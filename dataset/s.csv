Is masago a caviar?,"'Masago and caviar are both fish roe (fish eggs) from different species of fish. Only the roe from sturgeon fish is called “true caviar.” So, technically, masago is not caviar. Both masago and caviar are used as a garnish and not as the main ingredient. However, there are differences between these two types of fish eggs.''Table 1.

What is masago?,"'Masago is a type of fish roe or fish eggs used mainly in sushi preparation. It is often prepared from the roe of the capelin fish found primarily in the Arctic, Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Capelin belongs to the family of small fish that are a meal for larger fish, thus making it a significant part of the food chain. Masago is highly nutritious and makes a great accompaniment with rice. Masago is commonly used in Japanese dishes and sushi rolls. Overfishing of these fish has been banned because it may cause disturbances in the food chain or ecological system.' "
What is caviar?,"'Similar to masago, caviar is also fish roe prepared from the roe of the wild sturgeon fish. It is one of the most luxurious foods that originated from Russia and the Persian empire. There are different types of sturgeon caviar, which include''The ''omega-3 fatty acids'' in caviar are anti-inflammatory and they are also beneficial for the function of the brain, ''heart'' and eyes.'

What are the sacroiliac (SI) joints?,"'The sacroiliac (SI) joints are formed by the connection of the ''sacrum'' and the right and left iliac bones. The sacrum is the triangular-shaped bone in the lower portion of the spine, centrally located below the lumbar spine. While most of the bones (vertebrae) of the spine are mobile, the sacrum is made up of five vertebrae that are fused together and do not move. The iliac bones are the two large bones that make up the pelvis. As a result, the SI joints connect the spine to the pelvis. The sacrum and the iliac bones (ileum) are held together by a collection of strong ligaments. There is relatively little motion at the SI joints. There are normally less than 4 degrees of rotation and 2 mm of translation at these joints. Most of the motion in the area of the pelvis occurs either at the hips or the lumbar spine. These joints do need to support the entire weight of the upper body when we are erect, which places a large amount of ''stress'' across them. This can lead to wearing of the cartilage of the SI joints and ''arthritis''.' "
What is sacroiliac joint dysfunction?,"'There are many different terms for sacroiliac joint problems, including SI joint dysfunction, sacroiliac joint disease, SI joint syndrome, SI joint strain, and SI ''joint inflammation''. Each of these terms refers to a condition that causes ''pain'' in the SI joints from a specific cause.'  "
What are the causes of sacroiliac joint dysfunction?,"'As with most other joints in the body, the SI joints have a cartilage layer covering the bone. The cartilage allows for some movement and acts as a ''shock'' absorber between the bones. When this cartilage is damaged or worn away, the bones begin to rub on each other, and ''degenerative arthritis'' (''osteoarthritis'') occurs. This is the most common cause of SI joint dysfunction. Degenerative arthritis occurs commonly in the SI joints, just like other weight-bearing joints of the body.''Another common cause of SI joint dysfunction is ''pregnancy'"". During pregnancy, hormones are released in the woman's body that allow ligaments to relax. This prepares the body for ""'childbirth''. Relaxation of the ligaments holding the SI joints together allows for increased motion in the joints and can lead to increased stresses and abnormal wear. The additional weight and ''walking'' pattern (altered gait) associated with pregnancy also places additional ''stress'' on the SI joints.''Any condition that alters the normal walking pattern places increased stress on the SI joints and is a risk factor for SI joint dysfunction. This could include a leg length discrepancy (one leg longer than the other), or ''pain'' in the hip, knee, ankle, or foot. Patients with severe pain in the lower extremity often develop problems with either the lower back (lumbar spine) or SI joints. Usually, if the underlying problem is treated, the associated lumbar spine or SI joint dysfunction will also improve.''There are many disorders that affect the joints of the body that can also cause inflammation in the SI joints. These include ''gout'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''reactive arthritis'', and ''ankylosing spondylitis''. These are all various forms of arthritis that can affect all joints. ''Ankylosing spondylitis'' is an inflammatory arthritis that always affects the SI joints. It can lead to ''stiffness'' and severe pain in the SI joints, due to inflammation in the sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis). As the disease process continues, the SI joints can fuse together and have no range of motion. Once this occurs, there is no further pain associated with the SI joints. Rarely, bacterial infection can involve the sacroiliac joints.' "
What are sacroiliac joint dysfunction symptoms?,"'The most common symptom of SI joint dysfunction is sacroiliac ''joint pain''. Patients often experience pain in the lower back or the back of the hips. Pain may also be present in the groin and thighs. In many cases, it can be difficult to determine the exact source of the pain. Your physician can perform specific tests to help isolate the source of the pain. The pain is typically worse with standing and walking and improved when lying down. Inflammation and arthritis in the SI joint can also cause stiffness and a burning sensation in the pelvis.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose sacroiliac joint dysfunction?,"""The first step in diagnosis is typically a thorough history and physical examination by a physician. The physician will ask questions to determine if there are any underlying disorders that could be causing the patient's pain. Certain signs can also help differentiate pain coming from the SI joints, lumbar spine, or hips. There are various tests a physician can perform during the physical examination that can help isolate the source of the pain. By placing the patient's hips and legs in certain positions and applying pressure, the SI joints can be moved or compressed to identify them as a source of pain. Other portions of the examination are to exclude certain possibilities that could mimic sacroiliac disease."" "
How do health care professionals diagnose sacroiliac joint dysfunction? (Part 2),"'The next step in diagnosis is often plain radiographs (''X-rays''). The patient may have X-rays of the pelvis, hips, or lumbar spine depending on what the physician finds on the history and physical examination. A computed tomography (CAT or CT) scan may also help in the diagnosis. A ''CT scan'' gives a more detailed look at the joint and bones. Both X-rays and ''CT scans'' can help identify sacroiliitis. This can appear as sclerosis in the joints. More severe wear in the joints can appear as erosion of the bone around the SI joints. These tests can also look for fusion of the SI joints. A ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') scan can also be helpful. This provides a better evaluation of the soft tissues, including muscles and ligaments. It can also identify subtle ''fractures'' that may not be visible on an X-ray. The MRI can identify inflammation in the SI joint by the presence of excessive fluid in the joint. A ''bone scan'' can be obtained to help isolate the source of the pain and can be used to identify bony abnormalities. The bone scan can identify areas of increased activity in the bone. This is a nonspecific test and can be positive in cases of arthritis, infection, ''fracture'', or tumors of bone.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose sacroiliac joint dysfunction? (Part 3),"'A helpful method of diagnosing SI joint dysfunction is by performing an injection that can numb the irritated area, thereby helping to pinpoint the pain source. An anesthetic material (for example, ''lidocaine'' [''Xylocaine'']) can be injected along with a steroid (cortisone) directly into the SI joint. This is usually performed with the aid of an X-ray machine to verify the injection is in the SI joint. The anesthetic and steroid can help relieve the pain from inflammation that is common with SI joint dysfunction. The duration of pain relief is variable, but this is very useful to determine that the SI joint is the source of the pain.' "
What is the treatment for sacroiliac joint dysfunction?,"'As stated above, injections into the SI joint can provide both diagnosis and treatment. The duration of pain relief from injection can last from one day to much more long term. The injections can be repeated each month up to three each year. Oral anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs'', ''ibuprofen'' [''Motrin''], ''naproxen'' [''Naprosyn'']) are often effective in pain relief as well. These can be taken long term if the patient does not have any other medical problems that prevent them from taking these medications. Oral steroids (''prednisone'') are used as well for short periods of time occasionally to treat the inflammation.''Physical therapy can be very helpful. Pain in the SI joint is often related to either too much motion or not enough motion in the joint. A physical therapist can teach various stretching or stabilizing exercises that can help reduce the pain. A sacroiliac belt is a device that wraps around the hips to help stabilize the SI joints, which can also help the SI joint pain. Other options to stabilize the SI joints include ''yoga'', manual therapy, and ''Pilates''.''If other treatments fail and pain continues to interfere with normal activities, surgery might be an option. Surgery for SI dysfunction typically involves a fusion of the SI joints. In this surgery, the cartilage covering the surfaces of the SI joints is removed and the bones are held together with plates and screws until they grow together (fuse). This eliminates all motion at the SI joints and typically relieves the pain. This should be considered only if other less invasive treatments have not been successful.'  "
Which specialties of doctors treat sacroiliac joint dysfunction?,"'Several different types of doctors may treat SI joint pain. ''Rheumatologists'' are experts in treating SI joint pain caused by inflammatory arthritis such as ankylosing spondylitis, ''psoriatic arthritis'', reactive arthritis, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and ''gout'', as well as SI joint pain from other causes. Obstetricians often treat sacroiliac joint pain caused by pregnancy. Internists, general practitioners, family medicine doctors, and pain-management specialists all can treat SI joint dysfunction.' "
What are home remedies for sacroiliac joint dysfunction?,"'Oral anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen [Motrin], naproxen sodium [''Aleve''], or ''acetaminophen'' [''Tylenol'']) are often effective for pain relief. If the cause of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is mechanical, such as from pregnancy or the ''aging'' process, then rest and ice may be helpful. On the other hand, if the cause is inflammatory, such as from ankylosing spondylitis or ''psoriatic arthritis'', then gentle ''exercise'' (walking) and heat may be helpful.' "
What is the prognosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction?,"'The prognosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction varies depending on the cause of the dysfunction. When the problem is caused by pregnancy, the prognosis is excellent, as the condition usually improves after pregnancy during the postpartum period. Conditions affecting the sacroiliac joints such as ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic, but excellent treatments are available. These treatments can minimize the SI joint pain and prevent destruction of the joints. Degenerative arthritis affecting the SI joint is also a chronic condition and cannot be reversed, but treatments are generally very effective in improving symptoms.' "
Is it possible to prevent sacroiliac joint dysfunction?,"'Unfortunately, SI joint dysfunction is not preventable in some people. For many, it is an unfortunate part of the normal ''aging'' process. However, the severity can be reduced through treatment with medication, injections, or physical therapy. Maintaining a healthy body weight and good conditioning can reduce the chances of developing SI joint dysfunction and other forms of arthritis. By reducing the loads on the joints, there is less chance for cartilage damage and subsequent arthritis.' "
What is a sacroiliac joint?,'A sacroiliac (SI) joint is a joint in the lower back that connects the bones of the spine and tailbone (''sacrum'') to the hip bones (iliac crests). The main function of the SI joint is to absorb ''shock'' between the upper body and pelvis and legs. Small movements at the joints help with shock absorption and forward/backward bending. The SI joint is fairly susceptible to ''lower back pain''.' 
What is a sacroiliac joint injection?,'A sacroiliac (SI) ''joint injection'' is the injection of local anesthetics or ''corticosteroids'' into the SI joint to treat ''pain''. The SI joint injection can be used as a treatment or as a diagnostic technique. ''SI joint pain'' can be caused due to the following conditions:' Rheumatoid arthritis Gout Psoriasis Fracture Cancer Congenital deformities (deformity present from birth) Infection Pregnancy: A hormone called relaxin released excessively during pregnancy causes excess motion at the SI joint. Previous spinal surgery Ankylosing spondylitis (inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine and large joints)
When should be a sacroiliac joint injection avoided?,'You should avoid a sacroiliac (SI) joint injection if you have the following conditions:' Bleeding disorder Infection at the planned site of injection Allergic to the contents of the injection Pregnancy Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Congestive heart failure Blood thinner use Cancerous tumors at the SI joint or the nearby areas Unable to remain still for the procedure
What to expect before the sacroiliac joint injection?,"'Some of the instructions that you need to follow before and on the day of injection are as follows:' You should inform your doctor if you are on blood thinners such as Coumadin (warfarin) or heparin or any prescription medicines. You should refrain from alcohol, cigarette smoking, or recreational drugs before the procedure. You should stop taking anti-diabetic medications prior to the procedure. You should not consume solid foods or fluids on the night prior to the procedure."
How is a sacroiliac joint injection given?,"'The physician first injects a contrast at the lower back area. This helps to outline the joint, which can be viewed under a fluoroscope. Once the physician identifies the sacroiliac (SI) joint, a syringe filled with steroid and a local anesthetic is injected into the joint space. The solution should enter the space with minimal resistance. The physician may reposition the needle in case of any resistance. The ultrasonographic technique can enhance the accuracy of the SI joint injection.' "
What can I expect after a sacroiliac joint injection?,'A sacroiliac (SI) joint injection improves ''pain'' immediately. You can expect pain and soreness at the injection site for a day or two after the surgery. The steroid medications may take two to three days to show its result. You may have temporary numbness or ''weakness'' in your legs caused by the anesthetic.' 
How long does it take for a sacroiliac joint injection to work?,"'A sacroiliac (SI) joint injection works almost immediately. There is an immediate improvement in pain. However, once the numbing effect of the anesthesia wears off, your pain might return.' "
What are the complications of a sacroiliac joint injection?,'The complications of a sacroiliac (SI) joint injection include the following:' Allergic reactions to the anesthetic agents  Infection at the site of injection Increased blood sugar level An increase in pain A sudden drop in blood pressure

What is seasonal affective disorder?,"'Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), formally referred to as recurrent ''depression'' with seasonal pattern, is a type of depression that tends to occur (and recur) as the days grow shorter in the fall and winter. It is believed that affected people react adversely to the decreasing amounts of sunlight and the colder temperatures as the fall and winter progress. It is important to note that although seasonal affective disorder usually presents in the fall and winter there are those who suffer from this condition during the summer instead of, or in addition to, during the fall or winter.''Seasonal affective disorder has not been long recognized as an official diagnosis. The term first appeared in print in 1985. Seasonal affective disorder is also sometimes colloquially called winter depression, winter blues, or the hibernation reaction.''The incidence of seasonal affective disorder increases in people who are living farther away from the equator. Statistics on seasonal affective disorder in the United States include that this disorder occurs in 1% to 10% of adults and is dependent on geographical location. Seasonal affective disorder is less common where there is snow on the ground. Seasonal affective disorder is about four times more common in women than men, and the average age of people when they first develop this illness is 23 years of age. People of all ages can develop seasonal affective disorder.' "
What are the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder?,"'Although there is no specific diagnostic test for the illness, it is understood that since it is a form of depression, the symptoms of the condition include ''tiredness'', ''fatigue'', sadness or a sense of general discontent, crying spells, irritability, apathy, trouble concentrating, body aches, loss of sex drive, poor ''sleep'', decreased activity level, and appetite changes, particularly overeating, especially of carbohydrates and ''weight gain''. When the condition occurs during the summer, the symptoms are more commonly ''insomnia'', poor appetite, and ''weight loss'', in addition to ''anxiety'', irritability, ''difficulty concentrating'', and crying spells. Social isolation, with the potential resulting loneliness, also occurs at times with summer seasonal affective disorder. If the condition is severe, it can be associated with thoughts of ''suicide''.''The symptoms of seasonal affective disorder typically tend to begin in the fall each year, lasting until spring. The symptoms are more intense during the darkest months. Therefore, the more common months for the condition to occur will vary depending on how far away from the equator one lives.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for seasonal affective disorder?,"'Seasonal affective disorder seems to develop from inadequate exposure to bright light during the winter months. Studies show that bright light changes the chemicals in the brain. Exactly how this occurs and the details of its effects are being studied. Factors like high levels of ''melatonin'' and low levels of serotonin in the brain, as well as low levels of ''vitamin D'' levels in the blood are found to be associated with a higher occurrence of seasonal affective disorder and some other depressive conditions.' "
"How do health-care professionals assess and diagnose seasonal affective disorder, and what types of specialists treat this condition?","'A number of different health professionals can be qualified to evaluate and treat seasonal affective disorder, including primary-care providers, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.' "
What is the treatment for seasonal affective disorder?,"'In addition to being key in the ''prevention'' of seasonal affective disorder, regular exposure to light that is bright, particularly fluorescent lights, significantly improves depression in people with this disorder when it presents during the fall and winter. The light treatment is used daily in the morning and evening for best results. Temporarily changing locations to a climate that is characterized by bright light (such as the Caribbean) can also be effective. Light treatment has also been called phototherapy. Individuals who suffer from seasonal affective disorder will also likely benefit from increased social support during vulnerable times of the year.''Phototherapy is available in the form of light boxes, used for approximately 30 minutes daily. The light required must be of sufficient brightness, approximately 25 times as bright as a normal living room light. The light does not need to be actual sunlight. It seems that it is quantity, not necessarily quality of light that matters in the phototherapy of seasonal affective disorder. The most common possible side effects associated with phototherapy include irritability, ''insomnia'', ''headaches'', and eyestrain.''Antidepressant'' medications, particularly those from the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) group of medications, have been found to be effective in treating seasonal affective disorder that occurs during summer as well as that which tends to occur during the fall or winter. Examples of SSRIs include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), and ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix). Common side effects for this class of medications include ''insomnia'', ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', and many can cause ''decreased sex drive'' or performance. As with any other mood disorder, psychotherapy tends to accentuate the effectiveness of medical treatment and therefore should be included in the approach to addressing this disorder. In individuals who are perhaps vulnerable to the development of ''bipolar disorder'', either light therapy or ''antidepressants'' can cause a ''manic'' episode as a side effect.''Since stimulant medications like ''modafinil'' (''Provigil'') may be a helpful addition to other treatments for seasonal affective disorder, other ''stimulants'' like ''methylphenidate'' (''Ritalin'') may play a future role in addressing this disorder. ''Acupuncture'' may be a viable alternative intervention to antidepressant medications, particularly in ''pregnant'' women, for whom medications should be used with particular caution.''Determined to be equally effective as phototherapy or antidepressant medication in addressing seasonal affective disorder, ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT'') is another viable option for treating this illness. This form of psychotherapy involves the therapist working with the client to help the depression sufferer identify and understand ways of thinking that may be obstacles to improving their mood, thereby increasing the ability of the person with seasonal affective disorder to alleviate symptoms.''Chronotherapy, which uses environmental input to affect biorhythms, is thought to be a helpful aspect of treatment for seasonal affective disorders, as well as for other kinds of depression. This treatment uses methods like controlled ''sleep'"" deprivation to affect the seasonal affective disorder sufferer's brain chemicals in a positive way.""'Lifestyle changes that can help decrease the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder include increasing time spent outdoors, more physical ''exercise'', and maintaining eating habits that are high in lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates while decreasing the intake of refined sugars and other carbohydrates. Remedies that do not necessarily require the involvement of a health-care professionals, or so-called home remedies, include ''vitamin D'' supplementation and taking melatonin in the evenings.' "
What is the prognosis and potential complications of seasonal affective disorder?,"'People who receive treatment for seasonal affective disorder in a timely way tend to recover well. However, as with other forms of ''major depression'"", seasonal affective disorder is a risk factor for developing a number of other mental-health symptoms and disorders, engaging in self-mutilating behaviors or taking one's own life. People who suffer from this illness are also more vulnerable to having troubled relationships, low performance at school or work, and for developing some medical and substance use disorders."" "
Is it possible to prevent seasonal affective disorder?,"'Attempts to prevent future episodes of seasonal affective disorder using psychotherapy or light therapy have inconsistent results, but preventive medication treatment is thought to have promise. Therefore, health-care professionals tend to focus on lifestyle changes that can be helpful, as well as recommending preventive treatments based on what was most helpful for the individual sufferer in the past.'

What should I know about safe drugs to take for a cold or flu (influenza) if you have diabetes?,"  People with type 1 or 2 diabetes who don't comply with their doctor's medications may have a difficult time fighting off colds and flu viruses when their immune system is weakened. Getting the yearly seasonal flu vaccine is the best way for people with diabetes to prevent from getting infections, for example, colds or the flu, and their complications. Natural and home remedies help prevent infections like the common cold or flu. Avoid contact with people who are ill and are coughing, sneezing, or has post-nasal drip. Take diabetes medications as your doctor has prescribed when sick with the common cold or flu. Often, people type 1 diabetes may require more treatment with insulin when sick. People with diabetes need to test their blood sugar levels more often when they are sick with an infection, for example, the common cold or flu. Follow a type 1 or type 2 diabetes diet plan; which should include low-glycemic foods and drinks that are rich in antioxidants. Drink sports drinks, for example, Gatorade or Pedialyte to replace electrolytes like potassium and calcium."
Which drugs and medications are safe to take if you have diabetes?,"'Generally, medications to treat the signs and symptoms of the flu or ''common cold'' are safe to take if you have ''diabetes'', for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'') or ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others) can control ''pain'' and ''fever''. Usually, ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) ''cold'' and ''cough'' medications are acceptable for people with ''diabetes''. While ''sugar''-free medications are always preferred, the amount of sugar consumed in a single dose of medication (in syrup form) is minimal and unlikely to cause harm.''People with ''diabetes'' may misunderstand that they should reduce their medication dosages if an infection (like a cold or flu) has decreased their appetite and they are eating less. However, being sick usually makes someone resistant to ''insulin'' and raises glucose levels - even if you are eating less. So, it is important to continue taking your diabetes medication when you are sick and to monitor for urinary or blood ketones.''Lack of physical activity associated with the illness can raise blood sugar levels.''If you are diagnosed with the flu, your doctor or other healthcare professional can prescribe antiviral medications that can help reduce the duration and severity of your illness.' "
Why do diabetics have a more difficult time recovering from common colds (upper respiratory tract infections) and the flu?,"'People with ''diabetes mellitus'' (type 1 or type 2) are at risk of complications from other illness. They may be more susceptible of developing common infections like a ''cold'' or the flu because diabetes can weaken a person’s immune system. Complications from the flu include secondary ''bacterial infections'', for example, ''pneumonia'', ''ear infections'', ''sinus infections'' (''sinusitis''), and ''bronchitis''.' "
How often should I check my blood sugar levels if I have diabetes and a cold or the flu?,"'The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) provides ""Sick Day Guidelines"" for people with diabetes. These guidelines recommend testing your blood sugar every 2 to 4 hours while you are sick with a cold or flu and tracking the results. You also should monitor and track urinary ketone levels each time you void (pee). Follow your doctor\'s guidance for additional insulin so long as ketones are detected. If you vomit, then promptly seek medical care at your nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department.' "
What can I drink or eat to control my blood sugar levels when I am sick?,"'If possible, you should continue to follow your meal plan while you are sick. You may have trouble keeping food down or eating enough food. If you are not able to follow your normal eating plan (that includes a type 1 or 2 dabetes ''diet'' plan), be sure to drink plenty of fluids. High blood sugars, ''fever'', or poor appetite can cause ''dehydration'', yet the body needs adequate fluid to eliminate excess glucose. If you are not eating, you can drink water or other fluids free of sugar or ''caffeine'' whenever your blood sugar is over 150 mg/dL. Consuming 1 ounce per year of age per hour, up to a maximum of 8 ounces of fluid per hour is a good target.''Eating 45-50 grams of carbohydrate every few hours can help maintain stable blood sugar levels while you are sick. It may be easier to tolerate meals such as soup, crackers, gelatin, or other soft foods.''People with diabetes who are sick and display ketones should contact their doctor and consider taking additional fast-acting insulin as 10% of their total daily insulin dose given every 2 hours so long as moderate to large ketones persist in the urine or blood. ''If moderate to large ketones persist for more than 4 to 6 hours (or do not improve) despite taking extra insulin every two hours, call 911 or go to your nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department.' "
When should I see a doctor if I have diabetes and get a cold or the flu?,"'According to the ""Sick Day Guidelines for People with Diabetes"" issued by the CDC, you call your doctor or go the nearest Emergency Room or local Urgent Care Centers if you experience signs and symptoms, for example, you are unable to eat food for more than 6 hours, ''vomiting'', severe ''diarrhea'', loose more than 5 pounds (2.6 kg.), ''Fever'' greater than 101 F (37.7 C), blood glucose level over 250 mg/dL on two separate checks, and blood glucose level lower than 70 mg/dL..''Moderate to large amounts of ketones in the urine or blood, difficulty ''breathing'', and feeling confused or unable to think clearly, or feeling sleepy.' "
How can I help prevent infections?,"'Getting the yearly seasonal flu ''vaccine'' is the best way for people with diabetes to prevent the flu and its complications. Other practices to help prevent colds or the flu include avoiding contact with those who are ill and washing the hands frequently, especially before meals or touching your face.' "
Which rheumatoid arthritis drugs are safe during pregnancy?,"'None of the ''drugs'' used in the treatment of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') is completely safe during ''pregnancy''. You must discuss with your physician regarding the decision to use, modify, or stop any medications.''Pain'' control during pregnancy may be done through nonpharmacologic management such as paraffin baths, decreased physical activity, splinting, and ''cold'' packs as adjunctive care.''Corticosteroids'':'' They are considered relatively safe in pregnancy when used in low doses and are designated as category B medications. Category B drugs are those which have found to be safe in ''pregnant'' animals although they lack adequate studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids have potent anti-inflammatory action. They may, however, increase the maternal risk of ''high blood pressure'', swelling, increased sugars during pregnancy, poor bone health in pregnancy, premature delivery, low birth weight ''babies'', and ''birth defects'' such as ''cleft palate'' in the ''newborn''. Certain corticosteroids such as ''prednisone'' and hydrocortisone are safer for use without adverse events in the fetus.''Sulfasalazine'':'' It is another important medication for ''RA''. It is also a category B medication. Sulfasalazine does not put the developing baby at risk and is considered safe in pregnancy.''Hydroxychloroquine'' or HCQ'': HCQ is considered safe during pregnancy. It is a category C medication, which means that animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may permit the use of the drug in pregnant women.''Tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists'': These are commonly used in ''RA'' management. They belong to category B and are considered safe during pregnancy.''Certain other drugs such as ''azathioprine'' and ''abatacept'' are used in the treatment of ''RA'' in pregnant women only if the risks of side effects are outweighed by the benefits of these drugs. These drugs have found to cause fetal defects in a few studies.''Hence, the ultimate decision to use a certain drug should be made only in consultation with the doctor.' "
Can rheumatoid arthritis cause miscarriage?,'Most studies on RA suggest that RA does not increase the overall risk for a ''miscarriage''. Some researchers suggest that both disease activity and certain RA medications may have a role in causing miscarriage in some women such as those with severe disease.' 
Does having rheumatoid arthritis increase the chances of cesarean delivery?,"'Generally, delivery by cesarean delivery does not appear to be performed more commonly in patients with ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA). Any pregnancy, with or without RA, may be associated with factors that demand the baby to be delivered by cesarean delivery. None of the studies done so far conclusively say that RA mandates or increases the chance of cesarean delivery. In some women with RA, who have severe disease, the need for cesarean delivery may be higher than other women.' "
What should a pregnant woman with rheumatoid arthritis eat?,"'Because ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA) affects the joints, it is important to eat right during pregnancy. There should not be excess ''weight gain'' in pregnancy. At the same time, the mother and baby’s nutritional needs should not be compromised. Pregnant women with RA are advised to have a low-fat, high-carbohydrate, and high-''fiber'' ''diet''. This includes a ''diet'' rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, mushrooms, and salmon. They should avoid fried and grilled foods, pastries, pasta, and other processed foods. They can have fish oils in moderate quantities during pregnancy only after consulting their doctor. Pregnant women with RA should avoid ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) herbal remedies and ''supplements''. They should take routine oral calcium and ''vitamin D'' ''supplements'' as advised by their doctor.' "
What is salivary gland cancer?,"'The salivary glands make saliva and release it into the mouth. Saliva has enzymes that help digest food and antibodies that help protect against infections of the mouth and throat. There are 3 pairs of major salivary glands:''There are also hundreds of small (minor) salivary glands lining parts of the mouth, nose, and larynx that can be seen only with a microscope. Most small salivary gland tumors begin in the palate (roof of the mouth).''More than half of all salivary gland tumors are benign (not cancerous) and do not spread to other tissues.''Salivary gland cancer is a type of head and ''neck cancer''.' Parotid glands: These are the largest salivary glands and are found in front of and just below each ear. Most major salivary gland tumors begin in this gland. Sublingual glands: These glands are found under the tongue in the floor of the mouth. Submandibular glands: These glands are found below the jawbone."
What increases the risk of salivary gland cancer?,"'Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Although the cause of most salivary gland ''cancers'' is not known, risk factors include the following:'   Older age. Treatment with radiation therapy to the head and neck. Being exposed to certain substances at work."
What are symptoms and signs of salivary gland cancer?,"'Salivary gland cancer may not cause any symptoms. It is sometimes found during a regular dental check-up or physical exam. Symptoms caused by salivary gland cancer also may be caused by other conditions. A doctor should be consulted if any of the following problems occur:'   A lump (usually painless) in the area of the ear, cheek, jaw, lip, or inside the mouth. Fluid draining from the ear. Trouble swallowing or opening the mouth widely. Numbness or weakness in the face. Pain in the face that does not go away."
What exams and tests are used to detect and diagnose salivary gland cancer?,"'The following procedures may be used:''Because salivary gland cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have the tissue samples checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing salivary gland cancer.'   Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health. The head, neck, mouth, and throat will be checked for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Endoscopy: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. For salivary gland cancer, an endoscope is inserted into the mouth to look at the mouth, throat, and larynx. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. An FNA is the most common type of biopsy used for salivary gland cancer.Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn’t look normal.Surgery: If cancer cannot be diagnosed from the sample of tissue removed during an FNA biopsy or an incisional biopsy, the mass may be removed and checked for signs of cancer. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. An FNA is the most common type of biopsy used for salivary gland cancer. Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn’t look normal. Surgery: If cancer cannot be diagnosed from the sample of tissue removed during an FNA biopsy or an incisional biopsy, the mass may be removed and checked for signs of cancer."
What is the prognosis for salivary gland cancer?,'The treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery) depend on the following:' The stage of the cancer (especially the size of the tumor). The type of salivary gland the cancer is in. The type of cancer cells (how they look under a microscope). The patient's age and general health.
What tests are done to determine if salivary gland cancer has spread?,"'The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the salivary glands or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following procedures may be used in the staging process:' MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography."
How does salivary gland cancer spread in the body?,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:''When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if salivary gland cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually salivary gland cancer cells. The disease is metastatic salivary gland cancer, not ''lung cancer''.' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
What are the stages for salivary gland cancer?,"'The following stages are used for major salivary gland cancers:''In stage I, the tumor is in the salivary gland only and is 2 centimeters or smaller.''In stage II, the tumor is in the salivary gland only and is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters.''In stage III, one of the following is true:''Stage IV is divided into stages IVA, IVB, and IVC as follows:''Salivary gland cancers are also grouped by grade. The grade of a tumor tells how fast the cancer cells are growing, based on how the cells look under a microscope. Low-grade cancers grow more slowly than high-grade cancers.''Minor salivary gland cancers are staged according to where they were first found in the body.''Recurrent salivary gland cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. Recurrent salivary gland cancer may come back in the salivary glands or in other parts of the body.' The tumor is not larger than 4 centimeters and has spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller. The tumor is larger than 4 centimeters and/or has spread to soft tissue around the affected gland. Cancer may have spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller. Stage IVA:The tumor may be any size and may have spread to soft tissue around the affected gland. Cancer has spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the tumor and the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters, or has spread to more than one lymph node on either or both sides of the body and the lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters; orCancer has spread to the skin, jawbone, ear canal, and/or facial nerve, and may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on either or both sides of the body. The lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters. The tumor may be any size and may have spread to soft tissue around the affected gland.

Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body."
What is the treatment for salivary gland cancer?,"'There are different types of treatment for patients with salivary gland cancer.''Different types of treatment are available for patients with salivary gland cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Patients with salivary gland cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating head and neck cancer.''Your treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer. Because the salivary glands help in eating and digesting food, patients may need special help adjusting to the side effects of the cancer and its treatment. The medical oncologist may refer you to other doctors who have experience and expertise in treating patients with head and neck cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These include the following:''Three types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment for salivary gland cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around the cancer. In some cases, a lymphadenectomy (surgery in which lymph nodes are removed) will also be done.''Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Special types of radiation may be used to treat some salivary gland tumors. These include:''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.''Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.''For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.''Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.'""Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.""'Follow-up tests may be needed.''Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.'   Head and neck surgeon. Radiation oncologist. Dentist. Speech therapist. Dietitian. Psychologist. Rehabilitation specialist. Plastic surgeon. Fast neutron radiation therapy: Fast neutron radiation therapy is a type of high-energy external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims tiny, invisible particles, called neutrons, at the cancer cells to kill them. Fast neutron radiation therapy uses a higher-energy radiation than the x-ray type of radiation therapy. This allows the radiation therapy to be given in fewer treatments. Photon-beam radiation therapy: A type of radiation therapy that reaches deep tumors with high-energy x-rays made by a machine called a linear accelerator. This can be delivered as hyperfractionated radiation therapy, in which the total dose of radiation is divided into small doses and the treatments are given more than once a day."

What is Salmonella?,"'Salmonella'' is a genus name that represents gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria that cause disease in humans and other warm-blooded animals. ''Salmonella'' can cause various diseases, such as ''food poisoning'', gastrointestinal inflammation, ''typhoid fever'', and ''sepsis''.\xa0The CDC estimates that every year in the United States about 1.2 million people are infected with ''Salmonella'', 23,000 need hospital care, and 450 deaths occur.'  "
Is Salmonella contagious?,"'Many of the members of the bacterial genus ''Salmonella'' are ''contagious''. The organisms can be transferred from person to person by both direct (via saliva, fecal/oral spread, kissing) and indirect contact (for example, using contaminated eating utensils). In addition, a number of ''Salmonella'' species can be transmitted from animals (snakes, turtles, chickens, hamsters, cats, and ''dogs'') to humans, usually by direct contact. Undercooked meats and especially eggs are common sources of ''Salmonella'' bacteria.' "
What is the contagious period for Salmonella?,"'Some individuals may shed ''Salmonella'' for days to weeks after symptoms have resolved and remain ''contagious'' during this time. A few individuals may become carriers and be contagious for years (for example, Typhoid Mary, a food handler responsible for several typhoid outbreaks).' "
How will I know if someone has a Salmonella infection? What is the incubation period for salmonellosis?,"'Most symptoms of salmonellosis begin within 12-24 hours after exposure to the bacteria. It is not unusual to have a group of individuals come down with the same symptoms if ''Salmonella'' infection comes from contaminated foods. Health care professionals often recognize outbreaks when people who eat or drink from a contaminated source begin to seek medical care (for example, a large family reunion with many people eat contaminated potato salad). The symptoms and signs usually include ''stomach cramps'', ''diarrhea'', ''fever'', and occasionally ''vomiting''. Usually, a physician makes the diagnosis after laboratory examination of the ''stool'' sample, because the bacteria can be easily cultivated and identified. However, if the symptoms are relatively mild (for example, no ''dehydration''), by the time the organism is identified, most people will be spontaneously cured of the disease.' "
How is Salmonella transmitted?,"'Salmonella'' spread usually through the fecal-oral route (contamination of hands or objects with bacteria shed in the ''stool''); ''Salmonella'' can be excreted into the environment and easily contaminate food and water sources. When animals or humans touch or consume food or drink contaminated with ''Salmonella'', they are likely to get salmonellosis. The contaminated animal or human then can easily spread the bacteria to other animals and/or humans by direct and indirect contact.' "
How will I know if I am cured of Salmonella?,"'Salmonellosis for most people is an uncomfortable disease that lasts about three to five days and often requires only good oral fluid intake for recovery. The symptoms gradually wane, and most people spontaneously clear the infection in this time period. However, for other individuals, ''symptoms of dehydration'', ''nausea'', and ''vomiting'' may be more severe. Most infected patients do not require antibiotic treatment, although some individuals will require antibiotics to help cure the infection. A few individuals may have very severe symptoms that require the patient to be hospitalized.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about Salmonella?,"'If any individual shows signs of ''dehydration'' (for example, reduced or absent urination, dry ''mucus'' membranes), have immunodeficiency problems, or has ''sickle cell anemia'', he or she should contact a physician urgently or go to an emergency department to avoid complications of severe ''dehydration'' and/or ''sepsis'' (spread of infection to the bloodstream). People at higher risk for ''Salmonella'' infections are infants, young children, and anyone with suppressed immune system function.'  "
What is Salmonella food poisoning?,"'Salmonella'' infection, or salmonellosis, is another name for ''Salmonella'' ''food poisoning''. ''Salmonella'' are a type of bacteria known to cause food-borne illness for over 125 years. The organism is named for a scientist named Daniel Elmer Salmon, who discovered the bacteria. Salmonellosis is a food-borne infection typically caused by consumption of contaminated foods. ''Salmonella'' causes an estimated 1 million food-borne illnesses every year in the U.S. and about 19,000 hospitalizations.''Different types (called serotypes or serovars) of the ''Salmonella'' bacteria can cause the illness. The two most common serotypes in the U.S. are ''S. typhimurium'' and ''S. enteritidis''. Specific ''strains'' of the bacteria can be responsible for outbreaks of the disease. For example, an outbreak in 2013-2014 was linked to multidrug-resistant serotype ''Salmonella ''Heidelberg. This strain and some other strains have become resistant to many ''drugs'' traditionally used to treat the infection, posing a risk to public health.''Some types of ''Salmonella'' bacteria (''S. typhi'') cause ''typhoid fever'', a serious illness that occurs most often in nonindustrialized areas of the world.' "
What are symptoms and signs of Salmonella poisoning?,"'Salmonella'' illness causes an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract; this is known as ''gastroenteritis''.''The symptoms usually go away on their own after four to seven days.'   Symptoms of Salmonella poisoning usually begin 12-72 hours after infection. Diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and fever are common symptoms. The diarrhea is typically loose and not bloody. Nausea Vomiting Headache Muscle aches"
"What causes (eggs, chicken) Salmonella outbreaks? How does Salmonella spread?","'Poultry, beef, milk, and eggs may contain ''Salmonella'' bacteria, since the bacteria live in the ''intestines'' of humans and animals. Thorough cooking of these foods destroys the bacteria.''Foods, including vegetables and fruits, may also be contaminated during handling or processing of the food, and this is another common source of outbreaks. For example, food may be contaminated by the feces of infected people or animals or from the unwashed hands of a person handling or preparing the food.''Small rodents such as hamsters, as well as baby chicks and ducklings, may also carry the bacteria, and contamination of food after handling these animals may also result in salmonellosis. Reptiles may also harbor ''Salmonella'' bacteria. In the 1970s, outbreaks were associated with baby turtles kept as pets. Further, the infection may be spread by contaminated surfaces (such as cutting boards) that have had contact with contaminated foods.''Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal. Over the past years, outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with a number of different foods, including chicken, cucumbers, alfalfa sprouts, bean sprouts, ground beef, mangoes, peanut butter, and cantaloupe. These are just a few examples. An outbreak in February 2016 caused by the strain ''Salmonella muenchen'' was linked to contaminated alfalfa sprouts. In 2017, an outbreak was linked to papayas from Mexico. A breakfast cereal known as Honey Smacks caused an outbreak in 2018.'  "
What are risk factors for Salmonella food poisoning?,"'Since foods contaminated with ''Salmonella'' are not obvious, anyone may consume contaminated foods. Owning pets such as small rodents, chicks, ducklings, small turtles and some other reptiles, and some birds may increase the risk of coming in contact with ''Salmonella'' bacteria. People who are exposed to many people, such as those living in group housing, may have an increased risk. Young children (under 5 years of age) have the highest reported incidence of infection.''People with medical conditions that lead to immune suppression are at risk for a more severe illness when they do become infected.' "
Is Salmonella contagious?," Many of the members of the bacterial genus Salmonella are contagious. Salmonella food poisoning is usually acquired from eating contaminated foods. It is possible to spread the infection 
	from person to person through fecal-oral cross-contamination, meaning that fecal material contaminates the hands of an infected person who then contaminates foods that are consumed by others."
What is the incubation period for a Salmonella infection?,'Symptoms usually begin 12-72 hours after infection with salmonella.' 
What is the contagious period for salmonellosis?,"'Those with ''Salmonella'' infection can be contagious for days to weeks, even after symptoms have disappeared.' "
Which types of doctors treat Salmonella food poisoning?,"'Salmonellosis may be treated by''In severe or complicated cases, other doctors may be consulted, including gastroenterologists or critical care specialists.' primary care doctors, pediatricians, emergency medicine doctors, or internal medicine doctors."
What tests diagnose Salmonella food poisoning?,"'Many infections can cause similar symptoms, so diagnosis of ''Salmonella'' infection requires identification of the organism in a ''stool'' sample from the affected person. Specific tests can be done to identify the exact type of ''Salmonella'' responsible for an infection.' "
What is the treatment for Salmonella food poisoning?,"'In most cases, the symptoms resolve on their own without treatment within four to seven days. Taking plenty of fluids is essential to replace fluid lost by diarrhea to prevent ''dehydration''. People with severe illness or who are unable to take oral liquids may need intravenous fluids. Antibiotics have been shown to prolong the time period in which the bacteria are present in the ''stool'' and are therefore not recommended for most cases. People with severe illness, those with risk factors for complications (such as the elderly or infants), or those with a weakened immune function may require treatment with antibiotics.'  "
What is the prognosis of Salmonella food poisoning?,"'Most cases of salmonellosis resolve completely without long-term complications, but bowel habits may be abnormal for months. About 380 people die from salmonellosis each year in the U.S.' "
What are the complications of Salmonella food poisoning?,"'Complications of ''Salmonella'' food poisoning can include ''dehydration'' from vomiting and diarrhea. Spread of the infection to the bloodstream is a further possible complication. This is most likely to occur in people with suppressed immune function. The elderly and very young are also at increased risk for complications.''An uncommon complication called ''reactive arthritis'' involves the development of ''joint pains'', irritation of the eyes, and ''pain'' on urination. ''Reactive arthritis'' may persist for months to years and can lead to chronic ''arthritis''.' "
Tips to prevent Salmonella food poisoning,"'There is no vaccine available to prevent ''Salmonella'' infection. However, one can take the following steps to help ensure good hygiene and food safety, reducing the likelihood of getting the infection:' Wash hands thoroughly after using the bathroom. Cook meats and eggs thoroughly. Do not consume raw eggs or unpasteurized milk. Wash hands and kitchen surfaces with soap and water after contact with raw meat or eggs. Do not allow uncooked meats to come in contact with other foods in the kitchen, including utensils and work surfaces that will be used to prepare other foods. Wash hands thoroughly after contact with animal feces and after all contact with reptiles, birds, and small rodents. Chill foods after serving and when transporting from place to place."
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "

Generally, treatment involves medications that reduce inflammation in the particular tissues affected. Examples of medications that are used for inflammation include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'', such as ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil'', ''Motrin''], and ''naproxen'' [''Aleve'']) and cortisone medications (either in the form of topical creams, tablets, or by injection into the involved area).''Topical ''cold'' applications can also help reduce inflammation in some tissues.

What is sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis is a disease that results from a specific type of inflammation of tissues of the body. It can appear in almost any body organ, but it starts most often in the lungs or ''lymph nodes''.''The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. The disease can appear suddenly and disappear. Or it can develop gradually and go on to produce symptoms that come and go, sometimes for a lifetime.''As sarcoidosis progresses, microscopic lumps of a specific form of inflammation, called granulomas, appear in the affected tissues. In the majority of cases, these granulomas clear up, either with or without treatment. In the few cases where the granulomas do not heal and disappear, the tissues tend to remain inflamed and become scarred (fibrotic).''Sarcoidosis was first identified over 100 years ago by two dermatologists working independently, Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson in England and Dr. Caesar Boeck in Norway. Sarcoidosis was originally called Hutchinson\'s disease or Boeck\'s disease. Dr. Boeck went on to fashion today\'s name for the disease from the Greek words ""sark"" and ""oid,"" meaning flesh-like. The term describes the skin eruptions that are frequently caused by the illness.'  "
What are causes and risk factors of sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis is a spontaneous disease of unknown cause. There are no known predisposing risk factors for developing sarcoidosis.''The immunse system is complex. Basically, B lymphocytes make antibodies to fight against infections, while T-lymphocytes patrol the tissues to fight off invaders in other ways.''The heightened cellular immune response in the diseased tissue is characterized by significant increases in activated T-lymphocytes with certain characteristic cell-surface antigens, as well as in activated alveolar macrophages. This pronounced, localized cellular response is also accompanied by the appearance in the lung of an array of lymphocyte produced mediators generally called cytokines that are thought to contribute to the disease process. These include interleukin-1, interleukin-2, B-cell growth factor, B-cell differentiation factor, fibroblast growth factor, and fibronectin. Because a number of lung diseases follow respiratory tract infections, ascertaining whether a virus can be implicated in the events leading to sarcoidosis remains an important area of research.''Some recent observations seem to provide suggestive leads on this question. In these studies, the genes of ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV''), a common disease-causing virus, were introduced into lymphocytes, and the expression of the viral genes was studied. It was found that the viral genes were expressed both during acute infection of the cells and when the virus was not replicating in the cells. However, this expression seemed to take place only when the T-cells were activated by some injurious event. In addition, the product of a ''CMV'' gene was found capable of activating the gene in alveolar macrophages responsible for the production of interleukin-1. Since interleukin-1 levels are found to increase in alveolar macrophages from patients with sarcoidosis, this suggests that certain viral genes can enhance the production of inflammatory components associated with sarcoidosis. Whether these findings implicate viral infections in the disease process in sarcoidosis is unclear.' "
What are signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis?,"'Shortness of breath'' (dyspnea) and a ''cough'"" that won't go away can be among the first symptoms of sarcoidosis. But sarcoidosis can also show up suddenly with the appearance of skin ""'rashes''. Red ''bumps'' (''erythema nodosum'') on the face, arms, or shins and inflammation of the eyes are also common symptoms and signs.''It is not unusual, however, for sarcoidosis symptoms to be more general. ''Weight loss'', ''fatigue'', ''night sweats'', ''fever'', or just an overall feeling of ill health can also be clues to the disease.''In addition to the lungs and lymph nodes, the body organs more likely than others to be affected by sarcoidosis are the ''liver'', skin, ''heart'', nervous system, and kidneys, in that order of frequency. Patients can have symptoms related to the specific organ affected, they can have only general symptoms, or they can be without any symptoms whatsoever. Symptoms also can vary according to how long the illness has been under way, where the granulomas are forming, how much tissue has become affected, and whether the granulomatous process is still active.'""Even when there are no symptoms, a doctor can sometimes detect signs of sarcoidosis during a routine examination, usually a chest X-ray, or when checking out another complaint. The patient's age and race or ethnic group can raise an additional red flag that a sign or symptom of illness could be related to sarcoidosis. Enlargement of the salivary or tear-producing glands and ""'cysts'' in bone tissue are also among sarcoidosis signals.''The lungs are usually the first site involved in sarcoidosis. Indeed, about nine out of 10 sarcoidosis patients have some type of lung problem, with nearly one-third of these patients showing some respiratory symptoms -- usually ''coughing'', either dry or with ''phlegm'', and dyspnea. Occasionally, patients have ''chest pain'' and a feeling of ''tightness in the chest''.''It is thought that sarcoidosis of the lungs begins with inflammation of the alveoli (alveolitis), the tiny sac-like air spaces in the lungs where carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged. Alveolitis either clears up spontaneously or leads to granuloma formation. Eventually, fibrosis can form, causing the usually flexible and clompliant lung to stiffen and making ''breathing'' even more difficult.''Eye disease occurs in about 20%-30% of patients with sarcoidosis, particularly in children who get the disease. Almost any part of the eye can be affected -- the membranes of the eyelids, ''cornea'', outer coat of the eyeball (sclera), retina, and ''lens''. The eye involvement can start with no symptoms at all or with reddening or ''watery eyes''. In a few cases, ''cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', and ''blindness'' can result.''The skin is affected in 20% to 35% of sarcoidosis patients. Skin sarcoidosis is usually marked by small, raised patches on the face. Occasionally, the patches are purplish in color and larger. Patches can also appear on limbs, face, and buttocks.''Other symptoms include the red bumps of\xa0''erythema nodosum'', mostly on the legs and often accompanied by ''arthritis'' in the ankles, elbows, wrists, and hands. Erythema nodosum usually goes away, but other skin problems can persist. Virtually any organ or organ system can be involved in sarcoidosis.''Occasionally, sarcoidosis can lead to nervous system problems. For example, sarcoid granulomas can appear in the brain, spinal cord, and facial and optic nerves. Facial ''paralysis'' and other symptoms of nerve damage call for prompt treatment with medications such as high doses of cortisone (see below). Rarely, the heart may be involved in sarcoidosis, which can be a serious problem. People with sarcoidosis can have ''depression'' that is unrelated to the activity of the disease and is felt to be, in part, because of a misdirected immune system.''Symptoms can appear suddenly and then disappear. Sometimes, however, they can continue over a lifetime.'  "
Who gets sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis was once considered a rare disease. We now know that it is a common chronic illness that appears all over the world. Indeed, it is the most common of the scarring lung disorders and occurs often enough in the United States for Congress to have declared a national Sarcoidosis Awareness Day in 1990.''Anyone can get sarcoidosis. It occurs in all races and in both sexes. Nevertheless, the risk is greater if you are a young black adult, especially a black woman, or of Scandinavian, German, Irish, or Puerto Rican origin. No one knows why.''Because sarcoidosis can escape diagnosis or be mistaken for several other diseases, we can only guess at how many people are affected. The best estimate today is that about 10 in 100,000 white people in the United States have sarcoidosis. Among black people, it occurs more frequently, in probably 35 out of 100,000 people. Some scientists, however, believe that these figures greatly underestimate the percentage of the U.S. population with sarcoidosis.''Sarcoidosis mainly affects people between 20-40 years of age. White women are just as likely as white men to get sarcoidosis, but the black female gets sarcoidosis two times as often as the black male. No one knows what causes sarcoidosis.'""Sarcoidosis also appears to be more common and more severe in certain geographic areas. It has long been recognized as a common disease in Scandinavian countries. But it was not until the mid '40s, when a large number of cases were identified during mass chest X-ray screening for the Armed Forces, that its high prevalence was recognized in North America."" "
What are some things we don't know about sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis is currently thought to be associated with an abnormal immune response. It is not known whether the trigger that initiates the immune disturbance is a foreign substance, chemical, drug, virus, or some other substance.''In general, more than half of the time, sarcoidosis appears briefly and heals naturally, often without the patient knowing or doing anything about it. Some sarcoidosis patients are left with permanent lung damage. In 10%-15% of the patients, sarcoidosis can become chronic.''When either the granulomas or fibrosis seriously affect the function of a vital organ -- the lungs, heart, nervous system, liver, or kidneys, for example -- sarcoidosis can be fatal. This occurs 1% to 5% of the time. Some people are more at risk than others. No one knows why.'""No one can predict how sarcoidosis will progress in an individual patient. The patient's symptoms, race, and the doctor's findings can give some clues. For example, a sudden onset of general symptoms, such as ""'weight loss'' or feeling generally ill, are usually taken to mean that the course of sarcoidosis will be relatively short and mild. Dyspnea and possibly skin sarcoidosis often indicate that the sarcoidosis will be more chronic and severe.''White patients are more likely to develop the milder form of the disease. Black people tend to develop the more chronic and severe form.''Sarcoidosis rarely develops before the age of 10 or after the age of 60. However, the illness -- with or without symptoms -- has been reported in younger as well as in older people. When symptoms do appear in these age groups, the symptoms are those that are more general in nature, for example, ''tiredness'', sluggishness, coughing, and a general feeling of ill health.' "
What do we know about sarcoidosis? Is sarcoidosis contagious or hereditary?,"'Much about sarcoidosis remains unknown. Nevertheless, if you have the disease, you can be reassured about several things. Sarcoidosis is usually not crippling. It often goes away by itself, with most cases healing in 24-36 months. Even when sarcoidosis lasts longer, most patients can go about their lives as usual. Sarcoidosis is not a ''cancer''. It is not ''contagious'', and your friends and family will not catch it from you. Although it can occur in families, there is no evidence that sarcoidosis is passed from parents to children.' "
What types of doctors treat sarcoidosis?,"'Because sarcoidosis can involve inflammation in a variety of organs of the body, many types of doctors can be involved in the treatment of patients with sarcoidosis. Patients with sarcoidosis are best treated by a lung specialist or a doctor who has a special interest in sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis specialists are usually located at major research centers.''Doctors who treat sarcoidosis include primary-care providers as well as internists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, ''rheumatologists'', dermatologists, and neurologists.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose sarcoidosis?,"""Preliminary diagnosis of sarcoidosis is based on the patient's medical history, routine tests, a physical examination, and a chest X-ray.""'The doctor confirms the diagnosis of sarcoidosis by eliminating other diseases with similar features. These include such granulomatous diseases as berylliosis (a disease resulting from exposure to beryllium metal), ''tuberculosis'"", farmer's lung disease (""'hypersensitivity pneumonitis''), ''fungal infections'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''rheumatic fever'', and ''cancer'' of the lymph nodes (''lymphoma'').' "
What do laboratory tests for sarcoidosis show?,"'While no single test can be relied on for a correct diagnosis of sarcoidosis, many types of tests are useful. ''X-rays'' and blood tests are usually the first procedures the doctor will order. Pulmonary function tests often provide clues to diagnosis. Other tests may also be used, some more often than others.''Many of the tests that the doctor calls on to help diagnose sarcoidosis can also help the doctor follow the progress of the disease and determine whether the sarcoidosis is getting better or worse.''The chest X-ray is often helpful to give the doctor a picture of the lungs, heart, as well as the surrounding tissues containing lymph nodes (where infection-fighting white blood cells form) and give the first indication of sarcoidosis. For example, a swelling of the lymph glands between the two lungs can show up on an X-ray. When sarcoidosis becomes more advanced, an X-ray can also show scarring in affected areas of the lungs.''By performing a variety of tests called pulmonary function tests (PFT), the doctor can find out how well the lungs are doing their job of expanding and exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood. The lungs of sarcoidosis patients cannot handle these tasks as well as they should; this is because granulomas and fibrosis of lung tissue decrease lung capacity and disturb the normal flow of gases between the lungs and the blood. One PFT procedure calls for the patient to breathe into a machine, called a spirometer. It is a mechanical device that records changes in the lung size as air is inhaled and exhaled, as well as the time it takes the patient to do this.''Blood analyses can evaluate the number and types of blood cells in the body and how well the cells are functioning. They can also measure the levels of various blood proteins known to be involved in immunological activities, and they can show increases in serum calcium levels and abnormal ''liver function'' that often accompany sarcoidosis.''Blood tests can measure a blood substance called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Because the cells that make up granulomas secrete large amounts of ACE, the enzyme levels are often high in patients with sarcoidosis. ACE levels, however, are not always high in sarcoidosis patients, and increased ACE levels can also occur in other illnesses.''This uses an instrument called a bronchoscope -- a long, narrow tube with a light at the end -- to wash out, or lavage, cells and other materials from inside the lungs. This wash fluid is then examined for the amount of various cells and other substances that reflect inflammation and immune activity in the lungs. A high number of white blood cells in this fluid usually indicate an inflammation in the lungs.''Transbronchial biopsy allows microscopic examination of specimens of lung tissue obtained with a bronchoscope. A transbronchial biopsy demonstrating evidence of the type of granuloma found in sarcoidosis is considered the definitive test today.'""In this procedure, the doctor injects the radioactive chemical element gallium-67 into the patient's vein. The gallium collects at places in the body affected by sarcoidosis and other inflammatory conditions. Two days after the injection, the body is scanned for radioactivity. Increases in gallium uptake at any site in the body indicate that inflammatory activity has developed at the site and give an idea of which tissue, and how much tissue, has been affected. However, since any type of inflammation causes gallium uptake, a positive gallium scan does not necessarily mean that the patient has sarcoidosis. This test is rarely used today.""'The PET (positron emission tomography) scan injects a small amount of radioactive glucose and tracks where it accumulates. While granulomas do accumulate glucose preferentiall, so do other forms of inflammation and other conditions.''This test involves injecting a standardized preparation of sarcoid tissue material into the skin. On the one hand, a unique lump formed at the point of injection is considered positive for sarcoidosis. On the other hand, the test result is not always positive even if the patient has sarcoidosis.''The Kveim test is not used often in the United States because no test material has been approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, a few hospitals and clinics may have some standardized test preparation prepared privately for their own use.''An instrument called a slit lamp, which permits examination of the inside of the eye, can be used to detect silent damage from sarcoidosis.' "
What is the treatment for sarcoidosis?,"'Fortunately, many patients with sarcoidosis require no treatment. Symptoms, after all, are usually not disabling and do tend to disappear spontaneously.''When therapy is recommended, the main goal is to keep the lungs and other affected body organs working and to relieve symptoms. The disease is considered inactive once the symptoms fade. After many years of experience with treating the disease, ''corticosteroid'' ''drugs'' remain the primary treatment for inflammation and granuloma formation. ''Prednisone'' is probably the corticosteroid most often prescribed today.\xa0''Prednisone often improves the ''cough'' and pulmonary function tests in sarcoidosis. Unfortunately, if the lungs are severely affected by sarcoidosis, scarring develops in them. Prednisone will not clear the established scarring. In those unusual cases where sarcoidosis raises the calcium level in the blood, if lowering calcium and ''vitamin D'' intake is not sufficient to correct this, or the calcium elevation is symptomatic, then Prednisone can be rapidly effective at bringing the calcium level back to normal.'""Because sarcoidosis can disappear even without therapy, even doctors sometimes disagree on when to start the treatment, what dose to prescribe, and how long to continue the medicine. The doctor's decision depends on the organ system involved and how far the inflammation has progressed. If the disease appears to be severe, especially in the lungs, eyes, heart, nervous system, spleen, or kidneys, the doctor may prescribe corticosteroid.""'Corticosteroid treatment usually results in improvement. Symptoms often start up again, however, when it is stopped. Treatment, therefore, may be necessary for several years, sometimes for as long as the disease remains active or to prevent relapse.''Frequent checkups are important so that the doctor can monitor the illness and, if necessary, adjust the treatment.''Corticosteroids'', for example, can have side effects: ''mood swings'', swelling, and ''weight gain'' because the treatment tends to make the body hold on to water; ''high blood pressure''; ''high blood sugar''; and craving for food. Long-term use can affect the stomach, skin, and bones. This situation can bring on ''stomach pain'', an ulcer, or ''acne'' or cause the loss of calcium from bones. However, if the corticosteroid is taken in carefully prescribed low doses, the benefits from the treatment are usually far greater than the problems.''Besides corticosteroid, various other drugs have been tried, but their effectiveness has not been established in controlled studies. These drugs include ''hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil), ''chloroquine'' (''Aralen''), and D-''penicillamine''. Several drugs such as ''chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), and ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), which might suppress alveolitis by killing the cells that produce granulomas, have also been used. None have been evaluated in controlled ''clinical trials'', and the risk of using these drugs must be compared closely with the benefits in preventing organ damage by the disease. They are not to be used by ''pregnant'' women.''Cyclosporine'', a drug used widely in organ transplants to suppress immune reaction, has been evaluated in one controlled trial. It was found to be unsuccessful. More recently, ''thalidomide'' (''Thalomid'') has been used successfully in a limited number of patients and seemed to improve lung function and heal skin lesions. ''Infliximab'' (''Remicade'') has been reported recently as effective in treating patients with sarcoidosis.''There are many unanswered questions about sarcoidosis. Identifying the agent that causes the illness, along with the inflammatory mechanisms that set the stage for the alveolitis, granuloma formation, and fibrosis that characterized the disease is the major aim of researchers of sarcoidosis. Development of reliable methods of diagnosis, treatment, and eventually, the ''prevention'' of sarcoidosis is the ultimate goal.''Originally, scientists thought that sarcoidosis was caused by an acquired state of immunological inertness (anergy). This notion was revised when the technique of bronchoalveolar lavage provided access to a vast array of cells and cell-derived mediators operating in the lungs of sarcoidosis patients. Sarcoidosis is now believed to be associated with a complex mix of immunological disturbances involving simultaneous activation, as well as ''depression'', of certain immunological functions.''Immunological studies on sarcoidosis patients show that many of the immune functions associated with thymus-derived white blood cells, called T-lymphocytes or T-cells, are ''depressed''. The ''depression'' of this cellular component of systemic immune response is expressed in the inability of the patients to evoke a delayed hypersensitivity skin reaction (a positive skin test), when tested by the appropriate foreign substances, or antigen, underneath the skin.''In addition, the blood of sarcoidosis patients contains a reduced number of T-cells. These T-cells do not seem capable of responding normally when treated with substances known to stimulate the growth of laboratory-cultured T-cells. Neither do they produce their normal complement of immunological mediators, cytokines, through which the cells modify the behavior of other cells.''In contrast to the ''depression'' of the cellular immune response, the B-cell activity -- or humoral immune response of sarcoidosis patients is elevated. The humoral immune response is reflected by the production of circulating antibodies against a variety of exogenous antigens, including common ''viruses''. This humoral component of systemic immune response is mediated by another class of lymphocytes known as B-lymphocytes, or ''B-cells'', because they originate in the bone marrow.''In another indication of heightened humoral response, sarcoidosis patients seem prone to develop autoantibodies (antibodies against endogenous antigens) similar to rheumatoid factors.''With access to the cells and cell products in the lung tissue compartments through the bronchoalveolar technique, it also has become possible for researchers to complement the above investigations at the blood level with analysis of local inflammatory and immune events in the lungs. In contrast to what is seen at the systemic level, the cellular immune response in the lungs seems to be heightened rather than depressed.''Currently, thalidomide is being studied as a treatment for sarcoidosis. Future research with viral models may provide clues to the molecular mechanisms that trigger alterations in white blood cell (lymphocyte and macrophage) regulation leading to sarcoidosis.''For difficult-to-treat (refractory) sarcoidosis and sarcoidosis involving the nervous system (neurosarcoidosis), recent research using biologic medications that inhibit ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF-blockers) has been beneficial. The TNF-blockers used were ''adalimumab'' (''Humira'') and infliximab (Remicade).'  "
Is it possible to prevent sarcoidosis?,"'The cause of sarcoidosis still remains unknown, so there is at present no known way to prevent or cure this disease. However, doctors have had a great deal of experience in management of the illness. It should be noted that most people with sarcoidosis lead normal lives.''If you have sarcoidosis, you can help yourself by following sensible health measures. You should not smoke. You should also avoid exposure to other substances such as dusts and chemicals that can harm your lungs.''If you have any symptoms of sarcoidosis, see your doctor regularly so that the illness can be watched and, if necessary, treated. Regular checkups with the doctor are important even if there are no symptoms present. Eye examinations by an eye specialist can detect early eye inflammation from sarcoidosis.''Although severe sarcoidosis can reduce the chances of ''becoming pregnant'', particularly for older women, many young women with sarcoidosis have given birth to healthy ''babies'' while on treatment. Patients planning to have a baby should discuss the matter with their doctor. Medical checkups all through ''pregnancy'"" and immediately thereafter are especially important for sarcoidosis patients. In some cases, bed rest is necessary during the last three months of pregnancy. In addition to family and close friends, a number of local lung organizations, other nonprofit health organizations, and self-help groups are available to help patients cope with sarcoidosis. By keeping in touch with them, you can share personal feelings and experiences. Members also share specific information on the latest scientific advances, where to find a sarcoidosis specialist, and how to improve one's self-image.""  "
What is the prognosis of sarcoidosis?,'The prognosis of sarcoidosis is generally very good. The prognosis ultimately depends on the location and severity of involvement with the sarcoid inflammation.' 
Where can a person find more information on sarcoidosis?,"'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)''Division of Lung Diseases''5333 Westward Avenue''Room 6A16''Bethesda, MD 20892''If you are interested in participating on NHLBI clinical studies of sarcoidosis, have your physician write to the following address:''National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute''Pulmonary Branch''9000 Rockville Pike''Building 10, Room 6D06''Bethesda, MD 20892''National Institute of ''Allergy'' and Infectious Diseases''9000 Rockville Pike''Building 31, 7A32''Bethesda, MD 20892''Sarcoidosis Family Aid and Research Foundation''460A Central Avenue''East Orange, NJ 07018'""Many local chapters of the American Lung Association host support groups for sarcoidosis patients.

What are the causes of sarcoidosis?,"'The research to reveal the exact cause of ''sarcoidosis''\xa0is unknown.\xa0 Certain ''inherited'' genes make it more likely for a person to develop\xa0''sarcoidosis''.''Sarcoidosis is a result of an abnormal immune system, where the body starts to attack its own tissues and organs. The resulting swelling then causes granulomas to develop in the organs. Some possible triggers include:''The condition is not infectious, so it\xa0cannot be\xa0passed from person to person.' A person with a close blood relative who has sarcoidosis is nearly 5 times as likely to develop the condition. The disease can appear suddenly and then disappear, or it can develop gradually and produce symptoms that come and go for a lifetime. Sarcoidosis may be an abnormal response to a germ by the body. Environmental factor or allergies Exposure to virus, fungi, or bacteria Exposure to chemicals Patients who had recent organ transplantation It is most common among adults between the ages of 20 and 40  The disease is slightly more common in women than in men. The disease is 10 to 17 times more common in African-Americans than in Caucasians. People of Scandinavian, German, Irish, or Puerto Rican origin are also more prone to the disease."
What is sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis is a rare condition that causes small patches of red and swollen tissue (granulomas) to develop in the organs of the body. It usually affects the ''lungs'' and skin. This condition may change the normal structure and possibly the function of an affected organ. The symptoms of sarcoidosis include:' Reddish tender bumps or patches on the skin. Red and teary eyes or blurred vision. Swollen and painful joints. Enlarged and tender lymph glands in the neck, armpits, and groin. Enlarged lymph glands in the chest and around the lungs. Hoarse voice. Pain in the hands, feet, or other bony areas due to the formation of cysts (an abnormal sac-like growth) in bones. Weakness Weight loss Dry cough and shortness of breath Kidney stone formation. Enlarged liver. Development of abnormal or missed heartbeats (arrhythmias), inflammation of the covering of the heart (pericarditis), or heart failure. Nervous system effects, including hearing loss, meningitis, seizures, or psychiatric disorders (for example, dementia, depression, psychosis)."
Can sarcoidosis be treated?,"'There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but the disease may get better on its own over time. Sarcoidosis symptoms will often get better without treatment. Treatment is aimed at maintaining good lung function, reducing symptoms, and preventing organ damage.''Medicines commonly used to treat sarcoidosis may cause side effects. Side effects range from those that are mild, to those that are severe and potentially dangerous. Hence medical attention is constantly required.\xa0''Apart from the above medication patient may be required to follow lifestyle modifications which include:' Corticosteroids: The most common corticosteroid prescribed for sarcoidosis is prednisone. This may reduce inflammation and slow the growth of the granulomas. Methotrexate: This medicine may be given to people who cannot take corticosteroids. It also may be used with corticosteroids if needed.  Azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, and pentoxifylline are other drugs that may be used if corticosteroids and methotrexate are not effective.  Thalidomide and minocycline have been used in some cases of skin sarcoidosis. Infliximab is a new treatment that has proved useful for chronic sarcoidosis but is currently a drug to use only when standard treatments have failed. Eating a well-balanced diet with a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables Drinking enough fluids every day Getting six to eight hours of sleep each night Exercising regularly and managing your weight Quitting smoking Avoiding exposure to dust, chemicals, fumes, gases, toxic inhalants, and other substances that can harm your lungs Avoiding excessive amounts of calcium-rich foods (such as dairy products, oranges, and canned salmon with bones), vitamin D, and sunlight."
What is scabies? What causes a scabies infestation?,"'Scabies is an itchy, highly contagious skin disease caused by an infestation by the itch mite ''Sarcoptes scabiei''. Mites are small eight-legged parasites (in contrast to insects, which have six legs). They are tiny, just 1/3 millimeter long, and burrow into the skin to produce intense ''itching'', which tends to be worse at night. The mites that infest humans are female and are 0.3 mm-0.4 mm long; the males are about half this size. Scabies mites can be seen with a magnifying glass or microscope. The scabies mites crawl but are unable to fly or jump. They are immobile at temperatures below 20 C, although they may survive for prolonged periods at these temperatures.''Scabies infestation occurs worldwide and is very common. Scabies can affect anyone of any age (including a baby or child) or race. It has been estimated that about 300 million cases occur each year throughout the world. Human scabies has been reported for over 2,500 years. Scabies has been reported to occur in epidemics in ''nursing'' homes, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other institutions. In the U.S., scabies frequently affects the homeless population. It also occurs episodically in other populations of all socioeconomic groups, as well.'  "
What are scabies symptoms and signs? What does the scabies rash look like? ,"'The scabies rash is often apparent on the head, face, neck, palms, and soles of the feet in infants and very young children but usually not in adults and older children.''Textbook descriptions of scabies always mention ""burrows"" or ""tunnels."" These are tiny threadlike projections, ranging from 2 mm-15 mm long, which appear as thin gray, brown, or red lines in affected areas. The burrows can be very difficult to see. Often mistaken for burrows are linear scratch marks or welts that are large and dramatic and appear in people with any itchy skin condition. Scratching actually destroys burrows. Scratching may open the skin and lead to scab formation.'   Scabies produces a skin rash composed of small red bumps and blisters and affects specific areas of the body. Scabies may involve the webs between the fingers, the wrists and the backs of the elbows, the knees, around the waist and umbilicus, the axillary folds, the areas around the nipples, the sides and backs of the feet, the genital area, and the buttocks. The bumps (medically termed papules) may contain blood crusts. It is helpful to know that not every bump is a bug. In most cases of scabies affecting otherwise healthy adults, there are no more than 10-15 live mites even if there are hundreds of bumps and pimples on the skin."
Is scabies contagious? How do you get scabies?,"'Scabies is very contagious, and direct skin-to-skin contact is the mode of transmission. Scabies mites are very sensitive to their environment. They can only live off of a host body for 24-36 hours under most conditions. Transmission of the mites involves close person-to-person contact of the skin-to-skin variety, so risk factors include close contact with an infested person. It is hard, if not impossible, to catch scabies by ''shaking hands'', hanging your coat next to someone who has it, or even sharing bedclothes that had mites in them the night before. Sexual physical contact, however, can transmit the disease. In fact, sexual contact is the most common form of transmission among sexually active young people, and scabies has been considered by many to be a sexually transmitted disease (STD). However, other forms of physical contact, such as a mother hugging a baby, are sufficient to spread the mites. Over time, close friends and relatives can contract it this way, too. School settings typically do not provide the level of prolonged personal contact necessary for transmission of the mites.'  "
Can you catch scabies from a dog or cat?,"'Pets are infested by different types of mites than those that infect humans. Animals are not a source of spread of human scabies. Scabies on ''dogs'' is called mange and is sometimes referred to as sarcoptic mange. When canine or feline mites land on human skin, they fail to thrive and produce only a mild itch that goes away on its own. This is unlike human scabies, which gets worse and worse unless the condition is treated.' "
How do scabies spread?,"'Scabies can infest any human who comes in contact with the mites, including people in good health. The only known risk factor is direct skin contact with someone who is infested. Good hygiene and health practices cannot prevent transmission if there is close contact with an infested person. The contact one experiences in social or school settings is not likely to be sufficient to transmit the mites. Sexual or other close contact (such as hugging) is required to spread the condition. The condition does appear in clusters, so outbreaks may occur within a given community.''Elderly and weakened people in nursing homes and similar institutional health care settings may harbor scabies without showing significant itching or visible signs. In such cases, there can be widespread epidemics among patients and health care workers. Such cases are dramatic but, fortunately, uncommon.' "
What does scabies feel like?,"'It is important to note that symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested with the scabies mite. Even though symptoms do not occur, the infested person is still able to spread scabies during this time. When symptoms develop, itching is the most common symptom of scabies. Scabies does not cause ''pain''. The itch of scabies is insidious and relentless and often worsens over a period of weeks. The itch is typically worse at night. For the first weeks, the itch is subtle. It then gradually becomes more intense until, after a month or two, ''sleep'' becomes almost impossible due to the intensely itchy skin.''What makes the itch of scabies distinctive is its relentless quality, at least after several weeks. Other itchy skin ''conditions -- ''eczema'','' ''hives'', and so ''forth -- tend'' to produce symptoms that wax and wane. These types of itch may keep people from falling asleep at night for a little while, but they rarely prevent ''sleep'' or awaken the sufferer in the middle of the night.' "
What tests diagnose a scabies infestation?,"'Scabies is suggested by the presence of the typical rash and symptoms of unrelenting and worsening itch, particularly at night. Ultimately, the definitive medical diagnosis is made when evidence of mites is found from a skin scraping test. By scraping the skin (covered with a drop of mineral oil) sideways with a scalpel blade over an area of a burrow and examining the scrapings microscopically, it is possible to identify mites, eggs, or pellets. This process can be difficult, however, since burrows can be hard to identify.''Sometimes scratch marks are mistaken for burrows, and even the examination of scrapings from 15 or more burrows may only reveal one or two mites or eggs. If the characteristic physical findings are present, scabies can often be treated without performing the skin scrapings necessary to identify the mites. ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') testing is available to identify the genetic material of the scabies mites when the diagnosis is difficult, though this is not generally used. The mites can also be identified in skin biopsies that are performed when other causes of skin disease are suspected.' "
Which types of doctors treat scabies?,"'Scabies is treated by a number of different health-care professionals. The medical condition is commonly treated by primary-care doctors, including pediatricians, internal-medicine specialists, and family medicine doctors. Many patients with skin symptoms seek treatment from a dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist. Sometimes, the condition may be first treated by an emergency-medicine doctor if the patient seeks care in an emergency department.' "
What are treatments and home remedies for a scabies infestation? ,"'Curing scabies is rather easy with the administration of prescription ''scabicide'' drugs. There are no approved over-the-counter preparations that have been proved to be effective in eliminating scabies, and home remedies are not effective. Since scabies is a parasitic infestation, antibiotics used to treat ''bacterial infections'' are not effective. The following steps should be included in the medical treatment of scabies:'   Apply a mite-killer like permethrin (Elimite). These creams are applied from the neck down, left on overnight, then washed off. This application is usually repeated in seven days. Permethrin is approved for use in people 2 months of age and older and is considered to be the safest and most effective treatment for scabies. An alternative treatment is 1 ounce of a 1% lotion or 30 grams of cream of lindane, applied from the neck down and washed off after approximately eight hours. Since lindane can cause seizures when it is absorbed through the skin, it should not be used if skin is significantly irritated or wet, such as with extensive skin disease, rash, or after a bath. As an additional precaution, lindane should not be used during pregnancy or in nursing women, the elderly, people with skin sores at the site of the application, children younger than 2 years of age, or people who weigh less than 110 pounds. Lindane is not a first-line treatment and is only recommended if patients cannot tolerate other therapies or if other therapies have not been effective. Resistance to this medication has also been frequently reported."
What OTC and prescription medications treat and get rid a scabies infestation? ," Ivermectin (Stromectol), an oral medication, is an antiparasitic medication that has also been shown to be an effective scabicide, although it is not FDA-approved for this use. The CDC recommends taking this drug at a dosage of 200 micrograms per kilogram body weight as a single dose, followed by a repeat dose two weeks later. Although taking a drug by mouth is more convenient than application of the cream, oral ivermectin has a greater risk of toxic side effects than permethrin and has not been shown to be superior to permethrin in eradicating scabies. It is typically used only when topical medications have failed or when the patient cannot tolerate them. Crotamiton lotion 10% and cream 10% (Eurax, Crotan) is another drug that has been approved for the treatment of scabies in adults, but it is not approved for use in children. However, treatment failures have been documented with the use of crotamiton. Sulfur in petrolatum (Sulfo-Lac, Sulfo-Lo) applied as a cream or ointment is one of the earliest known treatments for scabies. It has not been approved by the FDA for this use, and sulfur should only be used when permethrin, lindane, or ivermectin cannot be tolerated. However, sulfur is safe for use during pregnancy and in infants."
What home remedies get rid of scabies?,"""Just as the itch of scabies takes a while to reach a crescendo, it takes a few days to subside after treatment. After a week or two, relief is dramatic. If that doesn't happen, the diagnosis of scabies must be questioned."" Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can be useful in helping provide relief from itching. Sometimes, a short course of topical or oral steroids is prescribed to help control the itching. Wash linens and bedclothes in hot water. Because mites don't live long away from the body, it is not necessary to dry-clean the whole wardrobe, spray furniture and rugs, and so forth. Treat sexual contacts or relevant family members (who either have either symptoms or have the kind of relationship that makes transmission likely)."
Are cases of scabies often misdiagnosed?,"'Scabies is very easy to misdiagnose because early subtle infestation may look like small ''pimples'' or mosquito bites. Those affected may believe they have another condition, such as ''bedbug bites'' or other kinds of ''rashes'"" or infections. Over a few weeks, however, mistakes like this become evident as patients feel worse and worse with symptoms they can't ignore."" "
What are the complications of scabies?,"'The intense itching of scabies leads to prolonged and often intense scratching of the skin. When the skin is broken or injured due to scratching, secondary bacterial infections of the skin can develop from bacteria normally present on the skin, such as ''Staphylococcus aureus'' or beta-hemolytic streptococci.' "
What is Norwegian or crusted scabies?,"'Norwegian scabies, or crusted scabies, is a severe form of scabies first described in Norway. Crusted scabies almost always affects people with a compromised immune system and is observed most frequently in the elderly, those who are mentally or physically disabled, and in patients with ''AIDS'', ''lymphoma'', or other health conditions that decrease the effectiveness of the immune response. Due to the poor function of the immune system, an individual may become infested with hundreds of thousands of the mites. The lesions of this distinctive form of scabies are extensive and may spread all over the body. The elbows, knees, palms, ''scalp'', and soles of the feet are most commonly the original sites of involvement, and the scaly areas eventually take on a wart-like appearance. The fingernails can be thickened and discolored. Interestingly, itching may be minimal or absent in this form of scabies.''A particular danger of crusted scabies is that these lesions often predispose to the development of secondary infections, as with ''Staphylococcus'' or ''Streptococcus'' bacteria, including ''impetigo'', a common ''skin infection'' of children.' "
Can a scabies infestation be prevented?,'Avoiding close personal contact with infested people can prevent scabies. Sexual contacts and household members of people who develop scabies can be treated as soon as the condition is identified so that they will not develop the signs or symptoms of the condition. The treatment for these exposed people is the same as the treatment of the infested individual.'  
Can scabies be cured?,"'Scabies is curable with scabicide medications. Treatment failures are not common but are possible, and people with Norwegian scabies may require a combination of different treatment methods.' "

They are immobile at temperatures below 20 C, although they may survive for prolonged periods at these temperatures.''Scabies infestation occurs worldwide and is very common. Scabies can affect anyone of any age (including a baby or child) or race. It has been estimated that about 300 million cases occur each year throughout the world. Human scabies has been reported for over 2,500 years. Scabies has been reported to occur in epidemics in ''nursing'' homes, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other institutions. In the U.S., scabies frequently affects the homeless population. It also occurs episodically in other populations of all socioeconomic groups, as well.'  "
What are scabies symptoms and signs? What does the scabies rash look like? ,"'The scabies rash is often apparent on the head, face, neck, palms, and soles of the feet in infants and very young children but usually not in adults and older children.''Textbook descriptions of scabies always mention ""burrows"" or ""tunnels."" These are tiny threadlike projections, ranging from 2 mm-15 mm long, which appear as thin gray, brown, or red lines in affected areas. The burrows can be very difficult to see. Often mistaken for burrows are linear scratch marks or welts that are large and dramatic and appear in people with any itchy skin condition. Scratching actually destroys burrows. Scratching may open the skin and lead to scab formation.'   Scabies produces a skin rash composed of small red bumps and blisters and affects specific areas of the body. Scabies may involve the webs between the fingers, the wrists and the backs of the elbows, the knees, around the waist and umbilicus, the axillary folds, the areas around the nipples, the sides and backs of the feet, the genital area, and the buttocks. The bumps (medically termed papules) may contain blood crusts. It is helpful to know that not every bump is a bug. In most cases of scabies affecting otherwise healthy adults, there are no more than 10-15 live mites even if there are hundreds of bumps and pimples on the skin."
Is scabies contagious? How do you get scabies?,"'Scabies is very contagious, and direct skin-to-skin contact is the mode of transmission. Scabies mites are very sensitive to their environment. They can only live off of a host body for 24-36 hours under most conditions. Transmission of the mites involves close person-to-person contact of the skin-to-skin variety, so risk factors include close contact with an infested person. It is hard, if not impossible, to catch scabies by ''shaking hands'', hanging your coat next to someone who has it, or even sharing bedclothes that had mites in them the night before. Sexual physical contact, however, can transmit the disease. In fact, sexual contact is the most common form of transmission among sexually active young people, and scabies has been considered by many to be a sexually transmitted disease (STD). However, other forms of physical contact, such as a mother hugging a baby, are sufficient to spread the mites. Over time, close friends and relatives can contract it this way, too. School settings typically do not provide the level of prolonged personal contact necessary for transmission of the mites.'  "
Can you catch scabies from a dog or cat?,"'Pets are infested by different types of mites than those that infect humans. Animals are not a source of spread of human scabies. Scabies on ''dogs'' is called mange and is sometimes referred to as sarcoptic mange. When canine or feline mites land on human skin, they fail to thrive and produce only a mild itch that goes away on its own. This is unlike human scabies, which gets worse and worse unless the condition is treated.' "
How do scabies spread?,"'Scabies can infest any human who comes in contact with the mites, including people in good health. The only known risk factor is direct skin contact with someone who is infested. Good hygiene and health practices cannot prevent transmission if there is close contact with an infested person. The contact one experiences in social or school settings is not likely to be sufficient to transmit the mites. Sexual or other close contact (such as hugging) is required to spread the condition. The condition does appear in clusters, so outbreaks may occur within a given community.''Elderly and weakened people in nursing homes and similar institutional health care settings may harbor scabies without showing significant itching or visible signs. In such cases, there can be widespread epidemics among patients and health care workers. Such cases are dramatic but, fortunately, uncommon.' "
What does scabies feel like?,"'It is important to note that symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested with the scabies mite. Even though symptoms do not occur, the infested person is still able to spread scabies during this time. When symptoms develop, itching is the most common symptom of scabies. Scabies does not cause ''pain''. The itch of scabies is insidious and relentless and often worsens over a period of weeks. The itch is typically worse at night. For the first weeks, the itch is subtle. It then gradually becomes more intense until, after a month or two, ''sleep'' becomes almost impossible due to the intensely itchy skin.''What makes the itch of scabies distinctive is its relentless quality, at least after several weeks. Other itchy skin ''conditions -- ''eczema'','' ''hives'', and so ''forth -- tend'' to produce symptoms that wax and wane. These types of itch may keep people from falling asleep at night for a little while, but they rarely prevent ''sleep'' or awaken the sufferer in the middle of the night.' "
What tests diagnose a scabies infestation?,"'Scabies is suggested by the presence of the typical rash and symptoms of unrelenting and worsening itch, particularly at night. Ultimately, the definitive medical diagnosis is made when evidence of mites is found from a skin scraping test. By scraping the skin (covered with a drop of mineral oil) sideways with a scalpel blade over an area of a burrow and examining the scrapings microscopically, it is possible to identify mites, eggs, or pellets. This process can be difficult, however, since burrows can be hard to identify.''Sometimes scratch marks are mistaken for burrows, and even the examination of scrapings from 15 or more burrows may only reveal one or two mites or eggs. If the characteristic physical findings are present, scabies can often be treated without performing the skin scrapings necessary to identify the mites. ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') testing is available to identify the genetic material of the scabies mites when the diagnosis is difficult, though this is not generally used. The mites can also be identified in skin biopsies that are performed when other causes of skin disease are suspected.' "
Which types of doctors treat scabies?,"'Scabies is treated by a number of different health-care professionals. The medical condition is commonly treated by primary-care doctors, including pediatricians, internal-medicine specialists, and family medicine doctors. Many patients with skin symptoms seek treatment from a dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist. Sometimes, the condition may be first treated by an emergency-medicine doctor if the patient seeks care in an emergency department.' "
What are treatments and home remedies for a scabies infestation? ,"'Curing scabies is rather easy with the administration of prescription ''scabicide'' drugs. There are no approved over-the-counter preparations that have been proved to be effective in eliminating scabies, and home remedies are not effective. Since scabies is a parasitic infestation, antibiotics used to treat ''bacterial infections'' are not effective. The following steps should be included in the medical treatment of scabies:'   Apply a mite-killer like permethrin (Elimite). These creams are applied from the neck down, left on overnight, then washed off. This application is usually repeated in seven days. Permethrin is approved for use in people 2 months of age and older and is considered to be the safest and most effective treatment for scabies. An alternative treatment is 1 ounce of a 1% lotion or 30 grams of cream of lindane, applied from the neck down and washed off after approximately eight hours. Since lindane can cause seizures when it is absorbed through the skin, it should not be used if skin is significantly irritated or wet, such as with extensive skin disease, rash, or after a bath. As an additional precaution, lindane should not be used during pregnancy or in nursing women, the elderly, people with skin sores at the site of the application, children younger than 2 years of age, or people who weigh less than 110 pounds. Lindane is not a first-line treatment and is only recommended if patients cannot tolerate other therapies or if other therapies have not been effective. Resistance to this medication has also been frequently reported."
What OTC and prescription medications treat and get rid a scabies infestation? ," Ivermectin (Stromectol), an oral medication, is an antiparasitic medication that has also been shown to be an effective scabicide, although it is not FDA-approved for this use. The CDC recommends taking this drug at a dosage of 200 micrograms per kilogram body weight as a single dose, followed by a repeat dose two weeks later. Although taking a drug by mouth is more convenient than application of the cream, oral ivermectin has a greater risk of toxic side effects than permethrin and has not been shown to be superior to permethrin in eradicating scabies. It is typically used only when topical medications have failed or when the patient cannot tolerate them. Crotamiton lotion 10% and cream 10% (Eurax, Crotan) is another drug that has been approved for the treatment of scabies in adults, but it is not approved for use in children. However, treatment failures have been documented with the use of crotamiton. Sulfur in petrolatum (Sulfo-Lac, Sulfo-Lo) applied as a cream or ointment is one of the earliest known treatments for scabies. It has not been approved by the FDA for this use, and sulfur should only be used when permethrin, lindane, or ivermectin cannot be tolerated. However, sulfur is safe for use during pregnancy and in infants."
What home remedies get rid of scabies?,"""Just as the itch of scabies takes a while to reach a crescendo, it takes a few days to subside after treatment. After a week or two, relief is dramatic. If that doesn't happen, the diagnosis of scabies must be questioned."" Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can be useful in helping provide relief from itching. Sometimes, a short course of topical or oral steroids is prescribed to help control the itching. Wash linens and bedclothes in hot water. Because mites don't live long away from the body, it is not necessary to dry-clean the whole wardrobe, spray furniture and rugs, and so forth. Treat sexual contacts or relevant family members (who either have either symptoms or have the kind of relationship that makes transmission likely)."
Are cases of scabies often misdiagnosed?,"'Scabies is very easy to misdiagnose because early subtle infestation may look like small ''pimples'' or mosquito bites. Those affected may believe they have another condition, such as ''bedbug bites'' or other kinds of ''rashes'"" or infections. Over a few weeks, however, mistakes like this become evident as patients feel worse and worse with symptoms they can't ignore."" "
What are the complications of scabies?,"'The intense itching of scabies leads to prolonged and often intense scratching of the skin. When the skin is broken or injured due to scratching, secondary bacterial infections of the skin can develop from bacteria normally present on the skin, such as ''Staphylococcus aureus'' or beta-hemolytic streptococci.' "
What is Norwegian or crusted scabies?,"'Norwegian scabies, or crusted scabies, is a severe form of scabies first described in Norway. Crusted scabies almost always affects people with a compromised immune system and is observed most frequently in the elderly, those who are mentally or physically disabled, and in patients with ''AIDS'', ''lymphoma'', or other health conditions that decrease the effectiveness of the immune response. Due to the poor function of the immune system, an individual may become infested with hundreds of thousands of the mites. The lesions of this distinctive form of scabies are extensive and may spread all over the body. The elbows, knees, palms, ''scalp'', and soles of the feet are most commonly the original sites of involvement, and the scaly areas eventually take on a wart-like appearance. The fingernails can be thickened and discolored. Interestingly, itching may be minimal or absent in this form of scabies.''A particular danger of crusted scabies is that these lesions often predispose to the development of secondary infections, as with ''Staphylococcus'' or ''Streptococcus'' bacteria, including ''impetigo'', a common ''skin infection'' of children.' "
Can a scabies infestation be prevented?,'Avoiding close personal contact with infested people can prevent scabies. Sexual contacts and household members of people who develop scabies can be treated as soon as the condition is identified so that they will not develop the signs or symptoms of the condition. The treatment for these exposed people is the same as the treatment of the infested individual.'  
Can scabies be cured?,"'Scabies is curable with scabicide medications. Treatment failures are not common but are possible, and people with Norwegian scabies may require a combination of different treatment methods.' "
What is scabies?,"'Human ''scabies'' is caused by the human ''itch'' ''mite'' (''Sarcoptes scabiei'', variation or subtype ''hominis''). This itch mite burrows into the upper layers of skin and lays its eggs in the skin. This itch mite is found worldwide and often causes outbreaks in places where people are living close together, such as dormitories, nursing homes, institutions, or prisons. The ''rash'' often includes areas such as the web spaces of the fingers, wrists, beltline, ''feet'', scrotum, and areolas, but other areas may get infected.'  "
Is scabies contagious?,"'Scabies'' is ''contagious''. However, it usually requires fairly long skin-to-skin contact with an infested person (for example, carrying a person, sleeping with the person, or ''sexual partners''). Infrequently, it may be contagious through contact with clothing or bedding, but this form of transfer of ''scabies'' is thought to be very infrequent. In general, most people who become infested with scabies usually have about 10-15 itch mites on their body. One exception to this rule is a scabies infestation that is seen less frequently called crusted or Norwegian scabies, in which large areas of skin are infected with huge numbers (thousands) of itch mites; a person with this type of scabies is highly contagious.''Although pets can become infested with similar itch mites, they are not usually spread from humans to animals or from animals to humans.' "
What is the contagious period for scabies?,"'As long as an individual has about 10 to 15 itch mites on their body and has skin-to-skin contact with an uninfested person, that person is contagious for scabies and can pass the organisms to others. In addition, a person who has recently acquired scabies and is in the incubation period (without symptoms) is also contagious for scabies.' "
How will I know if I have scabies? What is the incubation period for scabies?,"'People usually know if they have scabies from the presence of a very itchy ''rash'' that has little tendrils that extend out of an area of itchy rash (these are the burrows that the itch mite makes in the skin layers), especially if they have noticed similar skin changes on a person with whom they may have had close contact. Some physicians may do skin scrapings and, with fairly common laboratory stains, may identify the mite and/or its eggs or fecal matter in the skin scrapings viewed with a microscope. In young children, pinkish-brown nodules may form on the skin. The incubation period for scabies can be up to eight weeks; the infested person can be contagious during this period.' "
How is scabies transmitted?,"'Scabies is spread by direct and usually prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has the disease. Indirect spread can sometimes occur through contaminated clothing or towels. Crusted or Norwegian scabies is highly contagious, both from direct contact and indirect contact (from clothing, bedding, towels, for example) because of the very high concentration of mites.' "
How will I know if I am cured of scabies?,"'Scabicides like permethrin are used topically (spread onto skin) to kill the itch mites. Usually, a cream or lotion is applied from the neck down to the feet, and the cure results in remission and finally disappearance of the rash. However, sometimes people may seem to be cured only to have ''itching'' and the rash return in a few weeks. This may be due to inadequate treatment that allows the eggs to survive and hatch or may be due to inadequate cleaning of clothing or bedding (scabies mites are killed by hot water and dryer heat, or dry cleaning, and cannot survive more than two or three days away from human skin) or simply due to contacting someone who has scabies. If there is no further symptom development about two to four weeks after treatment, most people will be cured of scabies.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about scabies?,"'If you or someone close to you has scabies, contact a physician for treatment and for advice about who else may benefit from treatment (for example, sexual partners, family members). Patients with crusted scabies require isolation and/or barriers (gloves, gowns, for example) to protect others from the mites; such patients often are hospitalized and also tested for underlying health problems (such as immunosuppression).' "
Is ringworm contagious?,"'Ringworm occurs in people of all ages, but it is particularly common in children. It occurs most often in warm, moist climates. Ringworm is a contagious disease and can be passed through skin-to-skin contact or by sharing combs and brushes, other personal care items, or clothing. It is also possible to become infected with ringworm after coming in contact with locker room or pool surfaces. The skin infection can also affect ''dogs'' and cats, and pets may transmit the infection to humans. It is common to have several areas of ringworm at once in different body areas.'  "
What does the term ringworm mean?,"'The term ''ringworm'' or ''ringworms'' refers to ''fungal infections'' that are on the surface of the skin. The name is derived from the early belief that the infection was due to a worm, which it is not. Ringworm is a fungal infection in the skin. Nevertheless, the name ringworm remains. Some of these fungi produce a ''rash'' of round scaly spots on the skin, but many do not. On the other hand, many round, red spots or ''rashes'' on the skin are not due to a fungal infection. A physical examination of the affected skin, evaluation of skin scrapings under the microscope, and culture tests can help health care professionals make the appropriate diagnosis and distinctions from other conditions. A proper diagnosis is best for successful treatment.''The medical term for ringworm is ''tinea''. (Tinea is the Latin name for a growing worm.) Health care professionals add another word to indicate the part of the body where the fungus is located. Tinea capitis, for instance, refers to ''scalp ringworm'', tinea corporis to fungus of the body, ''tinea pedis'' to fungus of the ''feet'', and so on.' "
What causes ringworm?,"'Although the world is full of yeasts, molds, and fungi, only a few cause skin disease. These agents are called the ''dermatophytes'' (which means ""skin fungi""). An infection with these fungi is medically known as dermatophytosis. Skin fungi can only live on the dead layer of keratin protein on top of the skin. They rarely invade deeper into the body and cannot live on mucous membranes, such as those in the mouth or vagina.''Scientific names for the most common of the dermatophyte fungi that cause ringworm include ''Trichophyton rubrum'', ''Trichophyton tonsurans'', ''Trichophyton interdigitale'', and/or ''Trichophyton mentagrophytes'', ''Microsporum canis'', and ''Epidermophyton floccosum''.' "
What are the sources of skin fungi?,"""Some fungi live only on human skin, hair, or nails. Others live on animals and only sometimes are found on human skin. Still others live in the soil. It is often difficult or impossible to identify the source of a particular person's skin fungus. The fungi may spread from person to person (anthropophilic), from animal to person (zoophilic), or from the soil to a person (geophilic).""'Heat and moisture help fungi grow and thrive, which makes them more commonly found in skin folds such as those in the groin area or between the toes. This also accounts for their reputation as being caught from showers, locker rooms, and ''swimming'' pools. This reputation is exaggerated, though, since many people with ""jock ''itch''"" or ""'""athlete's foot""'"" have not contracted the infection from locker rooms or athletic facilities.' "
What are risk factors for ringworm?,"'As described previously, it is possible to acquire ringworm from a variety of places and circumstances. The greatest risk factor is coming in contact with an affected individual. Warm, moist areas are favorable conditions for the growth of fungi, so areas such as communal showers and locker rooms are areas in which transmission is favorable. However, any contact with an infected person or a contaminated surface can cause ringworm infection.' "
What types of ringworm are there? What are ringworm symptoms and signs?,"'The following are the different types of ringworm, or tinea:''Tinea barbae'': Ringworm of the bearded area of the face and neck, with swelling and marked crusting, is often accompanied by ''itching'"", sometimes causing the hair to break off. In the days when men went to the barber daily for a shave, tinea barbae was called barber's ""'itch''.''Tinea capitis'': Scalp ringworm commonly affects children, mostly in late childhood or adolescence. This condition may spread in schools. Tinea capitis appears as scalp scaling that is associated with bald spots (in contrast to ''seborrhea'' or ''dandruff'', for instance, which do not cause ''hair loss'').\xa0Occasionally, a kerion (a pus-filled, raised swelling) may develop in severe cases of ringworm of the scalp.' "
Types of ringworm: tinea corporis and tinea cruris. What are the symptoms?,"'Tinea corporis'': When fungus affects the skin of the body, it often produces the round spots of classic ringworm. The first stage of symptoms involves a red, scaly area of skin that may be slightly raised (plaque). This stage tends to worsen rapidly. The condition progresses to form the characteristic ring shape. Sometimes, these spots have an ""active"" outer border as they slowly grow and advance. Sometimes, scaling, crusting, raised areas, or even blister-like lesions can appear, particularly in the active border. It is important to distinguish ringworm of the body from other ''skin conditions'', such as ''nummular eczema''. This condition, and others, may appear similar to ringworm, but they are not due to a fungal infection and require different treatment.''Tinea cruris'': Tinea of the groin (""jock itch"") tends to have a reddish-brown color and extends from the folds of the groin down onto one or both thighs. Other conditions that can mimic tinea cruris include yeast infections, ''psoriasis'', and ''intertrigo'', a ''chafing'' rash that results from the skin rubbing against the skin.' "
Types of ringworm: tinea faciei and tinea manus. What are the symptoms?,"'Tinea faciei (faciale)'': ringworm on the face except in the area of the beard. On the face, ringworm is rarely ring shaped. Characteristically, it causes red scaly patches with indistinct edges.''Tinea manus'': ringworm involving the hands, particularly the palms and the spaces between the fingers. It typically causes thickening (hyperkeratosis) of these areas, often on only one hand. Tinea manus is a common companion of tinea pedis (ringworm of the feet). It is also called tinea manuum.' "
Types of ringworm: tinea pedis and tinea unguium. What are the symptoms?,"'Tinea pedis'': Athlete\'s foot may cause scaling and inflammation with itching and burning irritation in the toe webs, especially the one between the fourth and fifth toes. Another common form of tinea pedis produces a thickening or scaling of the skin on the heels and soles. This is sometimes referred to as the ""moccasin distribution."" Occasionally, tinea causes ''blisters'' between the toes or on the sole. Aside from '""athlete's foot""', tinea pedis is known as tinea of the foot or, more loosely, fungal infection of the feet. Tinea pedis is an extremely common skin disorder. It is the most common and perhaps the most persistent of the fungal (tinea) infections. It is rare before adolescence. It may occur in association with other fungal skin infections such as tinea cruris (jock itch).''Tinea unguium'': Finally, fungal infection can make the fingernails and, more often, the toenails yellow, thick, and crumbly. This is referred to as ''fungal nails'' or ''onychomycosis''.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose ringworm?,"'Often, the diagnosis of ringworm is obvious from its location and appearance. Otherwise, skin scrapings for microscopic examination and a culture of the affected skin can establish the diagnosis of ringworm. If the diagnosis is unclear, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of a skin scraping can be reviewed under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis of a fungus. If a fungus infection is present and the skin problem is misdiagnosed, inappropriate treatment might be prescribed that could actually worsen the infection.'  "
What kinds of health care professionals treat ringworm?,"'Ringworm is treated by primary-care specialists, including internists, pediatricians (for ringworm in a child), and family medicine specialists. Because it is a skin condition, many people also seek medical advice from a dermatologist for ringworm. In rare, complicated ringworm infection, an infectious-disease specialist may be consulted.' "
What is the treatment for ringworm? Are there home remedies for ringworm?,"'Home remedies cannot cure ringworm. To cure ringworm, it is necessary to take antifungal medications. Ringworm can be treated topically (with external applications) or systemically (for example, with oral medications):''Topical treatment'': When fungus affects the skin of the body or the groin, many antifungal creams can clear the condition in around two weeks. Examples of such preparations include those that contain ''clotrimazole'' (Cruex cream, ''Desenex'' cream, Lotrimin cream, lotion, and solution), ''miconazole'' (''Monistat''-Derm cream), ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral'' cream), econazole (Spectazole), naftifine (''Naftin''), and ''terbinafine'' (''Lamisil'' cream and solution). These treatments are effective for many cases of ''foot fungus'' as well. Many of these antifungal creams are available as ''over-the-counter'' preparations. It is usually necessary to use topical medications for at least two weeks. More recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the antifungal medication luliconazole (Luzu), the first topical azole antifungal agent with a one-week once-daily treatment regimen for the management of tinea cruris and tinea corporis in adults aged 18 years or older.''Systemic treatment'': Some fungal infections do not respond well to external applications. Examples include scalp fungus and fungus of the nails. To penetrate these areas and for particularly severe or extensive disease, oral medications can be used.''For a long time, the only effective antifungal tablet was ''griseofulvin'' (''Fulvicin'', Grifulvin, and Gris-''PEG''). Now, other agents are available that are both safer and more effective. These include terbinafine, ''itraconazole'' (''Sporanox''), and ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''). Oral medications are usually given for a three-month course.'  "
Is it possible to prevent ringworm?,"'Conventional wisdom holds that minimizing sweat and moisture can help prevent fungal infections. Common recommendations for ringworm ''prevention'' along these lines are for men to wear loose-fitting boxer shorts, for women to avoid pantyhose, and so forth. Whether these measures, some of which are quite difficult to implement, are really worth all of the effort is open to question.''You can also take steps to prevent spread of ringworm infections. Do not share clothing, towels, hairbrushes, combs, hair accessories, sports gear, or other personal-care items. Wearing sandals or shoes in gyms, locker rooms, and at pools can help reduce your chances of contracting '""athlete's foot""'. Be sure that your child also wears shoes in locker rooms and around pools. You should avoid touching pets that have signs of ringworm (typically bald spots). Wash hands after touching pets and be sure that a child washes his/her hands after touching pets.''If your pet has ringworm, wear gloves and long sleeves when handling your pet, and vacuum often in areas of the home frequented by your pet. You can kill fungal spores by disinfecting surfaces and bedding by using a solution of diluted chlorine bleach, benzalkonium chloride, or strong detergents. A veterinarian can treat your pet so that the infection can be eradicated.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for ringworm?,"'Ringworm can be cured with appropriate treatment. Ringworm of the skin typically resolves after two to three weeks of treatment, while cases of ringworm of the scalp or nails may require treatment for a few months. Complications are rare and can include a secondary bacterial skin infection or a widespread fungal infection (extremely rare and more likely to occur in individuals with suppressed immune systems).' "
What is scalp psoriasis? When can scalp psoriasis begin?,"'Psoriasis'' is an inflammatory disease of the skin that is estimated to affect about 2.2% of the adult population. In children, the onset of ''psoriasis'' can be before the age of one year but peaks around 5-8 years. ''Psoriasis'' produces scaly, ''itching'' ''bumps on the skin''. Some people may have a genetic predisposition to ''psoriasis''. The genes affected seem to be involved with control of the immune system. ''Psoriasis'' appears as red scaling, slightly raised ''bumps'' (''papules'') that merge to form plaques. ''Psoriasis'' classically appears on the elbows and knees, but it can affect any part of the skin. The ''scalp'' is also characteristically affected in many people. Like ''psoriasis'' anywhere on the body, ''scalp'' plaques produce excess scale and can ''itch''. Severe disease can cause a loss of scalp hair, which usually will return if the disease can be controlled. ''Scalp psoriasis'' somewhat difficult to treat when the scalp is covered with hair sufficient to act a barrier to the application of topical medications.' "
What are causes and risk factors of scalp psoriasis?,"'It is generally accepted that scalp ''psoriasis'', like all psoriasis, is related to genetic defects that affect certain parts of the immune system. There are undoubtedly environmental risk factors that trigger its initial development in genetically predisposed individuals. The notion that ""emotional ''stress''"" plays a causal role or at least exacerbates psoriasis has been difficult to prove. There is no question, however, that ''psoriasis of the scalp'' can be an extremely stressful experience.' "
What are scalp psoriasis symptoms and signs? Can scalp psoriasis cause hair loss?,"'Psoriasis appears as a small bump, a papule, surmounted by scale. When these ''papules'' coalesce, a plaque is formed that is often covered by thick layers of horny scale. When this scale is shed, it appears as ''dandruff'', which can be quite unsightly. Scratching these plaques, either because of ''itching'' or because of the impulse to remove it, is a very poor idea because of what is called the Koebner phenomenon (also known as the Koebner response or isomorphic response). This may cause psoriasis to develop in areas of inflammation and ''trauma''. Scratching off the scale will only make things worse. Although most patients do not note ''hair loss'', there can be extensive ''alopecia'' ''hair loss'' (''alopecia'') in severe cases.'  "
Scalp psoriasis vs. seborrheic dermatitis,"'Occasionally, ''seborrheic dermatitis'' of the scalp can be confused with scalp psoriasis since both can produce excess scale and can ''itch''. Pathological examination of the ''skin biopsy'' material occasionally may be helpful in distinguishing the two entities. As a practical matter, this is rarely necessary because most patients with psoriasis have typical psoriatic lesions present in other areas, such as the elbows, knees, or torso. In addition, both conditions generally respond to similar topical medications.' "
What physicians treat scalp psoriasis?,"'Dermatologists are specialists who deal with the diagnosis and treatment of many kinds of scalp conditions. Other physicians that can be involved in the care of patients with psoriasis include general and family-practice physicians, internists, and ''rheumatologists''.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose scalp psoriasis?,"'The fact that the scalp is a hair-bearing area in most people produces challenges in diagnosis as well as treatment. If scaling plaques are present on portions of the body in a distribution characteristic of psoriasis, then the diagnosis of the scalp disease is much easier to make.' "
What are scalp psoriasis home remedies and topical treatments? Are there shampoos for scalp psoriasis?,"'The most important consideration in treating scalp psoriasis is getting an effective medication into the skin. Both the hair and any scale covering the disease act as an impediment to treatment. Removal of the scale in a nontraumatic fashion is very important. This can be accomplished by shampooing frequently. Using tar, selenium, or salicylic acid-containing shampoos can be helpful. This may have to be done at least twice a day initially if the scale is sufficiently thick. Gently rubbing off the scale with the fingertips and not the nails is important.''It should be appreciated that scaling is not due to dryness but to the excessive production of the horny layer of the skin. Occasionally, it may be necessary to cover the scalp overnight with mineral oil. To avoid an unpleasant mess, it is necessary to cover the head with a shower cap or swim cap. With moderate or severe scalp disease, the addition of a topical steroid is often required. The potency of the steroid would depend on the severity of the condition. The type of vehicle (lotion, solution, or foam) depends on physician and patient preference. It is important to remember that the medication must get past the hair in order to reach the scalp skin. Sometimes other medications may be of benefit, such as topical calcipotriene (''Dovonex'', ''Sorilux'') in a lotion or foam form. Some medications are available as combinations of topical steroid and calcipotriene.'  "
What are office treatments for scalp psoriasis?,"'Rarely, it may be of benefit to inject triamcinolone acetonide directly into psoriatic plaques. Aside from the ''pain'' involved, the benefit only lasts about six weeks at best. Ultraviolet light in wavelengths near 313 nm (narrow band UVB) is effective in psoriasis. The hair, however, can pose a barrier to effective administration unless it is removed or sparse. The excimer laser produces out laser light in these UV wavelengths also and can be of benefit if the amount of scalp involvement is limited.'  "
What medications treat scalp psoriasis?,"'If the scalp is involved as part of ''severe psoriasis'' deemed too extensive to be treated practically with topical medications, then medications delivered orally or by injection may be necessary. All these medications comprise more risk when compared to topical medication. They include oral ''drugs'' like ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune''), ''acitretin'' (''Soriatane''), ''apremilast'' (''Otezla''), and some of the so-called biological ''drugs'' that are administered by infusion into a vein (''infliximab'' [''Remicade'']) or by injection into the deeper layers of the skin like ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), ''ustekinumab'' (''Stelara''), secukinumab (Cosentyx), and ixekizumab (Taltz). Regular laboratory work may be necessary to monitor for the toxicities associated with some of these systemic therapies.'  "
"What is the prognosis of scalp psoriasis? Is there a cure for scalp 
psoriasis?","'Since psoriasis is incurable unless there is a miraculous spontaneous resolution, those afflicted need to remember that constant care is required to keep it controlled. With diligent attention, scalp psoriasis can be controlled.' "
Are there support groups for individuals with psoriasis?,'Patient support groups like the ''National Psoriasis Foundation'' are valuable additions to medical care that can aid individuals dealing with the disease.' 
What is the thyroid gland?,"'The thyroid is a gland that makes and stores essential hormones that help regulate the ''heart'' rate, ''blood pressure'', body temperature, and the rate of chemical reactions (metabolism) in the body. It is located in the anterior neck just below the ""Adam\'s apple.""''The thyroid gland is the main part of the body that takes up ''iodine''. In a thyroid scan, iodine is labeled with a radioactive tracer, and a special camera is used to measure how much tracer is absorbed from the bloodstream by the thyroid gland. If a patient is ''allergic'' to iodine, technetium can be used as an alternative.' "
How is the thyroid scan performed?,"'A thyroid scan is an outpatient procedure usually done in the nuclear medicine section of a hospital. This is usually part of the radiology department.''If you have a thyroid scan, you will be asked to take a drink, or swallow a pill containing the iodine. You will then wait for the iodine to be taken up by the thyroid - usually about 4 hours. At this time you lie under a scintography camera, and it will take pictures which correlate directly to the amount of iodine taken up by the thyroid. This is done by counting the intensity and location of the gamma rays emitted by the radioactively labeled iodine. You then leave the hospital, and return in 24 hours to have a second scan performed in the same manner.''There are no limitations during this 24 hour interval except that you will be asked to take precautions when you urinate. This is because the radioactive iodine is removed from your body by the urine, and it is safer to have others avoid contact with your urine during this time. Be sure to let the doctor performing the test know if you have an iodine ''allergy'', or if you have ingested a lot of iodine-containing foods (like sushi) prior to the test.' "
When is thyroid scanning helpful?,"'A thyroid scan can provide information on the size and shape of the gland as well as the overall activity of the gland (is the whole thyroid gland overactive or underactive?). ''For example, thyroid scanning is used to determine how active thyroid tissue is in manufacturing ''thyroid hormone''. This feature can determine whether inflammation of the thyroid gland (''thyroiditis'') is present. It can also detect the presence and degree of overactivity of the gland (''hyperthyroidism'' ). In this case the scan reveals increased iodine uptake by the whole gland. ''In addition, a thyroid scan can provide information on specific areas within the thyroid gland and can help to determine whether any localized areas are hyperfunctioning or under functioning compared to the rest of the gland. In these cases spots appear on the image corresponding to areas that take up iodine differently from the rest of the gland. ''Thyroid scanning is especially helpful in evaluating ''thyroid nodules'', particularly after a fine needle aspiration biopsy has failed to provide a diagnosis. A scan will reveal whether a ''thyroid nodule'' is ""functioning"" or ""nonfunctioning"". Doctors refer to hyper functioning nodules of the thyroid (those that are actively taking up iodine to produce thyroid hormone more so than surrounding thyroid tissue) as ""hot"" nodules, and these hyperfunctioning areas are seen on the image of the thyroid gland. A nonfunctioning nodule does not take up iodine and produces a localized ""''cold''"" area on the image of the thyroid gland. ''In addition, thyroid scanning can be done to help determine if ''thyroid cancer'' has spread beyond the bed of the thyroid in the neck. For this purpose, usually a whole body thyroid scan is performed. ' "
"What is significant about whether a nodule is ""hot"" or ""cold?""","'Functioning or ""hot"" nodules only rarely are from ''cancer''. Nearly all thyroid ''cancers'' are nonfunctioning or ""cold"" nodules. However, even among ""cold"" nodules, ''cancer'' is infrequent (less than 5 percent of cases).' "
Thyroid Scan Safety and Efficacy,"'While the thought of taking something ""radioactive"" is not very appealing, it is important to remember that iodine concentrates only in thyroid tissue, making this test safe and also quite specific for ''thyroid disorders''.''A thyroid scan can provide information on both the structure as well as the function of the thyroid gland. This information can help you and your physician determine if further investigations, procedures, or medications are medically necessary.' "
What is a keloid scar?,"'Keloids can be considered to be ""''scars'' that don\'t know when to stop."" A keloid, sometimes referred to as a keloid scar, is a tough heaped-up scar that rises quite abruptly above the rest of the skin. It usually has a smooth top and a pink or purple color. Keloids are irregularly shaped and tend to enlarge progressively. Unlike scars, keloids do not regress over time.'  "
What is the cause of keloids?,"'Doctors do not understand exactly why keloids form. Alterations in the cellular signals that control proliferation and inflammation may be related to the process of keloid formation, but these changes have not yet been characterized sufficiently to explain this defect in ''wound'' healing.'  "
What are keloid risk factors?,"'Individuals with darkly pigmented skin are 15 times more likely to develop keloids, with those of African, Hispanic, and Asian ethnicity are at greatest risk. Keloids are equally common in women and men. Keloids are less common in children and the elderly. Although people with darker skin are more likely to develop them, keloids can occur in people of all skin types. In some cases, the tendency to form keloids seems to run in families. A mutation in a gene known as NEDD4 gene may indicate that a person has a predisposition to keloid formation.' "
In which area of the body are keloids most likely to appear?,"'Keloids develop most often on the chest, back, shoulders, and earlobes. They seldom develop on the face (with the exception of the jawline).'  "
"What is the difference between a keloid, hypertrophic scar, and a 
dermatofibroma?","'After the skin is injured, the healing process usually leaves a flat scar. Sometimes the scar is hypertrophic, or thickened, but confined to the margin of the original wound. Hypertrophic scars tend to be redder and often regress spontaneously (a process which can take one year or more). Treatment, such as injections of cortisone (steroids), can speed this process.''A ''dermatofibroma'' is a small, benign, pigmented, very firm bump in the skin that does not cause other symptoms. It is most often found on the legs. Dermatofibromas are almost never larger than ½ to ¾ of an inch and remain unchanged over many years.'""Keloids, by contrast, may start sometime after a cutaneous injury and extend beyond the wound site. This tendency to migrate into surrounding areas that weren't injured originally distinguishes keloids from hypertrophic scars. Keloids typically appear following surgery or injury, but they can also as a result of some minor inflammation, such as an ""'acne'' ''pimple'"" on the chest (even one that wasn't scratched or otherwise irritated). Other minor injuries that can trigger keloids are ""'burns'' and cosmetic piercings.''A keloid has a characteristic microscopic appearance and may be distinguished from a ''hypertrophic scar'' and a dermatofibroma.' "
Keloids and piercing,"""Keloids can develop following the minor injuries that occur with body piercing. Since this form of physical adornment has become popular, the presence of keloidal scarring is much more prevalent. Since doctors do not understand the precise reasons why some people are more prone to developing keloids, it is impossible to predict whether one's first piercing will lead to keloid formation. Although there are some families that seem prone to forming keloids, for the most part, it's impossible to tell who will develop a keloid. One person might, for instance, develop a keloid in one earlobe after piercing and not in the other. It makes sense, however, for someone who has formed one keloid to avoid any elective surgery or cosmetic piercing of any body part.""  "
Is it possible to remove a keloid?,"'The decision about when to treat a keloid depends on the symptoms associated with its development and its anatomical location. A chronically ''itchy'' and irritated keloid can be quite distracting. Keloids in cosmetically sensitive areas that cause disfigurement or embarrassment are obvious candidates for treatment. It is unclear whether early treatment is important. What is clear is that larger keloids are more difficult to treat. Special techniques must be used soon after the surgical procedure has concluded to prevent the formation of a new, larger keloid.' "
What are keloid symptoms and signs?,"'Keloids are raised and look shiny and dome-shaped, ranging in color from pink to red. Some keloids become quite large and unsightly. Aside from causing potential cosmetic problems, these exuberant scars tend to be itchy, tender, or even painful to the touch.'  "
What types of doctors diagnose and treat keloids?,"'Dermatologists, ''plastic'' surgeons, and certain family physicians generally diagnose and treat keloids with occasional help from therapeutic radiologists.' "
What are treatment options for keloids?,"'The methods now available to treat keloids are as follows:'   Corticosteroid injections (intralesional steroids): These are safe but moderately painful. Injections are usually given once every four to eight weeks into the keloids) and usually help flatten keloids; however, steroid injections can also make the flattened keloid redder by stimulating the formation of more superficial blood vessels. (These can be treated using a laser; see below.) The keloid may look better after treatment than it looked to start with, but even the best results leave a mark that looks and feels quite different from the surrounding skin. Surgery: This is risky because cutting a keloid can trigger the formation of a similar or even larger keloid. Some surgeons achieve success by injecting steroids or applying compression (using a specialized pressure device where appropriate) to the wound site for months after cutting away the keloid. Superficial radiation treatment after surgical excision has also been found to be useful. Laser: The pulsed-dye laser can be effective at flattening keloids and making them look less red. Treatment is safe and not very painful, but several treatment sessions may be needed. These may be costly, since such treatments are not generally covered by insurance plans. Silicone gel or sheeting: This involves wearing a sheet of silicone gel on the affected area continuously for months, which is hard to sustain. Results are variable. Some doctors claim similar success with compression dressings made from materials other than silicone. Pressure: Special earrings are available, which when used appropriately, can cause keloids on the earlobe to shrink significantly. Cryotherapy: Freezing keloids with liquid nitrogen may flatten them but often darkens or lightens the site of treatment. Interferon: Interferons are proteins produced by the body's immune systems that help fight off viruses, bacteria, and other challenges. In recent studies, injections of interferon have shown promise in reducing the size of keloids, though it's not yet certain whether that effect will be lasting. Current research is under way using a variant of this method, applying topical imiquimod (Aldara), which stimulates the body to produce interferon. Fluorouracil and bleomycin: Injections of these chemotherapeutic (anti-cancer) agents, alone or together with steroids, have been used for treatment of keloids. Radiation: Some doctors have reported safe and effective use of radiation to treat keloids using a variety of techniques."
Are there home remedies for keloids?,'There are no effective home remedies for keloids.' 
Is keloid prevention possible?,"'The best way to deal with a keloid is not to get one. A person who has had a keloid should not undergo elective or cosmetic skin surgeries or procedures such as piercing. When it comes to keloids, ''prevention'' is crucial, because current treatments leave a lot to be desired.' "
What is the prognosis for keloids?,"'Small keloids can be effectively treated using a variety of methods. Generally, a series of injections of steroids into the problem area is the simplest and safest approach. The patient needs to understand that the keloid will never entirely disappear but is likely to become less symptomatic and flatter. Larger lesions are more difficult to treat.' "
What are abdominal adhesions?,"'Abdominal adhesions are bands of fibrous tissue that can form between abdominal tissues and organs. Normally, internal tissues and organs have slippery surfaces, preventing them from sticking together as the body moves. However, abdominal adhesions cause tissues and organs in the abdominal ''cavity'' to stick together.''The abdominal ''cavity'' is the internal area of the body between the chest and hips that contains the lower part of the ''esophagus'', stomach, small intestine, and ''large intestine''. The ''esophagus'' carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach, which slowly pumps them into the small and large ''intestines''. Abdominal adhesions can kink, twist, or pull the small and large ''intestines'' out of place, causing an intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction, also called a bowel obstruction, results in the partial or complete blockage of movement of food or ''stool'' through the intestines.' "
What causes abdominal adhesions?,"'Abdominal surgery is the most frequent cause of abdominal adhesions. Surgery related causes include''Rarely, abdominal adhesions form without apparent cause.'   cuts involving internal organs handling of internal organs drying out of internal organs and tissues contact of internal tissues with foreign materials, such as gauze, surgical gloves, and stitches blood or blood clots that were not rinsed away during surgery Abdominal adhesions can also result from inflammation not related to surgery, includingappendix ruptureradiation treatmentgynecological infectionsabdominal infections appendix rupture radiation treatment gynecological infections abdominal infections"
How common are abdominal adhesions and who is at risk?," Of patients who undergo abdominal surgery, 93 percent develop abdominal adhesions. Surgery in the lower abdomen and pelvis, including bowel and gynecological operations, carries an even greater chance of abdominal adhesions. Abdominal adhesions can become larger and tighter as time passes, sometimes causing problems years after surgery."
What are the symptoms of abdominal adhesions?,"   In most cases, abdominal adhesions do not cause symptoms. When symptoms are present, chronic abdominal pain is the most common."
Seek help for emergency symptoms,'A complete intestinal obstruction is life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention and often surgery. Symptoms of intestinal obstruction include''severe ''abdominal pain'' or cramping'   nausea vomiting bloating loud bowel sounds abdominal swelling the inability to have a bowel movement or pass gas constipation - a condition in which a person has fewer than three bowel movements a week; the bowel movements may be painful A person with these symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.
What are the complications of abdominal adhesions?,"'Abdominal adhesions can cause intestinal obstruction and female ''infertility'' - the inability to become ''pregnant'' after a year of trying.' Abdominal adhesions can lead to female infertility by preventing fertilized eggs from reaching the uterus, where fetal development takes place. Women with abdominal adhesions in or around their fallopian tubes have an increased chance of ectopic pregnancy - a fertilized egg growing outside the uterus. Abdominal adhesions inside the uterus may result in repeated miscarriages - a pregnancy failure before 20 weeks."
How are abdominal adhesions and intestinal obstructions diagnosed?,"'Abdominal adhesions cannot be detected by tests or seen through imaging techniques such as x rays or ''ultrasound''. Most abdominal adhesions are found during surgery performed to examine the abdomen. However, abdominal x rays, a lower gastrointestinal (GI) series, and ''computerized tomography'' (CT) scans can diagnose intestinal obstructions.'   Abdominal x rays use a small amount of radiation to create an image that is recorded on film or a computer. An x ray is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. An x ray does not require anesthesia. The person will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The x-ray machine is positioned over the abdominal area. The person will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. The person may be asked to change position for additional pictures. A lower GI series is an x-ray exam that is used to look at the large intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. The health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. A laxative or an enema may be used before the test. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves flushing water or laxative into the rectum using a special squirt bottle. For the test, the person will lie on a table while the radiologist inserts a flexible tube into the person’s anus. The large intestine is filled with barium, making signs of underlying problems show up more clearly on x rays. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. The procedure is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. The person will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken."
How are abdominal adhesions and intestinal obstructions treated?,"'Abdominal adhesions that do not cause symptoms generally do not require treatment. Surgery is the only way to treat abdominal adhesions that cause ''pain'', intestinal obstruction, or ''fertility'' problems. More surgery, however, carries the risk of additional abdominal adhesions. People should speak with their health care provider about the best way to treat their abdominal adhesions.''Complete intestinal obstructions usually require immediate surgery to clear the blockage. Most partial intestinal obstructions can be managed without surgery.'  "
How to prevent abdominal adhesions,"'Abdominal adhesions are difficult to prevent; however, certain surgical techniques can minimize abdominal adhesions.''Laparoscopic surgery decreases the potential for abdominal adhesions because several tiny incisions are made in the lower abdomen instead of one large incision. The surgeon inserts a laparoscope - a thin tube with a tiny video camera attache - into one of the small incisions. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor. Patients will usually receive general anesthesia during this surgery.''If laparoscopic surgery is not possible and a large abdominal incision is required, at the end of surgery a special filmlike material can be inserted between organs or between the organs and the abdominal incision. The filmlike material, which looks similar to wax paper and is absorbed by the body in about a week, hydrates organs to help prevent abdominal adhesions.''Other steps taken during surgery to reduce abdominal adhesions include' using starch- and latex-free gloves handling tissues and organs gently shortening surgery time using moistened drapes and swabs occasionally applying saline solution"
Facts you should know about scarlet fever," Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria that results in a rash and fever. Group a beta hemolytic streptococci produce an erythrogenic toxin that causes scarlet fever. The incubation period for scarlet fever is about 12 hours to seven days. Risk factors for scarlet fever include overcrowding, especially with children age 5 to 15 years old and the communal use of utensils, towels, or other substances. The contagious period for scarlet fever ranges from about 12 hours after exposure to the bacteria, even if the individual shows no symptoms, and during the acute phase when the person has a rash and fever; it ends after the fever has gone away for at least 12 hours. The signs and symptoms of scarlet fever include fever of 101 F or higher, a sandpaper-like rash, strawberry-like tongue texture, and other features that are relatively nonspecific such as nausea and vomiting, headache, swollen glands, and body aches. The diagnosis of scarlet fever is usually preliminarily made by the patient's history and physical exam, especially if the person has the typical rash and fever; however, isolation of streptococci from the patient usually provides the definitive diagnosis. The treatment for scarlet fever is antibiotics that are effective against the infecting streptococci. Complications of scarlet fever can include rheumatic fever and kidney problems; other serious problems can occur rarely, including death. The prognosis of scarlet fever, if treated early and effectively, is very good; such treatment usually prevents complications. However, if complications develop, the prognosis decreases depending upon the involvement of other organ systems. It's possible to reduce or prevent the chance of getting scarlet fever by good hand-washing techniques and by not using others utensils, towels, or other personal grooming products. There is no vaccine for humans against scarlet fever."
What is scarlet fever?,"'Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection caused by group A ''Streptococcus'' bacteria. This illness usually occurs in a few people (about 10%) who have ''strep throat'' (streptococcal ''pharyngitis'') and occasionally streptococcal skin infections or even ''wound'' infections. Scarlet fever is also known as scarlatina in the older articles; group A ''Streptococcus'' (for example, ''Streptococcus'' pyogenes'') is often shortened to read as ""''group A strep''"" or group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). Scarlet fever is mainly known for its sunburned-skin-colored sandpaper-like skin rash that is associated with fever.''Outbreaks occur. England reported a 50-year high number of individuals diagnosed with the disease (over 19,206) in 2016.' "
What causes scarlet fever?,"'Group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) bacteria are the cause of scarlet fever. These gram-positive ''coccus''-shaped (elliptically shaped) organisms, while infecting a body site, can produce an erythrogenic (producing a red colored) toxin. This toxin is responsible for causing the sandpaper-like red-colored skin rash. Researchers have shown that about 80% of children who reach age 10 have developed lifelong protective antibodies against the ''Streptococcus'' exotoxin. These bacteria can cause other symptoms and/or diseases such as ''impetigo'', skin desquamation, ''myositis'', acute ''rheumatic fever'' and ''necrotizing fasciitis''.' "
What is the incubation period for scarlet fever?,'The incubation period for scarlet fever has a fairly wide range from about 12 hours to seven days. Individuals are ''contagious'' during this first subclinical or incubation period and during the acute illness. The primary ''strep'' infection is the contagious aspect. The rash itself is not contagious.' 
What are risk factors for scarlet fever?,"'Risk factors for scarlet fever are overcrowded conditions (schools, dormitories, institutional settings). Children 5-15 years of age are the population that is usually seen with scarlet fever, although it can occur in some older children and adults. Scarlet fever is rare in children younger than 2 years old because of maternal antibodies.' "
What is the contagious period for scarlet fever?,"'As stated previously, the contagious period for scarlet fever occurs during both the initial subclinical (before development of symptoms) phase, about 12 hours to seven days after initial contact with the bacteria, and during the acute phase when the person has the rash and fever.' "
What are scarlet fever symptoms and signs?,"'Scarlet fever symptoms'' and signs may include a reddish ''sore throat'', a fever (101 F or above), and a widespread red rash (exanthem) with a sandpaper-like texture, and a tongue that resembles a strawberry (red with small ''bumps'' also termed strawberry tongue). Some patients will have whitish coating on the tongue or the throat and may have ''swollen lymph nodes'' glands, ''headache'', ''abdominal pain'' or discomfort resulting in ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', and/or body aches. The classic description of the rash of scarlet fever has been described as ""goose ''bumps'' (papule) on a sunburned skin"" or ""boiled-lobster"" skin.'  "
How do physicians diagnose scarlet fever?,"""In most cases, the patient's history and physical exam will result in a presumptive diagnosis of scarlet fever. For example, the physical exam may reveal Pastia's signs or Thompson's signs where pink or red lines form in skin creases of the armpits and groin. The lines may form before the rash develops and may remain as pigmented lines after desquamation (skin peeling off). However, a health care professional may obtain a throat culture or swab (or rarely, swabs from a ""'wound'' or other sites of infection) to determine if GABHS are present. Unfortunately, there are many other infections, like ''measles'', that can cause both a skin rash and a fever. Isolation of GABHS usually is enough to confirm the diagnosis of scarlet fever. An infectious disease specialist may be consulted if complications develop. If GABHS is not identified, the symptoms and signs are likely due to another underlying problem.'  "
What is the treatment for scarlet fever?,"'The treatment for scarlet fever is antibiotics that are effective against GABHS. Usually about 10 days of an oral ''penicillin'' medication (for example, ''amoxicillin'') is effective early treatment. Rarely, some patients may need to be treated with a single injection of ''penicillin G benzathine'' (''Bicillin L-A''). This is most commonly indicated for a patient who is unable to retain oral antibiotics. Other effective antibiotics are members of the cephalosporin family (for example, ''cephalexin'' [''Keflex'']). A recent outbreak in China showed GABHS resistance to the common antibiotics used to treat scarlet fever. Antibiotics may prevent complications of scarlet fever such as ''rheumatic fever''.'  "
What are complications of scarlet fever?,"'Complications from scarlet fever may include ''kidney disease'' (termed post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) and rheumatic fever (an inflammatory disease caused by antibody cross-reactivity that the effects the ''heart'', joints, skin, and brain). Rheumatic complications can begin about two to three weeks after the initial infection; children between the ages of 6 and 15 are most susceptible to rheumatic fever development. Glomerular complications may begin about one to two weeks after throat infection or about three to six weeks after ''skin infection'' and usually cause more problems in adults than children.' "
"What is the prognosis of scarlet fever? What are the long-term effects of 
scarlet fever?","'The prognosis for scarlet fever, when treated appropriately with antibiotics, is usually excellent. Patients recover completely and the skin symptoms progressively decrease over several weeks. Untreated scarlet fever has a worse prognosis and before the use of antibiotics, scarlet fever had a mortality (death) rate of about 15%-20%. Currently, the mortality rate is less than 1% because of early recognition and early treatment with antibiotics. In general, appropriately diagnosed and treated scarlet fever results in few if any long-term effects. However, if complications develop for whatever reason, problems that include kidney damage, ''hepatitis'', ''vasculitis'', septicemia, ''congestive heart failure'', and even death may occur.'  "
Is it possible to prevent scarlet fever? Is there a scarlet fever vaccine?,"'The best way to prevent or lessen the chance of getting scarlet fever is hand washing. In addition, avoiding communal use of utensils, towels, or other personal items should be avoided. Transmission of the disease is person to person, usually by droplets, so direct contact with infected individuals should be avoided. Patients who are treated with antibiotics and have had no fever for about 24 hours are considered to be noncontagious. No ''vaccine'' is available for humans to prevent scarlet fever.' "

What are complications of scarlet fever?,"'Complications from scarlet fever may include ''kidney disease'' (termed post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) and rheumatic fever (an inflammatory disease caused by antibody cross-reactivity that the effects the ''heart'', joints, skin, and brain). Rheumatic complications can begin about two to three weeks after the initial infection; children between the ages of 6 and 15 are most susceptible to rheumatic fever development. Glomerular complications may begin about one to two weeks after throat infection or about three to six weeks after ''skin infection'' and usually cause more problems in adults than children.' "
"What is the prognosis of scarlet fever? What are the long-term effects of 
scarlet fever?","'The prognosis for scarlet fever, when treated appropriately with antibiotics, is usually excellent. Patients recover completely and the skin symptoms progressively decrease over several weeks. Untreated scarlet fever has a worse prognosis and before the use of antibiotics, scarlet fever had a mortality (death) rate of about 15%-20%. Currently, the mortality rate is less than 1% because of early recognition and early treatment with antibiotics. In general, appropriately diagnosed and treated scarlet fever results in few if any long-term effects. However, if complications develop for whatever reason, problems that include kidney damage, ''hepatitis'', ''vasculitis'', septicemia, ''congestive heart failure'', and even death may occur.'  "
Is it possible to prevent scarlet fever? Is there a scarlet fever vaccine?,"'The best way to prevent or lessen the chance of getting scarlet fever is hand washing. In addition, avoiding communal use of utensils, towels, or other personal items should be avoided. Transmission of the disease is person to person, usually by droplets, so direct contact with infected individuals should be avoided. Patients who are treated with antibiotics and have had no fever for about 24 hours are considered to be noncontagious. No ''vaccine'' is available for humans to prevent scarlet fever.' "
What is scarlet fever?,"'Scarlet fever'' (also termed ''scarlatina'') is an illness characterized by a bright red ''rash'' that can cover most of the body and is caused by a toxin secreted by group A streptococci, a type of gram-positive ''coccus''-shaped (round) bacteria. ''Scarlet fever'' usually occurs in individuals that have had a ''strep throat'' infection or occasionally in those who have had streptococcal ''skin infection''. The majority of people who get scarlet ''fever'' are between about 5-12 years of age. (It rarely occurs in ''babies'' under 2 years of age.)' "
Is scarlet fever contagious?,"'Scarlet ''fever'' may be ''contagious'' if a person becomes infected with a group A streptococcal bacterial strain that produces the scarlet fever toxin. However, not all people who get group A ''streptococcal infections'' develop scarlet fever; only a small percentage of these patients go on to develop scarlet fever.' "
How will I know if I have scarlet fever?,"'Individuals with scarlet fever usually have some or most of the following symptoms and signs:'""The red rash may develop later than other symptoms (up to about seven days later). The physician can give a clinical diagnosis from the patient's history, physical exam, and possibly a ""'rapid strep test''; in some individuals, a throat culture may be done to determine if ''group A strep'' is the infecting bacteria.' Red rash with a sandpaper feel when touched Fever above 101 F Red, sore throat A ""strawberry-like"" appearance of the tongue Headache, body aches Nausea and/or vomiting Enlarged lymph nodes Some individuals may have whitish coating on the tongue and/or back of the throat"
How is scarlet fever transmitted?,"'The bacterial infection (''strep throat'' or skin infection) that results in scarlet fever is contagious, but some people will get the infection (such as ''strep throat'') without going on to develop scarlet fever. Consequently, scarlet fever spread is the secondary result of the way most group A streptococcal infections are spread -- by direct person-to-person contact (kissing, touching mucus membranes, for example) and by indirect methods such as contaminated eating utensils, cups, and other objects used by infected individuals. However, not all individuals who get group A streptococcal infections will develop scarlet fever.' "
When will I know I am cured of scarlet fever?,"'Scarlet fever can be treated with antibiotics because once the streptococci bacteria are debilitated or killed, they stop producing toxin and the rash will slowly fade away. A medical ''caregiver'' can help diagnose scarlet fever by doing a simple ''strep'' test or, if indicated, can culture the throat to confirm a group A streptococcal infection. Individuals with scarlet fever need to be treated quickly with antibiotics to reduce the chance of developing long-term health problems such as ''rheumatic fever'', ''kidney disease'', ear infections, and other types of infections.' "
When should I contact a physician about scarlet fever?,"'An individual should see a medical caregiver if they have had a recent infection of strep throat and then develop the ''symptoms of scarlet fever'"" (especially a reddish rash on the body). It's important to have a physician evaluate the patient to be sure that appropriate diagnosis and treatment (antibiotics) take place quickly to avoid or reduce the chances of any of the complications of scarlet fever such as organ impairment (of the kidneys, heart, joints, for example).""  "
Facts you should know about scars," Scars occur when tissues have been significantly damaged and repaired. Scars result in changes that alter the physical architecture of normal skin or other tissue. Scars can occur after physical trauma or as part of a disease process. Poorly controlled wound healing can result in thick, unsightly scars that cause symptoms. There is a genetic predisposition in some people to produce thicker, itchy, enlarging scars called keloids. Scarring in areas of increased skin tension or movement tend to be unsightly. When wounds are produced surgically, physicians utilize techniques to minimize scarring."
What is a scar?,"'Scarring is the process by which wounds are repaired. Damage to the deeper layer of the skin, the dermis, is required to produce a scar. Damage to only the ''epidermis'', the most superficial layer of skin, will not always produce a scar. Scars produce a structural change in the deeper layers of the skin which is perceived as an alteration in the architecture of the normal surface features. It is not just a change in skin color. Fetal tissues and mucosal tissues have the ability to heal without producing a scar. Understanding how and why this is possible could lead to better surgical scar outcomes.' "
What are the different types of scars?,"'There is only one type of scar. The appearance of a scar depends on the nature of the wound that produced the damage, the anatomical location of the wound, and a variety of genetic factors that are different for each individual.''A defective healing process can result in a ''keloid'', an unsightly, ''itchy'', thick, red, knobby bump that often continues to enlarge over time. Keloids often are larger than the margins of the original wound.' "
What causes a scar?,'The normal healing process in human tissue results in a scar.' 
What are symptoms and signs of a scar?,'Scars occur at the site of tissue damage and appear as firm red to purple fibrous tissue that over time usually becomes flatter and lighter in color.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose scars?,'Scars are almost always diagnosed by visual inspection. There are a number of rare situations when it may be necessary to examine ''scar tissue'' under the microscope to confirm its true identity. This would require a biopsy of the skin and may require the injection of a local anesthetic. Sometimes other ''skin conditions'' can form in a scar and require a biopsy in order to be diagnosed.' 
What is the treatment for a scar?,"'Since scars are part of the normal healing process, ordinary scars are not treated. Only when superficial scars become cosmetically undesirable do they require treatment. This would include scars in those who are predisposed to develop keloids, as well as scars in anatomical regions known to produce thick scars and scars that produce a significant, unpleasant distortion of adjacent anatomical structures. Thick scars and keloids often flatten out after injections of steroids directly into the fibrous scar tissue. They can respond to the chronic application of pressure and the application of sheets of silicone rubber. Thick scars can be flattened by ''dermabrasion'', which utilizes abrasive devices to sand down elevated scars. Certain types of ''depressed'' scars can be elevated by the injection of a cosmetic skin filler. Certain types of facial scarring respond well to forms of laser treatments. Occasionally, surgical revision of scars can result in a different scar that is much more cosmetically desirable. Since it takes about a year for scars to mature, it is frequently prudent to wait before starting any invasive surgical revisions.'  "
Are there any home remedies to reduce scarring?,"'Good ''wound care'' is important in preventing excessive scarring as well as speeding the healing process. Preventing infection can help prevent unnecessary inflammation which can increase the size of wounds resulting in larger, unsightly scars. It is important to remove crusts (scabs) from wounds gently with a washcloth and soap and water at least twice a day and to keep the wound moist by keeping it covered with petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment, such as ''Neosporin''. Assuming the wound is healing normally, it would not be unreasonable to cover the wound site after it is covered by skin (epithelialized) with silicone rubber 24 hours a day for a month or so. There is medical evidence that this can diminish the thickness of scars. Proprietary products of this type can be purchased without a prescription. There is an ''over-the-counter'' product (Mederma) that may improve the appearance of scars in the short term (first one to two months) but conclusive evidence of efficacy is lacking. This product relies on an extract of onions! The judicious use of cosmetic ''makeup'' can effectively obscure many scars.' "
What is the prognosis of a scar?,"'Scars generally improve in appearance over the first year. So considerations for invasive treatments need to be prudently considered prior to that time. On the other hand, scarring usually involves tissue contraction, so that it is unlikely that scars that pull or twist other anatomical structures, producing unpleasant results, will improve. These should be treated sooner than later.' "
Is it possible to prevent scarring?,"'Scarring is an integral part of the healing process. Assuming the wound does not become infected, physicians plan excisions to minimize the cosmetic defects produced by scars. This can be accomplished by orienting the wound in such a way so that it will not perturb other structures, so that the scar can be camouflaged by hiding in wrinkle lines or near other anatomical structures. It is also important to minimize the tension necessary to close the wound surgically.' "
Does insurance coverage apply to scar treatments?,"""Most medical insurance does not cover cosmetic procedures. If scarring has produced a change that is deemed other than cosmetic, it is reasonable to expect coverage, for example, when scarring is the result of trauma. Occasionally, this question may be open to dispute so it can be helpful to have a physician's office intercede with the carrier prior to performing the procedure."" "
What is Schatzki's ring? What causes it?,"""Schatzki (Schatzki's) ring is described a smooth, benign (non-cancerous), circumferential, and narrow ring of tissue in the lower end of the ""'esophagus'' (the food pipe that connects the mouth to the stomach). Schatzki rings are common and are located just above the junction of the esophagus with the stomach. The cause of Schatzki rings is not clearly understood. Some doctors believe they are caused by long-term damage from reflux of stomach acid (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'', ''GERD'').' "
What are Schatzki's ring symptoms and signs?,"'The majority of these rings cause no symptoms, and people do not know they are there. As the diameter of these rings shrinks; solid, poorly chewed food, for example, steak, turkey, or hotdogs, that stays in chunks can get caught at the level of the ring. This occurs when the diameter of the ring reaches approximately 1 cm (0.4 inches).''Rarely, food becomes impacted (the food cannot pass nor can it be regurgitated). Symptoms of impacted food in the throat include''A flexible endoscope has to be inserted through the mouth into the esophagus to extract the impacted food to relieve the obstruction.'   The person with Schatzki ring then experiences chest pain or sticking sensation in the chest with swallowing (referred to as dysphagia). When the chunk of food passes into the stomach, symptoms subside quickly and the person can resume eating. If the food does not pass into the stomach, some people have to induce regurgitation of the food by sticking their finger in the back of their throat before they can begin eating. chest pain, difficulty swallowing, decreased saliva, and secretion production."
How is Schatzki's ring diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of Schatzki ring can usually be made by barium X-ray examination of the esophagus; however, a narrow ring can be missed on X-ray. In patients with symptoms of ''dysphagia'', doctors usually also order an upper intestinal ''endoscopy'' examination.' Endoscopy is the best way of diagnosing a Schatzki ring. During the endoscopy, a flexible viewing tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus. It allows a direct view of the inner lining of the esophagus and the stomach. The test helps to exclude early cancer, esophagitis, and Barrett's esophagus that also may cause narrowing of the esophagus."
What treatment is for Schatzki's rings? Can they be cured?,"'There is no cure for Schatzki rings. Treatment and management of the condition include procedures that will stretch or ''fracture'' the rings, which will allow solid food to pass through the esophagus more freely.'   Schatzki rings can be stretched or fractured with endoscopes or tapered dilators inserted through the mouth. They also can place deflated balloons across the ring and then inflate them. Occasionally, Schatzki rings may be cut with an electrocautery probe. Rarely, surgery is necessary to treat Schatzki rings."
Facts you should know about schistosomiasis," Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma organisms that can cause acute and chronic infection. Many symptoms of schistosomiasis infection frequently include fever, blood in stools or urine, and abdominal discomfort. The immune response and Schistosoma egg migration through tissues and their deposition in body organs cause the disease. Schistosomiasis has an acute and chronic phase. Health care professionals diagnose schistosomiasis by identifying characteristic eggs in feces, urine, or biopsy samples. Serologic (blood) tests may aid the diagnosis. The antiparasitic drug praziquantel (Biltricide) often effectively treats schistosomiasis, especially in acute phase disease. Chronic schistosomiasis often produces complications in various organ systems (for example, the gastrointestinal system, urinary system, heart, and liver). Currently, there is no vaccine available for schistosomiasis."
What is schistosomiasis?,"'Schistosomiasis is a disease that is caused by parasites (genus ''Schistosoma'') that enter humans by attaching to the skin, penetrating it, and then migrating through the venous system to the portal veins where the parasites produce eggs and eventually, the symptoms of acute or chronic disease (for example, ''fever'', abdominal discomfort, blood in stools). Health officials consider the disease to be a worm infection, or helminthiasis.''Bilharziasis, bilharzia, bilharziosis, and snail ''fever'' or, in the acute form, Katayama ''fever'' are alternate names for schistosomiasis. Theodore Bilharz identified the parasite ''Schistosoma hematobium'' in Egypt in 1851. Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent tropical disease in the world; ''malaria'"" is the first. The disease is found mainly in developing countries in Africa, Asia, South America, the Middle East, and the Caribbean and is considered one of many tropical diseases that can be soil-transmitted (or water-transmitted). In the U.S., it is diagnosed in tourists who have visited these developing countries and in visitors from these countries, or from lab accidents. More than 200,000 people die each year in Sub-Saharan Africa from this infection. The type of snail that is part of the parasite's life cycle (see below) is not endemic (non-endemic) to U.S. freshwater sources in the U.S.""'In 2014, an outbreak occurred in Corsica, France, in people ''swimming'' in the Cavu River. This was the first reported locally acquired ''Schistosoma'' infection in France.'  "
What causes schistosomiasis?,"'Parasites of the genus ''Schistosoma'' (''S. mansoni'', ''S. mekongi'', ''S. intercalatum'', ''S. hematobium'', and ''S. japonicum'') cause the disease. The disease in humans is part of the complicated life cycle of the parasites that is illustrated in the figure below. Humans enter freshwater areas that contain snails that grow ''Schistosoma'' sporocysts that develop into free-''swimming'' cercariae shed by freshwater snails (''Biomphalaria'' and ''Bulinus'"" genus), considered to be an intermediate host. The cercariae can attach to and penetrate the human skin, migrate to blood vessels, and through lung blood capillaries reach the portal blood or vesicular (bladder) blood systems. During this migration, the cercariae change and develop from schistosomula into male and female adult parasitic worms. The worms incorporate human proteins into their surface structures, so most humans produce little or no immune response to the parasites. After parasite mating occurs in the portal or vesicular blood system, egg production occurs. In contrast to the adult parasites, the parasite's eggs stimulate a strong immune response by most humans. Some eggs migrate through the bowel or bladder tissue and are shed in feces or urine to soil or water, while other eggs are swept into the portal blood and lodge in other tissue sites. Eggs shed into urine or feces may reach maturity in freshwater (a hatched egg develops into a miracidium) and complete their life cycle by infecting susceptible snails. In addition, some adult worms may migrate to other organs (for example, eyes or ""'liver''). This life cycle is further complicated by ''S. japonicum'' species that may also infect domesticated and wild animals, which can then serve as another host system. ''S. hematobium'' is the species that usually infects the human bladder tissue, while the other species usually infect the bowel tissue.''The acute and chronic symptoms of schistosomiasis are thought to be mainly due to the egg migration through tissue and the human immune response to the eggs. Chronic symptoms are mainly due to eggs that are not shed from the body. Complications (for example, hepatomegaly or ''enlarged liver'' and ''bladder cancer'') related to the disease are thought to occur due to long-term exposure to the highly antigenic eggs.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of schistosomiasis?,"'Although a few patients may have minor skin irritation when the cercariae enter the skin, most people do not develop symptoms until the eggs develop (about one to two months after initial skin penetration). Then, fever, ''chills'', ''cough'', and muscle aches can begin within one to two months of infection. However, most people have no symptoms at this early phase of infection. Unfortunately, a few patients develop acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) during this one- to two-month period, and their symptoms resemble those for ''serum sickness'' and are as follows:''The majority of people who develop chronic schistosomiasis have symptoms develop months or years after the initial exposure to the parasites. The following is a list of most symptoms associated with chronic schistosomiasis. Patients usually have a few of these symptoms.'   Fever Abdominal pain (liver/spleen area) Bloody diarrhea or blood in the stools Cough Malaise Headache Rash Body aches Abdominal pain Abdominal swelling (ascites) Bloody diarrhea or blood in the stools Blood in the urine and painful urination Shortness of breath and coughing Weakness Chest pain and palpitations Seizures Paralysis Mental status changes Lesions on the vulva or the perianal area"
How do health care professionals diagnose schistosomiasis?,"'The presumptive diagnosis of schistosomiasis is based on the medical ''caregiver'""'s history and physical examination of the patient. It is important to know that a person has inhabited or visited areas of the world where the disease is endemic, especially if the person has had skin exposure to freshwater lakes and streams. If the patient has that history and has symptoms that are described above, a presumptive diagnosis may be made. However, because symptoms of schistosomiasis resemble those of ""'serum sickness'' and other diseases, definitive diagnostic tests are usually required. Thick fecal smears and urine concentration tests (for example, the Kato-Katz test) are used to determine if any ''Schistosoma'' eggs are present. If eggs are found, the patient is definitively diagnosed with schistosomiasis. In addition, most eggs from each species are shaped differently so it is possible to determine which ''Schistosoma'' is infecting the patient. Sometimes the definitive diagnosis is made by examination of biopsy samples of tissue, when the eggs are visualized in the infected tissue.''Blood tests and, more recently, ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') tests can help confirm the diagnosis, but positive results may only indicate past exposure. However, these tests are not usually positive until the patient has been infected for about six to eight weeks because it takes time for the eggs to develop and stimulate the human immune response. Each ''Schistosoma'' species has different egg proteins that can be detected by antibody tests. The ''PCR'' test is available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention''.''Many other tests and procedures may be necessary to establish the diagnosis, especially if no eggs are found in the feces or urine, which is often the situation in chronic schistosomiasis. ''Colonoscopy'', ''cystoscopy'', ''endoscopy'', and ''liver biopsy'' are all methods that can be used to obtain tissue biopsy material. In addition, ''ultrasound'', chest ''X-rays'', ''CT scan'', ''MRI'', and echocardiograms may be used to determine the extent of the infection in various organ systems. Most physicians will run additional blood tests (''complete blood count'' [''CBC''], ''liver function'' tests, renal function tests) to determine if organs have been damaged by the parasites.' "
What is the treatment for schistosomiasis?,"'Currently, the drug used in most people is ''praziquantel'' (''Biltricide'""); however, it only is effective against adult worms and does not affect eggs or immature worms. Treatment with this drug is simple and its dose is based on the patient's weight with two doses given on one day. However, the drug causes rapid disintegration of the worm which, in turn, allows the human immune system to attack the parasite. This immune response can cause localized reactions, which may increase the patient's symptoms. ""'Corticosteroids'' are often used to reduce the symptoms of this reaction. Unfortunately, this response limits the use of praziquantel. Praziquantel and oxaminquine or artemether are used by some clinicians early in infections, or to treat individuals infected with both ''malaria'' and schistosomes, respectively.''Ocular'' schistosomiasis should not be treated with this praziquantel. Other organs with heavy parasite infections may not function well and require supportive care until the hyperimmune response abates after drug administration. Other ''drugs'' (oxamniquine, metrifonate, artemisinins, and trioxolanes) have been used in some patients but have limited effectiveness. New ''drugs'' are in development. Infectious disease specialists, ophthalmologists, and surgeons may treat someone with a schistosomiasis infection.''Surgical care may include removal of ''tumor'' masses, ligation of esophageal varices, shunt surgeries, and granuloma removal.'  "
When should people with schistosomiasis seek medical care?,"'People associated with freshwater sources in areas where ''Schistosoma'' are endemic should seek medical care if they develop symptoms of acute schistosomiasis (see above, especially for ''abdominal pain'', blood in stools or urine, and fever). Those with diagnosed chronic schistosomiasis should seek medical care if their chronic symptoms increase (especially abdominal ''pain'', ''shortness of breath'', bloody ''diarrhea'' or ''bloody urine'', ''seizures'', or mental-status changes). Anyone with undiagnosed schistosomiasis who develops symptoms listed above should seek medical care and inform the caregivers that they have been exposed to freshwater sources in areas where the disease is endemic either as residents of the areas or as a tourist.' "
What are the complications of schistosomiasis?,"'The complications that may develop with schistosomiasis usually occur in individuals harboring many parasites and eggs, especially when the eggs and parasites have migrated to other organs. In general, complications usually involve the cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems (CNS), the liver and spleen, and urinary tracts along with the liver and spleen. Some of the major complications are ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), ''seizures'', ''bacterial infections'', urinary obstruction, organ damage or destruction, and death.' "
Is it possible to prevent schistosomiasis?,"""Theoretically, the disease can be prevented by avoiding all human skin contact with freshwater sources where schistosomiasis and the snails that complete their life cycle are endemic. However, this is unlikely to occur in most developing countries. Disease control officials' reports of attempts to decrease or eliminate snails from some freshwater sources using molluscicides (snail bait) have cited a decrease in the number of people infected, but this often requires repeat treatments of contaminated environments and some efforts have been stopped because of limited success.""'Unfortunately, people who are treated and have no symptoms of the disease can easily become reinfected if exposed to the cercariae; as the human immune response to this disease often is not able to prevent reinfection. There is no commercially available ''vaccine'' against ''Schistosoma'', but research is ongoing and perhaps a vaccine may be available in a few years.''Children of school age are at risk or at high risk for the disease because they often have skin and bare ''feet'' exposed to contaminated water and soil.' "
What is the prognosis (outcome) for schistosomiasis?,"'Early antiparasitic treatment, especially with acute schistosomiasis, may allow people to recover completely without developing chronic disease. A few people get the disease but recover completely. Even patients with early chronic disease can improve with drug treatment. However, the prognosis is worse for people who have other health problems (for example, with a suppressed immune system, ''HIV'', or chronic infections such as ''malaria'') and subsequently get infected with ''Schistosoma''. People with chronic disease may improve with careful antiparasitic drug treatments and symptomatic treatment of the complications associated with schistosomiasis.' "
Facts about schizoaffective disorder," Schizoaffective disorder is a chronic condition characterized by both psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) and mood problems. There are two kinds of schizoaffective disorder: bipolar and depressive. There is no known single specific cause for schizoaffective disorder. Schizoaffective disorder symptoms and signs include those of schizophrenia in addition to a manic episode or a major depressive episode. The typical treatment for schizoaffective disorder involves the individual taking an antipsychotic drug and possibly a mood stabilizer in addition to psychoeducation. For people who do not respond to the typical treatments, some may respond to non-medication medical treatments like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)."
What is schizoaffective disorder?,"'Schizoaffective disorder is a ''mental illness'' that involves persistent psychotic symptoms, like hallucinations or delusions, co-occurring with the major mood episode of depressive, manic, or mixed episodes. Jacob Kasanin first used the term ''schizoaffective'' in 1933; the term appeared in every edition of the ''mental health'' diagnostic manual, called the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM''), since 1952. Statistics on how often this condition occurs range from 0.32% in the general United States population up to as much as 9% of psychiatrically hospitalized people. Schizoaffective disorder is thought to occur at least as often as ''schizophrenia'' and less often than ''bipolar disorder''.' "
"What are symptoms 
and signs of schizoaffective disorder?","'The symptoms and signs of schizoaffective disorder include those of ''schizophrenia'' combined with major depressive disorder and/or a manic episode. ''Symptoms of schizophrenia'' may include the following:''Symptoms of a major depressive episode might include the following:''The following symptoms may characterize a manic episode:''Schizoaffective disorder is associated with schizophrenia-like impairments in memory, changing attention, thinking abstractly, and planning. However, people with schizoaffective disorder tend to have better cognitive functioning versus people with schizophrenia. In terms of brain structure, individuals with schizoaffective disorder tend to have smaller brain volumes compared to the general population, particularly in certain areas of the brain.'   Hallucinations, like hearing voices, seeing, feeling, tasting, or smelling things that are not there Delusions are ways of thinking with no basis in reality. Types of delusions include paranoid/persecutory, religious, erotic, grandiose (for example, false beliefs of superiority), jealous, body (somatic), or mixed (more than one) types and often involve the sufferer believing that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning (for example, the person with this symptom may believe that people on television are specifically talking to him or her directly). Delusions may be in line with the individual’s mood (known as mood-congruent, as grandiosity may be with mania) or out of line with a person’s mood (known as mood-incongruent, as grandiosity may be with depression). Disorganized speech Severely disorganized or catatonic behaviors, like rigid muscles, not speaking (mutism), purposeless moving, repeating what others say (echolalia), or adopting unusual body postures Negative symptoms, like the decrease or absence of speech (alogia), a limited range of movement (avolition) or emotion Depressed or irritable mood most of every day for two weeks or more in a row Inability to feel pleasure Appetite changes Significant weight loss in the absence of healthy dieting Significant weight gain Sleeping too little or too much Restlessness or moving less (psychomotor agitation or retardation, respectively) Low energy most days Feelings of worthlessness or guilt/self-blame Trouble concentrating Social isolation Hopelessness Thoughts of death, thoughts, plans, or attempts at self-destructiveness/self-harm or suicide Excessive self-esteem or grandiosity Expansive mood/euphoria (for example, feeling excessively happy or silly) Racing thoughts Rapid, frenzied/pressured speaking that may be off topic (tangential) Decreased need for sleep Sudden increases in energy Impulsivity Increase in goal-oriented activities Engaging in activities that may cause problems (for example, excessive spending or sexual activity)"
What are the different types of schizoaffective disorder?,'There are two types of schizoaffective disorder: bipolar type and depressive type. A characteristic of the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder is that the individual has at least one manic episode. The depressive type of this illness involves having only major ''depressive episodes'' as the mood disorder part of the illness.' 
What are causes and risk factors for schizoaffective disorder?,"'As with the vast majority of mental disorders, there is no specific, well-understood cause for schizoaffective disorder. Two-thirds of people who develop the illness are women. An immediate family (first-degree relatives) history of any mental illness, especially schizoaffective disorder, ''bipolar disorder'', or schizophrenia is a risk factor for schizoaffective disorder. Children born prematurely who were also small for their stage of development (gestational age) are also at risk for developing schizoaffective disorder, ''depression'', or ''bipolar disorder''. Developing schizoaffective disorder or another psychotic illness is more than twice as likely in children who suffer significant adversity like ''bullying'', abuse, neglect, or parental death, especially by ''suicide'', during that time of their lives.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose schizoaffective disorder?,"""To diagnose schizoaffective disorder, one first has to rule out any medical condition that may be the actual cause or contributing factor for the mood and behavioral changes. Once medical causes have been looked for and not found, a mental health professional should consider a mental illness such as schizoaffective disorder. The diagnosis will best be made by a licensed mental health professional, like a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, psychiatric nurse, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant, who can evaluate the patient and carefully sort through a variety of mental illnesses that might look similarly upon the initial examination. Such illnesses include any other thought disorder, like schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including schizophrenia, delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, and ""'schizotypal personality disorder'', as well as any disorder in which both mood episodes and psychosis may occur or appear to occur, like ''borderline personality disorder'', ''post-traumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), ''dissociative identity disorder'', bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or ''major depression'' with psychotic features.'""The mental health professional will examine someone with suspected schizoaffective disorder in an office or in the emergency department. The practitioner's role is to ensure that the patient doesn't have any medical problems, including active ""'drug use'' or exposure to environmental toxins, since symptoms of those conditions can mimic the thought disorder and ''mood swings'"" of schizoaffective disorder. The health care professional takes the patient's history and either performs, or refers the person for, a physical examination. A physician will perform tests, sometimes including a ""'computerized tomography'' (CT) scan of the brain. Physical findings can relate to the symptoms associated with schizoaffective disorder or the medications the person may be taking.' "
What are criteria for diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder?,"'According to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5''), an individual must meet the following diagnostic criteria in order for a mental health professional to diagnose schizoaffective disorder:' An uninterrupted period of illness that includes either a major depressive disorder or a manic episode along with at least two active symptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, severely disorganized or catatonic behaviors, negative symptoms like decreased emotional expression or movement) Delusions (for example, paranoia, erotomania, grandiosity, delusional jealousy, persecutory or somatic delusions) or hallucinations occur for at least two weeks without major depressive or manic symptoms at some time during the illness. The symptoms of major mood disorders occur for most of the duration of the illness. The illness is not the result of a medical condition or the effects of alcohol, other drugs of abuse, a medication or exposure to an environmental toxin."
What is the treatment for schizoaffective disorder? Are there home remedies for schizoaffective disorder?,"'Given the potentially serious impact that schizoaffective disorder has on the lives of sufferers, home remedies are not appropriate to address its symptoms. Treatment for people living with this condition tends to be symptom-based rather than distinctly different based on the illness itself. In terms of medication treatment, individuals with the bipolar type of the disorder seem to respond best to treatment with an antipsychotic drug combined with a mood-stabilizer drug or treatment with an antipsychotic drug alone. For people with the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder, combining an antipsychotic medication with an ''antidepressant'' medication tends to work best. Since consistent treatment is important for the best outcome, psychoeducation of the person with the illness and their loved ones, as well as using long-acting medications can be important aspects of their care.'""For people who don't respond to multiple trials of treatment, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be an option. Treatment for people who suffer from both schizoaffective disorder and a substance-abuse disorder (dual diagnosis) tends to be most effective when health care professionals address both conditions.""'Antipsychotic medications are effective in treating acute psychosis and reducing the risk of future psychotic episodes. The treatment of schizoaffective disorder thus has two main phases: an acute phase, when higher doses of medication might be necessary in order to alleviate psychotic and severe mood disorder symptoms, followed by a maintenance phase, which could be lifelong. During the maintenance phase, physicians gradually reduce the medication dosage to the minimum required to prevent further episodes. If symptoms reappear on a lower dosage, a temporary increase in medication dosage may help prevent a relapse.''Even with continued treatment, some patients have relapses. By far, though, the highest relapse rates occur when medication is discontinued. Most patients experience substantial improvement when receiving antipsychotic agents. Some patients, however, do not respond to medications, and a few may seem not to need them. Since it is difficult to predict which patients will fall into what groups, it is essential to have long-term follow-up, so that a mental health professional can adjust the treatment and address any problems in a timely manner.''Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of schizoaffective disorder. They have been available since the mid-1950s, and although antipsychotics do not cure the illness, they greatly reduce the symptoms and allow the patient to function better, both long-term and on a day-to-day basis, have better quality of life, and enjoy an improved outlook. The choice and dosage of medication is individualized and is best done by a well-trained health care professional experienced in treating severe mental illness. Researchers discovered the first antipsychotic by accident and then used it for schizophrenia. This was ''chlorpromazine'' (''Thorazine''); medications such as ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''), ''fluphenazine'' (''Prolixin''), ''thiothixene'' (''Navane''), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), perphenazine (Trilafon), ''loxapine'' (''Loxitane''), and ''thioridazine'' (Mellaril) followed. These medications have become known as ""neuroleptics"" because, although effective in treating positive symptoms (for example, acute symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, loose associations, ambivalence, or emotional lability), they can also alleviate severe ''anxiety'' that people with schizoaffective disorder may suffer. However, they cause side effects, many of which affect the neurologic (nervous) system. Since 1989, researchers have introduced a new class of antipsychotics (atypical antipsychotics). At clinically effective doses, very few of these neurological side effects, which often affect the extrapyramidal nerve tracts (which control such things as muscular rigidity, painful ''muscle spasms'', restlessness, or ''tremors'') are observed.''The first of the new class, ''clozapine'' (''Clozaril''), is not associated with extrapyramidal side effects, but it can produce other side effects, including a possible decrease in the number of white blood cells to the point of being dangerous, so the blood needs to be monitored every week during the first six months of treatment and then every two weeks to detect this side effect early if it occurs. Other atypical antipsychotics include ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel'' and Seroquel-XR), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), paliperidone (Invega), lurasidone (''Latuda''), and brexpiprazole (Rexulti). The use of these medications has allowed successful treatment and release back to their homes and the community for many people suffering from schizoaffective disorder. That some neuroleptic medications can either be injected into muscle (for example, haloperidol, fluphenazine, risperidone, and aripiprazole), in liquid form (like haloperidol, fluphenazine, Risperdal), and aripiprazole), or melt once placed under the tongue (for example, asenapine) can further help the schizoaffective disorder sufferer maintain critical compliance with their care.''Although more effective and better tolerated, the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs is also associated with side effects, and current medical practice is developing better ways of understanding and minimizing these effects, identifying people at risk, and monitoring for the emergence of complications.''Mood-stabilizer medications like ''lithium'' (''Lithobid''), ''valproic acid'' or ''divalproex'' (''Stavzor'' or ''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'', Tegretol XR, ''Equetro'', ''Carbatrol''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'') can be useful in treating active (acute) symptoms of mania as well as preventing return of such symptoms in schizoaffective disorder. Some studies have also found that ''oxcarbazepine'' (''Trileptal'') may also be a helpful addition to other medications that treat schizoaffective disorder. These medications may take a bit longer to work compared to the neuroleptic medications, and some (for example, lithium, divalproex, and carbamazepine) require monitoring of medication blood levels, while some can be associated with ''birth defects'' when taken by ''pregnant'' women. Since people with schizoaffective disorder often have ''depression'' as part of the illness, medications that address that symptom may be of great benefit, as well. Physicians often prescribe serotonergic medications like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil'' or ''Pexeva''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), vilazodone (Viibryd), and ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix) because of their effectiveness and low incidence of side effects. Other often-prescribed antidepressant medications for treatment of schizoaffective disorder include ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), and ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'').''Most of these medications take several weeks to take effect. Patience is required if the dose needs to be adjusted, the specific medication changed, or another medication added. In order to be able to determine whether an antipsychotic is effective or not, patients should try it for at least six to eight weeks (or even longer with clozapine).''In spite of successful antipsychotic treatment, many patients with schizoaffective disorder have difficulty with maintaining motivation, self-care and other activities of daily living, relationships, and communication skills. Therefore, psychosocial treatments are also important, and health care professionals have developed many useful treatment approaches to complement the medications in assisting people suffering from this illness:''As with other schizophrenia spectrum and other ''psychotic disorders'', people with schizoaffective disorder who do not receive enough relief of psychotic symptoms (like hallucinations or delusions) from medication and psychotherapy treatments may benefit from non-medication medical interventions like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or electroconvulsive treatment (ECT). TMS is a treatment that involves applying a magnetic field through the ''scalp'' to a small area of the brain to provide repeated stimulation. Patients usually complete the treatment course over about six weeks, with each treatment session taking about 20 minutes. TMS tends to have few negative effects and is considered quite safe.''ECT involves the use of electrical current passed through the brain using electrodes on one side of the brain through the scalp for inducing ''seizures''. Health care professionals perform ECT while the patient is sedated under generalized anesthesia. While its effectiveness in treating psychotic symptoms when used alone does not seem to be established, it is helpful when used in addition to prescribed antipsychotic medication. Due to side effects of decreased memory and risks associated with generalized anesthesia, ECT is a treatment of last resort for schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders'   Individual psychotherapy: This involves regular therapy sessions between just the patient and a therapist focused on past or current problems, thoughts, feelings, or relationships. Thus, via contact with a trained professional, people with schizoaffective disorder become able to understand more about the illness, to learn about themselves, and to handle the problems of their daily lives. The goals of therapy often include helping the person with schizoaffective disorder become better able to distinguish between what is real and, by contrast, what is not and to acquire beneficial problem-solving skills. Rehabilitation: Rehabilitation may include job and vocational counseling, problem solving, social-skills training, nutrition, and education in money management. Thus, patients learn skills required to live with the illness through successful reintegration into their community following discharge from the hospital and to minimize or eliminate the need for psychiatric hospitalizations. Family psychoeducation and family therapy: Research has consistently shown that people with schizoaffective disorder who have involved families with an understanding of their illness have a better prognosis than those who battle the condition alone. Self-help groups: Outside support for family members of those with schizoaffective disorder often is necessary and desirable."
What are complications of schizoaffective disorder?,"'There are a number of potential complications of schizoaffective disorder. ''Obesity'', ''diabetes'', and physical inactivity are examples of medical problems that disproportionately affect people with this and other severe mental illnesses. Between 46%-50% of people with a psychotic disorder like schizoaffective disorder have a substance-abuse disorder at some time in their life, most commonly ''nicotine'', followed by alcohol and ''marijuana'' abuse. There is research indicating that about one-third of people who suffer from either schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia have attempted suicide. Suicide attempts seem to occur about four years after the first-time psychosis occurs and about seven years after the onset of the first major depressive episode for those who had a history of major ''depression''. Even in the absence of depression, people with a psychotic disorder like schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia are at higher risk for having ''suicidal thoughts'' or attempts.' "
Is it possible to prevent schizoaffective disorder?,"'Once schizoaffective disorder has occurred, people can best prevent future episodes by receiving consistent treatment, including medication and psychosocial treatment of their symptoms.' "
What is the prognosis of schizoaffective disorder?,"""The prognosis of schizoaffective disorder can be challenging. Some studies indicate that about 47% of people with this illness or schizophrenia are in remission after five years, and about one-quarter of individuals have appropriate social functioning for two years or more. The prognosis for people with schizoaffective disorder tends to depend on how well the person was functioning before the illness began, the individual's compliance with prescribed medication to treat the illness, the number of illness episodes the person has, how persistent their psychotic symptoms are, their level of cognitive functioning, as well as how much the sufferer is emotionally supported by loved ones. Overall, however, individuals who suffer from schizoaffective disorder tend to have psychotic symptoms for a longer time before being treated and to have a more difficult course compared to those with bipolar disorder. Whether an individual suffers from schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia, they are more likely to have more frequent, troubling hallucinations and ""'anxiety'', as well as more difficulty attending work regularly over time compared to people without those illnesses.'

Facts you should know about schizophrenia," Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, debilitating mental illness that affects about 1% of the population -- more than 2 million people in the United States alone. With the sudden onset of severe psychotic symptoms, the individual is said to be experiencing acute psychosis. Psychotic means out of touch with reality or unable to separate real from unreal experiences. There is no known single cause of schizophrenia. As discussed later, it appears that genetic and other biological factors produce a vulnerability to schizophrenia, with environmental factors contributing to different degrees in different individuals. There are a number of various schizophrenia treatments. Given the complexity of this disorder, the major questions about the illness (its cause or causes, prevention, and treatment) are unlikely to be resolved in the near future. The public should beware of those offering ""the cure"" for (or ""the cause"" of) schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is one of the psychotic, also called thought-disordered, mental disorders and affects a person's thoughts, behaviors, and social functioning. Symptoms of schizophrenia may includedelusions,hallucinations,catatonia,negative symptoms, and/ordisorganized speech or behavior. delusions, hallucinations, catatonia, negative symptoms, and/or disorganized speech or behavior. While schizophrenia used to be divided into different types of the disorder, like paranoid and undifferentiated forms, it is now considered to have various symptoms of one inclusive disorder. Children as young as 6 years of age can be found to have all the schizophrenia symptoms as their adult counterparts and to continue to have those symptoms into adulthood. Although the term schizophrenia has only been in use since 1908, its symptoms have been described throughout written history. Schizophrenia is considered to be the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental risk factors. Health care professionals diagnose schizophrenia by gathering comprehensive medical, family, mental health, and social/cultural information. The practitioner will also either perform a physical examination or request that the person's primary care doctor perform one. The medical evaluation will usually include lab tests. In addition to providing treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis, practitioners attempt to determine the presence of other mental illnesses that may co-occur with schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia are at increased risk of having a number of medical problems, other mental health conditions, committing suicide or engaging in other self-harm, and otherwise dying earlier than people without this disorder. Medications that systematic reviews of published studies (meta-analyses) have found to be most effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are first- and second-generation antipsychotics. Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia include education of family members, assertive community treatment (ACT), substance-abuse treatment, social-skills training, supported employment, cognitive behavioral therapy, and weight management. The use of repetitive transient magnetic stimulation (rTMS), cognitive remediation, peer-to-peer interventions, weight-management therapies, and continued medication refinement are current topics for research."
What is schizophrenia?,"'Sometimes colloquially but inaccurately referred to as ''split personality disorder'', schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, debilitating mental illness. It affects about 1% of the general population, corresponding to more than 2 million people in the United States alone. Other statistics about schizophrenia include that it affects men about one and a half times more commonly than women. While the first episode of schizophrenia tends to occur from 18-25 years of age for men, the age of onset for women peaks initially from 25-30 years of age and again at about 40 years of age. People who experience the first episode of this mental illness after the age of 40 years are considered to have late-onset schizophrenia.'""Schizophrenia is one of the psychotic mental disorders and is characterized by symptoms of thought, behavior, and social problems. The thought problems associated with schizophrenia are described as psychosis, in that the person's thinking is completely out of touch with reality at times. For example, the sufferer may hear voices, smell odors, detect tastes, see people that are in no way present, or feel like bugs are crawling on their skin when there are none. The individual with this thought disorder may also have disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, physically rigid or lax behavior (catatonia), significantly decreased behaviors or feelings, as well as delusions, which are defined as ideas that have no basis in reality (for example, the individual might experience ""'paranoia'"", in that he or she thinks others are plotting against them when they are not; a false belief of superiority, that thoughts are not one's own or that ordinary events have a special and personal meeting). While compulsive behaviors and obsessional thinking are not included as part of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, these symptoms occur in many people with this disorder.""'Given that an individual can have various predominant symptoms of schizophrenia at different times as well as at the same time, the most recent ''Diagnostic Manual for Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-5'') ''has'' done away with what used to be described as five types of schizophrenia.''There are five types of schizophrenia. They are categorized by the types of symptoms the person exhibits when they are assessed:'   Paranoid schizophrenia Disorganized schizophrenia Catatonic schizophrenia Undifferentiated schizophrenia Residual schizophrenia"
How common is schizophrenia in children?,"'Although there have been fewer studies on schizophrenia in children compared to adults, researchers are finding that children as young as 6 years of age can be found to have all the symptoms of their adult counterparts and to continue to have those symptoms into adulthood.'  "
What is the history of schizophrenia?,"'The word ''schizophrenia'' has only been in use since about 1908, attributed to psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler. It was deemed a separate mental illness in 1887 by Emil Kraepelin. The positive, disorganized symptoms of psychosis were called hebephrenia. Despite that relatively recent history, it has been described throughout written history. Ancient Egyptian, Hindu, Chinese, Greek, and Roman writings described symptoms similar to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. During medieval times, schizophrenia, like other illnesses, was often viewed as evidence of the sufferer being possessed by spirits or having evil powers.''A number of accomplished individuals suffer from schizophrenia. The film ''A Beautiful Mind'' describes the life of John Nash, a noted scientist, and his struggles with what was previously called paranoid schizophrenia. The film ''The Soloist'' explores the challenges faced by Juilliard-trained musician Nathaniel Ayers as a result of schizophrenia. Despite those prominent portrayals of people with schizophrenia, this condition, like most mental illnesses, usually remains shrouded in secrecy and shame.' "
What are schizophrenia causes? Is schizophrenia hereditary?,"'One frequently asked question about schizophrenia is if it is hereditary. As with most other mental disorders, schizophrenia is not directly passed from one generation to another genetically, and there is no single specific cause for this illness. Rather, it is the result of a complex group of genetic and other biological vulnerabilities, as well as psychological and environmental risk factors. Biologically, it is thought that people who have abnormalities in the brain neurochemical ''dopamine'' and lower brain matter in some areas of the brain are at higher risk for developing the condition. Other brain issues that are thought to predispose people to developing schizophrenia include abnormalities in the connections between different areas of the brain, called default mode network connectivity. Recent research is emerging that implicates potential abnormalities in the transmission of the brain neurochemical glutamate as a risk factor for having schizophrenia.''Schizophrenia is thought to have a significant but not solely genetic component. People who have immediate family members (first-degree relatives) with psychosis are more vulnerable to developing schizophrenia compared to people who do not have such a family history. Genetically, schizophrenia and ''bipolar disorder'' have much in common, in that the two disorders share a number of the same risk genes. However, the fact is that both illnesses also have some genetic factors that are unique. There are some genetic commonalities with schizophrenia and ''epilepsy'', as well.''Environmentally, the risks of developing schizophrenia can even occur before birth. For example, the risk of schizophrenia is increased in individuals whose father is of advanced age or whose mother was malnourished or had one of certain infections during ''pregnancy''. Difficult life circumstances during childhood, like the early loss of a parent, parental poverty, ''bullying'', witnessing ''domestic violence''; being the victim of emotional, sexual, or physical abuse or of physical or emotional neglect; and insecure attachment have been associated with increased risks of developing this illness. Using ''drugs'', particularly ''marijuana'' (cannabis), ''amphetamines'', and hallucinogens, has been found to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. Factors like recent migration, being discriminated against, and how well represented an ethnic group is in a neighborhood can also be a risk or protective factor for developing schizophrenia in the long term. For example, some research indicates that ethnic minorities may be more at risk for developing this disorder if there are fewer members of the ethnic group to which the individual belongs in their neighborhood.' "
What are schizophrenia symptoms and signs?,"'According to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM''), symptoms of schizophrenia include the following:''Prior to the development of the full-blown disorder, people who go on to develop schizophrenia often exhibit subtler and/or less specific symptoms, also called prodromal symptoms. Some characteristics of prodromal schizophrenia are thought to include slowness in activity and thought, lower cognitive functioning, including ''memory loss'', disorientation, and mental ''confusion'""; abnormal speech, including circumstantial, vague, or stereotyped speech. Individuals suffering from the prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia may exhibit odd ideas that have not reached the level of being delusions, like feeling detached from themselves, having beliefs that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning or a belief that their thoughts aren't their own. People with prodromal schizophrenia also tend to have mood problems, like general discontent, inappropriate emotional responses, fear, mistrust, hostility, anger, ""'aggression'', excitability, ''agitation'', and inability to feel pleasure in activities they used to enjoy; ''social isolation'', the self-centeredness that borders on narcissism, and other problems socializing.'   Delusions are beliefs that have no basis in reality. Types of delusions include erotic, grandiose (for example, religious or false belief or superiority), jealous, persecutory, physical (somatic), mixed, and nonspecific. Hallucinations: hearing (for example, hearing voices), seeing, feeling (for example, feeling like bugs are crawling on the skin), smelling, or tasting things that have no basis in reality Disorganized speech: incoherent or often grossly off-topic (derailed) speech Disorganized behaviors Inhibition of facial expressions and/or a lack of emotional responsiveness Catatonic behaviors: difficulty moving, resistance to moving, hyperactivity, repetitive or otherwise abnormal movements, and/or nonsense word repetition or of what others say or do Self-neglect, poor grooming, and lack of good hygiene Lack of speech Apathy/lack of motivation"
What professionals diagnose and treat schizophrenia? Are there particular tests that assess schizophrenia?,"""As is true with virtually any mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has schizophrenia. Therefore, health care professionals like psychiatrists or other psychiatric medication prescribers, clinical psychologists or primary care providers diagnose this illness by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information. Patients tend to benefit when the practitioner performs a systematic review of their client's entire life and background. Examples of this include the person's gender, sexual orientation, cultural, religious and ethnic background, socioeconomic status, family, and other social relationships. The symptom sufferer might be asked to fill out a self-test that the professional will review if the person being evaluated is able to complete it.""""The practitioner will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical assessment will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has a medical condition or has been exposed to certain medications (for example, amphetamines like ""'methylphenidate'' [''Ritalin'' or ''Concerta''] or ''amphetamine and dextroamphetamine'' [''Adderall''] in the treatment of ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' or ''corticosteroids'' for the treatment of severe ''asthma'') that might produce psychological symptoms.''In asking questions about mental health symptoms, mental health professionals are often exploring if the individual suffers from hallucinations or delusions, ''depression'' and/or ''manic'' (for example, excessive anger or elevated mood, inappropriate emotional responses, rapid, pressured, and/or frenzied speaking, a lack of behavioral restraint, overexcitement, decreased need for ''sleep'') symptoms as occurs in ''bipolar disorder'' or ''schizoaffective disorder'', ''anxiety'', ''substance abuse'', as well as some personality disorders (like ''schizotypal personality disorder'') and developmental disorders (for example, ''autism'' spectrum disorders including the condition that was formerly called ''Asperger disorder''). How long symptoms occur is a factor in determining diagnosis. For example, psychosis sufferers whose symptoms resolve in no more than a month may qualify for the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder rather than schizophrenia. Since some of the symptoms of schizophrenia can also occur in other psychiatric illnesses, the mental health screening is to assess if the individual suffers from ''schizoaffective disorder'' or other psychotic disorder, depressive disorder, ''bipolar disorder'', an ''anxiety disorder'', a personality disorder, or a substance-abuse/drug-induced psychosis (for example, marijuana, ''cocaine'', amphetamines, or psychedelic drugs).''Any disorder that is associated with bizarre behavior, mood, or thinking, like another psychotic disorder, ''borderline personality disorder'' or ''dissociative identity disorder'' (DID), previously called ''multiple personality disorder'' (MPD), may be particularly challenging to distinguish from schizophrenia. However, people with DID often suffer from feeling detached from oneself, as well as what looks like ''amnesia'"" for their dissociative episodes, which does not tend to be a characteristic of schizophrenia. In order to assess the person's current emotional state, health care professionals perform a mental-status examination, as well. In addition to providing treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis, determining the presence of mental health conditions that may co-occur (be comorbid) with schizophrenia is important in improving the life of schizophrenia sufferers. For example, people with schizophrenia are at increased risk of having a substance-abuse, depressive, or ""'anxiety'' disorder and committing ''suicide''.' "
What are treatments for schizophrenia and the side effects of those treatments?,"'Given the seriousness and chronic nature of schizophrenia, self-care without also getting treatment by a professional or home remedies are not deemed appropriate treatment for this illness. There is currently not thought to be a cure for schizophrenia, but there are a number of helpful treatments available, of which medication remains the cornerstone of treatment for people with this condition. These medications are often referred to as antipsychotics since they help decrease the intensity of psychotic symptoms. Many health care professionals prescribe one of these medications, sometimes in combination of one or more other psychiatric medications, in order to maximize the benefit for the person with schizophrenia.''Medications that have been found to be particularly effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and therefore are considered top choices or first-line treatments, include orally taken medications like ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), lurasidone (''Latuda''), brexpiprazole (Rexulti), and iloperidone (Fanapt). Medications that may be taken by injection or by mouth include ''chlorpromazine'', ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''), ''fluphenazine'', risperidone (''Risperdal Consta''), olanzapine (Zyprexa Relprevv), aripiprazole (Abilify, Abilify Maintena, Aristrada), and paliperidone (Invega Sustenna). Injectable medications tend to be more long-acting compared to oral preparations, lasting as much as four weeks at a time, thereby improving consistency of treatment.''Although older antipsychotic medications in this class like haloperidol (Haldol), ''thioridazine'' (Mellaril), perphenazine (Trilafon), and ''molindone'' (''Moban'') are more likely to cause muscle ''stiffness'', impaired motor coordination, shakiness, and very rarely uncoordinated muscle twitches (''tardive dyskinesia'') that can be permanent, health care professionals appropriately monitor the people they treat for these potential side effects, as well. Some of the abnormal muscle movements, like ''tremors'' (for example, akathisia) or stiffness (''dystonia'') can be managed using anti-''tremor'' medications like ''benztropine'' (''Cogentin'') or ''amantadine'' (Symmetrel). Also, more recent research regarding all antipsychotic medications seems to demonstrate that the older (first-generation) antipsychotics are just as effective as the newer ones, both in the management of current symptoms and prevention of future symptoms, and have no higher rate of people stopping treatment because of any side effect the medications cause. Not all medications that treat schizophrenia in adults have been approved for use in treating childhood schizophrenia.''Clozapine'' (''Clozaril''), while thought to be highly effective for treating schizophrenia, has potentially serious, even fatal side effects that prevent it from being used prescribed more often. Those side effects can include dangerously low white blood cell count, inflammation of the ''heart'' muscle (''myocarditis''), as well as what are classified as metabolic side effects, like elevated blood ''sugar'' and ''cholesterol levels'', ''weight gain'', and elevated ''prolactin'' levels. While reserpine, a medication that also reduces ''blood pressure'', has also been found to decrease psychotic symptoms, the fact that safer, more effective medications now exist has resulted in its being far less frequently used these days. ''Prochlorperazine'' (''Compazine'') has strong antipsychotic effects but is used to treat ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''vertigo''.''Mood-stabilizer medications like ''lithium'' (''Lithobid''), ''divalproex'' (''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'') can be useful in treating ''mood swings'' that sometimes occur in individuals who have a diagnosable mood disorder in addition to psychotic symptoms (for example, schizoaffective disorder, ''depression'', in addition to schizophrenia). These medications may take a bit longer to work compared to the antipsychotic medications. Some (for example, lithium, divalproex, and carbamazepine) require monitoring of medication blood levels, and some can be associated with ''birth defects'' when taken by ''pregnant'' women. Divalproex and lamotrigine carry the rare potential of causing a potentially rare autoimmune reaction (Stevens-Johnson syndrome).''Antidepressant'' medications are the primary medical treatment for the ''depression'' that can often accompany schizophrenia and meta-analyses (systematic reviews of published studies) of how people with this illness fare when taking ''antidepressants'' support treatment with these medications. Examples of antidepressants that are commonly prescribed for that purpose include serotonergic (SSRI) medications that affect levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin (like ''fluoxetine'' [''Prozac''], ''sertraline'' [''Zoloft''], ''paroxetine'' [''Paxil''], ''citalopram'' [''Celexa''], ''escitalopram'' [''Lexapro''], ''vortioxetine'' [Trintellix], and vilazodone [Viibryd]) and combination serotonergic/adrenergic medications (SNRIs) (like ''venlafaxine'' [''Effexor''] and ''duloxetine'' [''Cymbalta''] and levomilnacipran [Fetzima], as well as ''bupropion'' [''Wellbutrin''], which is a dopaminergic [affecting dopamine levels] antidepressant medication).''Despite its stigmatized history, ''electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'') can be a viable treatment for people whose schizophrenia has inadequately responded to a number of medication trials and psychosocial interventions.'""When treating pregnant women with schizophrenia, health care practitioners take great care to balance the need to maintain the person's more stable thoughts and behavior while minimizing the problems that medications used to treat this disorder may present. While some medications that treat schizophrenia may carry risks to the fetus in pregnancy and during ""'breastfeeding'', careful monitoring of how much medication is administered and the health of the fetus and of the mother can go a long way toward protecting the fetus from any such risks, while maximizing the chance that the fetus will grow in the healthier environment provided by an emotionally healthy mother.''Family psycho-education and support'': In addition to educating family members about the symptoms, course, and treatment of schizophrenia, this form of treatment consists of providing family with supportive therapy, problem-solving skills, and access to ongoing community supports, including care providers during times of crises. When this intervention is consistently provided for at least several months, it has been found to decrease the relapse rate for the person with schizophrenia and improve social and emotional outcomes. Also, the burden that family members experience as a result of having a loved one with schizophrenia is less, family members tend to be more knowledgeable about the disorder and feel more supported by the professionals involved, and family relationships are improved.''Assertive community treatment (ACT)'"": This intervention consists of members of the person's treatment team meeting with that individual on a daily basis, in community settings (for example, home, work, or other places the person with schizophrenia frequents) rather than in an office or hospital setting. The treatment team is made up of a variety of professionals. For example, a psychiatrist, nurse, case manager, employment counselor, and substance-abuse counselor often make up an ACT team. Over the long term, ACT tends to be successful in reducing how often people with schizophrenia are psychiatrically hospitalized or become homeless.""'Substance abuse treatment'': Providing medical and psychosocial interventions that address substance abuse should be an integral part of treatment as about 50% of individuals with schizophrenia suffer from some kind of substance abuse or dependence.''Social skills training'': Also called illness management and recovery programming, social-skills training involves teaching clients ways to handle social situations appropriately. It may be conducted as part of individual or group ''psychotherapy'' and often involves the person scripting (thinking through or role-playing) situations that occur in social settings in order to prepare for those situations when they actually occur. This treatment type has been found to help people with schizophrenia resist using drugs of abuse, as well as improve their relationships with health care professionals and with people at work.''Supported employment'': This intervention provides supports like a job coach (someone who periodically or consistently counsels the client in the workplace), as well as instruction on constructing a résumé, interviewing for jobs, and education and support for employers to hire individuals with chronic mental illness. Supported employment has been found to help schizophrenia sufferers secure and maintain employment, earn more money, and increase the number of hours they are able to work.''Cognitive behavioral therapy (''CBT'')'': CBT is a reality-based intervention that focuses on helping a client understand and change patterns that tend to interfere with his or her ability to interact with others and otherwise function. Except for people who are actively psychotic, CBT has been found to help individuals with schizophrenia decrease symptoms and improve their ability to function socially. This intervention can be done either individually or in group therapy.''Group therapy'': Group therapy is usually supportive and expressive, in that participants are encouraged in their efforts to care for themselves and otherwise engage in healthy, appropriate behaviors in the community.''Weight management'': Educating people with schizophrenia about weight gain and related health problems that can be a side effect of some antipsychotic and other psychiatric medications has been found to be helpful in resulting in a modest ''weight loss''. That is also true when schizophrenia sufferers are provided with behavioral interventions to help with ''weight loss''.'  "
What are potential complications of schizophrenia? What is the prognosis for schizophrenia?,"'Possible complications for schizophrenia range from more medical conditions (morbidity) or shortened life span (mortality) to negative impacts on their family members as well. For example, people with schizophrenia who continue to suffer from residual symptoms have more trouble thinking than those whose negative symptoms are adequately managed with treatment. Women with schizophrenia are thought to be more likely to suffer from complications during their ''pregnancies'"", at delivery and during their children's ""'newborn'' period.''Individuals with schizophrenia have more than twice the rate of death than those without the disorder. Almost half of people with schizophrenia will suffer from a drug-use disorder (for example, ''alcohol'', marijuana, or other drug) during their lifetime. Research shows that people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have a better quality of life when their family members tend to be more supportive and less critical of them.' "
Is it possible to prevent schizophrenia?,"'Prevention of schizophrenia for individuals who have yet to develop even the early symptoms of the disorder focuses on decreasing many of the environmental insults that increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. Therefore, improving ''prenatal care'', ameliorating poverty, bullying, ''child abuse'' and neglect, as well as protecting people from family and community violence are important aspects of preventing schizophrenia. For people who show early signs of schizophrenia, some clinical trial research is exploring the potential use of medications to prevent full-blown schizophrenia.' "
What research is being done on schizophrenia?,"'Repetitive transient magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a procedure that involves multiple sessions of applying magnetic pulses to the brain, has been shown in some studies to decrease hearing voices (verbal auditory hallucinations) in schizophrenia sufferers as a result of stimulating certain areas of the brain. However, more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of this intervention before it is widely used.''Cognitive remediation continues to be an experimental treatment that addresses the cognitive problems that are associated with schizophrenia (for example, memory problems, speech impairment, learning problems). ''Clinical trials'' using this intervention in combination with vocational rehabilitation to improve work functioning have shown some promise, but more research is needed, particularly that which focuses on improving how well the person with schizophrenia functions in real-world situations as a result of this treatment.''Peer-to-peer treatment is a promising possible intervention since it promotes active constructive involvement from people who have schizophrenia, provides role models for individuals whose functioning is less stable, and may be accessible in individual and group settings, in person as well as by telephone or through the Internet. However, further research is necessary to demonstrate its effectiveness in decreasing symptoms or otherwise clearly improving functioning for people with schizophrenia.''In terms of weight management, more research is needed to explore how to best help people with schizophrenia retain the ''weight loss'' they achieve and even to prevent weight gain.'

What is schizophrenia?,"'Schizophrenia'' is a type of ''mental illness'' in which the affected person cannot distinguish between real and imaginary things or situations. There are times when people can completely lose touch with reality.''Most people with ''schizophrenia'' recover well, whereas some experience relapse or worsening of the condition. If you have been diagnosed with ''schizophrenia'', you can cope with its symptoms by combination therapy of medications, ''psychotherapy'', self-care, and a good support system.' "
What are the symptoms of schizophrenia?,"'Some of the characteristic signs and ''symptoms of schizophrenia'' include:''Other signs and symptoms of schizophrenia include:' Hallucinations: You start seeing, hearing, feeling, or smelling things that don’t exist. Delusions (false beliefs): You may not believe things based on facts but instead form your own false or irrational belief. Confused thinking: You are unable to focus on a single thought—there is a rapid shift in thoughts that leads to confusion in the thinking process. Disordered thinking: Disordered thinking manifests in the form of randomly spoken words and complete incoherence (nonsense sentences) in speaking or writing. Inappropriate emotional response: You are not able to understand the difference between serious and light moments. As a result, you display opposite emotions in events where you are expected to react normally as a healthy person (without schizophrenia) would react. You suddenly become overly active. There is a sudden appearance of a state (catatonia) in which your body becomes rigid and cannot be moved. You take a bath very fewer times in a week and stop grooming (you may look untidy and shabby). You start withdrawing from meeting family and friends. You are unable to carry out your routine activities at school, work, or home. You lose interest even in things that were enjoyable earlier."
What is the medical treatment of schizophrenia?,"'The medical treatment for schizophrenia works by reducing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, ''paranoia'', and disordered thinking. Finding the right drug and dosage takes time, and hence, treatment is a long-term process.''Second-generation antipsychotic ''drugs'' seem to work with fewer side effects than first-generation antipsychotics. Some of these include:''First-generation antipsychotics are also known as typical or conventional. Some of these are as follows:''A therapeutic ''shock'' treatment known as ''electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'') ''is sometimes used as an adjunct to antipsychotic medications. This therapy is usually used when medications to treat schizophrenia fail to improve the symptoms.'

What are the self-care strategies for schizophrenia? ,"'Taking care of yourself plays a vital role in substantiating the benefits of treatments for schizophrenia. Here are some self-care strategies:' Maintain good physical and mental health by having regular, well-balanced meals and being physically active. Learn to deal effectively with minor ailments and long-term conditions. Learn to recognize the signs if you become sick or the symptoms increase. Be in regular touch with your healthcare team. Take your medicine as prescribed and do not stop them without consulting your doctor. If you have any doubts regarding the medicines you are taking, talk to your doctor. Try reading the information leaflet that comes with the medicine about possible interactions with other drugs or supplements. Manage your stress by doing regular activities that relax you (this can be yoga, deep breathing, or even as simple as taking a stroll in the lap of nature). Additionally, you can learn ways to deal with stress through psychotherapy from a mental health therapist. Try quitting alcohol, smoking, and drugs because these can interfere with your treatment. Spend time with your family and friends and ask for suggestions for your condition. Alternatively, you can join a schizophrenia support group to know about how others affected with schizophrenia deal with their problems."
What is bipolar disorder? What is schizophrenia?,"'Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that involves severe mood swings, at least one episode of mania (an exaggerated or heightened mood, see below) and may include repeated episodes of ''depression''. It is a mood disorder that afflicts up to as many as 4 million people. Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, debilitating mental illness that involves psychotic symptoms, meaning that one is out of touch with reality. People with either illness are at a higher risk of ''suicide'', ''substance abuse'', and other mental health problems.' "
What are causes and risk factors for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia?,"'Like most mental disorders, neither bipolar disorder nor schizophrenia is directly passed down genetically. Rather, each is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. These two illnesses share a number of the same risk genes but also have some unique genetic risk factors. ''Stress'' has been found to be a significant contributor to the development of most mental health conditions, including both of these disorders.' "
What are signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder and of schizophrenia?,"'To qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, a person must experience at least one ''manic'' episode. Symptoms of mania include''While a major depressive episode is not required for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, ''depression'' often alternates with manic episodes and tends to occur more often than mania in many people.''Symptoms of schizophrenia may include'  elevated, expansive, or irritable mood; racing thoughts; pressured speech (rapid, excessive, and frenzied speaking); decreased need for sleep; grandiose ideas (for example, false beliefs of superiority or failures); tangential speech (repeatedly changing topics to topics that are hardly related); restlessness/increased goal-directed activity; and impulsivity, poor judgment, or engaging in risky activity (like spending sprees, promiscuity, or excess desire for sex). delusions (beliefs not at all based in reality), hallucinations (seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, or tasting something that is not really there), catatonia, negative symptoms, like not talking (mutism, low motivation, and movement), and disorganized speech or behavior."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose bipolar disorder and schizophrenia?,"""Since there is no one test that determines that someone has bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, health care professionals diagnose these conditions by gathering medical, family, and mental health information. The mental health professional will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor do so, including lab tests to assess the person's general health and whether he or she has mental health symptoms that are due to a physical condition."" "
What are treatments and medications for bipolar disorder and for schizophrenia?,"'People with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia can expect their mental health professionals to consider several interventions, including medications, psychotherapies, and lifestyle advice. Medication treatment of bipolar disorder tends to address relieving already existing symptoms of the illness and preventing symptoms from returning. For schizophrenia, medications have been found to be effective in treating the positive symptoms (for example, delusions or hallucinations).''Antipsychotic medications that treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and the manic and mixed ''symptoms of bipolar disorder'' include ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), ''paliperidone'' (Invega), ''asenapine'' (Saphris), ''iloperidone'' (Fanapt), lurasidone (''Latuda''), and ''brexpiprazole'' (Rexulti). Older medications, like ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''), ''chlorpromazine'' (''Thorazine''), and ''thioridazine'' (Mellaril), are more likely to cause muscular side effects, rarely one that can be permanent.''Mood stabilizers like ''lithium'' (''Lithobid'') and antiseizure (anticonvulsant) medications like ''divalproex'' (''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'', Tegretol XR), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'') treat active manic or mixed symptoms and those symptoms from returning. ''Antidepressants'' are the primary medical treatment for the depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder. Antidepressants include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix), and vilazodone (Viibryd); serotonergic/adrenergic medications (SNRIs) like ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), and levomilnacipran (Fetzima), as well as ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin''), a dopaminergic ''antidepressant''.''Electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'') can treat people whose symptoms of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia are severe and have inadequately responded to psychotherapies and a number of medication trials. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can treat resistant depression, as well.''Talk therapy (''psychotherapy'') is an important part of helping individuals living with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia achieve the highest level of functioning possible by improving ways of coping with the illness. Assertive community treatment (ACT) involves members of the treatment team having daily meetings with the schizophrenia sufferer in community settings (for example, at home, work, or otherwise in the community) rather than just in an office or hospital.' "
What is the prognosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia?,"'Bipolar disorder sufferers tend to have mood problems up to 60% of the time but can be helped with psychotherapy and medication. Schizophrenia has a more difficult course, less so with treatment. People with either condition are at risk for developing medical problems, other mental health disorders, taking their own life, or otherwise dying younger.' "
What is schizotypal personality disorder?,"""Schizotypal personality disorder (STPD) is a mental disorder that belongs to the group of mental illnesses called personality disorders. Therefore, like other personality disorders, it is characterized by a consistent pattern of thinking, feeling, and interacting with others and with the world that tends to cause significant problems for the sufferer. Specifically, schizotypal personality disorder tends to be associated with a pattern of odd, eccentric feelings, unusual perceptual experiences, behaviors, and relating to other people that interferes with the individual's ability to function. Individuals with this illness have a tendency to be loners and suffer from discomfort in social situations. They may also be paranoid, although their level of suspiciousness might not rise to the level of being completely out of touch with reality (delusional). As with other personality disorders, the person with schizotypal personality disorder is usually an adolescent or adult before they can be assessed as meeting the full symptom criteria for the diagnosis of this illness.""'Schizotypal personality disorder tends to occur in almost 4% of adults, more often in males than in females. It is thought to be part of a continuum of illnesses related to ''schizophrenia'', so in the current diagnostic manual by the American Psychiatric Association, the ''Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5''), it is dually grouped with other personality disorders and with ''schizophrenia'' spectrum and other ''psychotic disorders''. That is a bit different from how this illness is described by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the ICD-10, which calls this illness schizotypal disorder and associates it with schizophrenia only, rather than also with personality disorders.' "
What are causes and risk factors for schizotypal personality disorder?,"'Although there is no specific cause for schizotypal personality disorder, like most other mental disorders, it is understood to be the result of a combination of biological vulnerabilities, ways of thinking, and social stressors (biopsychosocial model). Biologically, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder are thought to have less brain matter in certain areas and abnormalities of the neurotransmitter ''dopamine'' in the brain, with some similarities to the brain abnormalities found in individuals with schizophrenia. Neurodevelopmentally, people with schizotypal personality disorder have often been found to show differences in how they form new memories (prospective memory), as well as how their brains seem to respond when confronted with social situations.''Having a family history of ''mental illness'' is a risk factor for developing schizotypal personality disorder. People who have a member of their immediate family (first-degree relative) with schizotypal symptoms (schizotypy) can be as much as 50% more likely to develop schizotypy compared to people without that family history. If a person has a close relative with schizophrenia, they are also more likely to develop schizotypal personality disorder and to have symptoms of similar severity to their schizophrenic relative.''People who were born to a mother who smoked during ''pregnancy'', had a lower birth weight, and had a smaller head circumference at the age of 12 months seem to develop symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder at higher rates than people of normal birth weight and head circumference at 1 year of age. Medical conditions like ''epilepsy'' can be a predisposing factor to developing schizotypy as an adult.''Social risk factors for developing the suspiciousness and unusual perceptive symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder include birth during the winter or summer, higher birth order, being the victim of childhood physical or sexual abuse, or having a lower family socioeconomic status during childhood. It has also apparently been found to occur more often in black women compared to other women, independent of socioeconomic factors. Having parents who have difficult communication or a parent who tends to engage in magical thinking, like purporting to know what their children are thinking or doing, are other risk factors for children growing up to develop schizotypal personality disorder. Children who use ''marijuana'' for the first time before 14 years of age or have been prematurely placed in the role of an adult can be predisposed to developing this illness as well.' "
What are schizotypal personality disorder symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms associated with schizotypal personality disorder can include the following:''Both of the most recent two editions of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-IV-TR'' and ''DSM-V'') remain fairly consistent in how schizotypal personality disorder is defined.'   Ideas of reference (like feeling strangers are noticing or somehow communicating with oneself) Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is inconsistent with cultural norms (like superstitiousness, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or ""sixth sense""; in children and adolescents it may involve bizarre fantasies or preoccupations) Unusual perceptions Odd thinking and speech (like vague speech, or that which contains excessive detail, is in metaphors, is overly elaborate, or stereotyped) Suspiciousness or paranoid thoughts Inappropriate or constricted ways of expressing emotion (affect) Behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or strange Lack of close friends or confidants other than close relatives Excessive social anxiety that does not decrease with familiarity and tends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than negative thoughts about oneself"
What tests diagnose schizotypal personality disorder?,"'There is no specific definitive test, like a blood test, that can accurately assess that a person has schizotypal personality disorder. People who are concerned that they may suffer from this diagnosis might explore the possibility by taking a self-test, either an online or printable test, like the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, the Structured Interview for Schizotypy, the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE), the Rust Inventory of Schizotypal Cognitions, the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences, or the Schizotypal Personality Scale.''To determine the presence of schizotypal personality disorder, health care professionals conduct a mental health interview that looks for the history and presence of the symptoms, also called diagnostic criteria, previously described. As with any mental health assessment, the health care professional will usually work toward ruling out other mental disorders, including screening for mood problems like ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' disorders, including anxiety attacks or generalized anxiety, obsessive compulsive symptoms, types of other personality disorders like ''narcissistic personality disorder'', ''antisocial personality disorder'', schizoid personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder, drug-abuse problems as well as problems of being out of touch with reality, like schizophrenia or delusional disorder. Besides determining if the person suffers from schizotypal personality disorder, the mental health professional may determine that while some symptoms (traits) of the disorder are present, the person does not fully qualify for the diagnosis. Since schizotypal personality disorder has most often been found to co-occur (termed being co-morbid) with ''borderline personality disorder'', avoidant personality disorder, and paranoid personality disorder, the presence of those disorders will most likely be specifically explored as well.''The health care professional will also likely try to ensure that the individual is not suffering from a medical problem that may cause emotional symptoms that mimic those of schizotypal personality disorder. The health care professional will therefore often inquire about when the person has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood testing, and any other tests that a medical professional deems necessary to ensure that the individual is not suffering from a medical condition instead of or in addition to their emotional symptoms. Due to the use of a mental health interview in making the diagnosis and the fact that this condition, like any personality disorder, can be quite resistant to treatment, it is of great importance that the health care professional knows to conduct a thorough assessment. This is to assure that the person is not incorrectly assessed as having schizotypal personality disorder when he or she does not.'""In determining the presence of schizotypal personality disorder, the evaluator will likely explore whether the person's symptoms indicate the presence of a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts as indicated by five or more of the aforementioned symptoms and signs (diagnostic criteria). The diagnosis is not to be assigned if it only occurs during the course of having schizophrenia, a ""'bipolar disorder'' or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or an ''autism spectrum disorder''.' "
"What is the 
treatment for schizotypal personality disorder?","'Given the difficulties associated with schizotypal personality disorder, home remedies are not generally entertained as viable options for treating schizotypal personality disorder. Evidence-based treatments that have been found to be useful in helping the sufferer manage some of the symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder include both psychodynamic and cognitive behavioral forms of talk therapy (psychotherapy). Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on helping the person understand how their thoughts and behaviors affect each other. An emphasis on improving social skills is particularly important in addressing the long-standing social deficits that are part of schizotypal personality disorder. Psychodynamic psychotherapy, which is also called psychoanalytic therapy, seeks to help the individual understand and better manage his or her ways of defending against negative emotions.''While medications do not ""cure"" personality disorders, including schizotypal personality disorder, they may be appropriate to address some of the mental health symptoms that can accompany it, like ''paranoia'', odd behaviors, magical thinking, ''depression'', or anxiety. The first antipsychotic medication was discovered by accident and then used for treatment of schizophrenia. This was ''chlorpromazine'' (''Thorazine''), which was soon followed by medications such as ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''), ''fluphenazine'' (''Prolixin''), ''thiothixene'' (''Navane''), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), perphenazine (Trilafon), and ''thioridazine'' (Mellaril). These medications have become known as ""neuroleptics"" because, although effective in treating positive symptoms (for example, paranoia, magical thinking, ''mood swings''/emotional lability), they can cause side effects, many of which affect the neurologic (nervous) system. Examples of such neurologic side effects include muscle stiffness or rigidity, painful spasms, restlessness ''tremors'', and muscle twitches. These older medications are thought to be not as effective against so-called negative symptoms such as decreased motivation and lack of emotional expressiveness.''Since 1989, a new class of antipsychotics (atypical or second-generation antipsychotics) has been used. At clinically effective doses, very few of the neurological side effects of traditional (first generation) antipsychotics are observed.''Clozapine'' (''Clozaril''), the first drug of this new class, is the only medication that has been shown to be effective where other antipsychotics have failed. Its use is not associated with severe side effects, but it does produce other side effects, including a possible decrease in the number of white blood cells that can become dangerous in rare cases. Therefore, the blood needs to be monitored every week during the first six months of treatment and then every two weeks to identify this side effect early if it occurs.''Other atypical antipsychotics include ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), paliperidone (Invega or Sustenna), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), lurasidone (''Latuda''), and brexpiprazole (Rexulti).''Although sometimes more effective and usually better tolerated, the use of the atypical antipsychotics is also associated with possible side effects, and current medical practice is developing better ways of understanding these effects, identifying people at risk, and monitoring for the emergence of complications. Most of these medications take two to three weeks to take effect. Patience is required if the dose needs to be adjusted, the specific medication is changed, or another medication is added. In order to be able to determine whether an antipsychotic is effective or not, it should be tried for at least four weeks (or even longer with clozapine).''Since people with a schizotypal personality disorder are at increased risk of also developing ''depression'', medications that address that symptom may be of great benefit as well. Serotonergic medications like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix), and vilazodone (Viibryd) are often prescribed because of their effectiveness and low incidence of side effects. Other often-prescribed ''antidepressant'' medications for the ''depression'' that can be associated with schizotypal personality disorder include ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), levomilnacipran (Fetzima), and ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'').' "
What are complications of schizotypal personality disorder? What is the prognosis of schizotypal personality disorder?,"'People with schizotypal personality disorder are at risk for developing ''brief psychotic disorder'', schizophreniform disorder, or delusional disorder. As many as half of individuals with this illness also suffer from ''major depression'' at the time the personality disorder is diagnosed and most have a history of suffering from at least one episode of major depression. People with schizotypal personality disorder also tend to suffer from an ''anxiety disorder'', and many individuals who have this personality disorder in addition to another mental disorder have been found to be less responsive to treatment. Without treatment, individuals with this illness are at risk for having trouble getting and keeping relationships and employment over the long term, often due to symptoms like their odd behaviors and tendency toward paranoia.' "
Is it possible to prevent schizotypal personality disorder?,"'Societal interventions like prevention of child abuse and substance abuse in families can help decrease the occurrence of a number of very different mental health problems, including schizotypal personality disorder. More specifically, encouraging good ''prenatal care'', discouraging women from ''smoking during pregnancy'', and providing emotional support to women during pregnancy and the postpartum period may decrease those factors that have been linked to increased schizotypal symptoms in the children that come from those ''pregnancies''.'

What is impetigo? Who gets it and how (causes) it?,"   Impetigo (pronounced im-puh-TIE-go) is a contagious, superficial infection of the skin caused by Staphylococcus (staph) and Streptococcus (strep) bacteria. Impetigo is more common in children (especially 2- to 5-year-olds) than in adults. Impetigo is most likely to occur in warm and humid environments and is most commonly spread by close contact (such as between family members). Many years ago the formal name for this disease was ""impetigo contageosum."" A rarely used ecthyma is the term for a rash similar to impetigo, but the infection penetrates the skin more deeply. (Its therapy is similar to impetigo.)"
Is impetigo contagious?,"'A bandage covering the infected area should be applied during this time.''The incubation period (the time between exposure to the bacteria and the first development of symptoms) depends on the infective bacteria. Strep-caused impetigo has a shorter incubation period (one to three days) than staph-caused impetigo (four to 10 days).'   Impetigo is generally thought to be contagious during the first 24 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy. If impetigo is caused by streptococci bacteria it iscontagious for about one to three days.  If impetigo is caused by staphylococci bacteria it is contagious for about four to 10 days. Impetigo is spread rimarily from direct contact with someone who has it, but sometimes from towels, toys, clothing, or household items. After starting in one location, impetigo often spreads to other parts of the body. This is particularly common with impetigo in children. There may be mini epidemics of impetigo in day care centers. Bacteria that cause impetigo may enter through a break in the skin, such as that which comes from cuts and scrapes. Heat, humidity, and the presence of eczema predispose a person to developing impetigo. Recurrent impetigo infections may be associated with staph or strep bacteria residing in the nose and spreading from to other parts of the skin. Impetigo is common in children 2-5 years old. The child will develop impetigo lesions at the nasal openings inflamed by the prominent nasal drainage associated with a cold. In this situation, skin integrity is often disrupted by the continuous covering of purulent nasal discharge. Adults often develop impetigo from close contact with infected children. "
"What are the symptoms, signs, and types types of impetigo? ","'There are two types of impetigo.'   Nonbullous impetigo: This is the more common form, caused by both staph and strep bacteria.This form of impetigo initially manifest as small red papules similar to insect bites.These contagious lesions rapidly evolve to small blisters and then to pustules that finally scab over with a characteristic honey-colored crust.This entire process usually takes about one week.These lesions often start around the nose and on the face, but less frequently they may also affect the arms and legs.At times, there may be non-tender but swollen lymph nodes (glands) nearby.

These lesions often start around the nose and on the face, but less frequently they may also affect the arms and legs. At times, there may be non-tender but swollen lymph nodes (glands) nearby. Bullous impetigo: This form of impetigo is caused only by staph bacteria.These staph bacteria produce a toxin that reduces cell-to-cell stickiness (adhesion), causing separation between the top skin layer (epidermis) and the lower layer (dermis).This leads to the formation of a blister. (The medical term for blister is bulla.)Bullae can appear in various skin areas, especially the buttocks and trunk.These blisters are fragile and contain a clear yellow-colored fluid.The bullae are delicate and often break with the overlying ""roof"" of skin lost, leaving red, raw skin with a ragged edge.A dark crust will commonly develop during the final stages of development.With healing, this crust from impetigo resolves.

What tests and procedures diagnose impetigo?,"'Diagnosing an impetigo infection is generally straightforward and based on the clinical appearance. Occasionally, other conditions may look something like impetigo. Skin infections such as tinea (""''ringworm''"") or ''scabies'' (mites) may be confused with impetigo. It is important to note that not every sore or blister means an impetigo infection. At times, other infected and noninfected skin diseases produce blister-like ''skin inflammation''. Such conditions include ''herpes'' ''cold sores'', ''chickenpox'', ''poison ivy'', skin ''allergies'', ''eczema'', and ''insect bites''.''Secondary skin infections may sometimes occur. Medical evaluation and occasionally culture tests are used to decide whether topical antibacterial creams will suffice or whether oral antibiotics will be necessary.' "
What antibiotics treat impetigo?,"   An impetigo infection is not serious and is very treatable. Mild impetigo can be handled by gentle cleansing of the sores, removing crusts from the infected person, and applying the prescription-strength antibiotic ointment mupirocin (Bactroban). Nonprescription topical antibiotic ointments (such as Neosporin) generally are not effective. More severe or widespread impetigo, especially of bullous impetigo, may require oral antibiotic medication. I n recent years, more staph germs have developed resistance to standard antibiotics. Bacterial culture tests can help a doctor to guide the use of proper oral therapy if needed. Antibiotics which can be helpful include penicillin derivatives (such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [Augmentin]) and cephalosporins such as cephalexin (Keflex). If clinical suspicion is supported by culture results show other bacteria, such as drug-resistant staph (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA), other antibiotics such as clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim or Septra) may be necessary.  Treatment is guided by laboratory results (culture and sensitivity tests)."
What are the complications and prognosis of impetigo?,"'An excellent prognosis of complete cure and recovery of the infected area is anticipated when impetigo is treated. In fact, many specialists in infectious diseases would propose that a poor response to appropriate antibiotic therapy should raise concerns regarding the accuracy of the diagnosis.''A potentially serious but rare complication of impetigo caused by strep bacteria is glomerulonephritis, a condition producing kidney inflammation. Many specialists are not convinced that treating impetigo will prevent glomerulonephritis from occurring.' "
Will impetigo leave scars?,"'Because the crusts and blisters of impetigo are superficial, impetigo generally does not leave ''scars''. Affected skin looks red for a while after the crusts go away, but this redness fades in a matter of days to weeks. Once the skin has healed, ''sunscreen'' application is indicated.' "
Can you prevent impetigo?,'Routine hand washing with soap and warm water is an important and effective mechanism to prevent the spread of impetigo.' 
What types of specialists treat impetigo?,"'A primary care doctor -- pediatrician, family practice doctor, or internist -- can routinely manage evaluation and treatment of impetigo. If there are unusual health issues or no response to appropriate antibiotic therapy, a specialist in infectious diseases could be consulted.' "
What is sciatica?,'Sciatica is pain in the lower extremity resulting from irritation of the sciatic nerve. The pain of sciatica is typically felt from the low back (lumbar area) to behind the thigh and can radiate down below the knee. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and begins from nerve roots in the lumbar spinal cord in the low back and extends through the buttock area to send nerve endings down the lower limb. ''Radiculopathy'' is sometimes referred to as sciatic nerve pain.'  
What are common causes of sciatica?,"'While sciatica is most commonly a result of a lumbar ''disc herniation'' directly pressing on the nerve, any cause of irritation or inflammation of the sciatic nerve can produce the symptoms of sciatica. This irritation of nerves as a result of an abnormal intervertebral disc is referred to as radiculopathy. Aside from a ''pinched nerve'' from a disc, other causes of sciatica include irritation of the nerve from adjacent bone, tumors, muscle, ''internal bleeding'', infections in or around the lumbar spine, ''spondylolisthesis'', injury, spinal stenosis, ''cauda equina syndrome'', osteophyte, and other causes. Sometimes sciatica can occur because of irritation of the sciatic nerve during ''pregnancy''.'  "
What are risk factors for sciatica? What are sciatica symptoms?,"'Risk factors for sciatica include ''degenerative arthritis'' of the lumbar spine, lumbar disc disease, and ''herniated disc'', and ''trauma'' or injury to the lumbar spine.''Sciatica causes pain, a burning sensation, numbness, or tingling radiating from the lower back and upper buttock down the back of the thigh to the back of the leg. The result is ''lumbar pain'', ''buttock pain'', ''hip pain'', and ''leg pain''. Sometimes the sciatic pain radiates around the hip or buttock to feel like ''hip pain''. While sciatica is often associated with ''lower back pain'' (''lumbago''), it can be present without ''low back pain''. Severe sciatica can make ''walking'' difficult if not impossible. Sometimes the symptoms of sciatica are aggravated by walking or bending at the waist and relieved by lying down. The numbness and pain relief by changing positions can be partial or complete.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose sciatica?,"'Sciatica is diagnosed with a physical exam and medical history. The typical symptoms and certain examination maneuvers help the health care professional to diagnose sciatica. Sometimes, ''X-rays'' and other tests, such as ''CT scan'', ''MRI'' scan, and ''electromyogram'', are used to further define the exact causes of sciatica.' "
Which health care specialties treat sciatica?,"'Physician specialties that evaluate and treat sciatica range from generalists to subspecialists. These specialties include general medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, gynecology, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, ''rheumatology'', ''pain management'', and physiatry. Other health care providers for ''low back pain'' include physical therapists, chiropractors, ''massage'' therapists, psychologists, and acupuncturists.' "
What is the best sciatica treatment?,"'Bed rest has been traditionally advocated for the treatment of acute sciatica. But how useful is it?''To study the effectiveness of bed rest in patients with sciatica of sufficient severity to justify treatment with bed rest for two weeks, a research team in the Netherlands led by Dr. Patrick Vroomen randomly assigned 183 such patients to bed rest or, alternatively, to watchful waiting for this period.'""To gauge the outcome, both primary and secondary measures were examined. The primary outcome measures were the global assessments of improvement after two and 12 weeks by the doctor and the patient. The secondary outcome measures were changes in functional status and in pain scores, absenteeism from work, and the need for surgical intervention. Neither the doctors who assessed the outcomes nor those involved in data entry and analysis were aware of the patients' treatment assignments.""'The results, reported in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'', showed that after two weeks, 64 of the 92 (70%) patients in the bed-rest group reported improvement, as compared with 59 of the 91 (65%) of the patients in the control (watchful-waiting) group. After 12 weeks, 87% of the patients in ''both'' groups reported improvement. The results of assessments of the intensity of pain, the aggravation of symptoms, and functional status revealed ''no'' significant differences between the two groups. The extent of absenteeism from work and rates of surgical intervention were similar in the two groups.''The researchers concluded that ""among patients with symptoms and signs of a lumbosacral radicular syndrome, bed rest is ''not'' a more effective therapy than watchful waiting."" Sometimes, conventional wisdom is not as wise as research!'  "
What are other treatment options for sciatica?,"'Other treatment options for sciatica depend on its cause and include addressing the underlying cause and physical therapy.''Cortisone medications, given orally or by local injection (epidural injection), can sometimes be helpful in relieving sciatica pain.''Surgical procedures can sometimes be required for persisting sciatica that is caused by ''nerve compression'' at the lower spine. Sometimes pain management specialists help with chronic sciatica conditions.' Transcutaneous nerve stimulators (TENS units) are sometimes useful for more chronic forms of sciatica. A variety of low back conditioning and stretching exercises are employed to help people recover from sciatica. Medications used in the treatment of sciatica include pain relievers, muscle relaxants, anti-inflammatories, and antidepressants. Antidepressants actually can help in this setting by reducing pain perception in the brain. Other medications that may be helpful include gabapentin (Neurontin) and duloxetine (Cymbalta)."
How long does sciatica last?,"'The duration of sciatica is critically dependent on its cause. A ''herniated disc'', back sprain, ''shingles'', and degenerative lumbar spine can all cause temporary forms of sciatica, lasting from days to weeks. Each can also cause chronic sciatica. Sometimes degeneration of the lumbar spine and discs can cause chronic sciatica that persists unless a surgical intervention is performed.' "
Are there home remedies and self-care exercises for sciatica?,"'Keys to the management of acute sciatica include relief of pain and relaxing associated ''muscle spasms''. Home remedies include heat and ''cold'' pack topical administration, ''over-the-counter'' pain medications such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' like\xa0''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), and ''aspirin'', and physical therapy that incorporates gradual exercises and stretching. Exercises and stretching can sometimes best be guided by physical therapists.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) for patients with sciatica? Is it possible to prevent sciatica?,"'Depending on the precise cause of the sciatica and the duration of symptoms, the outlook for recovery from sciatica ranges from excellent to having long-term chronic symptoms.''Sciatica can be prevented to some extent by avoiding low back trauma injuries.

Facts on sciatica exercises and stretches,"  Sciatica describes the symptoms associated with inflammation of the sciatic nerve. These include pain in the low back radiating to the buttock or hip and then down the leg to the foot and toes. There may also be associated numbness and tingling and muscle weakness. Activity may be more helpful than bedrest in recovering from symptoms. Exercises are useful in helping prevent and control sciatica by increasing low back muscle strength, flexibility, endurance, and correcting and maintaining good posture. Other treatment options that may be helpful include massage, acupuncture, spinal manipulation, and physical therapy. If possible, surgery and other invasive procedures should be reserved for those who have emergent conditions like cauda equina syndrome or for those who cannot control their symptoms in other ways."
What is sciatica?,"'Sciatica describes ''pain'' that radiates along the path of nerves that leave the lower back and into the leg.''The sciatic nerve is the largest and widest nerve in the body. It forms from nerve roots that leave the spinal cord from many levels in the low back, from L4 (lumbar) to S3 (sacral) and runs from the low back to the buttock/hip and then down the back of the leg to the foot and toes. These nerve roots leave the spinal canal through the intervertebral space, the space between the vertebrae (bones) that makes up the spine.''Sciatica is also known as lumbosacral ''radiculopathy'' (radicular=''spinal nerve'' root + pathy=disorder).''Inflammation or irritation of the sciatic nerve causes the typical symptoms of sciatica, including''Sciatica may have one or many of these symptoms and their location depends upon the involved nerve root.' pain radiating down the leg, numbness and/or tingling of the leg and foot, and weakness of the muscles that the nerve controls."
What causes sciatic nerve pain?,"'Sciatic ''nerve pain'' occurs when the nerve or one of the nerve roots is irritated, usually due to compression of some of the nerve fibers by surrounding structures. It is a consequence of another disease or injury.''Common causes include situations where the intervertebral space is narrowed. This includes ''degenerative joint disease'' (DJD) or ''arthritis'' of the back, ''degenerative disc disease'', ''spondylolisthesis'', compression ''fractures'' of the lumbar spine, and lumbar stenosis.''Muscle of the low back may become inflamed and/or spasm that can affect the sciatic nerve if it is nearby. ''Piriformis syndrome'' is an example. ''Pregnancy'' and a growing uterus can cause inflammation of the nearby sciatic nerve. Diagnosing any underlying cause may help determine what exercises and stretches will be most helpful for the patient.' "
What exercises and stretches help to relieve sciatic nerve pain?,"'Exercise'' and activity seem to offer the best opportunity to help acute flares of ''low back pain'' and sciatica.''Physical therapy with the use of traction, stretching, ''ultrasound'', and electrical stimulation may be of some help. Heat and ice therapy are also useful. While there is little research that confirms the benefit of using a back brace, patients often find some pain and function improvement.''Acupuncture'', spinal manipulation, and massage may be helpful treatment options.''Exercise'' programs may be of benefit:'  Lumbar extensor muscle strengtheningUsually requires education and supervised training at the beginningMay need to perform exercises in situations where the effects of gravity on the lumbar spine is decreasedWater therapyYogaPilatesMcKenzie exercisesAlexander techniqueCore muscle strengthening Usually requires education and supervised training at the beginning May need to perform exercises in situations where the effects of gravity on the lumbar spine is decreased Water therapy Yoga Pilates McKenzie exercises Alexander technique Core muscle strengthening Dynamic lumbar stabilizing exercisesUsually requires education and supervised training at the beginningIsometric low back exercises are done while the back is kept in neutral, pain-free position.Functional restoration exercisesAimed at restoring muscle strength, flexibility, and endurance in the low backAssess and correct posture issuesCore muscle strengthening Usually requires education and supervised training at the beginning Isometric low back exercises are done while the back is kept in neutral, pain-free position.

When should I seek medical care for sciatica nerve pain?,"'Sciatica with just pain can often be controlled with the help of a primary care provider, chiropractor, or physical therapist. Other providers, including athletic trainers and acupuncturists, may also be resources for help. Patients should seek help with pain relief when they cannot control the pain.''Seek immediate medical evaluation of any sciatic nerve pain associated with injury or ''trauma''.''Patients should seek urgent care when the sciatic nerve is so inflamed and damaged that it causes parts of the body to stop working.''Loss of bowel control, ''inability to urinate'', and numbness around the perineum are symptoms of ''cauda equina syndrome'' (inflammation to the nerves at the end of the spinal cord), and the patient should seek emergent care to prevent permanent loss of function.''Weakness of muscles of the leg and foot, including foot drop, the inability to dorsiflex the foot (lift the toes upward), should have immediate evaluation.' "
What are the symptoms of sciatica?,"'Sciatica'' is a symptom itself rather than a specific diagnosis. It is the term used to describe any type of shooting ''pain'' that begins at the spine and radiates through the buttocks and down the back of the leg and as far as the foot.''Sciatica'' symptoms can range from a mild nuisance to sharp, shooting ''pain'' and discomfort. Symptoms are most often temporary and vary greatly depending on the condition causing ''sciatica''.''Symptoms of sciatica include:''In severe cases, patients may lose sensation in\xa0the leg and may also have difficulty controlling the bowels and bladder.' Shooting pain that makes it difficult to stand up or move suddenly, which may worsen with cough or sneeze Constant lower back pain or tingling sensation Pain in the rear or one leg that worsens while sitting Hip pain Weakness, numbness, or difficulty moving the leg or foot A minor movement such as bending over to pick something up (trigger for sciatic pain)"
What are the common causes of sciatica?,"'Sciatica is usually the symptom of a ''pinched nerve'' affecting one or more of the lower spinal nerves. The nerve might be pinched inside or outside of the spinal canal as it passes through the leg.''Some causes of sciatica include:''Severe injury to the spine or back may sometimes compress the sciatic nerve leading to ''lower back pain''.' Herniated or slipped disk: It is the most common cause of sciatica that causes pressure on a nerve root. Piriformis syndrome: Small piriformis muscle, which lies deep in the buttocks, becomes tight and spasms, thus creating pressure and causing irritation to the sciatic nerve. Spinal stenosis: It is narrowing of the spinal canal that puts pressure on the nerves. Spondylolisthesis: It occurs when one vertebra slips so that it is out of line with the one above it, narrowing the opening through which the sciatic nerve exits. Degenerative disk disease: It is caused by the wear and tear and effects of aging on the spine. Osteoarthritis: It is characterized by the formation of bone spurs (bits of protruding bone) that may press the nerve roots. It is mostly seen in older people. Pregnancy: Sciatica is often associated with pregnancy in women. A spinal tumor is rare but may also cause sciatica pain"
What are the common exercises that may relieve sciatic pain?,"'Sciatic pain may be sometimes relieved by exercises. Exercises can ease symptoms and muscle tension. Do not perform any exercises without consulting your doctor.' Stretching exercises: Stretches for the lower back and buttock muscles are particularly useful. Hold stretches for 20-30 seconds, rest, and repeat the same stretch once or even twice more.  Mobility and strengthening: If sciatica is caused by a lumbar disk prolapse (slipped disk), then extension exercises are recommended to help reduce the compression of the disk on the nerve root.  Core exercises: Core strengthening exercises to strengthen the core muscles of the trunk is a popular option for managing back conditions."
What are the common treatment options for sciatica?,"'Sciatica can be relieved by treating symptoms and underlying causes, such as a slipped disk. Depending on the underlying cause of sciatica, various treatments and therapies may be recommended, including:''Sciatica may always recur. To minimize the chances of recurrence, people should ''exercise'' regularly, maintain proper posture, and protect the back by bending at the knees to lift heavier objects.' Bed rest and frequent changing of the body posture may help in relieving the symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Advil and Motrin (ibuprofen) and Aleve and Naprosyn (naproxen) help to control inflammation and pain. NSAIDs should only be used as recommended by your physician. Muscle relaxants are prescribed to ease muscle tension and pain. Corticosteroid medications that are generally given through direct injection into the spine may reduce inflammation and pain. Antidepressants are usually prescribed to reduce nerve pain. Non Opioid pain drugs that work at the opioid receptor (Tramadol) are given for the treatment of severe sciatic pain. Short-term opioids may also help in treating sciatica pain. Chiropractic therapies, such as spinal manipulation, electrical stimulation, and trigger-point therapy, are generally recommended for limiting the symptoms. Complementary therapies, such as yoga, acupuncture, massage, and biofeedback, are considered to relax the body and nerves. Physical therapy and exercises are prescribed to improve muscle strength in the back and abdomen, increase flexibility and movement, and reduce pain. Surgery may relieve severe pain or solve bowel incontinence, bladder incontinence, or leg weakness. Surgical options include laminectomy or discectomy, both of which relieve pressure on the sciatic nerve."

Facts you should know about scleritis," Scleritis is inflammation of the white portion of the eye, the sclera. Scleritis is a serious eye disease that is often associated with underlying autoimmune disorders. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of scleritis is essential to prevent permanent vision loss."
What is scleritis?,"'Scleritis is inflammation of the sclera, the white portion of the eye.' "
What is the sclera?,"'The sclera is the tough, white fibrous outer wall layer of the eyeball. It is a type of connective tissue. The sclera provides both the white color of the eye and maintains the shape of the eyeball. It extends from the edge of the ''cornea'' (the clear, dome-shaped window in the front of the eye) around to the ''optic nerve'' in the back of the eye.' "
What causes scleritis?,"'Scleritis is an uncommon disease and is differentiated from episcleritis, which is inflammation of the surface membrane covering the sclera and is a more common eye condition. In episcleritis, only the superficial tissue between the white of the eye (sclera) and the blood vessel-filled covering (''conjunctiva'') is inflamed.''Approximately one-half of scleritis cases are associated with underlying diseases that affect the body internally (systemic diseases). Connective tissue disorders, autoimmune diseases, and generalized vasculitic abnormalities may all first appear as scleritis or manifest themselves as scleritis at some other time during the course of the underlying disease.''Scleritis may be seen in association with ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''arthritis'', other types of inflammatory ''arthritis'' (''ankylosing spondylitis'', ''reactive arthritis'', ''gouty arthritis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'', relapsing ''polychondritis''), ''polyarteritis nodosa'', ''mixed connective tissue disease'', progressive ''systemic sclerosis'' (''scleroderma''),\xa0granulomatous polyangiitis, ''polymyositis'', '""Sjögren's syndrome""', ''giant cell arteritis'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'', and ''allergic'' ''angiitis''.''Scleritis may be the initial manifestation of these underlying illnesses. Some of these conditions are organ-threatening and potentially lethal.''Scleritis can also be the result of an infectious process caused by bacteria including ''pseudomonas'', fungi, mycobacterium, ''viruses'', or parasites. ''Trauma'', chemical exposure, or postsurgical inflammation can also cause scleritis.''No cause is found in some cases of scleritis.''Scleritis may affect either one or both eyes. In patients with disease in both eyes, an underlying systemic cause is almost always found.' "
Is scleritis contagious?, 
What are risk factors for scleritis?,'The peak incidence of scleritis is in people aged 40-50 years old. Women are more commonly affected than men. The presence of known autoimmune or ''connective tissue disease'' markedly increases the risk of scleritis.'  
What are symptoms of scleritis?,"'Symptoms of scleritis include ''pain'', redness, tearing, light sensitivity (''photophobia''), tenderness of the eye, and decreased visual acuity.''Pain'' is nearly always present and typically is severe and accompanied by tenderness of the eye to touch. The ''pain'' may be boring, stabbing, and often awakens the patient from ''sleep''. The extreme ''pain'' of scleritis helps to differentiate it from other common causes of ''redness of the eyes'', such as ''conjunctivitis'' or episcleritis.''There is usually no discharge from the eye in scleritis.''The discoloration that is caused by the inflammation can have a bluish hue and can involve the entire white of the eye or be localized to only one area.''Decreased visual acuity may be caused by extension of scleritis to the adjacent structures, leading to inflammation of the ''cornea'' (''keratitis'') or the colored portion of the front of the eye (''uveitis''), ''glaucoma'', ''cataract'', and abnormalities of the retina.'  "
What are signs of scleritis?,"'In scleritis, there is redness of the blood vessels adjacent to the sclera. This redness can have a bluish or violet tinge. With repeated episodes or long-standing scleritis, the sclera can thin and the underlying brown choroid may become visible through the residual sclera.''Scleritis may be nodular with multiple round or oval elevated areas of the sclera. Scleritis may also be necrotizing, resulting in areas of thinning and softening of the normally fairly rigid sclera. Areas of absence of redness may be due to death (necrosis) of inflamed blood vessels.''Scleritis can be characterized as being located in the front or back of the eye (anterior or posterior), depending on the location of the disease upon examination.''Visual acuity can be decreased if there is secondary clouding of the cornea or of the ''lens'' of the eye. ''Intraocular pressure'' can be increased from ''congestion'' of the blood vessels involved in draining aqueous fluid from the eye. ''Intraocular'' pressure can also be decreased if the ciliary body, which lies deeper than the sclera, is secondarily involved by inflammation.''Disturbances of eye movement can be seen since the extraocular muscles can become irritated where they insert into the sclera. This can cause ''double vision''.' "
Scleritis vs. episcleritis,"'Many of the conditions associated with scleritis are serious. Episcleritis is a much more common and milder inflammation of the tissue. The extreme pain of scleritis helps to differentiate it from other common causes of ''redness of the eyes'' such as episcleritis, which is not as painful.' "
Scleritis vs. conjunctivitis,"'Many of the conditions associated with scleritis are serious. ''Conjunctivitis'' is a much more common cause of a ''red eye''. The extreme pain of scleritis helps to differentiate it from other common causes of ''redness of the eyes'' such as ''conjunctivitis'', which can cause ''itching'' and burning, but is not exceptionally painful. There is usually no discharge from the eye in scleritis while there is often a discharge with ''conjunctivitis''.' "
What is necrotizing scleritis?,"'Necrotizing scleritis is the most severe and destructive form of scleritis, sometimes leading to loss of the eye from multiple complications, or occasionally perforation of the eyeball (globe). In necrotizing scleritis, there is breakdown of the scleral tissue.' "
What specialists treat scleritis?,'Ophthalmologists treat scleritis. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who has specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. Your ophthalmologist may consult with an immunologist or ''rheumatologist'' to assist in your treatment depending on the particular situation.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose scleritis?,"'Scleritis is usually diagnosed by the history and the clinical findings on slit lamp examination by an ophthalmologist. The slit lamp is a special viewing instrument that eye specialists use to stabilize the head while magnifying and viewing the structures of the eye.''In order to determine the cause of the scleritis, blood tests including ''rheumatoid factor'', antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, human leukocyte antigen typing, and erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' may be ordered. If infectious disease is suspected, appropriate cultures or serological tests may be necessary. If ''granulomatosis with polyangiitis'' is considered, sinus ''X-rays'' and a ''chest X-ray'' may be ordered. Radiographic examination of joints may assist in the diagnosis of various types of arthritis. If orbital inflammation is suspected in addition to the scleritis, an ''MRI'' of the orbit may be helpful for diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for scleritis?,"'Treatment of scleritis resulting from an underlying disease process usually requires specific therapy for that disease.''Topical treatment with eye drops is an adjunct to such systemic treatment. These eye drops will usually be anti-inflammatory, such as topical steroid drops or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drops (''NSAIDs''). Topical antibiotics are used if the scleritis is felt to be infectious.''In situations where no underlying disease process is found, eye drops to counter inflammation are used, but they are often insufficient to control the process. Systemic treatment with ''NSAIDs'', cortisone medication (''corticosteroids''), or immune modulating agents such as ''methotrexate'' (MTX) can be the first choice. But ''azathioprine'', ''mycophenolate mofetil'', ''cyclophosphamide'', or ''cyclosporine'' are also used. Anti-TNF agents such as the ''biologics'' ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') or ''adalimumab'' (''Humira'') can also be used.''Localized, subconjunctival steroid injections are often helpful in certain situations or if systemic side effects of these ''drugs'' are of concern.''The delivery of steroid eyedrops using a low-level electrical current to encourage drug migration into the affected tissue, known as iontophoresis, is currently in ''clinical trials''.''Rarely, surgical procedures may be required if there is scleral thinning. In order to preserve the integrity of the eye, scleral grafts available through eye banks can be used. Corneal tissue may also be used if there is perforation or severe thinning in the limbal area.'  "
Are there home remedies for scleritis?, 
What are the complications of scleritis?,"'Complications of scleritis include inflammation of the cornea (''keratitis''), anterior or posterior ''uveitis'', ''glaucoma'', ''cataract'', retinal swelling, scleral thinning, peripheral corneal shinning, and retinal macular swelling.''Corneal or scleral thinning, if untreated, may lead to a hole in the side of the eye (''ocular'' perforation) and severe ''vision loss'' or ''blindness''. Scleritis may be recurrent. Long-term treatment with ''corticosteroid'' eye drops may itself cause ''cataract'' and ''glaucoma''.' "
What is the prognosis for scleritis?,"'Scleritis is a serious eye disease which must be evaluated, treated, and monitored aggressively to avoid vision loss. Scleritis may be recurrent, but is usually responsive to therapy. It is critical that any underlying disease be diagnosed and treated. Many of the conditions associated with scleritis are serious and may only be diagnosed during the evaluation for the cause of the scleritis. The scleritis itself may respond to treatment, but the underlying disease process may not.''In general, scleritis in association with ''granulomatosis with polyangiitis'' is difficult to treat and may lead to vision loss even with treatment. The scleritis seen with the spondyloarthropathies is usually very responsive to treatment. Scleritis that occurs in the absence of an underlying disease will typically respond well to treatment. When recurrent scleritis symptoms are noticed, urgent treatment can result in optimal outcome.' "
Is it possible to prevent scleritis?,'Scleritis is an inflammation of the white of the eye. It is a serious eye disease which is often associated with underlying autoimmune disorders. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential in preventing permanent vision loss. There is no preventive treatment for most cases. Patients with underlying disease processes should be made aware of the possibility of scleritis occurring and should have access to immediate care and careful monitoring by an ophthalmologist.' 
What research is being done on scleritis?,'Current research in scleritis is trying to determine the exact immune abnormalities leading to the disease and is searching for more precise medication to target those portions of the immune system.' 
Facts you should know about scleroderma," Scleroderma is a skin disease of the connective tissue featuring thickened skin that can involve scarring, blood vessel problems, varying degrees of inflammation and pain, and is associated with an overactive immune system. CREST syndrome is a limited form of scleroderma. Patients with scleroderma can have specific antibodies (ANA, anticentromere, or anti-topoisomerase) in their blood that suggest autoimmunity. Treatment of scleroderma is primarily directed toward the particular individual's symptoms."
What is scleroderma?,"""Scleroderma is an autoimmune condition of the connective tissue characterized by skin thickening, spontaneous scarring, blood vessel disease, and varying degrees of inflammation, associated with an overactive immune system. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. Scleroderma is characterized by the formation of ""'scar tissue'' (fibrosis) in the skin. This leads to thickness and firmness of involved skin. This may also occur in internal organs such as the kidney.''Scleroderma is classified as localized or widespread (systemic scleroderma with a tendency to affect internal organs). Systemic scleroderma is further divided into limited and diffuse based upon the extent of cutaneous involvement.'  "
What causes scleroderma?,"'The cause of scleroderma is not known. Researchers have found some evidence that certain genes are important hereditary factors, but the environment seems to also play a role. The result is activation of the immune system in a susceptible individual, causing damage to the inner lining of tiny blood vessels and injury to tissues that result in ''scar'' tissue formation and the accumulation of excess collagen.''The fact that genes seem to cause a predisposition to developing scleroderma means that inheritance at least plays a partial role. It is not unusual to find other autoimmune diseases in families of scleroderma patients. Some evidence for the role genes may play in leading to the development of scleroderma comes from the study of Choctaw Native Americans who are the group with the highest reported prevalence of the disease. The condition is more frequent in females than in males.' "
What are risk factors for developing scleroderma?,"'Because of the known association of certain genes with scleroderma, it may be that combinations of exposures to environmental factors and possibly certain ''viruses'' may trigger the development of scleroderma in genetically susceptible people. The precise interplay of pathology leading to blood vessel damage, scar and collagen accumulation, and autoimmunity is unclear.' "
How do health care professionals classify scleroderma?,"'Scleroderma can be classified in terms of the degree and location of the skin and organ involvement. Accordingly, scleroderma has been categorized into two major groups, localized scleroderma and systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis is further subdivided into either diffuse or limited forms based on the location and extent of cutaneous involvement.''Localized scleroderma skin changes are in isolated areas, either as morphea patches or linear scleroderma. Morphea is scleroderma that is localized to a patchy area of the skin that becomes hardened and slightly pigmented. Sometimes morphea can cause multiple oval-shaped lesions in the skin. Morphea is not associated with disease elsewhere within the body, only in the involved skin areas. Linear scleroderma is scleroderma that is localized usually to a lower extremity, frequently presenting as a strip of hardening skin down the leg of a child. Linear scleroderma in children can stunt bone growth of the affected limb. Sometimes linear scleroderma is associated with a ""satellite"" area of a patch of localized scleroderma skin, such as on the abdomen.''The widespread type of scleroderma involves internal organs in addition to the skin. This type, called systemic sclerosis, is subcategorized by the extent of skin involvement as either diffuse or limited. The diffuse form of scleroderma (diffuse systemic sclerosis) involves symmetric thickening of skin of the extremities, face, and trunk (chest, back, abdomen, or flanks) that can rapidly progress to hardening after an early inflammatory phase. Organ disease can occur early on and be serious and significantly decrease life expectancy. Organs affected include the ''esophagus'', bowels, and scarring (fibrosis) of the ''lungs'', ''heart'', and kidneys. ''High blood pressure'' can be troublesome and can lead to ''kidney failure'' (renal crisis).''The limited form of scleroderma tends to have far less skin involvement with skin thickening confined to the skin of the fingers, hands, and face. The skin changes and other features of disease tend to occur more slowly than in the diffuse form. Because characteristic clinical features can occur in patients with the limited form of scleroderma, this form has taken another name that is composed of the first initials of the common components. Thus, this form is also called the ""CREST"" variant of scleroderma. CREST syndrome represents the following features:''C''...Calcinosis refers to the formation of tiny calcium deposits in the skin. This is seen as hard whitish areas in the superficial skin, commonly overlying the elbows, knees, or fingers. These firm deposits can be tender, can become infected, and can fall off spontaneously or require surgical removal. This is the least common of the CREST scleroderma variant features.''R''...'""Raynaud's""' phenomenon refers to the spasm of the tiny arterial vessels supplying blood to the fingers, toes, nose, tongue, or ears. These areas turn white, then blue, then red after exposure to extremes of ''cold'', or even sometimes with extremes of heat or emotional upset. This can lead to tiny areas of damage to the tips of the fingers (digital ulcers) or larger areas of dead skin on the ends of the fingers.''E''...Esophagus disease in scleroderma is characterized by dysmotility (poorly functioning muscle of the lower two-thirds of the esophagus, the swallowing tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach). This can lead to an abnormally wide esophagus that allows stomach acid to backflow into the esophagus to cause ''heartburn'', inflammation, and potentially scarring that narrows the esophagus. This can eventually lead to difficulty in passing food from the mouth through the esophagus into the stomach. Symptoms of heartburn are treated aggressively in patients with scleroderma in order to prevent injury to the esophagus.''S''...Sclerodactyly is the localized thickening and tightness of the skin of the fingers or toes. This can give them a ""shiny"" and slightly puffy appearance. The tightness can cause severe limitation of motion of the fingers and toes. These skin changes generally progress much slower than those of patients with the diffuse form of scleroderma.''T''...''Telangiectasias'' are tiny red areas, frequently on the face, hands, and in the mouth behind the lips. These areas blanch when they are pressed upon and represent widened (dilated) capillaries.''Patients with limited systemic sclerosis can have variations of CREST with differing manifestations, for example, CRST, REST, or ST. Occasionally, patients can have initial illness with features of CREST that evolve into the diffuse form of scleroderma. Some patients have ""overlaps"" of scleroderma and other connective tissue diseases, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', and ''polymyositis''. When features of scleroderma are present along with features of ''polymyositis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', and certain abnormal blood tests, the condition is referred to as ''mixed connective tissue disease'' (''MCTD'').'  "
What are scleroderma symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms of scleroderma depend on the type of scleroderma present and the extent of external and internal involvement in the individual affected. Because scleroderma can involve the skin, esophagus, blood vessels, kidneys, lungs, ''blood pressure'', and bowels, the symptoms it causes can affect many areas of the body.''Scleroderma affects the skin to cause local or widespread signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, tenderness, ''itching'', and ''pain'"") that can lead to skin tightness or hardening and a mask-like face. These skin changes can be widespread, but it's most common for them to affect the fingers, ""'feet'', face, and neck. This can lead to decreased range of motion of the fingers, toes, and jaw. Tiny areas of calcification (calcinosis), while not common, can sometimes be noticed as hard nodules at the tips of the elbows, knees, in the fingers, or over joints.''Scleroderma commonly affects the esophagus leading to heartburn. This is directly a result of stomach acid flowing back up into the esophagus. Sometimes this can lead to scarring of the esophagus, resulting in narrowing with ''difficulty swallowing'' food and/or localized pain in the central chest.''Blood vessels that can be affected include the tiny arterioles of the finger tips, toes, and elsewhere. These vessels can have a tendency to spasm when the areas are exposed to cold, leading to whiteness, blueness, and redness of involved fingers, toes, and sometimes nose or ears. These color changes are referred to as '""Raynaud's"""" phenomenon. This may precede the development of other features of scleroderma by years. It should be noted that Raynaud's phenomenon can be an isolated disease without any other disease such as scleroderma developing. Raynaud's phenomenon can cause inadequate supply of oxygen to the involved tips of fingers or toes, causing tiny ulcers or blackened (dead) skin. Sometimes Raynaud's phenomenon is also associated with tingling. Other blood vessels that can be involved in scleroderma are the tiny capillaries of the face, lips, mouth, and fingers. These capillaries widen (dilate), forming tiny, red blanching spots, called ""'telangiectasias''. Rarely, telangiectasias in the stomach (called ""watermelon stomach"" because of its appearance) can present a serious risk of bleeding and require close monitoring by gastroenterologists.''Elevated blood pressure is potentially serious and can lead to kidney damage (renal crisis). Symptoms include ''headache'', ''fatigue'', and in severe cases, ''stroke''. Blood pressure monitoring and control is essential.''Inflammation of the lungs in scleroderma can cause scarring, resulting in ''shortness of breath'', especially with physical exertion. Elevated pressure in the arteries to the lungs (''pulmonary hypertension'') can also cause shortness of breath and difficulty getting an adequate breath with activity.''Scleroderma involvement in the heart can lead to damage to heart muscle, irregular heart rhythms, abnormal electrical activity of the heart, and inflammation around the heart (''pericarditis'').''Scleroderma affecting the large bowel (colon) most often causes ''constipation'' but can also lead to cramping and ''diarrhea''. When this is severe, complete ''stool'' blockage (fecal impaction) can result.'  "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of scleroderma?,"'The diagnosis of the scleroderma syndrome is based on the detection of the clinical features of the illness. In addition, nearly all patients with scleroderma have blood tests that suggest autoimmunity and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are usually detectable. A particular antibody, the anticentromere antibody, is found almost exclusively in the limited, or CREST, form of systemic sclerosis. Anti-Scl 70 antibody (antitopoisomerase I antibody) is most often seen in patients with the diffuse form of systemic sclerosis.''Other tests are used to evaluate the presence or extent of any internal disease. These may include upper and lower gastrointestinal tests to evaluate the stomach and bowels, chest ''X-rays'', lung function testing (pulmonary function test), and CAT scanning to examine the lungs, ''EKG'' and echocardiograms, and sometimes heart catheterization to evaluate the pressure in the arteries of the heart and lungs for ''pulmonary hypertension''.' "
What are medical treatments for scleroderma?,"'Treatment of scleroderma is directed toward the individual features affecting different areas of the body.''Aggressive treatments of elevations in blood pressure have been extremely important in preventing ''kidney failure''. Blood pressure medications, particularly the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of ''drugs'', such as ''lisinopril'', are frequently used.''Some research indicates that ''colchicine'' can be helpful in decreasing the inflammation and tenderness that periodically accompanies the calcinosis nodules in the skin. Skin ''itching'' can be relieved with lotions (emollients) such as Eucerin, Lubriderm, and Curel.'""Mild Raynaud's phenomenon may require only hand warming and protection. Low-dose ""'aspirin'' is often added to prevent tiny ''blood clots'"" in the fingers, especially in patients with a history of fingertip ulcerations. Moderate Raynaud's phenomenon can be helped by medications that open up the arteries, such as ""'nifedipine'' (''Procardia'', Adalat), ''nicardipine'' (''Cardene''), and ''diltiazem'' (''Cardizem''), or with topical ''nitroglycerin'' applied to the most affected digit (most effective on the sides of the digit where the arteries are). Gently applied finger splinting can protect tender tissues. (It is important to not constrict the tiny arteries on the sides of the fingers when protecting them with splints, ''braces'', or band aid materials.) A class of medications that is typically used for ''depression'', called serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), can sometimes improve the circulation of the affected digit. Drugs that constrict blood vessels, such as pseudoephedrine (''Sudafed'' ''decongestant'""), should be avoided. Severe Raynaud's phenomenon can require surgical procedures, such as those to interrupt the nerves of the finger that stimulate constriction of the blood vessels (digital sympathectomy). Ulcerations of the fingers can require topical or oral antibiotics.""'Esophagus irritation and heartburn can be relieved with ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium''), or ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''). Antacids can also be helpful. Elevating the head of the bed can reduce the back flow of acid into the esophagus that causes inflammation and heartburn. Avoiding ''caffeine'' and ''cigarette smoking'' also helps. Of note, there is an increased risk of developing ''lung cancer'' in people with scleroderma. This ''cancer'' risk is even greater in those who smoke.''Constipation'', cramping, and ''diarrhea'' are sometimes caused by bacteria that can be treated with ''tetracycline'' (Sumycin), ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', Pce, Pediazole, Ilosone), ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro''), or ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl''). Increased fluid intake and ''fiber'' intake are good general measures to take to reduce these symptoms. A variety of medications that promote movement of the bowels are available.''Irritated, ''itchy'' ''dry skin'' can be helped by emollients such as Lubriderm, Eucerin, or Curel.''Telangiectasias, such as those on the face, can be treated with local laser therapy. Sun exposure should be minimized as it can worsen telangiectasias. Telangiectasias from watermelon stomach can require laser treatments to the stomach.''Approximately 10% of patients with the CREST variant develop elevated pressures in the blood vessels to the lungs (pulmonary ''hypertension''). Abnormally elevated blood pressure of the arteries supplying the lungs is often treated with calcium antagonist medications, such as nifedipine (Procardia), and blood-thinning drugs (anticoagulation). More severe pulmonary ''hypertension'' can be helped by continuous intravenous infusion or ''inhalation'' of prostacyclin (Iloprost). Taken by mouth, ''bosentan'' (''Tracleer'') is used to treat pulmonary ''hypertension''. In addition, ''sildenafil'' (''Revatio'') and ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis'') are approved to treat pulmonary hypertension.''Additionally, medicines are used to suppress the overly active immune system that seems to be spontaneously causing the disease in organs. Immunosuppressants used for this purpose include D-''penicillamine'', ''azathioprine'' (Imuran, Azasan), and ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). Serious inflammation of the lungs (alveolitis) can require immune suppression with ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan'') along with ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred''). The optimal treatment of scleroderma lung disease is an area of active research. Stem-cell transplantation is being explored as a possible option.''No medicine has been found to be universally effective for patients with scleroderma. In an individual patient, the illness may be mild and not require treatments. In some, the disease is ravaging, relentless, and can lead to death. Because blood vessel damage is a primary part of the pathology of scleroderma, patients with this condition must not smoke.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with scleroderma?,"""A patient's prognosis is optimized with close monitoring of overall health status and treatment of complications, especially elevated blood pressure. This can involve medical subspecialists, including ""'rheumatologists'', pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, nephrologists, and cardiologists. Research indicates that the critical period of organ risk is generally within the first three years of skin involvement. This means that patients can be reassured that their risk of life-threatening organ complications is significantly less after three years of having skin symptoms and not having internal organ problems.''Patients with diffuse skin involvement tend to do worse than those with limited skin involvement. Those with limited disease of the skin can develop serious lung scarring (''interstitial lung disease'') and pulmonary artery hypertension even after a decade of disease. Lung disease is the leading cause of death. Those with poor pulmonary function tests can have worse outcomes.''Scleroderma continues to challenge medical scientists. Researchers are evaluating the effectiveness of ''thalidomide'' (''Thalomid'') for the treatment of scleroderma. More sensitive tests to detect early lung disease of scleroderma are also being evaluated. Ongoing research into new medications for pulmonary hypertension are in ''clinical trials''. Researchers are also evaluating the possible role of stem-cell transplantation for certain serious forms of scleroderma.''Many researchers are investigating the roles of various cell messengers, called cytokines, in causing scleroderma. Researchers are also currently studying a hormone of ''pregnancy'', called relaxin, for the treatment of scleroderma. Preliminary results suggest that it may improve scleroderma. Relaxin normally loosens the ligaments of the pelvis and ripens the womb for ''childbirth''. How it might work in scleroderma is unclear.''It is clear that our understanding of the effects of the immune system in scleroderma is greatly improving. Many clinical ''research trials'' are under way to evaluate potential treatments for various aspects of the disease to improve the prognosis for patients with scleroderma. Further research supported by the Scleroderma Foundation, ''Arthritis'' Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health will lead to better understanding the illness and more optimal care for patients with scleroderma.' "
Is it possible to prevent scleroderma?,'There is no ''prevention'' method or ''diet'' to avoid or decrease the risk of scleroderma.' 
Facts you should know about sclerotherapy," During the sclerotherapy procedure, a health care professional injects chemicals into smaller veins, which damage the inner lining and produce a clot. As the clot is reabsorbed, the vessel is permanently obliterated. The choice of the chemical sclerosing agent and its physical form depend on the size of the vessel to be treated. Treatment of the correct vessels can improve the symptoms of venous insufficiency. Small superficial vessels are often destroyed for cosmetic reasons."
What is sclerotherapy?,"'Sclerotherapy is a medical procedure whereby a chemical, the sclerosant, is injected into a vein to entirely obliterate it. The sclerosant damages the innermost lining of the vessel (the endothelium), resulting in a clot that blocks the blood circulation in the vein beyond. Veins carry unoxygenated blood from the peripheral tissues back to the ''heart''. Since the venous ''blood pressure'' in the veins is low, the blood is pumped by forward by contractions of the heart. To prevent back-flow, most veins have valves that only allow blood only to flow in the direction of the heart. When these valves become incompetent, veins become enlarged and bulging (varicose). Smaller veins that feed these ''varicose veins'' can also become enlarged and appear as red or blue ''spider veins'' in the skin. ''Varicose veins'' can lead to a chronic swelling condition of the leg called venous insufficiency. Venous insufficiency predisposes a person to ''leg swelling'', ''blood clots'', and skin ulceration. Even more frequently, damaged veins are manifested as unsightly ''spider veins''. The destruction of these types of veins can be desirable both medically and cosmetically.' "
Is sclerotherapy safe?,"'All medical procedures have risks that should be considered carefully prior to embarking on a particular treatment. Since sclerotherapy is frequently used to treat cosmetic problems, untoward and dangerous side effects ought to be fully explained to the patient.' "
Does sclerotherapy hurt?,"'Because this procedure requires injections through the skin, it is not a painless procedure. Some chemicals that are injected (sclerosants) are more likely to cause ''pain'' than others. If the sclerosant is deposited outside the vein inadvertently, this is often more painful.' "
Is sclerotherapy an effective treatment for varicose veins and spider veins?,"'Sclerotherapy is an effective technique to obliterate or collapse veins. Other techniques include surgical removal of the offending vein, endovenous laser destruction (fiberoptic-transmitted laser light) and, for very small vessels, percutaneous laser light or intense pulsed-light exposure are also effective.'  "
Who is a good candidate for sclerotherapy?,"'Those with venous insufficiency who have disease that is poorly controlled with compression stockings and who are not ''obese'' are ideal candidates for sclerotherapy. To determine if sclerotherapy obliteration is likely to be of benefit, the site of the defective vein is identified as well as the venous drainage pattern. Healthy people who complain of unsightly superficial veins of small caliber (4 mm or less) are also candidates for sclerotherapy.' "
How do people prepare for the sclerotherapy procedure?,"'Patients are screened using special ''ultrasound'' techniques to determine the site of venous disease prior to treatment. In situations where there is only a small area of ''spider veins'', this is rarely done.' "
How does a doctor administer sclerotherapy injections?,"'There are now two FDA-approved sclerosants available, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (a detergent) and polidocanol (Asclera). For small veins, hypertonic saline is occasionally used. Depending on the size of the vein to be treated, the sclerosant may be administered as foam. A needle of the appropriate caliber is inserted into the vessel to be treated, and the chemical is injected.' "
What is the recovery time for sclerotherapy?,'This is an outpatient procedure and the patient leaves the office on the same day of treatment.' 
What aftercare is needed following a sclerotherapy procedure?,'Patients should wear compression dressings for one to three weeks after treatment. A follow-up visit within two weeks to enable the evacuation of blood clots in larger veins can improve the prognosis and the appearance.' 
What are the benefits of sclerotherapy?,"'For patients with venous insufficiency, treatment can be beneficial by improving venous blood flow and limiting chronic swelling. For those with cosmetic complaints, their appearance can be improved.' "
"What are risks, side effects, and complications of sclerotherapy?","'Sclerotherapy risks, side effects, and complications include ''hyperpigmentation'', temporary swelling, capillary dilation (telangiectatic matting), ''pain'' from the injection, localized ''hives'', tape compression ''blister'', tape compression ''folliculitis'', and recurrence, ''vasovagal'' reflex, localized hair growth (hirsutism), skin death (cutaneous necrosis), ''allergic reaction'', superficial ''thrombophlebitis'', arterial injection, ''pulmonary embolism'', ''deep vein thrombosis'', nerve damage, and ''migraine'' ''headaches''.'  "
"Does insurance cover the 
cost of sclerotherapy?","'Although insurance companies differ in their coverage and preapproval is always helpful, the treatment of venous insufficiency is usually covered. The treatment of cosmetic problems including spider veins is rarely covered.' "
What is scoliosis?,"'Scoliosis is a disorder that causes an abnormal curve of the spine, or backbone. There is a normal spinal curve when looking from the side, but the spine should appear straight when looking from the front. ''Kyphosis'' is a curve in the spine seen from the side in which the spine is bent forward. There is a normal kyphosis in the middle (thoracic) spine. Lordosis is a curve seen from the side in which the spine is bent backward. There is a normal lordosis in the upper (cervical) spine and the lower spine or lumbar spine. People with scoliosis develop additional curves to either side of the body, and the bones of the spine twist on each other, forming a C or an S-shaped or scoliosis curve in the spine. Scoliosis ranges from 10-20 degrees (mild), 20-50 degrees (moderate), and severe (greater than 50 degrees).''Scoliosis is about two times more common in girls than boys. It can be seen at any age, but it is most common in those over about 10 years of age. Scoliosis is hereditary in that people with scoliosis are more likely to have children with scoliosis; however, there is no correlation between the severity of the curves from one generation to the next.'  "
What causes scoliosis?,"'Scoliosis affects about 2% of females and 0.5% of males. In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown (known as idiopathic). This type of scoliosis is described based on the age when scoliosis develops, as are other some other types of scoliosis.''More than 80% of people with scoliosis have idiopathic scoliosis, the most common type of scoliosis, and the majority of those are adolescent girls; the most common location for scoliosis is in the thoracic spine.''Medical literature often has more specific names or terms for scoliosis:'   If the person is less than 3 years old, it is called infantile idiopathic scoliosis (or early-onset, that is associated with other problems like chest wall deformities, spina bifida, and others). Scoliosis that develops between 3-10 years of age is called juvenile idiopathic scoliosis. People who are over 10 years old (10-18 years old) have adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Kyphoscoliosis: a combination of outward and lateral spine curvature Dextroscoliosis: curvature of the spine to the right Rotoscoliosis (rotatory): curvature of the vertebral column turned on its axis Levoconvex: curvature of the spine to the left Thoracolumbar: curvature related to both the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spine"
What are the causes of other types of scoliosis?,"'As stated above, idiopathic scoliosis and its subtypes comprise over 80% of all scoliosis patients. However, there are three other main types of scoliosis:''There are other potential causes of scoliosis, including spine tumors such as osteoid osteoma. This is a benign ''tumor'' that can occur in the spine and cause ''pain''. The ''pain'' causes people to lean to the opposite side to reduce the amount of pressure applied to the tumor. This can lead to a spinal deformity. In addition, researchers suggest that genetics (hereditary), muscle disorders, and/or abnormal fibrillin metabolism may play a role in causing or contributing to scoliosis development.' Functional: In this type of scoliosis, the spine is normal, but an abnormal curve develops because of a problem somewhere else in the body. This could be caused by one leg being shorter than the other, carrying heavy loads that cause unequal weight-bearing, or by muscle spasms in the back. Neuromuscular: In this type of scoliosis, there is a problem when the bones of the spine are formed. Either the bones of the spine fail to form completely or they fail to separate from each other during fetal development. This type of congenital scoliosis develops in people with other disorders, including birth defects, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, or Marfan syndrome (an inherited connective tissue disease). People with these conditions often develop a long C-shaped curve and have weak muscles that are unable to hold them up straight. If the curve is present at birth, it is called congenital scoliosis. This type of scoliosis is often much more severe (severe scoliosis) and needs more aggressive treatment than other forms of scoliosis. Degenerative: Unlike the other forms of scoliosis that are found in children and teens, degenerative scoliosis occurs in older adults. It is caused by changes in the spine due to arthritis known as spondylosis. Weakening of the normal ligaments and other soft tissues of the spine combined with abnormal bone spurs can lead to an abnormal curvature of the spine. The spine can also be affected by osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, and disc degeneration."
What are risk factors for scoliosis?,"'Age is a risk factor as the symptoms often begin between 9-15 years of age. Being a female increases the risk of scoliosis, and females have a higher risk of worsening spine curvature than males. Although many individuals who develop the problem do not have family members with scoliosis, a family history of scoliosis increases the risk of the disease. ' "
What are scoliosis symptoms and signs?,"'The most common symptom of scoliosis is an abnormal curve of the spine. Often this is a mild change and may be first noticed by a friend or family member or physician doing routine screening of children for school or sports. The change in the curve of the spine typically occurs very slowly so it is easy to miss until it becomes a more severe physical deformity. It can also be found on a routine school screening examination for scoliosis. Those affected may notice that their clothes do not fit as they did previously, they may notice an uneven waist, or that pant legs are longer on one side than the other.''Scoliosis may cause the head to appear off center, leaning to one side or notice one hip or shoulder to be higher than the opposite side. Someone may have a more obvious curve on one side of the rib cage on their back from twisting of the vertebrae and ribs. If the scoliosis is more severe, it can make it more difficult for the ''heart'' and ''lungs'' to work properly. This can cause ''shortness of breath'' and ''chest pain''.''In most cases, scoliosis is not painful, but there are certain types of scoliosis than can cause ''back pain'', rib pain, ''neck pain'', muscle spasms, and ''abdominal pain''. Additionally, there are other causes of these nonspecific pains, which a doctor will want to look for as well to rule out other diseases.'  "
What tests to health care professionals use to diagnose scoliosis?,"'If someone thinks he or she has scoliosis, see a doctor for an examination. The doctor will ask questions, including if there is any family history of scoliosis, or if there has been any pain, ''weakness'', or other medical problems.''The physical examination involves looking at the curve of the spine from the sides, front, and back. The person will be asked to undress from the waist up to better see any abnormal curves, physical deformities, or uneven waist. The person will then bend over trying to touch their toes. This position can make the curve more obvious. The doctor will also look at the symmetry of the body to see if the hips and shoulders are at the same height, leaning to one side, or if there is sideways curvature. Any skin changes will also be identified that can suggest scoliosis due to a birth defect. A doctor may check your range of motion, muscle strength, and reflexes.'""The more growth that a person has remaining increases the chances of scoliosis getting worse. As a result, the doctor may measure the person's height and weight for comparison with future visits. Other clues to the amount of growth remaining are signs of ""'puberty'' such as the presence of breasts or pubic hair and whether menstrual periods have begun in girls. Skeletal maturity occurs at about 14.5 years of age in females and about 16.5 years in males.''If the doctor believes a patient has scoliosis, the patient could either be asked to return for an additional examination in several months to see if there is any change or the doctor may obtain X-rays of the back. If X-rays are obtained, the doctor can make measurements from them to determine how large of a spinal curve is present. This can help decide what treatment, if any, is necessary. Measurements from future visits can be compared to see if the curve is getting worse.''It is important that the doctor knows how much further growth (growth spurt) the patient has left. Additional X-rays of the hand, wrist, or pelvis can help determine how much more the patient will grow. If a doctor finds any changes in the function of the nerves, he or she may order other imaging tests of your spine, including an MRI or ''CT scan'' to look more closely at the bones and nerves of the spine.'  "
What types of specialists treat scoliosis?,"""Usually, a person's primary care or pediatric physician notices the problem and consults a board-certified orthopedic surgeon or neurosurgeon (spine surgeon) who specializes in spine surgery. In addition, it may be necessary to consult a rehabilitation specialist and/or a physical therapist. Some patients may need a ""'neurologist'', orthotist (brace designer), or an occupational therapist as part of the treatment team.' "
What is the treatment for scoliosis?,"'Treatment of scoliosis is based on the severity of the curve and the chances of the curve getting worse. Certain types of scoliosis have a greater chance of getting worse, so the type of scoliosis also helps to determine the proper treatment. There are three main categories of treatment: observation, bracing (for example, thoracolumbosacral orthosis or TLSO back brace), and surgery. Consequently, there are treatments available that do not involve surgery, but in some individuals, surgery may be their best option.''Functional scoliosis is caused by an abnormality elsewhere in the body. This type of scoliosis is treated by treating that abnormality, such as a difference in leg length. A small wedge can be placed in the shoe to help even out the leg length and prevent the spine from curving. There is no direct treatment of the spine because the spine is normal in these people.''Neuromuscular scoliosis is caused by an abnormal development of the bones of the spine. These types of scoliosis have the greatest chance for getting worse. Observation and bracing do not normally work well for these people. The majority of these people will eventually need surgery to stop the curve from getting worse.''Treatment of idiopathic scoliosis usually is based on the age when it develops.''In many cases, infantile idiopathic scoliosis will improve without any treatment. X-rays can be obtained and measurements compared on future visits to determine if the curve is getting worse. Bracing is not normally effective in these people.''Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis has the highest risk for getting worse of all of the idiopathic types of scoliosis. Bracing can be tried early if the curve is not very severe. The goal is to prevent the curve from getting worse until the person stops growing. Since the curve starts early in these people, and they have a lot of time left to grow, there is a higher chance for needing more aggressive treatment or surgery.''Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form of scoliosis. If the curve is small when first diagnosed, it can be observed and followed with routine X-rays and measurements. If the curve or Cobb angle stays below about 20-25 degrees (Cobb method or angle, is a measurement of the degree of curvature), no other treatment is needed. The patient may return to see the doctor every three to four months to check for any worsening of the curve. Additional X-rays may be repeated each year to obtain new measurements and check for progression of the curve. If the curve is between 25-40 degrees and the patient is still growing, a brace may be recommended. Bracing is not recommended for people who have finished growing. If the curve is greater than 40 degrees, then surgery may be recommended.''As explained above, scoliosis is not typically associated with ''back pain''. However, in some patients with ''back pain'', the symptoms can be lessened with physical therapy, ''massage'', stretches, and exercises, including ''yoga'' (but refraining from twisting pressures on the spine). These activities can help to strengthen the muscles of the back. Medical treatment is mainly limited to pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs'') and anti-inflammatory injections. These treatments are not, however, a cure for scoliosis and will not be able to correct the abnormal curve.'  "
What is the treatment for scoliosis? (Continued),"'There are several different types of ''braces'' available for scoliosis. Some need to be worn nearly 24 hours a day and are removed only for showering. Others can be worn only at night. The ability of a brace to work depends on the person following the instructions from the doctor and wearing the brace as directed. ''Braces'' are not designed to correct the curve. They are used to help slow or stop the curve from getting worse with good back brace management treatment. Intermittent or chronic discomfort may be a side effect of any treatments used to slow or correct the spinal curvature.'""If the curve stays below 40 degrees until the person is finished growing, it is not likely to get worse later in life. However, if the curve is greater than 40 degrees, it is likely to continue to get worse by 1-2 degrees each year for the rest of the person's life, a long-term effect of the disease. If this is not prevented, the person could eventually be at risk for heart or lung problems. The goals of surgery for scoliosis are as follows: correcting and stabilizing the curve, reducing pain, and restoring a more normal curve and appearance to the spinal column.""'Surgery involves correcting the curve back to as close to normal as possible and performing a ''spinal fusion'' to hold it in place. This is done with a combination of screws, hooks, and rods that are attached to the bones of the spine to hold them in place. The surgeon places bone graft around the bones to be fused (spinal fusion) to get them to grow together and become solid. This prevents any further curvature in that portion of the spine. In most cases, the screws and rods will remain in the spine and not need to be removed. There are many different ways for a surgeon to perform the fusion surgery. It may be all performed from a single incision on the back of the spine or combined with another incision along your front or side. This decision is based on the location and severity of the curve.''Surgery recovery and ''scar'"" formation varies some from person to person. A doctor will use medications to control the patient's pain initially after surgery. A patient will likely be up out of bed to a chair the first day after surgery and will work with a physical therapist who will assist him or her in ""'walking'' after the surgery. As the patient continues to recover, it is important to improve muscle strength. The physical therapist can help the patient with exercises for the muscles that will also help with the pain. Typically, a young person will miss about six weeks of school and may take about six months to return to their normal activities, although recovery time varies between individuals.'""As with any surgery, there are risks of surgery for scoliosis. The amount of risk depends partially on the patient's age, the degree of curve, the cause of the curve, and the amount of correction attempted. In most cases, the surgeon will use a technique called neuromonitoring during surgery. This allows the surgeon to monitor the function of the spinal cord and nerves during surgery. If they are being placed at increased risk of damage, the surgeon is alerted and can adjust the procedure to reduce those risks. There is a small risk of infection with any surgery. This risk is decreased with the use of antibiotics, but it can still occur in some cases. Other potential risks include injury to nerves or blood vessels, bleeding, continued curve progression after surgery, broken rods or screws, and the need for further surgery. Each of these is rare.""'If a tumor such as osteoid osteoma is the cause of the scoliosis, surgery to remove the tumor is generally able to correct the curve.''People with degenerative scoliosis will often have more complaints of ''back pain'' and ''leg pain''. This is related to the arthritis in the back and possible compression of the nerve roots that lead to the legs. Nonoperative treatment including physical therapy, exercises, and gentle chiropractic can help relieve these symptoms in some cases. People who fail to improve with these treatments may benefit from surgery. X-rays and possible three-dimensional ''MRIs'' will be obtained to plan for surgery. The surgery could include only a decompression or removal of bone spurs that are compressing the nerves. In some cases, a fusion will be necessary to stabilize the spine and possibly correct the abnormal curve. The cost of scoliosis surgery can be high; according to the Spinal Cord Society of surgeons, an average cost per operation (rod implants to straighten the spine) is $150,000 and may be higher or lower depending on the individual procedure.' "
Are there home remedies for scoliosis?,"'There are many home remedies that have been described for scoliosis; some involve herbal treatments, ''diet'' therapy, massage, physical therapy, stretches, certain exercises, and nutritional ''supplements'' like L-selenomethionine. A mattress that is composed of latex, memory foam, or cool gel (latex mattress infused with gel retains less heat than latex alone, also termed gel memory foam) and is adjustable (height of head and foot of bed can be adjusted) is recommended by some clinicians and patients. Patients are advised to discuss these treatments, especially exercises, with their doctor before starting any home remedies. Medical treatments are mainly ''over-the-counter'' pain medications when needed. Home remedies and medical treatments may reduce discomfort but do not provide a cure for scoliosis.' "
What is the prognosis for scoliosis?,"'School screening programs have helped to identify many cases of scoliosis early. This allows people to be treated with either observation or bracing and avoid the need for surgery in many cases. Most people with scoliosis can live full, productive, and normal lives with a relatively normal life expectancy. People with scoliosis are able to become ''pregnant'' and have children with no increased risk for complications. They may be at increased risk for additional ''low back pain'' during ''pregnancy''. In general, as the degree of spine curvature increases, the prognosis worsens.''Newer advances in surgery have allowed for less invasive surgical methods that have less pain and shorter recovery periods. Surgery recovery time depends on the specific procedure that is performed; some may require an extended hospital stay with an in-patient stay at a rehabilitation facility (several weeks) while others may recover quickly and not require a rehabilitation facility. These techniques are still being developed, but the initial results are very promising.''Occasionally, untreated scoliosis can lead to deformity of the spine that is severe, painful, and result in the individual being unable to work or walk normally. Scoliosis may very rarely compromise ''breathing'' and cause death. Complications of pain and infections may rarely occur with treatments but may occur with surgery. Occasionally, patients are too optimistic about their treatments so patients are advised to discuss their expectations and follow up with their doctor to better understand the long-term prognosis and effects of their treatment.''The life expectancy has been reported to be reduced possibly by about 14 years in some individuals, especially those with more severe Cobb angle that is untreated but not all specialists agree with this controversial conclusion. Other clinicians either choose to avoid the controversy and say nothing while others suggest most people will have a near normal life span. Each individual with scoliosis should ask their treating physician about their life expectancy and potential for quality of life in the future with or without various treatment options.' "
Is there a cure for scoliosis? Is it possible to prevent scoliosis?,"'At this time, there is no cure for scoliosis. There are good treatment options as discussed above. Researchers are trying to find the causes of the different types of idiopathic scoliosis. This will hopefully lead to better treatments or a cure. Because the cause of idiopathic scoliosis is not known, there is no known way to prevent the problem. However, doctors speculate that doing certain exercises (''Pilates'', yoga, for example, with moves that torque or twist the spine) may make scoliosis worse. Gymnastics activities (like doing back bends), carrying weight on one side of the body (like a backpack on one shoulder), and using a trampoline are examples of ways to potentially make scoliosis worse.'

Cancer Screening Test Facts*,"'*''Cancer'' screening test facts medical author: Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD' Cancer screening tests are tests that look for the presence of cancer in healthy people or people without symptoms of cancer. Cancer screening tests are designed to find cancers at an early stage when they are more treatable. Some cancer screening tests have been found to lower the death rate (mortality rate) from certain cancers. Examples of some common cancer screening tests that are known to lower cancer death rates include colonoscopy for colon cancer, mammography for breast cancer, and Pap smear for cervical cancer. Some cancer screening tests are recommended only for people at high risk of developing cancer, such as MRI of the breast for women at increased risk of breast cancer."
Screening Tests,"'Many cancer screening tests are in use. Some tests have been shown both to find cancer early and to lower the chance of dying from the disease. Others have been shown to find cancer early but have not been shown to reduce the risk of dying from cancer; however, they may still be offered to people, especially those who are known to be at increased risk of cancer.'  "
Screening Tests That Have Been Shown to Reduce Cancer Deaths,"   Colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and high-sensitivity fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs)These tests have all been shown to reduce deaths from colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy also help prevent colorectal cancer because they can detect abnormal colon growths (polyps) that can be removed before they develop into cancer. Expert groups generally recommend that people who are at average risk for colorectal cancer have screening at ages 50 through 75. Low-dose helical computed tomographyThis test to screen for lung cancer has been shown to reduce lung cancer deaths among heavy smokers ages 55 to 74. MammographyThis method to screen for breast cancer has been shown to reduce mortality from the disease among women ages 40 to 74, especially those age 50 or older. Pap test and human papillomavirus (HPV) testingThese tests reduce the incidence of cervical cancer because they allow abnormal cells to be identified and treated before they become cancer. They also reduce deaths from cervical cancer. Testing is generally recommended to begin at age 21 and to end at age 65, as long as recent results have been normal."
Other Screening Tests,"   Alpha-fetoprotein blood testThis test is sometimes used, along with ultrasound of the liver, to try to detect liver cancer early in people at high risk of the disease. Breast MRIThis imaging test is often used for women who carry a harmful mutation in the BRCA1 gene or the BRCA2 gene; such women have a high risk of breast cancer, as well as increased risk for other cancers. CA-125 testThis blood test, which is often done together with a transvaginal ultrasound, may be used to try to detect ovarian cancer early, especially in women with an increased risk of the disease. Although this test can help in diagnosing ovarian cancer in women who have symptoms and can be used to evaluate the recurrence of cancer in women previously diagnosed with the disease, it has not been shown to be an effective ovarian cancer screening test. Clinical breast exams and regular breast self-examsRoutine examination of the breasts by health care providers or by women themselves has not been shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer. However, if a woman or her health care provider notices a lump or other unusual change in the breast, it is important to get it checked out. PSA testThis blood test, which is often done along with a digital rectal exam, is able to detect prostate cancer at an early stage. However, expert groups no longer recommend routine PSA testing for most men because studies have shown that it has little or no effect on prostate cancer deaths and leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Skin examsDoctors often recommend that people who are at risk for skin cancer examine their skin regularly or have a health care provider do so. Such exams have not been shown to decrease the risk of dying from skin cancer, and they may lead to overtreatment. However, people should be aware of changes in their skin, such as a new mole or a change to an existing mole, and report these to their doctor promptly. Transvaginal ultrasoundThis imaging test, which can create pictures of a woman's ovaries and uterus, is sometimes used in women who are at increased risk of ovarian cancer (because they carry a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation) or of endometrial cancer (because they have a condition called Lynch syndrome). But it has not been shown to reduce deaths from either cancer. Virtual colonoscopyThis test allows the colon and rectum to be examined from outside the body. However, it has not been shown to reduce deaths from colorectal cancer."
Introduction to colon and colorectal cancer screening and surveillance,"'The colon, also known as the ''large intestine'' or large bowel, constitutes the last part of the digestive tract. The colon is a long, muscular tube that receives still-undigested food from the small intestine. It removes water from the undigested food, stores it and then finally eliminates it from the body as ''stool'' or feces through bowel movements. The rectum is the last part of the bowel adjacent to the anus through which ''stool'' passes to the outside.''Cancer of the colon'' and rectum (''colorectal cancer'') is a type of ''malignant tumor'' arising from the inner wall of the large intestine. These ''malignant'' tumors are called ''cancers'' and can invade nearby tissue and spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumors of the colon are usually called polyps. Benign polyps do not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body like malignant tumors do. Benign polyps can be removed easily during ''colonoscopy'' and are not life-threatening. However, if benign polyps are not removed from the large intestine, they can become malignant (turn into ''cancer'') over time. In fact, most of the cancers of the large intestine are believed to have evolved from benign polyps that are ''precancerous'', that is, they are benign at first but later become cancerous.''Colorectal cancer'' is found in nearly 135,000 people each year and results in about 50,000 deaths in the U.S. It is the second most common cause of death due to ''cancer'' in the U.S. after ''lung cancer''. It is the second most common ''cancer'' in women and the third most common cancer in men. The lifetime risk for an adult American to develop ''colorectal'' cancer is 4.4%.''Cancer of the colon'' and rectum can invade and damage adjacent tissues and organs. Cancer cells also can break away and spread to other parts of the body (such as the ''liver'' and lung) where new tumors grow. The process whereby ''colon cancer'' spreads to distant organs is called ''metastasis'', and the new tumors are called metastases. Direct extension to or invasion of adjacent organs is a sign of a more advanced cancer, and the chance of cure in the treatment of a cancer which has directly extended into an adjacent tissue is less, even with surgery, as hidden cancer cells may also have spread elsewhere. If a colon or ''rectal cancer'' is found to have spread through the lymph channels to adjacent ''lymph nodes'', it is increasingly likely that even the removal of the portion of the colon and lymph nodes will not cure the patient. Finding ''lymph node'' metastases suggests that undetectable microscopic cancer cells may be more likely to still be present elsewhere in the body. If the cancer spreads through the bloodstream to the liver, ''lungs'', bones, or other organs, or through lymph channels to distant lymph nodes, then it is unlikely that a permanent cure will be obtained with treatment.''Colorectal cancer is both preventable and curable when found early. Colorectal cancer is prevented by removing precancerous ''colon polyps''. It is cured if cancerous change is found early and is surgically removed before the cancer cells spread to other parts of the body. The National Polyp Study showed in its surveillance program that individuals who had their polyps removed experienced a 90% reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer. The few patients in the study who did develop colorectal cancer had their cancer discovered at early, surgically or endoscopically curable stages. Since most colon polyps and early cancers are silent (produce no symptoms), it is important to do screening and surveillance for colon cancer in patients without symptoms or signs of the polyps or cancers. Recommendations for cost-effective public screening and surveillance have been promulgated and endorsed by numerous societies including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, American College of Gastroenterology, American Medical Association, American College of Physicians, etc.'  "
Screening recommendations for individuals with average risk of colon cancer,"'Fecal (stool) occult blood tests (FOBT) performed on stool samples, stool DNA tests, flexible sigmoidoscopic examinations, and colonoscopy are among the recommended screening tests for individuals at average risk for developing colorectal cancer. These tests are designed to detect and to prompt removal of precancerous polyps and identify early cancers in order to decrease deaths from colorectal cancer. Most guidelines recommend beginning screening at 50 years of age for people at average risk of developing colorectal cancer. Some groups recommend that African Americans begin screening at a slightly younger age due to an increased risk.' "
"Fecal occult blood tests (FOBT, stool testing)","'Fecal occult blood tests'' are chemical tests that are performed on samples of stool to detect the presence of ""occult"" blood (amounts of blood that are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye). These tests usually are performed along with a digital rectal examination (DRE) that is performed by a doctor. The use of fecal occult blood tests is based on observations that slow bleeding from colon polyps or cancers can cause small amounts of blood to mix with the colonic contents. Since the small amounts of blood are not visible to the naked eye, sensitive tests are needed to detect the traces of ''blood in the stool''. The newest form of the test is known as a fecal immunochemical, or FIT test and is even more sensitive than the older chemical or guaiac-based tests (gFOBT) for diagnosing colorectal cancer.''A stool DNA test (Cologuard or FIT-DNA test) has also been developed as a screening tool. DNA testing identifies abnormal genes in stool that are characteristic of colorectal cancer from cells that have broken off from colorectal cancers and some ''premalignant'' tumors. The FIT-DNA is a stool DNA test (MT-sDNA), combining fecal DNA, fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and DNA methylation assays. (DNA methylation is a type of genetic abnormality that controls the expression of the abnormal DNA.)''An individual whose stool specimen tests positive for occult blood then undergoes a colonoscopy of the entire colon to look for polyps, cancers, or other conditions that cause bleeding (such as abnormal blood vessels, diverticuli, or ''colitis''). The majority (greater than 90%) of the polyps detected at colonoscopy can be removed painlessly and safely during the colonoscopic examination. Polyps so removed are examined later under the microscope by a pathologist to determine if they are precancerous. Individuals with precancerous polyps have a higher than average risk for developing colon cancer and are advised to return for periodic surveillance colonoscopies.''Colon cancers that are detected at colonoscopy usually are removed surgically though under certain circumstances they may be removed at colonoscopy. Precancerous polyps that are too large or technically not possible to remove during colonoscopy also are removed surgically. Several studies have shown that fecal occult blood and related testing can reduce death rates (mortality) from colorectal cancer by 30%-40%.''If no colonic abnormalities are found in an individual whose stool contains occult blood, consideration then is given to examining the stomach and the small intestine as sources of bleeding.' "
Flexible sigmoidoscopy,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy'' utilizes a flexible sigmoidoscope, a flexible, fiberoptic viewing tube with a light at the tip. It is inserted through the anus and is used by the doctor to examine the rectum and the part of the colon adjacent to the rectum. It is a shorter version of a ''colonoscope''. Approximately 50% of colorectal cancers and polyps are found to be within the reach of a flexible sigmoidoscope. If polyps are found during a flexible sigmoidoscopic examination, a colonoscopy to examine the entire colon is recommended to remove the polyps as well as to find and remove additional polyps in other parts of the colon. The removed polyps are examined by a pathologist under a microscope to determine if the polyps are benign, malignant, or precancerous. Individuals with precancerous polyps (adenomas and villous adenomas) have a higher than average risk of developing colon cancer, and it is recommended that they return periodically for surveillance colonoscopies.' "
Screening colonoscopy,"'Colonoscopies are recommended screening tools beginning at the age of 50 and thereafter every seven to 10 years if no colon polyps or cancers are found. The rationale for this recommendation is as follows:''Colonoscopy is a procedure that enables the physician to evaluate the inside of the colon using a 4-foot long, flexible tube about the thickness of a finger with a camera and a source of light at its tip. The tip of the colonoscope is inserted into the anus. The tube is then advanced slowly into the rectum and through the colon usually as far as the cecum, which is the first part of the colon. Special preparation of the bowel is needed for this test to ensure that the intestine is empty of stool to allow for optimal visualization. In general, this consists of drinking a large volume of a special liquid or several days of a clear ''liquid diet'' and laxatives or enemas prior to the examination. It may also be necessary to avoid certain foods for a couple of days prior to the procedure, such as stringy foods, foods with seeds, or red Jell-O.'""Colonoscopy may be performed in a doctor's office or hospital. It typically takes less than an hour, and ""'sedatives'' are given to relax the patient.'  Colonoscopy examines the entire colon while flexible sigmoidoscopy only examines the rectum and the colon adjacent to the rectum. Approximately half of colon polyps (and colon cancers) are found in the upper colon (cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon) and, therefore, are beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopes and would be missed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. The National Polyp Study, a large, scientific study, has shown that colonoscopy with removal of all colon polyps reduces deaths from colon cancer."
Virtual colonoscopy,"'Virtual colonoscopy'' or CT colonography is a new technique that uses an X-ray machine called a CAT or CT scanner to construct virtual images of the colon that are similar to the views of the colon obtained at colonoscopy. The virtual colonoscopic images are produced by computerized manipulation of two-dimensional images obtained by a CT scanner rather than direct observation through the colonoscope. The colon is cleaned-out using laxatives the day prior to the virtual colonoscopy examination. A tube then is inserted into the anus and is used to inject air into the colon. The ''CT scans'' then are performed, and the scans are analyzed and manipulated to form a virtual image of the colon.''Properly performed virtual colonoscopy can be very good. It can even find polyps ""hiding"" behind folds that occasionally are missed by colonoscopy. Nevertheless, virtual colonoscopy has several limitations. They are:''Because of these limitations, virtual colonoscopy has not replaced colonoscopy as the primary screening tool for individuals at either normal or high risk for polyps or colon cancer. It is currently a good option for individuals who cannot or will not undergo colonoscopy' Virtual colonoscopy cannot find small polyps (less than 5 mm in size) that are easily seen at colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy is not as accurate as colonoscopy at finding flat cancers or premalignant lesions that are not protruding, that is, are not polyp-like. Small pieces of stool can look like polyps on virtual colonoscopy and lead to a diagnosis of polyps when there are none. Virtual colonoscopy cannot remove polyps. Thirty to forty percent of people have colon polyps. If polyps are found by virtual colonoscopy, then colonoscopy must be done to remove the polyps, and, therefore, many individuals having virtual colonoscopy will have to undergo a second procedure, colonoscopy."
Surveillance recommendations for individuals with higher-than-average risk of colon cancer,"'Many individuals are at higher than average risk for developing colon cancer because of a family history of colon cancer, history of chronic ''ulcerative colitis'', rare hereditary colon cancer syndromes, or a history of colon polyps or cancer. Periodic surveillance colonoscopies are recommended for these individuals to remove precancerous polyps, and /or to detect early cancers. Such testing will typically be recommended to begin at an earlier age than it will for those with average risk.' "
Patients with history of colon polyps,"'Patients with history of colon polyps often develop polyps subsequently. Therefore, periodic surveillance colonoscopies are recommended. In individuals with only precancerous polyps that are completely removed, the usual recommendation is to repeat the colonoscopy after three years. If the colonoscopy at three years shows no recurrence of polyps, then the interval between subsequent colonoscopies is extended to five years.''Sometimes, doctors are not confident that all polyps have been completely removed. Examples include individuals with multiple precancerous polyps, polyps that are technically difficulty to completely excise, or less than optimal visualization of the colon due to inadequate cleansing of the colon. Under these circumstances, the decision regarding the interval between surveillance colonoscopies is best arrived at jointly between the patient and the doctor.' "
Patients with history of colorectal cancer,'Individuals who have undergone colon cancer surgery are at higher risk of developing another colon cancer in the future. It usually is recommended that they undergo a repeat colonoscopy after six to 12 months and every three years thereafter. Early detection and treatment of future polyps and early cancers can significantly improve chances of survival.' 
Patients with ulcerative colitis,"'Patients with long-standing ''ulcerative colitis'' also have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. The risk of developing colon cancer is proportional to the duration of disease and to the extent of colon involved by colitis. Thus, patients with chronic ''ulcerative colitis'' involving the entire colon should have more frequent colonoscopies, including special techniques and biopsies. The biopsies are taken from the colon to look for early, microscopic precancerous changes in the cells.' "
Family history of colorectal cancer,"'Colorectal cancer may run in families. Colon cancer risk to an individual is even higher if more than one immediate family member (parents, siblings or children) has had colorectal cancer, and/or the family member developed the cancer at a young age (less than 55). Under these circumstances, it is recommended that individuals undergo a colonoscopy every three years starting at an age that is seven to 10 years younger than the age at which the family member who developed colorectal cancer at the youngest age developed his or her cancer.''If only one immediate family member developed colorectal cancer at an advanced age, the colon cancer risk to the individual is still higher than average but not as high as if two immediate family members developed colorectal cancer or if a family member developed colorectal cancer at an early age. Whether and when to perform screening colonoscopies in these individuals are best decided jointly by the individuals and their doctors.' "
What are hereditary colon cancer syndromes?,"'Hereditary colon cancer syndromes are caused by specific ''inherited'' changes in genes called mutations that are sufficient in themselves to cause colon polyps, colon cancers, and non-colonic cancers. Hereditary colon cancer syndrome can affect multiple members of a family. Approximately 5% of all colon cancers in the US are due to hereditary colon cancer syndromes. Patients who have inherited one of these syndromes have an extremely high risk for developing colon cancer, approaching 90%-100%. Fortunately, blood tests are now available to test for these hereditary colon cancer syndromes, once a syndrome has been suspected within a family.''Familial adenomatous polyposis'', or FAP is a hereditary colon cancer syndrome in which the affected family members develop large numbers (hundreds, sometimes thousands) of colon polyps starting in their ''teens''. Unless the condition is detected and treated early (treatment involves removal of the colon), a family member with the FAP syndrome is almost sure to develop colon cancer. Cancers most commonly begin to appear when patients are in their 40s, but can appear earlier. These patients also are at risk of developing other cancers such as cancers of the thyroid gland, stomach, and the ampulla (the part of the duodenum into which the bile ducts drain).''Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, or AFAP is a milder version of FAP. Affected patients develop less than 100 colon polyps. Nevertheless, they are at high risk of developing colon cancers at a young age. They are also at risk for stomach and duodenal polyps.''Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer'', or ''HNPCC'', is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected family members tend to develop colon cancers, usually in the right colon, in their 30s to 40s. Certain HNPCC patients also are at elevated risk for developing ''uterine cancer'', ''stomach cancer'', ''ovarian cancer'', cancers of the ureters (the tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder), cancers of the bile ducts (the ducts that drain bile from the liver to the ''intestines''), and ''cancer of the brain'' and skin. Lynch Syndrome is another name for HNPCC.''The MYH polyposis syndrome is a recently discovered hereditary colon cancer syndrome. Affected patients typically develop 10-100 polyps during their 40s and are at high risk for developing colon cancer. The MYH syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with each parent contributing one copy of the mutant gene. Most people with the MYH syndrome do not have a multigenerational family history of polyps or cancer of the colon but may have brothers or sisters with it.' "
Who should consider genetic counseling and testing and how is it conducted?,"'Genetic counseling'' followed by genetic testing should be considered for individuals as well as their family members when there are:'""Genetic counseling both obtains the details of a patient's history, and helps them to understand what testing may be recommended and what the results could mean.""'Patients who have hereditary colon cancer syndromes usually have no symptoms and are unaware that they have colon polyps or early colon cancers. They usually will develop colon cancers early in life (often before 40-50 years of age). Therefore, to prevent colon cancers in patients with hereditary colon cancer syndromes, colon screening must begin early. For example, patients with FAP should have annual flexible sigmoidoscopies starting at age 12, patients with AFAP should have annual colonoscopies starting at age 25, and patients with HNPCC should have colonoscopies beginning at age 25 (or 10 years younger than the earliest colon cancer diagnosed in the family, whichever is earlier). The current screening recommendations for the general population are inadequate for most patients with hereditary colon cancer syndromes.''Genetic counseling and testing are important to identify patients and family members with hereditary colon cancer syndromes so that screening with flexible sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies can begin early and, if necessary, the colon can be removed surgically to prevent colon cancer. Moreover, depending on which hereditary colon cancer syndrome is present, early screening for other types of cancer such as ovarian, uterine, stomach, ureter, and thyroid may be appropriate.'   Individuals in the family with early onset of colon cancer, before age 50 Individuals in the family with numerous colon polyps Families in which multiple members have colon cancer Families with members with numerous colon polyps Families with members having colon cancers at young ages Families with members having certain non-colon cancers such as cancers of the uterus, thyroid, ureters, ovaries, small intestine, etc."
Summary of colon cancer screening,"'Colon cancer is preventable and curable. Colon cancer is preventable by removing precancerous colon polyps, and it is curable if early cancer is surgically removed before cancer spreads to other parts of the body. Therefore, if screening and surveillance programs were practiced universally, there would be a major reduction in the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer.''Ongoing genetic research will help doctors better understand the genetic basis of colorectal cancer formation. Genetic blood tests and tests for premalignant cells in stool may also have a role in colorectal ''cancer screening''. Regardless of what new screening methods become available, you should remember to discuss colon cancer screening and/or surveillance as it relates to your situation.' "
What is screening?,"'Cancer screening'' looks for a hidden ''cancer'' before a person has any warning signs or symptoms. This can help find ''cancer'' at an early stage. When abnormal tissue or ''cancer'' is found early, it may be easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun to spread. ''Scientists are trying to better understand which people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things we do and the things around us to see if they cause cancer. This information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done. ''It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily think you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening tests are given when you have no ''cancer symptoms''. Screening tests may be repeated on a regular basis. ''If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called diagnostic tests. ' "
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.,"'The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system located just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The ''prostate gland'' produces fluid that makes up part of semen. ''Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems, showing the prostate, testicles, bladder, and other organs.''As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with urination. Rarely, this may cause problems with sexual function as well. This condition is called ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''), and although it is not cancer, surgery may be needed to correct it. The symptoms of ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' or of other problems in the prostate may be similar to symptoms of ''prostate cancer''. ''Normal prostate and ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An ''enlarged prostate'' presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.' "
How common is prostate cancer?,"'Prostate cancer'' is the most common nonskin cancer among men in the United States.''Prostate cancer is found mainly in older men. Although the number of men with prostate cancer is large, most men diagnosed with this disease do not die from it. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer.' "
What are prostate cancer risk factors?,"'Age, race, and family history of prostate cancer can affect the risk of developing prostate cancer.'""Anything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for prostate cancer include the following: "" Being 50 years of age or older. Being black. Having a brother, son, or father who had prostate cancer. Eating a diet high in fat or drinking alcoholic beverages."
What tests are used to screen for prostate cancer?,"'Some screening tests are used because they have been shown to be helpful both in finding ''cancers'' early and decreasing the chance of dying from these cancers. Other tests are used because they have been shown to find cancer in some people; however, it has not been proven in ''clinical trials'' that use of these tests will decrease the risk of dying from the cancer for which a person is being screened. '""Scientists study screening tests to find those with the fewest risks and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes symptoms) decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, finding and treating the disease at an early stage may result in a better chance of recovery. ""'Screening tests for prostate cancer continue to be under study. Decisions about undergoing screening for prosate cancer should be discussed one on one with a doctor. One may wish to participate in the study of screening tests for prostate cancer. These studies are called clinical trials. There are clinical trials taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the ''NCI Web site''. ''Tests to detect (find) prostate cancer that are being studied include the following'': ''Digital rectal exam (DRE) is an exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel the prostate for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. ''Digital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the prostate to check for anything abnormal.''A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a test that measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made mostly by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. The level of PSA may also be high in men who have an infection or inflammation of the prostate or ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (BPH; an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate). ''Scientists are studying the combination of PSA testing and digital rectal exam as a way to get more accurate results from the screening tests. ' "
What are the risks of prostate cancer screening tests?,"'Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer. ''Finding prostate cancer may not improve health or help a man live longer.''Screening may not improve your health or help you live longer if you have cancer that has already spread to the area outside of the prostate or to other places in your body. ''Some cancers never cause symptoms or become life-threatening, but if found by a screening test, the cancer may be treated. Finding these cancers is called overdiagnosis. It is not known if treatment of these cancers would help you live longer than if no treatment were given, and treatments for cancer, such as surgery and ''radiation therapy'', may have serious side effects.''Some studies of patients with prostate cancer showed these patients had a higher risk of death from cardiovascular (''heart'' and blood vessel) disease or ''suicide''. The risk was greatest the first year after diagnosis.''If a ''PSA test'' is higher than normal, a biopsy of the prostate may be done. Complications from a biopsy of the prostate may include ''fever'', ''pain'', ''blood in the urine'' or semen, and ''urinary tract infection''. Even if a biopsy shows that a patient does not have prostate cancer, he may worry more about developing prostate cancer in the future. ''Screening test results may appear to be normal even though prostate cancer is present. A man who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if he has symptoms. '""Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause ""'anxiety'' and is usually followed by more tests, (such as biopsy) which also have risks. ''Your doctor can advise you about your risk for prostate cancer and your need for screening tests. ' "

What should you know about quad marker screening?,"'The quad marker screening test (quad screen) is a blood test administered in ''pregnancy'', typically between the 15th and 20th weeks of gestation. Similar to the triple screen, the quad marker screen provides information about whether there is an increased risk for certain ''birth defects'' in the baby.''The test is simple and involves taking a blood sample as for any other routine blood test. The quad marker test is a screening test, meaning that it gives information about risk, but it does not allow the definitive diagnosis of any conditions. It can only signal that further testing should be done to confirm a diagnosis. There is no risk to the baby from the test.'  "
Why did my doctor order a quad marker screening test?,"'The quad screen looks at the three substances also measured in the triple screen (alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and estriol) test plus one additional substance, inhibin A.'""Looking at levels of these four substances in the mother's bloodstream allows an estimation of risk for ""'neural tube defects'' and certain chromosomal abnormalities, like ''Down syndrome''.' Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is produced by the liver of the fetus Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone made by the placenta Estriol is an estrogen made both by the placenta and the liver of the fetus Inhibin-A is another hormone made by the placenta"
How accurate is the quad marker screening test?,"""The test is a screening test only, and is not 100% accurate. It can predict about 85% of open neural tube defects, problems with the development of the baby's brain and spinal cord. It predicts about 80% of fetuses with ""'Down syndrome'' in women over age 35 and about 75% \xa0in younger women. The fact that it is not 100% accurate means that not all women who have a positive high risk result on the quad screen will have a fetus with a birth defect, and the test may also be normal even in the presence of birth defects.''For example, about 50 women out of every 1,000 will have a result on the quad screen that indicates an increased risk of a birth defect, but only one to two of those women will actually have a baby with an open neural tube defect. About 40 women out of 1,000 will have a result indicating an increased risk of Down syndrome, but only one to two of these women will have a baby with Down syndrome.' "
What should you do if you have normal or abnormal tests results?,"""As with any screening test, an abnormal result does not mean that the fetus definitely has a birth defect or genetic condition. It only means that the blood levels of these four substances suggest that a woman's risk is increased of having a baby with certain conditions. Women who have a result suggesting increased risk are typically offered further testing. This can include repeating the quad screen and/or having a high definition ""'ultrasound'' examination to look for signs of birth defects or abnormalities in the developing baby. If this testing is abnormal, the mother may be offered the choice to undergo ''amniocentesis''. Amniocentesis involves withdrawing a sample of ''amniotic fluid'' for genetic and chromosome testing, and it can definitively establish the diagnosis of genetic and chromosomal problems in most fetuses. Amniocentesis carries a small risk of ''miscarriage'' (fewer than 1% of fetuses tested).' "
What is seasonal affective disorder?,"'Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), formally referred to as recurrent ''depression'' with seasonal pattern, is a type of depression that tends to occur (and recur) as the days grow shorter in the fall and winter. It is believed that affected people react adversely to the decreasing amounts of sunlight and the colder temperatures as the fall and winter progress. It is important to note that although seasonal affective disorder usually presents in the fall and winter there are those who suffer from this condition during the summer instead of, or in addition to, during the fall or winter.''Seasonal affective disorder has not been long recognized as an official diagnosis. The term first appeared in print in 1985. Seasonal affective disorder is also sometimes colloquially called winter depression, winter blues, or the hibernation reaction.''The incidence of seasonal affective disorder increases in people who are living farther away from the equator. Statistics on seasonal affective disorder in the United States include that this disorder occurs in 1% to 10% of adults and is dependent on geographical location. Seasonal affective disorder is less common where there is snow on the ground. Seasonal affective disorder is about four times more common in women than men, and the average age of people when they first develop this illness is 23 years of age. People of all ages can develop seasonal affective disorder.' "
What are the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder?,"'Although there is no specific diagnostic test for the illness, it is understood that since it is a form of depression, the symptoms of the condition include ''tiredness'', ''fatigue'', sadness or a sense of general discontent, crying spells, irritability, apathy, trouble concentrating, body aches, loss of sex drive, poor ''sleep'', decreased activity level, and appetite changes, particularly overeating, especially of carbohydrates and ''weight gain''. When the condition occurs during the summer, the symptoms are more commonly ''insomnia'', poor appetite, and ''weight loss'', in addition to ''anxiety'', irritability, ''difficulty concentrating'', and crying spells. Social isolation, with the potential resulting loneliness, also occurs at times with summer seasonal affective disorder. If the condition is severe, it can be associated with thoughts of ''suicide''.''The symptoms of seasonal affective disorder typically tend to begin in the fall each year, lasting until spring. The symptoms are more intense during the darkest months. Therefore, the more common months for the condition to occur will vary depending on how far away from the equator one lives.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for seasonal affective disorder?,"'Seasonal affective disorder seems to develop from inadequate exposure to bright light during the winter months. Studies show that bright light changes the chemicals in the brain. Exactly how this occurs and the details of its effects are being studied. Factors like high levels of ''melatonin'' and low levels of serotonin in the brain, as well as low levels of ''vitamin D'' levels in the blood are found to be associated with a higher occurrence of seasonal affective disorder and some other depressive conditions.' "
"How do health-care professionals assess and diagnose seasonal affective disorder, and what types of specialists treat this condition?","'A number of different health professionals can be qualified to evaluate and treat seasonal affective disorder, including primary-care providers, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.' "
What is the treatment for seasonal affective disorder?,"'In addition to being key in the ''prevention'' of seasonal affective disorder, regular exposure to light that is bright, particularly fluorescent lights, significantly improves depression in people with this disorder when it presents during the fall and winter. The light treatment is used daily in the morning and evening for best results. Temporarily changing locations to a climate that is characterized by bright light (such as the Caribbean) can also be effective. Light treatment has also been called phototherapy. Individuals who suffer from seasonal affective disorder will also likely benefit from increased social support during vulnerable times of the year.''Phototherapy is available in the form of light boxes, used for approximately 30 minutes daily. The light required must be of sufficient brightness, approximately 25 times as bright as a normal living room light. The light does not need to be actual sunlight. It seems that it is quantity, not necessarily quality of light that matters in the phototherapy of seasonal affective disorder. The most common possible side effects associated with phototherapy include irritability, ''insomnia'', ''headaches'', and eyestrain.''Antidepressant'' medications, particularly those from the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) group of medications, have been found to be effective in treating seasonal affective disorder that occurs during summer as well as that which tends to occur during the fall or winter. Examples of SSRIs include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), and ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix). Common side effects for this class of medications include ''insomnia'', ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', and many can cause ''decreased sex drive'' or performance. As with any other mood disorder, psychotherapy tends to accentuate the effectiveness of medical treatment and therefore should be included in the approach to addressing this disorder. In individuals who are perhaps vulnerable to the development of ''bipolar disorder'', either light therapy or ''antidepressants'' can cause a ''manic'' episode as a side effect.''Since stimulant medications like ''modafinil'' (''Provigil'') may be a helpful addition to other treatments for seasonal affective disorder, other ''stimulants'' like ''methylphenidate'' (''Ritalin'') may play a future role in addressing this disorder. ''Acupuncture'' may be a viable alternative intervention to antidepressant medications, particularly in ''pregnant'' women, for whom medications should be used with particular caution.''Determined to be equally effective as phototherapy or antidepressant medication in addressing seasonal affective disorder, ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT'') is another viable option for treating this illness. This form of psychotherapy involves the therapist working with the client to help the depression sufferer identify and understand ways of thinking that may be obstacles to improving their mood, thereby increasing the ability of the person with seasonal affective disorder to alleviate symptoms.''Chronotherapy, which uses environmental input to affect biorhythms, is thought to be a helpful aspect of treatment for seasonal affective disorders, as well as for other kinds of depression. This treatment uses methods like controlled ''sleep'"" deprivation to affect the seasonal affective disorder sufferer's brain chemicals in a positive way.""'Lifestyle changes that can help decrease the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder include increasing time spent outdoors, more physical ''exercise'', and maintaining eating habits that are high in lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates while decreasing the intake of refined sugars and other carbohydrates. Remedies that do not necessarily require the involvement of a health-care professionals, or so-called home remedies, include ''vitamin D'' supplementation and taking melatonin in the evenings.' "
What is the prognosis and potential complications of seasonal affective disorder?,"'People who receive treatment for seasonal affective disorder in a timely way tend to recover well. However, as with other forms of ''major depression'"", seasonal affective disorder is a risk factor for developing a number of other mental-health symptoms and disorders, engaging in self-mutilating behaviors or taking one's own life. People who suffer from this illness are also more vulnerable to having troubled relationships, low performance at school or work, and for developing some medical and substance use disorders."" "
Is it possible to prevent seasonal affective disorder?,"'Attempts to prevent future episodes of seasonal affective disorder using psychotherapy or light therapy have inconsistent results, but preventive medication treatment is thought to have promise. Therefore, health-care professionals tend to focus on lifestyle changes that can be helpful, as well as recommending preventive treatments based on what was most helpful for the individual sufferer in the past.'

What is hay fever? What are hay fever symptoms and signs?,"'Hay fever affects up to 30% of all people worldwide, including up to 10% of U.S. children under 17 years of age and 7.8% of U.S. adults. The medical cost of allergic rhinitis is approximately $3.4 billion, mostly due to the cost of prescription medications. These figures are probably an underestimate because many of those affected may attribute their discomfort to a chronic ''cold''. Although childhood hay fever tends to be more common, this condition can occur at any age and usually occurs after years of repeated ''inhalation'' of allergic substances. The incidence of allergic disease has dramatically increased in the U.S. and other developed countries over recent decades.''""Hay fever"" is a misnomer. Hay is not a usual cause of this problem, and it does not cause fever. Early descriptions of sneezing, ''nasal congestion'', and eye irritation while harvesting field hay promoted this popular term. ''Allergic rhinitis'' is the correct term used to describe this ''allergic reaction'', and many different substances cause the allergic symptoms noted in hay fever. ''Rhinitis'' means ""inflammation of the nose"" and is a derivative of ''rhino'', meaning nose. Allergic rhinitis that occurs during a specific season is called ""seasonal allergic rhinitis."" When it occurs throughout the year, it is called ""perennial allergic rhinitis."" ''Rhinosinusitis'' is the medical term that refers to inflammation of the nasal lining as well as the lining tissues of the sinuses. This term is sometimes used because the two conditions frequently occur together.''Symptoms of allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, frequently include''Postnasal dripping of clear mucus frequently causes a ''cough''. Loss of the sense of smell is common, and loss of taste sense occurs occasionally. Nose bleeding may occur if the condition is severe. Eye ''itching'', redness, and excess tears in the eyes frequently accompany the nasal symptoms. The eye symptoms are referred to as ""''allergic conjunctivitis''"" (inflammation of the whites of the eyes). These allergic symptoms often interfere with one\'s quality of life and overall health.''Many people with ''allergies'' have difficulty with social and physical activities. For example, concentration is often difficult while experiencing allergic rhinitis symptoms.'   nasal congestion, a runny nose with clear mucus, sneezing, nose, eye itching, and excess tear production in the eyes."
Why does an allergic reaction occur?,"'An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system attacks a usually harmless substance called an ''allergen'' that gains access to the body. The immune system calls upon a protective substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to fight these invading allergic substances or allergens. Even though everyone has some IgE, an allergic person has an unusually large amount of IgE. This army of IgE antibodies attacks and engages the invading army of allergic substances of allergens.''Specialized cells called mast cells also participate in the allergic reaction. Mast cells release a variety of chemicals into the tissues and blood, one of which is known as histamine. These chemicals frequently cause allergic reactions. These chemicals are very irritating and cause itching, swelling, and fluid leaking from cells. Through various mechanisms, these allergic chemicals can cause ''muscle spasm'' and can lead to lung and throat tightening as is found in ''asthma'' and ''loss of voice'' (''laryngitis'').' "
What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)?,"'Any substance can cause an ''allergy'' if exposed to an allergic person in the right way. But for all practical purposes and with few exceptions, allergic rhinitis is caused by proteins. Commonly, allergic rhinitis is a result of an allergic person coming in contact several times with protein from plants. Many trees, grasses, and weeds produce extremely small, light, dry protein particles called pollen. This pollen is spread by the wind and is inhaled. These pollen particles are usually the male sex cells of the plant and are smaller than the tip of a pin or less than 40 microns in diameter.''Even though pollen is usually invisible in the air, pollen is a potent stimulator of ''allergy''. Pollen lodges in the nasal lining tissues (mucus membranes) and other parts of the respiratory tract, where it initiates the allergic response. Up to 7.8% of American adults suffer from allergic rhinitis. Approximately one in four people with allergic rhinitis also has ''asthma''.' "
What are risk factors for allergic rhinitis?,"'A person is programmed to be allergic by his/her genetic ''makeup'' and is destined to be allergic from birth. People of all races are affected, and the condition affects both males and females equally. Symptoms commonly begin in childhood. Having frequent exposure to the particular allergic substance is a risk factor for frequent attacks.' "
When and where does allergic rhinitis occur?,"'Since allergic rhinitis is frequently caused by pollen, symptoms occur when pollen is in the air. Trees primarily pollinate in the spring, while grasses pollinate in the spring and summer. Weeds usually pollinate in the late summer and fall. Of allergy sufferers in the United States, many are allergic to ragweed, about half are allergic to grasses, and fewer are allergic to trees. Of course, many people are allergic to other substances such as ''mold'"" spores, animal dander protein, and dust mites, to name a few. If you wish to know the pollen count in your area, this information can often be found in the newspaper in the weather section or you can access the National Allergy Bureau's pollen count information at their web site (http://www.aaaai.org/nab/index.cfm).""'Food is an uncommon cause of allergic rhinitis.' "
Is allergic rhinitis contagious?,"'Allergic rhinitis, like other allergic reactions, is not ''contagious''. However, the symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be confused with those of a ''common cold'', which can be spread from person to person.' "
What specialists treat allergic rhinitis?,"'Allergists are medical specialists trained in the diagnosis and treatment of ''allergies'', including hay fever. People with hay fever also often seek care from a primary care physician, including internists, pediatricians, and family practitioners.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose allergic rhinitis? How do health care professionals identify allergies?,"'Typically, allergies are initially diagnosed by a combination of characteristic symptoms coupled with exam findings that correspond with allergies.'""If a person is experiencing the typical symptoms of hay fever, a consultation with an allergy specialist can help identify the offending substances. Since the ideal way to manage an allergy is to avoid the substances that cause allergic reaction, it is important to first identify these substances (allergens). Many allergens can be suspected from information obtained in a patient's history. For example, if symptoms usually worsen with exposure to cats, then cat dander protein is a probable allergen causing the symptoms. If cutting grass is associated with the onset of symptoms, then grass allergy is probable. A patient's history of reactions is important in determining his/her unique allergies. Allergy testing is only done when allergies are debilitating enough that patients desire ""'allergy immunotherapy''.''Because the identification of allergens is important and often difficult to pinpoint, skin testing is often needed to identify exactly the specific substance causing the allergy. Skin testing is done with minimal discomfort and is performed as follows:''A number of blood tests are also available to aid in the diagnosis of allergy. These blood tests may be useful in people who cannot be skin tested due to skin diseases, who are taking medications that interfere with skin testing, or who are at a high risk of having an anaphylactic reaction to skin testing. These blood tests typically use various techniques to look for IgE antibodies in the blood and by inference suggest allergy in the tissues. If the allergy testing agrees with the history of symptoms upon exposure to the substance, then a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is likely.' A small amount of the suspected allergy substance is placed on the skin. The skin is then gently scratched through the small drop with a special sterile needle. This is known as the prick-puncture method and is typically used for initial evaluations. A second method, known as the intradermal method, involves injection of a small amount of the test substance into the skin. Intradermal testing is more sensitive but also tends to lead to more false-positive results. If the skin reddens and, more importantly, swells, then an individual is said to be ""sensitized"" to the particular allergen. If typical symptoms occur when a sensitized individual is exposed to the suspected substance, then allergy to that substance is probable. The skin testing described is tolerated by the youngest of patients and should be the standard of testing. Skin testing is not indicated for people who are at risk of a severe (anaphylactic) allergic reaction, who have certain skin conditions, or who are taking certain medications."
What is the treatment for hay fever?,"'Avoidance of identified allergens is the most helpful factor in controlling ''allergy symptoms''. Attempts to control the environment and avoidance measures often significantly aid in resolving symptoms. However, allergy avoidance is often not easy. A thorough discussion with your physician is needed, and control measures may be required daily.''If avoidance is not possible or does not relieve symptoms, additional treatment is needed. Many patients respond to medications that combat the effects of histamine, known as antihistamines. Antihistamines do not stop the formation of histamine, nor do they stop the conflict between the IgE and antigen. Therefore, antihistamines do not stop the allergic reaction but rather protect tissues from the effects of the allergic response.''The first-generation antihistamines, such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), brompheniramine (Dimetapp and others), ''clemastine'' fumarate (''Tavist'', Allerhist), and dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral) frequently cause mouth dryness and sleepiness as side effects.''Newer, so-called ""non-sedating"" or second-generation antihistamines are also available. These include ''loratadine'' (''Claritin''), ''fexofenadine'' (''Allegra''), ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec''), and ''azelastine'' (''Astelin'' Nasal Spray). In general, this group of antihistamines is slightly more expensive, has a slower onset of action, is longer acting, and induces less sleepiness. Many of these medications are available over the counter.''Discuss with a physician other ''antihistamine'' side effects that occasionally occur (for example, urine retention in males, fast ''heart'' rate, and others). Always discuss the potential side effects of any medication with a physician and/or pharmacist.''Decongestants help control allergy symptoms but not their causes. Decongestants shrink the swollen membranes in the nose and make it easier to breathe. Decongestants can be taken orally or by nasal spray. ''Decongestant'' nasal sprays should not be used for more than five days without a doctor\'s advice, and if so, usually only when accompanied by a nasal steroid. Decongestant nasal sprays often cause a so-called ""rebound effect"" if taken for too long. A rebound effect is the worsening of symptoms when a drug is discontinued. This is a result of a tissue dependence on the medication.''Some people with allergies need specialized prescription medications such as ''corticosteroids'', ''cromolyn'', and ipratropium (''Atrovent'') nasal sprays. These nasal sprays do not cause the rebound effect noticed with decongestant nasal sprays. Cortisone nasal sprays are very effective in reducing the inflammation that causes swelling, sneezing, and a runny nose. Cortisone can also decrease the formation of many chemicals involved in the allergic response. Many cortisone nasal sprays are on the market through prescription only. Intranasal steroids are typically the first-line medications for patients suffering from persistent allergies. Fluticasone (''Flonase'') is one medication available over the counter.''Cromolyn is also an anti-inflammatory medication available over the counter. Although cromolyn is not as potent as cortisone, it is very safe. Cromolyn must be used well in advance of anticipated allergy symptoms to be useful. Ipratropium (Atrovent) nasal spray is available for drying a wet runny nose. It will not prevent allergic reactions. This is an ''atropine'' derivative and although usually very safe, a person sensitive to atropine should be cautious when taking this drug.''Montelukast'' (''Singulair'') is an inhibitor of leukotriene action, another chemical involved in the allergic reaction. This medication is used for therapy of ''asthma'' and has also been approved for treatment of allergic rhinitis, but it is not a first-line therapy. It has been shown to be most effective in those for whom significant congestion is a primary complaint. It may also be used in some cases together with antihistamines.''If antihistamines and nasal sprays are not effective or not tolerated by the patient, other types of therapy are available. ''Allergy desensitization'' or immunotherapy may be needed. Allergy immunotherapy stimulates the immune system with gradually increasing doses of the substances to which a person is allergic. Because the patient is being exposed to the allergy-inducing substance, an allergic reaction can occur and this treatment should be supervised by a physician. Although the exact way allergy desensitization works is not completely known, allergy injections appear to modify or stop the allergic reaction by reducing the strength of the IgE and its effect on the mast cells. This form of treatment is very effective for allergies to pollen, mites, cats, and especially stinging insects (for example, bees). Allergy immunotherapy usually requires a series of injections (''allergy shots'') and takes three months to one year to become effective. The required length of treatment may vary, but three to five years is a typical course. Frequent office visits are necessary.''The duration of the effect of allergy immunotherapy should last many years, if not a lifetime. Although rare, serious allergy reactions can occur while receiving allergy injections. One cannot predict who will have a severe reaction. Even after years of receiving allergy shots, a patient can experience a reaction.'  "
Are there home remedies for hay fever?,"'A number of herbal or alternative treatments have been used for symptoms of hay fever. Scientific review of the use of these preparations has been limited, although there are some reports that suggest potential benefit for a number of different herbal remedies, at least in certain patients. These include the following:''Many herbal formulations contain a number of different ingredients, each with potentially varying effects and properties. People who wish to try one of these treatments should learn about potential side effects.

What is the prognosis of allergic rhinitis?,"'Allergic rhinitis is a chronic condition, meaning that it persists over time. Some people who experience allergic rhinitis as children will notice their symptoms improve as they get older. Others may have symptoms for life. Allergic rhinitis is not associated with severe complications and can be managed effectively with medications and, in some cases, desensitization therapy.' "
Is it possible to prevent allergic rhinitis?,"'Because allergic rhinitis is related to genetic susceptibility, ''prevention'' of the condition is not possible. However, it may be possible for some people to prevent attacks by avoiding exposure to the triggering allergic substance.' "
What is dandruff?,'Those unpleasant white flakes on the collar of your dark shirt or blouse are dandruff. Dandruff is a sign that the skin of the scalp is peeling off (exfoliating). It is perfectly normal for the skin to ''exfoliate''. The problem arises when the amount of dandruff becomes an eyesore. There are basically two reasons for this. Too much production or not effective removal. In the too much production category are inflammatory diseases of the scalp. In the ineffective removal category is inadequate scalp hygienic efforts.' 
What specialties of doctors treat dandruff?,'Primary-care providers and nurse practitioners are be able to diagnose and treat most cases of dandruff. Dermatologists are experts in skin diseases.' 
What are the causes of dandruff? What are dandruff symptoms and signs?,"'Dandruff itself produces no symptoms. However, the most common cause of dandruff, ''seborrheic dermatitis'' (''seborrhea''), is an ''itchy'' red ''rash'' that tends to occur on the scalp, ears, face, mid-chest, and mid-back. The cause of seborrhea is unknown, although a yeast that often lives on the skin, ''Malassezia furfur'', may play a role.''The most common secondary manifestation of seborrhea of the scalp is dandruff. Seborrhea produces plaques of ''itchy'' red skin with scaling. It is the accumulated scale that we call dandruff. Reddish, scaly plaques may also appear in the eyebrows, on the forehead, in the ear canal, on the folds of skin that extend from the nostril to the commissure of the lips. Although skin affected by seborrhea may feel and look dry, this is not the case; moisturizers are of little help in its control.''Scalp seborrhea may slow hair growth but does not cause permanent ''hair loss'"". Often, scalp seborrhea doesn't even ""'itch'' significantly. Seborrhea can appear during infancy, starting shortly after birth and lasting several months. It may affect the scalp (""''cradle cap''"") or produce scaly plaques on the body. Seborrhea may occur at any age.''Some people who have weakened immune systems, such as those on ''chemotherapy'' or those with ''HIV'' disease or certain neurological disorders, may have very severe seborrhea. It is important to emphasize, however, that seborrhea is a very common condition, affecting perhaps 5% of the population (with men predominating). The vast majority of those who have it are completely healthy and have no internal or immune problems.''There are a variety of other inflammatory diseases that can produce excessive scaling and therefore dandruff, including ''psoriasis'', fungal infection of the scalp skin (''tinea capitis''), and ''allergic contact dermatitis''.' "
How do doctors diagnose the cause of dandruff?,"'After a thorough scalp examination, the cause of most cases of dandruff is usually apparent. Occasionally, physicians may find it necessary to perform a scalp biopsy where a small amount of scalp skin is removed under local anesthesia and submitted for examination under a microscope.' "
What treatments are available for dandruff?,"'Treatment of seborrhea (dandruff) is directed at fighting the ''skin inflammation''. This is done either directly, by using cortisone-based creams and lotions (which reduce inflammation), or by using topical anti-yeast lotions and shampoos. Treatment should be directed at the cause of the dandruff.'  "
What doesn't help dandruff?,"  Moisturizing: Moisturizing lotions don't do much more than smooth out scales and make plaques look redder. Switching brands of shampoo: Shampoo doesn't cause dandruff. However, medicated shampoos (see below) can help. Changing hair-care routines: There is no ""right"" shampoo or conditioner. What is more important is the frequency with which these agents are used. As a rule, the more frequently one shampoos, the better the result. Seborrhea and dandruff are not caused by excessive shampooing ""drying out the scalp."" Hair dyes and conditioners do not cause or aggravate dandruff. Switching antiperspirants: When underarms are red from seborrhea, almost anything will make them redder, including antiperspirants, even though they are only aggravating the seborrhea and not causing it."

What are risk factors for seborrheic dermatitis?,"'Although almost all patients with seborrheic dermatitis are generally healthy, there does seem to be an association with diseases of the central nervous system and ''AIDS'' (''HIV'').' "
What causes seborrheic dermatitis?,"'Medical professionals have a poor understanding of the causes of seborrheic dermatitis. There are some newly recognized genetic influences in seborrheic dermatitis. Eleven gene mutations or protein deficiencies appear to be more common in individuals with seborrheic dermatitis. Most of the genes play a role either in the immune response or epidermal differentiation. Since this condition tends to occur in areas of heavy sebum production, it is felt that oily skin may be a factor leading to seborrheic dermatitis. In addition, it seems that many patients with seborrheic dermatitis have an abundant growth of normal skin yeast (''Pityrosporum'' or ''Malassezia'') in the affected areas. The fact that topical antifungal medications are effective in controlling seborrheic dermatitis has led some to conclude fungi may play a role in causing this disease. Whether these normal members of the cutaneous microbiome play a causal role in seborrheic dermatitis remains to be determined. Patients with severe central nervous system disease (''dementia'' and traumatic brain injuries) seem to have more trouble with seborrheic dermatitis. It is unclear if the nervous system plays a role in causing ''seborrhea'' or that it is simply a lack of normal hygiene.''Seborrheic dermatitis is not ''contagious''.' "

In adults, areas commonly involved include the scalp, the ''outer ear'', and external auditory canal, the forehead, the eyebrows, the eyelids, the cheeks adjacent to the nose, including the folds that extends from the nose to the sides of the mouth, and less commonly the armpits, the mid-chest, and mid-back regions. In ''babies'', the ''rash'' causes a scalp eruption commonly called ""''cradle cap''."" It can also be more extensive and involve the ''diaper'' area as well.

On the other hand, 1% hydrocortisone, which is inexpensive and easily available without a prescription, is likely to be very effective in controlling ''seborrhea''.' "
What are complications of seborrheic dermatitis?,"'There are few complications attributable to this condition. Most problems seem to be related to misdiagnosis or mistreatment. Rarely, certain superficial cutaneous (dermatophyte) ''fungal infections'' of the face and scalp can resemble seborrheic dermatitis. If dermatophyte infections are mistakenly treated with anti-inflammatory medications (topical steroids), more extensive involvement could be encouraged. The overuse of potent topical steroids in an ill-conceived attempt to cure this condition, especially on the face and armpits, can result in many undesirable skin changes including skin thinning. Severe seborrheic dermatitis can occasionally produce thinning or loss of hair, in great part probably related to excessive scratching. As the disease is controlled, regrowth is expected.'  "
What is the prognosis of seborrheic dermatitis?,"'Since seborrheic dermatitis generally is not associated with any serious problems, one way of looking at prognosis would be optimistic.

Patients may also use ''ketoconazole''-containing creams for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.''It needs to be stressed that since this condition is incurable but easily controlled; if the disease is active and the treatment is stopped, one should expect the seborrheic dermatitis to recur. One should also use effective medications just frequently enough to control the symptoms. Excessive treatment of apparently normal skin is economically wasteful as well as potentially risky.'   Tar Ketoconazole (Nizoral requires a prescription) Zinc pyrithione (Head & Shoulders) Selenium sulfide (Selsun) Salicylic acid 10% sodium sulfacetamide and 5% sulfur solution (Novacet, Sulfacet R lotion)"
Are there home remedies for seborrheic dermatitis?,"'There is little compelling evidence that any of the following substances taken either orally or used topically are of any significant benefit in the control of seborrheic dermatitis: coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, ''tea tree oil'', or biotin. On the other hand, 1% hydrocortisone, which is inexpensive and easily available without a prescription, is likely to be very effective in controlling ''seborrhea''.' "
What are complications of seborrheic dermatitis?,"'There are few complications attributable to this condition. Most problems seem to be related to misdiagnosis or mistreatment. Rarely, certain superficial cutaneous (dermatophyte) ''fungal infections'' of the face and scalp can resemble seborrheic dermatitis. If dermatophyte infections are mistakenly treated with anti-inflammatory medications (topical steroids), more extensive involvement could be encouraged. The overuse of potent topical steroids in an ill-conceived attempt to cure this condition, especially on the face and armpits, can result in many undesirable skin changes including skin thinning. Severe seborrheic dermatitis can occasionally produce thinning or loss of hair, in great part probably related to excessive scratching. As the disease is controlled, regrowth is expected.'  "
What is the prognosis of seborrheic dermatitis?,"'Since seborrheic dermatitis generally is not associated with any serious problems, one way of looking at prognosis would be optimistic. On the other hand, although treatment almost always results in an excellent response, it is unlikely to result in any durable, permanent resolution of the disease.''Seborrheic dermatitis is not preventable.' "
What is secondhand smoke?,"'Secondhand smoke refers to tobacco smoke that is passively breathed in by people in the vicinity of a person who is ''smoking''. Terms that have been used to refer to secondhand smoke are ''passive smoking'', involuntary smoking, or ''environmental tobacco smoke'' (ETS). Secondhand smoke is a mixture of the smoke from the tobacco product itself (termed sidestream smoke) and exhaled smoke from the smoker (known as mainstream smoke).''When a nonsmoker inhales secondhand smoke, he or she is exposed to the same toxins and chemicals, including ''nicotine'', as the smoker.''Exposure of children to secondhand smoke also increases their health risks; and children are especially vulnerable to the effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Even children who do not live with smokers may be at risk for adverse effects of secondhand smoke. Chemicals from tobacco smoke inhaled by a ''nursing'' mother are also known to reach breast milk.' "
What causes secondhand smoke?,"'Cigarettes are the most common sources of secondhand smoke, followed by cigars and pipe smoke. People can be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke anywhere - in their homes, in the workplace, and in recreational settings.' "
What are the health risks of secondhand smoke?,"'Secondhand smoke carries many health risks. At least 250 harmful chemicals have been identified in secondhand smoke, including at least 50 carcinogens (chemicals that are known to cause ''cancer''). Just some of the dangerous chemicals present in secondhand smoke include vinyl chloride, cadmium, benzene, arsenic, and ethylene oxide.''Secondhand smoke is known to cause ''cancer''. It has been classified as a ""known human carcinogen"" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is also associated with ''cardiovascular'' and respiratory diseases as well as other serious health conditions; several are listed below. '  "
Lung cancer and secondhand smoke,'Passive smoking is an established risk factor for the development of ''lung cancer''. Research has shown that nonsmokers who reside with a smoker have an increased risk for developing ''lung cancer'' when compared with nonsmokers who do not reside with a smoker.' 
Cardiovascular disease and secondhand smoke,"'Like ''cigarette'' smoking itself, secondhand smoke is a significant risk factor for the development of ''cardiovascular disease'' and ''heart attack''.' "
Other lung diseases and secondhand smoke,"'Coughing'', chest congestion, and decreased lung function can also occur in those exposed to passive smoke. ''Babies'' exposed to secondhand smoke can also develop serious respiratory infections. Passive smoking is believed to cause lung infections (such as ''pneumonia'' and ''bronchitis'') in children younger than 18 months of age each year.' "
Secondhand smoke and other effects on children,"'In addition to the risk of ''pneumonia'' and respiratory infections in babies exposed to secondhand smoke (see above), passive smoke is known to increase the severity of ''asthma in children'' with this condition. ''Middle ear'' infections in children are also occur as a result of exposure to secondhand smoke. Babies who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for ''sudden infant death syndrome'' (SIDS).' "
Secondhand smoke and the effects on pregnant women,"'Like women who smoke, ''pregnant'' women who are exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of having low-birthweight babies.' "
Secondhand smoke and the possible link to breast cancer,"'The question of whether or not passive smoking is associated with an increased risk of ''breast cancer'' is currently a source of both investigation and controversy. ''Breast cancer'' risk in active smokers is not known to be increased, yet some studies have found a possible link to ''breast cancer'' with exposure to passive smoke. In 2006, the U.S. Surgeon General\'s report concluded that there is ""suggestive but not sufficient"" evidence of a link at this point.' "
Is there a safe level of secondhand smoke?,"'While, logically, more extensive or prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with greatest risk of having medical problems as a result, no safe limit for exposure to secondhand smoke has been established. Even low levels of secondhand smoke can be harmful. This means that all exposure to secondhand smoke should be avoided whenever possible.' "
What can be done about secondhand smoke exposure?,"'Local, state, and national governments have enacted a variety of laws designed to protect people from health dangers associated with secondhand smoke. These laws vary according to location. The American Lung Association has a listing of these regulations grouped by U.S. state (see References below). Legislation to prevent smoking in workplaces and public buildings is on the rise as the public becomes more informed about the risks of secondhand smoke.''Obviously, quitting smoking if you are a smoker is the best way to protect your family and friends from secondhand smoke. A number of support systems, programs, and even prescription medications are available to help smokers break the habit. ''If you are a non-smoker, the safest way to avoid passive smoke is not to allow others to smoke in your home. This is particularly important if there are children in your home. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, smoke-free workplaces are the only way to protect people from exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace, since separate smoking areas, cleaning the air, and ventilating the building are not sufficient to prevent exposure if people still are permitted to smoke inside the building.'  "
What is thirdhand smoke?,"'Thirdhand smoke exposure is a new concept; it is exposure to many of the toxic agents in smoke that have accumulated (as residue) in clothing, drapes, rugs, furniture, dust, and other items due to secondhand smoke. The toxic agents, deposited in and on items from secondhand smoke, can be absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes of non-smokers, especially by infants and young children. ''Prevention'' of secondhand smoke exposure can prevent thirdhand smoke exposure.' "
What is a sedimentation rate?,"'A sedimentation rate is common blood test that is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body. The sedimentation rate is also called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate because it is a measure of the ''red blood cells'' (erythrocytes) sedimenting in a tube over a given period of time. Sedimentation rate is often abbreviated as ""sed rate"" or ESR. Although this test measures a general state of inflammation, it is not specific to what causes the inflammation. It is elevated in inflammatory diseases, including ''arthritis'' as well as in autoimmune diseases such as ''lupus''. It can also be elevated due to other conditions such as certain ''cancers'' and '""Grave's disease""'.'  "
Why is a sedimentation rate performed?,'A blood sedimentation rate is tested to detect inflammation in the body. It can also be used to follow the progress of a disease.' 
What specialists order a sedimentation rate?,'All specialties of medicine can order this simple blood test while evaluating symptoms in order to determine whether or not there is inflammation in the body.' 
How is a sedimentation rate performed?,"'A sedimentation rate is performed by measuring the rate at which red blood cells (RBCs) settle in a test tube. The RBCs become sediment in the bottom of the test tube over time, leaving the blood serum visible above. The classic sedimentation rate is simply how far the top of the RBC layer has fallen (in millimeters) in one hour. The sedimentation rate will be higher in the presence of increased inflammation.' "
What is the normal range for sedimentation rate?,"'The normal sedimentation rate (Westergren method) for males is 0-15 millimeters per hour, females is 0-20 millimeters per hour. The sedimentation rate may normally be slightly higher in the elderly.'  "

What is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS or SEID)?,"'Controversy about the definition of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) finally led an international panel of CFS research experts in 1994 to establish a precise definition of CFS so that the syndrome could actually be diagnosed. There are two criteria developed by this panel that both define and diagnose CFS. The patient must have both of the following criteria:''In addition, four symptoms of the symptoms listed above must have persisted or recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness and must not have predated the severe chronic fatigue (the symptoms must have occurred at the same time or after severe chronic fatigue appeared but not before).''Why so much controversy? There are at least three major reasons for controversy:''Consequently, the disease is diagnosed by excluding the diseases that may cause the symptoms (termed a diagnosis of exclusion) listed above yet still fit the two defined criteria established by the panel of CFS experts in 1994. It is not unusual for patients to undergo an extensive battery of tests to rule out other diseases before a patient is determined to fit the CFS diagnostic criteria. Unfortunately, many patients who have subsequently been diagnosed to have CFS also have had some of the conditions and symptoms listed above. Without the CFS criteria, diagnosis would even be more controversial.''Controversy still remains. Some individuals want to rename the disease. Some clinicians want to change the 1994 criteria and others do not. Until a definitive cause is proven, controversies about names, diagnosis, treatments, and other aspects of CFS will likely remain. In February 2015, the Institute of Medicine, at the request of the CDC and others, completed a report on myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. The new report suggested a name change to systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) to better identify the disease with less prejudice and also slightly modified some criteria of the disease.''Because this report is so new and is undergoing review, it is not clear if all of it will be accepted by the medical community. The CDC has yet to make name changes in its CFS publications so this article will present information on both the current CFS and the new SEID; in most instances, the basic information has not changed (for example, cause, symptoms, and treatment).' Have severe (debilitating) chronic fatigue of six months or longer duration with other known medical conditions excluded by clinical diagnosis Concurrently have four or more of the following symptoms: substantial impairment in short-term memory or concentration; sore throat; tender lymph nodes in neck or armpits; unexplained muscle pain; multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertion malaise lasting more than 24 hours Chronic fatigue is a symptom of many illnesses, so chronic fatigue syndrome had to have criteria that distinguished it from similar medical conditions that have chronic fatigue as a major symptom (for example, fibromyalgia, chronic mononucleosis, neurologic problems, Lyme disease, and sensitivity to certain chemicals). Other treatable illnesses and conditions that may have chronic fatigue as one symptom among many others include hypothyroidism, cancers, immune system or autoimmune diseases, adrenal gland problems, subacute or chronic infections, obesity, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, reactions to medicines, hormonal disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, depression, alcohol and substance abuse, psychosomatic problems, and malingering. In addition to the two criteria above needed to fit both the definition and diagnosis of CFS, many patients have additional symptoms that, depending on their severity, may predominate and overshadow the CFS symptom criteria. These symptoms include chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chronic cough, diarrhea, nausea, night sweats, jaw pan and muscle stiffness, double vision, and psychological problems such as panic attacks, anxiety, and depression. There is no laboratory test that can give a definitive diagnosis of CFS, and there are no physical signs that specifically identify CFS."
What causes chronic fatigue syndrome or systemic exertional  intolerance disease?,"'No defined cause of CFS or SEID is known, even after about two decades of research on patients who fit the CFS or SEID criteria. Although many diseases coexist with CFS or SEID in patients, there are no proven links to any known disease (physical or mental) or pathogen (including viral) that is responsible for CFS or SEID development.''The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) indicates that researchers are still trying to identify the cause(s) of CFS/SEID and offer some speculation about the ongoing research. For example, they suggest the possibility that CFS/SEID represents an endpoint of multiple diseases or conditions such as viral infections, ''stress'', and toxin exposure. However, the CDC states that ""CFS is not caused exclusively by any single recognized infectious disease agent."" This includes ''Epstein-Barr virus'', ''Lyme disease'' bacteria (''Borrelia burgdorferi''), human retroviruses, bornaviruses, fungi, ''Mycoplasma'' spp, ''flu'' or ''flu-like'' ''viruses'', and many others. However, if a person has been infected with several (at least three) different pathogens, the chances of getting CFS/SEID goes up. In addition, some researchers had suggested that a new virus found in some CFS/SEID patients (termed XMRV or xenotropic murine ''leukemia'' virus-related virus) may be a candidate for cause, but a recent larger study has disproven this theory. In addition, although the CDC says no autoimmune changes like ''lupus'' or other diseases are found in CFS/SEID, many CFS/SEID patients have high levels of immune complexes and anti-self antibodies in their blood that may be a clue about what causes CFS/SEID. The CDC mentions other findings (''allergies'', T-cell activation, and cytokines), but none have any direct link to causing CFS/SEID.'  "
What are risk factors for CFS/SEID?,"'Without knowing the cause of CFS/SEID, it is difficult to determine risk factors. However, statistics gathered about people with diagnosed CFS/SEID do tell something about some high-risk groups. For example, although people of every age, gender, race, and economic group can get CFS/SEID, it is most commonly diagnosed in people in the 40- and 50-year-old age group. In addition, CFS/SEID is diagnosed about four times as often in women (some investigators consider ''menopause'' as a possible risk factor). In the pediatric-aged group, ''teens'' are most often affected.' "
"What are systemic exertion intolerance disease or chronic fatigue syndrome
symptoms and signs?","'The symptoms and signs of CFS/SEID are complex but specific. The patient must have severe chronic long-term fatigue of six months or longer duration with other known medical conditions excluded by clinical diagnosis. In addition, the patients have four or more of the following symptoms that either occurred at the same time or after the severe chronic fatigue. The symptoms are substantial impairment in short-term memory or concentration; ''sore throat''; tender lymph nodes; muscle ''pain''; multi-joint ''pain'' without swelling or redness; ''headaches'' of a new type, pattern, or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertion malaise lasting more than 24 hours. Patients may often have additional symptoms such as ''double vision'', mild ''fevers'', earaches, ''diarrhea'', and many other symptoms, but they do not fit into the criteria that are considered to be part of the definition of CFS.''The following are five main symptoms that the new IOM considers key for SEID or CFS:'   Reduction or impairment in ability to carry out normal daily activities, accompanied by profound fatigue Post-exertional malaise (worsening of symptoms after physical, cognitive, or emotional effort) Unrefreshing sleep Cognitive impairment Orthostatic intolerance (symptoms that worsen when a person stands upright and improve when the person lies back down)"
What are CFS/SEID symptoms in men?,"'CFS/SEID symptoms in men need to fit the time and type (six months and four symptoms) criteria stated above to be diagnosed with the disease. Currently, chronic fatigue syndrome is diagnosed much more frequently in females than in males. General symptoms in men that can occur that are described by male patients are similar to those in females, but clinicians speculate that many men are reluctant to say they have symptoms of muscle pain, malaise, ''headaches'', and other symptoms due to cultural inhibitions and training. Many doctors speculate that men need to be more open in describing their symptoms to their doctors.' "
What are SEID/CFS symptoms in women?,"'As stated above for men, CFS/SEID symptoms in women need to fit the time and type (six months and four symptoms) criteria stated above to be diagnosed with the disease. Women are much more likely to be diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome than men. Clinicians speculate that women are more forthcoming with their doctors about chronicity of symptoms, including the four major symptom criteria (substantial impairment in short-term memory or concentration; sore throat; tender lymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertion malaise lasting more than 24 hours) than are men because of cultural expectations and training.' "
What tests help diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome (or systemic exertion intolerance disease)?,"'Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or SEID is a diagnosis made by excluding many diseases that have chronic fatigue as a major or frequent symptom. Unfortunately, there are no physical signs or diagnostic tests (blood tests) that identify CFS. The diagnosis is made by fitting the two major criteria set out by a group of CFS research experts.''The first criteria states the patient must have severe chronic fatigue of six months or longer duration with other known medical conditions excluded by clinical diagnosis (a diagnosis by exclusion).''The second criteria requires the patients have four or more of the following symptoms that either occurred at the same time or after the severe chronic fatigue. The symptoms include''Although there are no lab studies that identify CFS, lab studies do provide some supportive evidence for a diagnosis. Lab studies that confirm either the presence or absence of cause of other diseases help define the diagnosis of exclusion. Additionally, many patients with CFS have certain lab findings listed below:''When taken as a group, these tests support a diagnosis of CFS but are not definitive; only the patients who meet the two established criteria described above for CFS are definitively diagnosed with CFS.'   substantial impairment in short-term memory or concentration; sore throat; tender lymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertion malaise lasting more than 24 hours. Very low erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Elevated immunoglobulins against Coxsackie B virus, HHV-6 (human herpes virus strain 6), and/or Chlamydia pneumoniae Decreased number of natural killer cells Normal CBC, liver function tests, and normal urinalysis"
What is the treatment for CFS/SEID?,"'There is no known cure for CFS/SEID chronic fatigue syndrome; treatment is based on those therapies that reduce the symptoms. In general, patients who are diagnosed within the first two years of symptoms respond better to symptomatic treatment than those patients diagnosed after two or more years of having the disease. Treatments to reduce symptoms are individualized for each patient as no single therapy helps all CFS/SEID patients.''Drug therapies (''bupropion'' [''Wellbutrin''], ''sertraline'' [''Zoloft''], and other ''antidepressant'' ''drugs'') are used to treat symptoms of sleep, pain, and psychological problems. Some have used ''Adderall'' (off-label use). Other therapies that are used include ''stress'' reduction and lifestyle changes (which may include ''diet'' and ''exercise'' reduction). Some investigators suggest ''diet'' and ''nutrition'' play a role and recommend ''vitamin D'', B6, B12, lysine, and glutathione ''supplements'' while others do not. Some clinicians may prescribe antibiotics such as ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl'') or ''amoxicillin and clavulanic acid'' (''Augmentin'') if the patient has high levels of antibodies that react with ''C. pneumoniae'"" or other organisms. Other treatments that claim some positive effects on CFS symptoms include holistic treatments such as bananas, maca (a plant root from Peru), pau d'arco (herb from the bark of the taheebo tree in Central America), and ""'spirulina'' (plankton).''Acupuncture'' also is claimed to help CFS patients with moderate support in the literature. Light therapy has also been advocated but has no support in the literature, and at least one article has questioned ''melatonin'"" or phototherapy's effectiveness. Most of these other therapies have not been well studied by experts who treat CFS.""""Most clinicians agree that patients with CFS need a team approach to their illness. The most disruptive symptoms should be addressed first. In general, the therapy will be a combination of psychological counseling (to help with the day-to-day burden CFS imposes on the patient's life) and mild guided exercise (a physical therapist might be able to help; care should be taken to not be too strenuous). Cognitive-behavioral therapy seems to work well with pediatric-aged patients.""  "
Is there a cure for CFS/SEID?,"'Although some people may spontaneously have a reduction or cessation of some symptoms of CFS/SEID, especially with treatments described above, there is no known cure for CFS/SEID. The current goal is to relieve symptoms; accomplishing symptom reduction is often done by several different activities that patients can use at the same time. Such combined activity (or therapy) may include the following:' Healthy diet (increasing fruits and vegetables and avoiding fatty foods); some claim adding the following herbals and diet products to the patient's diet may reduce symptoms (astragalus, borage seed oil, bromelain, comfrey, Echinacea, garlic, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, primrose oil, quercetin, St. John's wort, maca, pau d'arco, spirulina, and Shiitake mushroom extract), but patients should check with their doctors before using such items. Exercise (regular daily exercise programmed for the individual patient or exercise therapy) Intellectual stimulation (may require cognitive-behavioral therapy) Testing for sleep apnea and receive sleep-management therapy if needed Medication for pain and discomfort Anti-anxiety and /or antidepressant medication"
What is the prognosis (outcome) for CFS/SEID?,"'Because full recovery from CFS/SEID is very infrequent (only 5%-10% of adult patients diagnosed), the prognosis usually ranges from fair to poor. Many patients can only work at part-time jobs; some patients become bedridden. Mental impairment, especially ''memory loss'' and the ability to concentrate are very disconcerting to CFS/SEID patients. Even with symptomatic treatment, some patients may continue with a slow decline in their ability to function. Some studies suggest that even about two years after diagnosis and symptomatic treatment, over half of the CFS/SEID patients still were fatigued.''The prognosis for children is better than that for adults as most children recover completely after about one to four years of treatment; although during recovery, they often have problems in school with attention and memory. Many will also have ''anxiety'' and ''depression''. Researchers suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy is a major effective treatment for adolescents with CFS/SEID.' "
Is it possible to prevent CFS/SEID?,"'Currently, there are no known methods to prevent CFS/SEID. Development of effective ''prevention'' methods is hampered by no firm knowledge of the cause(s) of CFS/SEID. The prevention suggestions of most experts and clinicians are general recommendations that result in a healthy lifestyle since no specific prevention methods are known. Examples of the general recommendations are avoidance of viral infections, lower daily stress as much as possible, and maintain regular sleep cycles and a healthy diet, along with avoidance of the many toxins in the environment; these are cited by most clinicians as possible ways to reduce or prevent the chance of developing CFS/SEID.''Females with CFS/SEID are cautioned about ''pregnancy'' because of the stresses placed on the mother and fetus. In addition, the genetic connection, if any, is not clear between the parents with CFS/SEID and their children.' "
Where can people find additional information about CFS/SEID?,"'The following is a list of agencies and groups where people may obtain more detailed information about chronic fatigue syndrome or systemic exertion intolerance disease and how an individual sufferer may cope with the disease:''CFIDS Association of America: ''http://solvecfs.org/what-is-mecfs/''CDC Treatment and Management Options: ''http://www.cdc.gov/cfs/''Because the disease seems to include multiple major disciplines such as neurology, immunology, infectious diseases and more, the NIH has developed a study group termed ""Trans-NIH ME/CFS"" that include representatives of various disciplines to report and design clinical studies. This group may provide more clarity on the cause and treatment of this disease.''In addition, you may want to watch a documentary film by Jennifer Brea titled ''Unrest''. The film shows her experience with this disease.' "
Introduction,"'Few experiences match the drama of a convulsive seizure. A person having a severe seizure may cry out, fall to the floor unconscious, twitch or move uncontrollably, drool, or even lose bladder control. Within minutes, the attack is over, and the person regains consciousness but is exhausted and dazed. This is the image most people have when they hear the word epilepsy. However, this type of seizure - a generalized tonic-clonic seizure -- is only one kind of epilepsy. There are many other kinds, each with a different set of symptoms.''Epilepsy was one of the first brain disorders to be described. It was mentioned in ancient Babylon more than 3,000 years ago. The strange behavior caused by some seizures has contributed through the ages to many superstitions and prejudices. The word epilepsy is derived from the Greek word for ""attack."" People once thought that those with epilepsy were being visited by demons or gods. However, in 400 B.C., the early physician Hippocrates suggested that epilepsy was a disorder of the brain, and we now know that he was right.' "
What Is Epilepsy?,"'Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. Neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons, glands, and muscles to produce human thoughts, feelings, and actions. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior, or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. During a seizure, neurons may fire as many as 500 times a second, much faster than normal. In some people, this happens only occasionally; for others, it may happen up to hundreds of times a day.''More than 2 million people in the United States have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. For about 80 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. However, about 25 to 30 percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment. Doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy. Having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy.''Epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation. Some people with mental retardation may experience seizures, but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment. Many people with epilepsy have normal or above-average intelligence. Famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the Russian writer Dostoyevsky, the philosopher Socrates, the military general Napoleon, and the inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, who established the Nobel Prize. Several Olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. Seizures sometimes do cause brain damage, particularly if they are severe. However, most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. Any changes that do occur are usually subtle, and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures.''While epilepsy cannot currently be cured, for some people it does eventually go away. One study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy, or epilepsy with an unknown cause, had a 68 to 92 percent chance of becoming seizure-free by 20 years after their diagnosis. The odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes, but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. This is more likely if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person has had ''epilepsy surgery''.'  "
What Causes Epilepsy?,"'Epilepsy is a disorder with many possible causes. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity -- from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development -- can lead to seizures.''Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, or some combination of these factors. Researchers believe that some people with epilepsy have an abnormally high level of excitatory neurotransmitters that increase neuronal activity, while others have an abnormally low level of inhibitory neurotransmitters that decrease neuronal activity in the brain. Either situation can result in too much neuronal activity and cause epilepsy. One of the most-studied neurotransmitters that plays a role in epilepsy is GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Research on GABA has led to ''drugs'' that alter the amount of this neurotransmitter in the brain or change how the brain responds to it. Researchers also are studying excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate.'""In some cases, the brain's attempts to repair itself after a head injury, ""'stroke'', or other problem may inadvertently generate abnormal nerve connections that lead to epilepsy. Abnormalities in brain wiring that occur during brain development also may disturb neuronal activity and lead to epilepsy.''Research has shown that the cell membrane that surrounds each neuron plays an important role in epilepsy. Cell membranes are crucial for a neuron to generate electrical impulses. For this reason, researchers are studying details of the membrane structure, how molecules move in and out of membranes, and how the cell nourishes and repairs the membrane. A disruption in any of these processes may lead to epilepsy. Studies in animals have shown that, because the brain continually adapts to changes in stimuli, a small change in neuronal activity, if repeated, may eventually lead to full-blown epilepsy. Researchers are investigating whether this phenomenon, called kindling, may also occur in humans.''In some cases, epilepsy may result from changes in non-neuronal brain cells called glia. These cells regulate concentrations of chemicals in the brain that can affect neuronal signaling.''About half of all seizures have no known cause. However, in other cases, the seizures are clearly linked to infection, ''trauma'', or other identifiable problems.'""Research suggests that genetic abnormalities may be some of the most important factors contributing to epilepsy. Some types of epilepsy have been traced to an abnormality in a specific gene. Many other types of epilepsy tend to run in families, which suggests that genes influence epilepsy. Some researchers estimate that more than 500 genes could play a role in this disorder. However, it is increasingly clear that, for many forms of epilepsy, genetic abnormalities play only a partial role, perhaps by increasing a person's susceptibility to seizures that are triggered by an environmental factor.""'Several types of epilepsy have now been linked to defective genes for ion channels, the ""gates"" that control the flow of ions in and out of cells and regulate neuron signaling. Another gene, which is missing in people with progressive myoclonus epilepsy, codes for a protein called cystatin B. This protein regulates enzymes that break down other proteins. Another gene, which is altered in a severe form of epilepsy called LaFora\'s disease, has been linked to a gene that helps to break down carbohydrates.'""While abnormal genes sometimes cause epilepsy, they also may influence the disorder in subtler ways. For example, one study showed that many people with epilepsy have an abnormally active version of a gene that increases resistance to drugs. This may help explain why anticonvulsant drugs do not work for some people. Genes also may control other aspects of the body's response to medications and each person's susceptibility to seizures, or seizure threshold. Abnormalities in the genes that control neuronal migration, a critical step in brain development, can lead to areas of misplaced or abnormally formed neurons, or dysplasia, in the brain that can cause epilepsy. In some cases, genes may contribute to development of epilepsy even in people with no family history of the disorder. These people may have a newly developed abnormality, or mutation, in an epilepsy-related gene.""'In many cases, epilepsy develops as a result of brain damage from other disorders. For example, ''brain tumors'', alcoholism, and '""Alzheimer's""' disease frequently lead to epilepsy because they alter the normal workings of the brain. Strokes, ''heart attacks'', and other conditions that deprive the brain of oxygen also can cause epilepsy in some cases. About 32 percent of all cases of newly developed epilepsy in elderly people appears to be due to cerebrovascular disease, which reduces the supply of oxygen to brain cells. Meningitis, ''AIDS'', viral ''encephalitis'', and other infectious diseases can lead to epilepsy, as can ''hydrocephalus'' -- a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the brain. Epilepsy also can result from intolerance to wheat ''gluten'' (also known as ''celiac disease''), or from a parasitic infection of the brain called neurocysticercosis. Seizures may stop once these disorders are treated successfully. However, the odds of becoming seizure-free after the primary disorder is treated are uncertain and vary depending on the type of disorder, the brain region that is affected, and how much brain damage occurred prior to treatment.''Epilepsy is associated with a variety of developmental and metabolic disorders, including ''cerebral palsy'', ''neurofibromatosis'', pyruvate dependency, tuberous sclerosis, ''Landau-Kleffner syndrome'', and ''autism''. Epilepsy is just one of a set of symptoms commonly found in people with these disorders.''In some cases, head injury can lead to seizures or epilepsy. Safety measures such as wearing seat belts in cars and using helmets when riding a motorcycle or playing competitive sports can protect people from epilepsy and other problems that result from head injury.''Prenatal Injury and Developmental Problems''The developing brain is susceptible to many kinds of injury. Maternal infections, poor ''nutrition'', and oxygen deficiencies are just some of the conditions that may take a toll on the brain of a developing baby. These conditions may lead to ''cerebral palsy'', which often is associated with epilepsy, or they may cause epilepsy that is unrelated to any other disorders. About 20 percent of ''seizures in children'' are due to cerebral palsy or other neurological abnormalities. Abnormalities in genes that control development also may contribute to epilepsy. Advanced brain imaging has revealed that some cases of epilepsy that occur with no obvious cause may be associated with areas of dysplasia in the brain that probably develop before birth.''Seizures can result from exposure to lead, carbon monoxide, and many other poisons. They also can result from exposure to street drugs and from overdoses of ''antidepressants'' and other medications.''Seizures are often triggered by factors such as lack of ''sleep'', alcohol consumption, ''stress'', or hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle. These seizure triggers do not cause epilepsy but can provoke first seizures or cause breakthrough seizures in people who otherwise experience good seizure control with their medication. Sleep deprivation in particular is a universal and powerful trigger of seizures. For this reason, people with epilepsy should make sure to get enough sleep and should try to stay on a regular sleep schedule as much as possible. For some people, light flashing at a certain speed or the flicker of a computer monitor can trigger a seizure; this problem is called photosensitive epilepsy. ''Smoking'' cigarettes also can trigger seizures. The ''nicotine'' in cigarettes acts on receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain, which increases neuronal firing. Seizures are not triggered by sexual activity except in very rare instances.' "
What Are the Different Kinds of Seizures?,"'Doctors have described more than 30 different types of seizures. Seizures are divided into two major categories -- focal seizures and generalized seizures. However, there are many different types of seizures in each of these categories.' "
Focal Seizures,"'Focal seizures, also called partial seizures, occur in just one part of the brain. About 60 percent of people with epilepsy have focal seizures. These seizures are frequently described by the area of the brain in which they originate. For example, someone might be diagnosed with focal frontal lobe seizures.''In a simple focal seizure, the person will remain conscious but experience unusual feelings or sensations that can take many forms. The person may experience sudden and unexplainable feelings of joy, anger, sadness, or ''nausea''. He or she also may hear, smell, taste, see, or feel things that are not real. ''In a complex focal seizure, the person has a change in or loss of consciousness. His or her consciousness may be altered, producing a dreamlike experience. People having a complex focal seizure may display strange, repetitious behaviors such as blinks, twitches, mouth movements, or even ''walking'' in a circle. These repetitious movements are called automatisms. More complicated actions, which may seem purposeful, can also occur involuntarily. Patients may also continue activities they started before the seizure began, such as washing dishes in a repetitive, unproductive fashion. These seizures usually last just a few seconds. ''Some people with focal seizures, especially complex focal seizures, may experience auras -- unusual sensations that warn of an impending seizure. These auras are actually simple focal seizures in which the person maintains consciousness. The symptoms an individual person has, and the progression of those symptoms, tend to be stereotyped, or similar every time. ''The symptoms of focal seizures can easily be confused with other disorders. For instance, the dreamlike perceptions associated with a complex focal seizure may be misdiagnosed as ''migraine'' ''headaches'', which also may cause a dreamlike state. The strange behavior and sensations caused by focal seizures also can be mistaken for symptoms of ''narcolepsy'', ''fainting'', or even mental illness. It may take many tests and careful monitoring by an experienced physician to tell the difference between epilepsy and other disorders.' "
Generalized Seizures,"'Generalized seizures are a result of abnormal neuronal activity on both sides of the brain. These seizures may cause loss of consciousness, falls, or massive muscle spasms. ''There are many kinds of generalized seizures. In absence seizures, the person may appear to be staring into space and/or have jerking or twitching muscles. These seizures are sometimes referred to as petit mal seizures, which is an older term. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of muscles of the body, generally those in the back, legs, and arms. Clonic seizures cause repeated jerking movements of muscles on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures cause jerks or twitches of the upper body, arms, or legs. Atonic seizures cause a loss of normal muscle tone. The affected person will fall down or may drop his or her head involuntarily. Tonic-clonic seizures cause a mixture of symptoms, including stiffening of the body and repeated jerks of the arms and/or legs as well as loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures are sometimes referred to by an older term: ''grand mal'' seizures.''Not all seizures can be easily defined as either focal or generalized. Some people have seizures that begin as focal seizures but then spread to the entire brain. Other people may have both types of seizures but with no clear pattern. '""Society's lack of understanding about the many different types of seizures is one of the biggest problems for people with epilepsy. People who witness a non-convulsive seizure often find it difficult to understand that behavior which looks deliberate is not under the person's control. In some cases, this has led to the affected person being arrested or admitted to a psychiatric hospital. To combat these problems, people everywhere need to understand the many different types of seizures and how they may appear."" "
What Are the Different Kinds of Epilepsy?,"'Just as there are many different kinds of seizures, there are many different kinds of epilepsy. Doctors have identified hundreds of different epilepsy syndromes -- disorders characterized by a specific set of symptoms that include epilepsy. Some of these syndromes appear to be hereditary. For other syndromes, the cause is unknown. Epilepsy syndromes are frequently described by their symptoms or by where in the brain they originate. People should discuss the implications of their type of epilepsy with their doctors to understand the full range of symptoms, the possible treatments, and the prognosis. ''People with absence epilepsy have repeated absence seizures that cause momentary lapses of consciousness. These seizures almost always begin in childhood or adolescence, and they tend to run in families, suggesting that they may be at least partially due to a defective gene or genes. Some people with absence seizures have purposeless movements during their seizures, such as a jerking arm or rapidly blinking eyes. Others have no noticeable symptoms except for brief times when they are ""out of it."" Immediately after a seizure, the person can resume whatever he or she was doing. However, these seizures may occur so frequently that the person cannot concentrate in school or other situations. Childhood absence epilepsy usually stops when the child reaches ''puberty''. Absence seizures usually have no lasting effect on intelligence or other brain functions. ''Temporal lobe epilepsy, or TLE, is the most common epilepsy syndrome with focal seizures. These seizures are often associated with auras. TLE often begins in childhood. Research has shown that repeated temporal lobe seizures can cause a brain structure called the hippocampus to shrink over time. The hippocampus is important for memory and learning. While it may take years of temporal lobe seizures for measurable hippocampal damage to occur, this finding underlines the need to treat TLE early and as effectively as possible. '""Neocortical epilepsy is characterized by seizures that originate from the brain's cortex, or outer layer. The seizures can be either focal or generalized. They may include strange sensations, visual hallucinations, emotional changes, muscle spasms, convulsions, and a variety of other symptoms, depending on where in the brain the seizures originate. """"There are many other types of epilepsy, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms. Many of these, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Rasmussen's ""'encephalitis'"", begin in childhood. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have severe epilepsy with several different types of seizures, including atonic seizures, which cause sudden falls and are also called drop attacks. This severe form of epilepsy can be very difficult to treat effectively. Rasmussen's encephalitis is a progressive type of epilepsy in which half of the brain shows continual inflammation. It sometimes is treated with a radical surgical procedure called hemispherectomy. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as childhood absence epilepsy, tend to go into remission or stop entirely during adolescence, whereas other syndromes such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are usually present for life once they develop. Seizure syndromes do not always appear in childhood, however. ""'Epilepsy syndromes that are easily treated, do not seem to impair cognitive functions or development, and usually stop spontaneously are often described as benign. Benign epilepsy syndromes include benign infantile ''encephalopathy'' and benign ''neonatal'"" convulsions. Other syndromes, such as early myoclonic encephalopathy, include neurological and developmental problems. However, these problems may be caused by underlying neurodegenerative processes rather than by the seizures. Epilepsy syndromes in which the seizures and/or the person's cognitive abilities get worse over time are called progressive epilepsy. ""'Several types of epilepsy begin in infancy. The most common type of infantile epilepsy is infantile spasms, clusters of seizures that usually begin before the age of 6 months. During these seizures the infant may bend and cry out. Anticonvulsant drugs often do not work for infantile spasms, but the seizures can be treated with ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) or ''prednisone''.' "
When Are Seizures Not Epilepsy?,"'While any seizure is cause for concern, having a seizure does not by itself mean a person has epilepsy. First seizures, ''febrile seizures'', nonepileptic events, and ''eclampsia'' are examples of seizures that may not be associated with epilepsy.' "
First Seizures,"'Many people have a single seizure at some point in their lives. Often these seizures occur in reaction to anesthesia or a strong drug, but they also may be unprovoked, meaning that they occur without any obvious triggering factor. Unless the person has suffered brain damage or there is a family history of epilepsy or other neurological abnormalities, these single seizures usually are not followed by additional seizures. One recent study that followed patients for an average of 8 years found that only 33 percent of people have a second seizure within 4 years after an initial seizure. People who did not have a second seizure within that time remained seizure-free for the rest of the study. For people who did have a second seizure, the risk of a third seizure was about 73 percent on average by the end of 4 years. ''When someone has experienced a first seizure, the doctor will usually order an ''electroencephalogram'', or ''EEG'"", to determine what type of seizure the person may have had and if there are any detectable abnormalities in the person's brain waves. Thedoctor also may order brain scans to identify abnormalities that may be visible in the brain. These tests may help the doctor decide whether or not to treat the person with antiepileptic drugs. In some cases, drug treatment after the first seizure may help prevent future seizures and epilepsy. However, the drugs also can cause detrimental side effects, so doctors prescribe them only when they feel the benefits outweigh the risks. Evidence suggests that it may be beneficial to begin anticonvulsant medication once a person has had a second seizure, as the chance of future seizures increases significantly after this occurs."" "
Febrile Seizures,"'Sometimes a child will have a seizure during the course of an illness with a high ''fever''. These seizures are called febrile seizures (febrile is derived from the Latin word for ""''fever''"") and can be very alarming to the parents and other caregivers. In the past, doctors usually prescribed a course of anticonvulsant drugs following a febrile seizure in the hope of preventing epilepsy. However, most children who have a febrile seizure do not develop epilepsy, and long-term use of anticonvulsant drugs in children may damage the developing brain or cause other detrimental side effects. Experts at a 1980 consensus conference coordinated by the National Institutes of Health concluded that preventive treatment after a febrile seizure is generally not warranted unless certain other conditions are present: a family history of epilepsy, signs of nervous system impairment prior to the seizure, or a relatively prolonged or complicated seizure. The risk of subsequent non-febrile seizures is only 2 to 3 percent unless one of these factors is present. ''Researchers have now identified several different genes that influence the risk of febrile seizures in certain families. Studying these genes may lead to new understanding of how febrile seizures occur and perhaps point to ways of preventing them.' "
Nonepileptic Events,"""Sometimes people appear to have seizures, even though their brains show no seizure activity. This type of phenomenon has various names, including nonepileptic events and pseudoseizures. Both of these terms essentially mean something that looks like a seizure but isn't one. Nonepileptic events that are psychological in origin may be referred to as psychogenic seizures. Psychogenic seizures may indicate dependence, a need for attention, avoidance of stressful situations, or specific psychiatric conditions. Some people with epilepsy have psychogenic seizures in addition to their epileptic seizures. Other people who have psychogenic seizures do not have epilepsy at all. Psychogenic seizures cannot be treated in the same way as epileptic seizures. Instead, they are often treated by ""'mental health'' specialists. ''Other nonepileptic events may be caused by ''narcolepsy'', ''Tourette syndrome'', cardiac arrythmia, and other medical conditions with symptoms that resemble seizures. Because symptoms of these disorders can look very much like epileptic seizures, they are often mistaken for epilepsy. Distinguishing between true epileptic seizures and nonepileptic events can be very difficult and requires a thorough medical assessment, careful monitoring, and knowledgeable health professionals. Improvements in brain scanning and monitoring technology may improve diagnosis of nonepileptic events in the future.' "
Eclampsia,'Eclampsia'' is a life-threatening condition that can develop in ''pregnant'' women. Its symptoms include sudden elevations of ''blood pressure'' and seizures. Pregnant women who develop unexpected seizures should be rushed to a hospital immediately. Eclampsia can be treated in a hospital setting and usually does not result in additional seizures or epilepsy once the ''pregnancy'' is over.' 
How is Epilepsy Diagnosed?,"'Doctors have developed a number of different tests to determine whether a person has epilepsy and, if so, what kind of seizures the person has. In some cases, people may have symptoms that look very much like a seizure but in fact are nonepileptic events caused by other disorders. Even doctors may not be able to tell the difference between these disorders and epilepsy without close observation and intensive testing. ''An EEG records brain waves detected by electrodes placed on the ''scalp'"". This is the most common diagnostic test for epilepsy and can detect abnormalities in the brain's electrical activity. People with epilepsy frequently have changes in their normal pattern of brain waves, even when they are not experiencing a seizure. While this type of test can be very useful in diagnosing epilepsy, it is not foolproof. Some people continue to show normal brain wave patterns even after they have experienced a seizure. In other cases, the unusual brain waves are generated deep in the brain where the EEG is unable to detect them. Many people who do not have epilepsy also show some unusual brain activity on an EEG. Whenever possible, an EEG should be performed within 24 hours of a patient's first seizure. Ideally, EEGs should be performed while the patient is sleeping as well as when he or she is awake, because brain activity during sleep is often quite different than at other times. """"Video monitoring is often used in conjunction with EEG to determine the nature of a person's seizures. It also can be used in some cases to rule out other disorders such as cardiac arrythmia or narcolepsy that may look like epilepsy. ""'One of the most important ways of diagnosing epilepsy is through the use of brain scans. The most commonly used brain scans include CT (computed tomography), PET (positron emission tomography) and ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging''). CT and MRI scans reveal the structure of the brain, which can be useful for identifying brain tumors, ''cysts'"", and other structural abnormalities. PET and an adapted kind of MRI called functional MRI (fMRI) can be used to monitor the brain's activity and detect abnormalities in how it works. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) is a relatively new kind of brain scan that is sometimes used to locate seizure foci in the brain. """"In some cases, doctors may use an experimental type of brain scan called a magnetoencephalogram, or MEG. MEG detects the magnetic signals generated by neurons to allow doctors to monitor brain activity at different points in the brain over time, revealing different brain functions. While MEG is similar in concept to EEG, it does not require electrodes and it can detect signals from deeper in the brain than an EEG. Doctors also are experimenting with brain scans called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that can detect abnormalities in the brain's biochemical processes, and with near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that can detect oxygen levels in brain tissue. """"Taking a detailed medical history, including symptoms and duration of the seizures, is still one of the best methods available to determine if a person has epilepsy and what kind of seizures he or she has. The doctor will ask questions about the seizures and any past illnesses or other symptoms a person may have had. Since people who have suffered a seizure often do not remember what happened, caregivers' accounts of the seizure are vital to this evaluation. ""'Doctors often take blood samples for testing, particularly when they are examining a child. These blood samples are often screened for metabolic or genetic disorders that may be associated with the seizures. They also may be used to check for underlying problems such as infections, ''lead poisoning'', ''anemia'', and ''diabetes'' that may be causing or triggering the seizures. ''Doctors often use tests devised to measure motor abilities, behavior, and intellectual capacity as a way to determine how the epilepsy is affecting that person. These tests also can provide clues about what kind of epilepsy the person has.' "
Can Epilepsy Be Prevented?,"'Many cases of epilepsy can be prevented by wearing seatbelts and bicycle helmets, putting children in car seats, and other measures that prevent head injury and other trauma. Prescribing medication after first or second seizures or febrile seizures also may help prevent epilepsy in some cases. Good ''prenatal care'', including treatment of ''high blood pressure'' and infections during pregnancy, can prevent brain damage in the developing baby that may lead to epilepsy and other neurological problems later. Treating ''cardiovascular disease'', ''high blood pressure'', infections, and other disorders that can affect the brain during adulthood and ''aging'' also may prevent many cases of epilepsy. Finally, identifying the genes for many neurological disorders can provide opportunities for genetic screening and ''prenatal diagnosis'' that may ultimately prevent many cases of epilepsy.' "
How Can Epilepsy Be Treated?,"'Accurate diagnosis of the type of epilepsy a person has is crucial for finding an effective treatment. There are many different ways to treat epilepsy. Currently available treatments can control seizures at least some of the time in about 80 percent of people with epilepsy. However, another 20 percent, about 600,000 people with epilepsy in the United States, have intractable seizures, and another 400,000 feel they get inadequate relief from available treatments. These statistics make it clear that improved treatments are desperately needed. ''Doctors who treat epilepsy come from many different fields of medicine. They include neurologists, pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, internists, and family physicians, as well as neurosurgeons and doctors called epileptologists who specialize in treating epilepsy. People who need specialized or intensive care for epilepsy may be treated at large medical centers and neurology clinics at hospitals or by neurologists in private practice. Many ''epilepsy treatment'' centers are associated with university hospitals that perform research in addition to providing medical care. ''Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. Research suggests that medication and other treatments may be less successful in treating epilepsy once seizures and their consequences become established. '""By far the most common approach to treating epilepsy is to prescribe antiepileptic drugs.  The first effective antiepileptic drugs were bromides, introduced by an English physician named Sir Charles Locock in 1857.  He noticed that bromides had a sedative effect and seemed to reduce seizures in some patients.  More than 20 different antiepileptic drugs are now on the market, all with different benefits and side effects.  The choice of which drug to prescribe, and at what dosage, depends on many different factors, including the type of seizures a person has, the person's lifestyle and age, how frequently the seizures occur, and, for a woman, the likelihood that she will become pregnant.  People with epilepsy should follow their doctor's advice and share any concerns they may have regarding their medication. ""'Doctors seeing a patient with newly developed epilepsy often prescribe ''carbamazepine'', valproate, ''lamotrigine'', ''oxcarbazepine'', or ''phenytoin'' first, unless the epilepsy is a type that is known to require a different kind of treatment.  For absence seizures, ''ethosuximide'' is often the primary treatment.  Other commonly prescribed drugs include ''clonazepam'', phenobarbital, and ''primidone''.   Some relatively new epilepsy drugs include ''tiagabine'', ''gabapentin'', ''topiramate'', ''levetiracetam'', and ''felbamate'"".   Other drugs are used in combination with one of the standard drugs or for intractable seizures that do not respond to other medications.  A few drugs, such as fosphenytoin, are approved for use only in hospital settings to treat specific problems such as status epilepticus (see section, “Are There Special Risks Associated With Epilepsy?”).  For people with stereotyped recurrent severe seizures that can be easily recognized by the person's family, the drug ""'diazepam'' is now available as a gel that can be administered rectally by a family member.  This method of drug delivery may be able to stop prolonged or repeated seizures before they develop into status epilepticus.  ''For most people with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with just one drug at the optimal dosage.  Combining medications usually amplifies side effects such as ''fatigue'' and ''decreased appetite'"", so doctors usually prescribe monotherapy, or the use of just one drug, whenever possible.  Combinations of drugs are sometimes prescribed if monotherapy fails to effectively control a patient's seizures. """"The number of times a person needs to take medication each day is usually determined by the drug's half-life, or the time it takes for half the drug dose to be metabolized or broken down into other substances in the body.  Some drugs, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, only need to be taken once a day, while others such as valproate must be taken two or three times a day. ""'Most side effects of antiepileptic drugs are relatively minor, such as ''fatigue'', ''dizziness'', or ''weight gain''.  However, severe and life-threatening side effects such as ''allergic'' reactions can occur.  Epilepsy medication also may predispose people to developing ''depression'' or psychoses.  People with epilepsy should consult a doctor immediately if they develop any kind of ''rash'' while on medication, or if they find themselves ''depressed'' or otherwise unable to think in a rational manner.  Other danger signs that should be discussed with a doctor immediately are extreme ''fatigue'', staggering or other movement problems, and slurring of words.  People with epilepsy should be aware that their epilepsy medication can interact with many other drugs in potentially harmful ways.  For this reason, people with epilepsy should always tell doctors who treat them which medications they are taking.  Women also should know that some antiepileptic drugs can interfere with the effectiveness of ''oral contraceptives'', and they should discuss this possibility with their doctors. ''Since people can become more sensitive to medications as they age, they may need to have their blood levels of medication checked occasionally to see if the dose needs to be adjusted.  The effects of a particular medication also sometimes wear off over time, leading to an increase in seizures if the dose is not adjusted.  People should know that some citrus fruit, in particular grapefruit juice, may interfere with breakdown of many drugs.  This can cause too much of the drug to build up in their bodies, often worsening the side effects. ''People taking epilepsy medication should be sure to check with their doctor and/or seek a second medical opinion if their medication does not appear to be working or if it causes unexpected side effects. '""When a person starts a new epilepsy drug, it is important to tailor the dosage to achieve the best results. People's bodies react to medications in very different and sometimes unpredictable ways, so it may take some time to find the right drug at the right dose to provide optimal control of seizures while minimizing side effects. A drug that has no effect or very bad side effects at one dose may work very well at another dose. Doctors will usually prescribe a low dose of the new drug initially and monitor blood levels of the drug to determine when the best possible dose has been reached. ""'Generic versions are available for many antiepileptic drugs. The chemicals in generic drugs are exactly the same as in the brand-name drugs, but they may be absorbed or processed differently in the body because of the way they are prepared. Therefore, patients should always check with their doctors before switching to a generic version of their medication. '""Some doctors will advise people with epilepsy to discontinue their antiepileptic drugs after 2 years have passed without a seizure. Others feel it is better to wait for 4 to 5 years. Discontinuing medication should always be done with a doctor's advice and supervision. It is very important to continue taking epilepsy medication for as long as the doctor prescribes it. People also should ask the doctor or pharmacist ahead of time what they should do if they miss a dose. Discontinuing medication without a doctor's advice is one of the major reasons people who have been seizure-free begin having new seizures. Seizures that result from suddenly stopping medication can be very serious and can lead to status epilepticus. Furthermore, there is some evidence that uncontrolled seizures trigger changes in neurons that can make it more difficult to treat the seizures in the future. """"The chance that a person will eventually be able to discontinue medication varies depending on the person's age and his or her type of epilepsy. More than half of children who go into remission with medication can eventually stop their medication without having new seizures. One study showed that 68 percent of adults who had been seizure-free for 2 years before stopping medication were able to do so without having more seizures and 75 percent could successfully discontinue medication if they had been seizure-free for 3 years. However, the odds of successfully stopping medication are not as good for people with a family history of epilepsy, those who need multiple medications, those with focal seizures, and those who continue to have abnormal EEG results while on medication. ""'When seizures cannot be adequately controlled by medications, doctors may recommend that the person be evaluated for surgery. Surgery for epilepsy is performed by teams of doctors at medical centers. To decide if a person may benefit from surgery, doctors consider the type or types of seizures he or she has. They also take into account the brain region involved and how important that region is for everyday behavior. Surgeons usually avoid operating in areas of the brain that are necessary for speech, language, ''hearing'', or other important abilities. Doctors may perform tests such as a Wada test (administration of the drug amobarbitol into the carotid artery) to find areas of the brain that control speech and memory. They often monitor the patient intensively prior to surgery in order to pinpoint the exact location in the brain where seizures begin. They also may use implanted electrodes to record brain activity from the surface of the brain. This yields better information than an external EEG. '""A 1990 National Institutes of Health consensus conference on surgery for epilepsy concluded that there are three broad categories of epilepsy that can be treated successfully with surgery. These include focal seizures, seizures that begin as focal seizures before spreading to the rest of the brain, and unilateral multifocal epilepsy with infantile hemiplegia (such as Rasmussen's encephalitis). Doctors generally recommend surgery only after patients have tried two or three different medications without success, or if there is an identifiable brain lesion--a damaged or dysfunctional area--believed to cause the seizures. ""'A study published in 2000 compared surgery to an additional year of treatment with antiepileptic drugs in people with longstanding temporal lobe epilepsy. The results showed that 64 percent of patients receiving surgery became seizure-free, compared to 8 percent of those who continued with medication only. Because of this study and other evidence, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) now recommends surgery for TLE when antiepileptic drugs are not effective. However, the study and the AAN guidelines do not provide guidance on how long seizures should occur, how severe they should be, or how many drugs should be tried before surgery is considered. A nationwide study is now underway to determine how soon surgery for TLE should be performed. ''If a person is considered a good candidate for surgery and has seizures that cannot be controlled with available medication, experts generally agree that surgery should be performed as early as possible. It can be difficult for a person who has had years of seizures to fully re-adapt to a seizure-free life if the surgery is successful. The person may never have had an opportunity to develop independence, and he or she may have had difficulties with school and work that could have been avoided with earlier treatment. Surgery should always be performed with support from rehabilitation specialists and counselors who can help the person deal with the many psychological, social, and employment issues he or she may face. ''While surgery can significantly reduce or even halt seizures for some people, it is important to remember that any kind of surgery carries some amount of risk (usually small). Surgery for epilepsy does not always successfully reduce seizures and it can result in cognitive or personality changes, even in people who are excellent candidates for surgery. Patients should ask their surgeon about his or her experience, success rates, and complication rates with the procedure they are considering. '""Even when surgery completely ends a person's seizures, it is important to continue taking seizure medication for some time to give the brain time to re-adapt. Doctors generally recommend medication for 2 years after a successful operation to avoid new seizures. ""'In cases where seizures are caused by a ''brain tumor'', ''hydrocephalus'"", or other conditions that can be treated with surgery, doctors may operate to treat these underlying conditions. In many cases, once the underlying condition is successfully treated, a person's seizures will disappear as well. ""'The most common type of surgery for epilepsy is removal of a seizure focus, or small area of the brain where seizures originate. This type of surgery, which doctors may refer to as a lobectomy or ''lesionectomy'', is appropriate only for focal seizures that originate in just one area of the brain. In general, people have a better chance of becoming seizure-free after surgery if they have a small, well-defined seizure focus. Lobectomies have a 55-70 percent success rate when the type of epilepsy and the seizure focus is well-defined. The most common type of lobectomy is a ''temporal lobe resection'', which is performed for people with temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal ''lobe resection'' leads to a significant reduction or complete cessation of seizures about 70 - 90 percent of the time. ''When seizures originate in part of the brain that cannot be removed, surgeons may perform a procedure called a ''multiple subpial transection''. In this type of operation, which has been commonly performed since 1989, surgeons make a series of ''cuts'"" that are designed to prevent seizures from spreading into other parts of the brain while leaving the person's normal abilities intact. About 70 percent of patients who undergo a multiple subpial transection have satisfactory improvement in seizure control. ""'Corpus callosotomy, or severing the network of neural connections between the right and left halves, or hemispheres, of the brain, is done primarily in children with severe seizures that start in one half of the brain and spread to the other side. Corpus callosotomy can end drop attacks and other generalized seizures. However, the procedure does not stop seizures in the side of the brain where they originate, and these focal seizures may even increase after surgery. '""These procedures remove half of the brain's cortex, or outer layer. They are used predominantly in children who have seizures that do not respond to medication because of damage that involves only half the brain, as occurs with conditions such as Rasmussen's encephalitis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and hemimegencephaly. While this type of surgery is very radical and is performed only as a last resort, children often recover very well from the procedure, and their seizures usually cease altogether. With intense rehabilitation, they often recover nearly normal abilities. Since the chance of a full recovery is best in young children, hemispherectomy should be performed as early in a child's life as possible. It is rarely performed in children older than 13. ""'The vagus nerve stimulator was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 for use in people with seizures that are not well-controlled by medication. The vagus nerve stimulator is a battery-powered device that is surgically implanted under the skin of the chest, much like a ''pacemaker'', and is attached to the vagus nerve in the lower neck. This device delivers short bursts of electrical energy to the brain via the vagus nerve. On average, this stimulation reduces seizures by about 20 - 40 percent. Patients usually cannot stop taking epilepsy medication because of the stimulator, but they often experience fewer seizures and they may be able to reduce the dose of their medication. Side effects of the vagus nerve stimulator are generally mild but may include ''hoarseness'', ear ''pain'', a ''sore throat'', or nausea. Adjusting the amount of stimulation can usually eliminate most side effects, although the ''hoarseness'' typically persists. The batteries in the vagus nerve stimulator need to be replaced about once every 5 years; this requires a minor operation that can usually be performed as an outpatient procedure. ''Several new devices may become available for epilepsy in the future. Researchers are studying whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a procedure which uses a strong magnet held outside the head to influence brain activity, may reduce seizures. They also hope to develop implantable devices that can deliver drugs to specific parts of the brain. ''Studies have shown that, in some cases, children may experience fewer seizures if they maintain a strict ''diet'' rich in ''fats'' and low in carbohydrates. This unusual diet, called the ''ketogenic diet'', causes the body to break down fats instead of carbohydrates to survive. This condition is called ketosis. One study of 150 children whose seizures were poorly controlled by medication found that about one-fourth of the children had a 90 percent or better decrease in seizures with the ketogenic diet, and another half of the group had a 50 percent or better decrease in their seizures. Moreover, some children can discontinue the ketogenic diet after several years and remain seizure-free. The ketogenic diet is not easy to maintain, as it requires strict adherence to an unusual and limited range of foods. Possible side effects include retarded growth due to nutritional deficiency and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can lead to ''kidney stones''. People who try the ketogenic diet should seek the guidance of a dietician to ensure that it does not lead to serious nutritional deficiency. ''Researchers are not sure how ketosis inhibits seizures. One study showed that a byproduct of ketosis called beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) inhibits seizures in animals. If BHB also works in humans, researchers may eventually be able to develop drugs that mimic the seizure-inhibiting effects of the ketogenic diet. ''Researchers are studying whether biofeedback -- a strategy in which individuals learn to control their own brain waves -- may be useful in controlling seizures. However, this type of therapy is controversial and most studies have shown discouraging results. Taking large doses of ''vitamins'"" generally does not help a person's seizures and may even be harmful in some cases. But a good diet and some vitamin ""'supplements'', particularly ''folic acid'', may help reduce some ''birth defects'' and medication-related nutritional deficiencies. Use of non-vitamin ''supplements'' such as ''melatonin'' is controversial and can be risky. One study showed that melatonin may reduce seizures in some children, while another found that the risk of seizures increased measurably with melatonin. Most non-vitamin supplements such as those found in health food stores are not regulated by the FDA, so their true effects and their interactions with other drugs are largely unknown'  "
How Does Epilepsy Affect Daily Life?,"'Most people with epilepsy lead outwardly normal lives. Approximately 80 percent can be significantly helped by modern therapies, and some may go months or years between seizures. However, the condition can and does affect daily life for people with epilepsy, their family, and their friends. People with severe seizures that resist treatment have, on average, a shorter life expectancy and an increased risk of cognitive impairment, particularly if the seizures developed in early childhood. These impairments may be related to the underlying conditions tha cause epilepsy or to epilepsy treatment rather than the epilepsy itself. ''It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems. Sometimes these problems are caused by embarrassment or frustration associated with epilepsy. Other problems may result from ''bullying'"", teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. In children, these problems can be minimized if parents encourage a positive outlook and independence, do not reward negative behavior with unusual amounts of attention, and try to stay attuned to their child's needs and feelings. Families must learn to accept and live with the seizures without blaming or resenting the affected person. Counseling services can help families cope with epilepsy in a positive manner. Epilepsy support groups also can help by providing a way for people with epilepsy and their family members to share their experiences, frustrations, and tips for coping with the disorder. ""'People with epilepsy have an increased risk of poor self-esteem, ''depression'', and ''suicide''. These problems may be a reaction to a lack of understanding or discomfort about epilepsy that may result in cruelty or avoidance by other people. Many people with epilepsy also live with an ever-present fear that they will have another seizure. '""For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence, in particular the ability to drive. Most states and the District of Columbia will not issue a driver's license to someone with epilepsy unless the person can document that they have gone a specific amount of time without a seizure (the waiting period varies from a few months to several years). Some states make exceptions for this policy when seizures don't impair consciousness, occur only during sleep, or have long auras or other warning signs that allow the person to avoid driving when a seizure is likely to occur. Studies show that the risk of having a seizure-related accident decreases as the length of time since the last seizure increases. One study found that the risk of having a seizure-related motor vehicle accident is 93 percent less in people who wait at least 1 year after their last seizure before driving, compared to people who wait for shorter intervals. """"The risk of seizures also restricts people's recreational choices. For instance, people with epilepsy should not participate in sports such as skydiving or motor racing where a moment's ""'inattention'' could lead to injury. Other activities, such as ''swimming'' and sailing, should be done only with precautions and/or supervision. However, jogging, football, and many other sports are reasonably safe for a person with epilepsy. Studies to date have not shown any increase in seizures due to sports, although these studies have not focused on any activity in particular. There is some evidence that regular ''exercise'' may even improve seizure control in some people. Sports are often such a positive factor in life that it is best for the person to participate, although the person with epilepsy and the coach or other leader should take appropriate safety precautions. It is important to take steps to avoid potential sports-related problems such as ''dehydration'', overexertion, and ''hypoglycemia'', as these problems can increase the risk of seizures. ''By law, people with epilepsy or other handicaps in the United States cannot be denied employment or access to any educational, recreational, or other activity because of their seizures. However, one survey showed that only about 56 percent of people with epilepsy finish high school and about 15 percent finish college -- rates much lower than those for the general population. The same survey found that about 25 percent of working-age people with epilepsy are unemployed. These numbers indicate that significant barriers still exist for people with epilepsy in school and work. Restrictions on driving limit the employment opportunities for many people with epilepsy, and many find it difficult to face the misunderstandings and social pressures they encounter in public situations. Antiepileptic drugs also may cause side effects that interfere with concentration and memory. Children with epilepsy may need extra time to complete schoolwork, and they sometimes may need to have instructions or other information repeated for them. Teachers should be told what to do if a child in their classroom has a seizure, and parents should work with the school system to find reasonable ways to accommodate any special needs their child may have. '""Women with epilepsy are often concerned about whether they can become pregnant and have a healthy child. This is usually possible. While some seizure medications and some types of epilepsy may reduce a person's interest in sexual activity, most people with epilepsy can become pregnant. Moreover, women with epilepsy have a 90 percent or better chance of having a normal, healthy baby, and the risk of birth defects is only about 4 to 6 percent. The risk that children of parents with epilepsy will develop epilepsy themselves is only about 5 percent unless the parent has a clearly hereditary form of the disorder. Parents who are worried that their epilepsy may be hereditary may wish to consult a genetic counselor to determine what the risk might be. ""'Amniocentesis'' and high-level ''ultrasound'' can be performed during pregnancy to ensure that the baby is developing normally, and a procedure called a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein test can be used for prenatal diagnosis of many conditions if a problem is suspected. ''There are several precautions women can take before and during pregnancy to reduce the risks associated with pregnancy and delivery. Women who are thinking about ''becoming pregnant'' should talk with their doctors to learn any special risks associated with their epilepsy and the medications they may be taking. Some seizure medications, particularly valproate, trimethidone, and phenytoin, are known to increase the risk of having a child with birth defects such as ''cleft palate'', ''heart'"" problems, or finger and toe defects. For this reason, a woman's doctor may advise switching to other medications during pregnancy. Whenever possible, a woman should allow her doctor enough time to properly change medications, including phasing in the new medications and checking to determine when blood levels are stabilized, before she tries to become pregnant. Women should also begin prenatal vitamin supplements -- especially with folic acid, which may reduce the risk of some birth defects -- well before pregnancy. Women who discover that they are pregnant but have not already spoken with their doctor about ways to reduce the risks should do so as soon as possible. However, they should continue taking seizure medication as prescribed until that time to avoid preventable seizures. Seizures during pregnancy can harm the developing baby or lead to ""'miscarriage'', particularly if the seizures are severe. Nevertheless, many women who have seizures during pregnancy have normal, healthy ''babies''. '""Women with epilepsy sometimes experience a change in their seizure frequency during pregnancy, even if they do not change medications. About 25 to 40 percent of women have an increase in their seizure frequency while they are pregnant, while other women may have fewer seizures during pregnancy. The frequency of seizures during pregnancy may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the woman's increased blood volume during pregnancy, which can dilute the effect of medication. Women should have their blood levels of seizure medications monitored closely during and after pregnancy, and the medication dosage should be adjusted accordingly. ""'Pregnant women with epilepsy should take ''prenatal vitamins'' and get plenty of sleep to avoid seizures caused by sleep deprivation. They also should take ''vitamin K'' supplements after 34 weeks of pregnancy to reduce the risk of a blood-clotting disorder in infants called neonatal coagulopathy that can result from fetal exposure to epilepsy medications. Finally, they should get good prenatal care, avoid tobacco, ''caffeine'', alcohol, and illegal drugs, and try to avoid stress. ''Labor and delivery'' usually proceed normally for women with epilepsy, although there is a slightly increased risk of hemorrhage, eclampsia, premature ''labor'', and cesarean section. Doctors can administer antiepileptic drugs intravenously and monitor blood levels of anticonvulsant medication during ''labor'' to reduce the risk that the ''labor'"" will trigger a seizure. Babies sometimes have symptoms of withdrawal from the mother's seizure medication after they are born, but these problems wear off in a few weeks or months and usually do not cause serious or long-term effects. A mother's blood levels of anticonvulsant medication should be checked frequently after delivery as medication often needs to be decreased. """"Epilepsy medications need not influence a woman's decision about breast-feeding her baby. Only minor amounts of epilepsy medications are secreted in ""'breast milk'', usually not enough to harm the baby and much less than the baby was exposed to in the womb. On rare occasions, the baby may become excessively drowsy or feed poorly, and these problems should be closely monitored. However, experts believe the benefits of breast-feeding outweigh the risks except in rare circumstances. '""To increase doctors' understanding of how different epilepsy medications affect pregnancy and the chances of having a healthy baby, Massachusetts General Hospital has begun a nationwide registry for women who take antiepileptic drugs while pregnant. Women who enroll in this program are given educational materials on pre-""'conception'' planning and perinatal care and are asked to provide information about the health of their children (this information is kept confidential). Women and physicians can contact this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or 617-726-1742 (fax: 617-724-8307). ''Women with epilepsy should be aware that some epilepsy medications can interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Women who wish to use oral contraceptives to prevent pregnancy should discuss this with their doctors, who may be able to prescribe a different kind of antiepileptic medication or suggest other ways of avoiding an unplanned pregnancy.'  "
Are There Special Risks Associated With Epilepsy?,"'Although most people with epilepsy lead full, active lives, they are at special risk for two life-threatening conditions: status epilepticus and sudden unexplained death. ''Status epilepticus is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a person either has an abnormally prolonged seizure or does not fully regain consciousness between seizures. Although there is no strict definition for the time at which a seizure turns into status epilepticus, most people agree that any seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes should, for practical purposes, be treated as though it was status epilepticus. ''While people with epilepsy are at an increased risk for status epilepticus, about 60 percent of people who develop this condition have no previous seizure history. These cases often result from tumors, trauma, or other problems that affect the brain and may themselves be life-threatening. ''While most seizures do not require emergency medical treatment, someone with a prolonged seizure lasting more than 5 minutes may be in status epilepticus and should be taken to an emergency room immediately. It is important to treat a person with status epilepticus as soon as possible. One study showed that 80 percent of people in status epilepticus who received medication within 30 minutes of seizure onset eventually stopped having seizures, whereas only 40 percent recovered if 2 hours had passed before they received medication. Doctors in a hospital setting can treat status epilepticus with several different drugs and can undertake emergency life-saving measures, such as administering oxygen, if necessary. ''People in status epilepticus do not always have severe convulsive seizures. Instead, they may have repeated or prolonged nonconvulsive seizures. This type of status epilepticus may appear as a sustained episode of ''confusion'' or agitation in someone who does not ordinarily have that kind of mental impairment. While this type of episode may not seem as severe as convulsive status epilepticus, it should still be treated as an emergency. ''For reasons that are poorly understood, people with epilepsy have an increased risk of dying suddenly for no discernible reason. This condition, called sudden unexplained death, can occur in people without epilepsy, but epilepsy increases the risk about two-fold. Researchers are still unsure why sudden unexplained death occurs. One study suggested that use of more than two anticonvulsant drugs may be a risk factor. However, it is not clear whether the use of multiple drugs causes the sudden death, or whether people' "
What Research Is Being Done on Epilepsy?,"'While research has led to many advances in understanding and treating epilepsy, there are many unanswered questions about how and why seizures develop, how they can best be treated or prevented, and how they influence other brain activity and brain development. Researchers, many of whom are supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), are studying all of these questions. They also are working to identify and test new drugs and other treatments for epilepsy and to learn how those treatments affect brain activity and development. '""The NINDS's Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP) studies potential new therapies with the goal of enhancing treatment for patients with epilepsy. Since it began in 1975, more than 390 public-private partnerships have been created. These partnerships have resulted in state-of-the-art evaluations of more than 25,000 compounds for their potential as antiepileptic drugs. This government-sponsored effort has contributed to the development of five drugs that are now approved for use in the United States. It has also aided in the discovery and profiling of six new compounds currently in various stages of clinical development. Besides testing for safer, more efficacious therapies, the Program is developing and validating new models that may one day find therapies that intervene in the disease process itself as well as models of resistant or refractory epilepsy. ""'Scientists continue to study how excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters interact with brain cells to control nerve firing. They can apply different chemicals to cultures of neurons in laboratory dishes to study how those chemicals influence neuronal activity. They also are studying how glia and other non-neuronal cells in the brain contribute to seizures. This research may lead to new drugs and other new ways of treating seizures. ''Researchers also are working to identify genes that may influence epilepsy in some way. Identifying these genes can reveal the underlying chemical processes that influence epilepsy and point to new ways of preventing or treating this disorder. Researchers also can study rats and mice that have missing or abnormal copies of certain genes to determine how these genes affect normal brain development and resistance to damage from disease and other environmental factors. In the future, researchers may be able to use panels of gene fragments, called ""gene chips,"" to determine each person\'s genetic ''makeup''. This information may allow doctors to prevent epilepsy or to predict which treatments will be most beneficial. ''Doctors are now experimenting with several new types of therapies for epilepsy. In one preliminary clinical trial, doctors have begun transplanting fetal pig neurons that produce GABA into the brains of patients to learn whether the cell transplants can help control seizures. Preliminary research suggests that stem cell transplants also may prove beneficial for treating epilepsy. Research showing that the brain undergoes subtle changes prior to a seizure has led to a prototype device that may be able to predict seizures up to 3 minutes before they begin. If this device works, it could greatly reduce the risk of injury from seizures by allowing people to move to a safe area before their seizures start. This type of device also may be hooked up to a treatment pump or other device that will automatically deliver an antiepileptic drug or an electric impulse to forestall the seizures. ''Researchers are continually improving MRI and other brain scans. Pre-surgical brain imaging can guide doctors to abnormal brain tissue and away from essential parts of the brain. Researchers also are using brain scans such as magnetoencephalograms (MEG) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to identify and study subtle problems in the brain that cannot otherwise be detected. Their findings may lead to a better understanding of epilepsy and how it can be treated.' "
How Can I Help Research on Epilepsy?,"'There are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. Pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry, which is maintained by the Genetics and Teratology Unit of Massachusetts General Hospital (see section on Pregnancy and Motherhood). People with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the Epilepsy Gene Discovery Project, which is supported by the Epilepsy Foundation. This project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. People who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. Researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary, and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. In many cases, identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. It also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. ''People with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications, surgical techniques, and other treatments by enrolling in ''clinical trials''. Information on clinical trials can be obtained from the NINDS as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies, universities, and other organizations. A person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. While experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials, patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. Therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work, and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. Patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. ''Patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. Brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders. Below are some brain banks that accept tissue from patients with epilepsy: ''Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders''University of Maryland''655 West Baltimore Street, Room 10-035 BRB''Baltimore, MD 21201-1559''800-847-1539''E-mail: ''[email\xa0protected]''http://medschool.umaryland.edu/BTBank/''(tissue from children only)''Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders''University of Miami''Department of Pathology, R-5''Papanicolaou Building, Room 410''Miami, FL 33136''800-59BRAIN (592-7246)''E-mail: ''[email\xa0protected]''(tissue from adults only)''Brain Endowment Bank''University of Miami''1501 NW Ninth Avenue, Suite #4013''Miami, FL 33136''305-243-6219''800-UM-BRAIN (862-7246) ''National Disease Research Interchange''8 Penn Center, 8th Floor''Philadelphia, PA 19103''215-557-7361''800-222-NDRI (6374)''E-mail: ''[email\xa0protected]''www.ndri.com''Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center''Neurology Research (127A)''W.

What to Do if You See Someone Having a Seizure,"""If you see someone having a seizure with convulsions and/or loss of consciousness, here's how you can help:"" Roll the person on his or her side to prevent choking on any fluids or vomit. Cushion the person's head.  Loosen any tight clothing around the neck.  Keep the person's airway open. If necessary, grip the person's jaw gently and tilt his or her head back.  Do NOT restrict the person from moving unless he or she is in danger.  Do NOT put anything into the person's mouth, not even medicine or liquid. These can cause choking or damage to the person's jaw, tongue, or teeth. Contrary to widespread belief, people cannot swallow their tongues during a seizure or any other time.  Remove any sharp or solid objects that the person might hit during the seizure.  Note how long the seizure lasts and what symptoms occurred so you can tell a doctor or emergency personnel if necessary.  Stay with the person until the seizure ends.  The person is pregnant or has diabetes. The seizure happened in water. The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes. The person does not begin breathing again or does not return to consciousness after the seizure stops. Another seizure starts before the person regains consciousness. The person injures himself or herself during the seizure. This is a first seizure or you think it might be. If in doubt, check to see if the person has a medical identification card or jewelry stating that they have epilepsy or a seizure disorder.  After the seizure ends, the person will probably be groggy and tired. He or she also may have a headache and be confused or embarrassed. Be patient with the person and try to help him or her find a place to rest if he or she is tired or doesn't feel well. If necessary, offer to call a taxi, a friend, or a relative to help the person get home safely.  If you see someone having a non-convulsive seizure, remember that the person's behavior is not intentional. The person may wander aimlessly or make alarming or unusual gestures. You can help by following these guidelines:  Remove any dangerous objects from the area around the person or in his or her path. Don't try to stop the person from wandering unless he or she is in danger. Don't shake the person or shout. Stay with the person until he or she is completely alert."
Conclusion,"'Many people with epilepsy lead productive and outwardly normal lives. Medical and research advances in the past two decades have led to a better understanding of epilepsy and seizures than ever before. Advanced brain scans and other techniques allow greater accuracy in diagnosing epilepsy and determining when a patient may be helped by surgery. More than 20 different medications and a variety of surgical techniques are now available and provide good control of seizures for most people with epilepsy. Other treatment options include the ketogenic diet and the first implantable device, the vagus nerve stimulator. Research on the underlying causes of epilepsy, including identification of genes for some forms of epilepsy and febrile seizures, has led to a greatly improved understanding of epilepsy that may lead to more effective treatments or even new ways of preventing epilepsy in the future.'

Introduction,"'Few experiences match the drama of a convulsive seizure. A person having a severe seizure may cry out, fall to the floor unconscious, twitch or move uncontrollably, drool, or even lose bladder control. Within minutes, the attack is over, and the person regains consciousness but is exhausted and dazed. This is the image most people have when they hear the word epilepsy. However, this type of seizure - a generalized tonic-clonic seizure -- is only one kind of epilepsy. There are many other kinds, each with a different set of symptoms.''Epilepsy was one of the first brain disorders to be described. It was mentioned in ancient Babylon more than 3,000 years ago. The strange behavior caused by some seizures has contributed through the ages to many superstitions and prejudices. The word epilepsy is derived from the Greek word for ""attack."" People once thought that those with epilepsy were being visited by demons or gods. However, in 400 B.C., the early physician Hippocrates suggested that epilepsy was a disorder of the brain, and we now know that he was right.' "
What Is Epilepsy?,"'Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. Neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons, glands, and muscles to produce human thoughts, feelings, and actions. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior, or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. During a seizure, neurons may fire as many as 500 times a second, much faster than normal. In some people, this happens only occasionally; for others, it may happen up to hundreds of times a day.''More than 2 million people in the United States have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. For about 80 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. However, about 25 to 30 percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment. Doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy. Having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy.''Epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation. Some people with mental retardation may experience seizures, but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment. Many people with epilepsy have normal or above-average intelligence. Famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the Russian writer Dostoyevsky, the philosopher Socrates, the military general Napoleon, and the inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, who established the Nobel Prize. Several Olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. Seizures sometimes do cause brain damage, particularly if they are severe. However, most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. Any changes that do occur are usually subtle, and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures.''While epilepsy cannot currently be cured, for some people it does eventually go away. One study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy, or epilepsy with an unknown cause, had a 68 to 92 percent chance of becoming seizure-free by 20 years after their diagnosis. The odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes, but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. This is more likely if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person has had ''epilepsy surgery''.'  "
What Causes Epilepsy?,"'Epilepsy is a disorder with many possible causes. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity -- from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development -- can lead to seizures.''Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, or some combination of these factors. Researchers believe that some people with epilepsy have an abnormally high level of excitatory neurotransmitters that increase neuronal activity, while others have an abnormally low level of inhibitory neurotransmitters that decrease neuronal activity in the brain. Either situation can result in too much neuronal activity and cause epilepsy. One of the most-studied neurotransmitters that plays a role in epilepsy is GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Research on GABA has led to ''drugs'' that alter the amount of this neurotransmitter in the brain or change how the brain responds to it. Researchers also are studying excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate.'""In some cases, the brain's attempts to repair itself after a head injury, ""'stroke'', or other problem may inadvertently generate abnormal nerve connections that lead to epilepsy. Abnormalities in brain wiring that occur during brain development also may disturb neuronal activity and lead to epilepsy.''Research has shown that the cell membrane that surrounds each neuron plays an important role in epilepsy. Cell membranes are crucial for a neuron to generate electrical impulses. For this reason, researchers are studying details of the membrane structure, how molecules move in and out of membranes, and how the cell nourishes and repairs the membrane. A disruption in any of these processes may lead to epilepsy. Studies in animals have shown that, because the brain continually adapts to changes in stimuli, a small change in neuronal activity, if repeated, may eventually lead to full-blown epilepsy. Researchers are investigating whether this phenomenon, called kindling, may also occur in humans.''In some cases, epilepsy may result from changes in non-neuronal brain cells called glia. These cells regulate concentrations of chemicals in the brain that can affect neuronal signaling.''About half of all seizures have no known cause. However, in other cases, the seizures are clearly linked to infection, ''trauma'', or other identifiable problems.'""Research suggests that genetic abnormalities may be some of the most important factors contributing to epilepsy. Some types of epilepsy have been traced to an abnormality in a specific gene. Many other types of epilepsy tend to run in families, which suggests that genes influence epilepsy. Some researchers estimate that more than 500 genes could play a role in this disorder. However, it is increasingly clear that, for many forms of epilepsy, genetic abnormalities play only a partial role, perhaps by increasing a person's susceptibility to seizures that are triggered by an environmental factor.""'Several types of epilepsy have now been linked to defective genes for ion channels, the ""gates"" that control the flow of ions in and out of cells and regulate neuron signaling. Another gene, which is missing in people with progressive myoclonus epilepsy, codes for a protein called cystatin B. This protein regulates enzymes that break down other proteins. Another gene, which is altered in a severe form of epilepsy called LaFora\'s disease, has been linked to a gene that helps to break down carbohydrates.'""While abnormal genes sometimes cause epilepsy, they also may influence the disorder in subtler ways. For example, one study showed that many people with epilepsy have an abnormally active version of a gene that increases resistance to drugs. This may help explain why anticonvulsant drugs do not work for some people. Genes also may control other aspects of the body's response to medications and each person's susceptibility to seizures, or seizure threshold. Abnormalities in the genes that control neuronal migration, a critical step in brain development, can lead to areas of misplaced or abnormally formed neurons, or dysplasia, in the brain that can cause epilepsy. In some cases, genes may contribute to development of epilepsy even in people with no family history of the disorder. These people may have a newly developed abnormality, or mutation, in an epilepsy-related gene.""'In many cases, epilepsy develops as a result of brain damage from other disorders. For example, ''brain tumors'', alcoholism, and '""Alzheimer's""' disease frequently lead to epilepsy because they alter the normal workings of the brain. Strokes, ''heart attacks'', and other conditions that deprive the brain of oxygen also can cause epilepsy in some cases. About 32 percent of all cases of newly developed epilepsy in elderly people appears to be due to cerebrovascular disease, which reduces the supply of oxygen to brain cells. Meningitis, ''AIDS'', viral ''encephalitis'', and other infectious diseases can lead to epilepsy, as can ''hydrocephalus'' -- a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the brain. Epilepsy also can result from intolerance to wheat ''gluten'' (also known as ''celiac disease''), or from a parasitic infection of the brain called neurocysticercosis. Seizures may stop once these disorders are treated successfully. However, the odds of becoming seizure-free after the primary disorder is treated are uncertain and vary depending on the type of disorder, the brain region that is affected, and how much brain damage occurred prior to treatment.''Epilepsy is associated with a variety of developmental and metabolic disorders, including ''cerebral palsy'', ''neurofibromatosis'', pyruvate dependency, tuberous sclerosis, ''Landau-Kleffner syndrome'', and ''autism''. Epilepsy is just one of a set of symptoms commonly found in people with these disorders.''In some cases, head injury can lead to seizures or epilepsy. Safety measures such as wearing seat belts in cars and using helmets when riding a motorcycle or playing competitive sports can protect people from epilepsy and other problems that result from head injury.''Prenatal Injury and Developmental Problems''The developing brain is susceptible to many kinds of injury. Maternal infections, poor ''nutrition'', and oxygen deficiencies are just some of the conditions that may take a toll on the brain of a developing baby. These conditions may lead to ''cerebral palsy'', which often is associated with epilepsy, or they may cause epilepsy that is unrelated to any other disorders. About 20 percent of ''seizures in children'' are due to cerebral palsy or other neurological abnormalities. Abnormalities in genes that control development also may contribute to epilepsy. Advanced brain imaging has revealed that some cases of epilepsy that occur with no obvious cause may be associated with areas of dysplasia in the brain that probably develop before birth.''Seizures can result from exposure to lead, carbon monoxide, and many other poisons. They also can result from exposure to street drugs and from overdoses of ''antidepressants'' and other medications.''Seizures are often triggered by factors such as lack of ''sleep'', alcohol consumption, ''stress'', or hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle. These seizure triggers do not cause epilepsy but can provoke first seizures or cause breakthrough seizures in people who otherwise experience good seizure control with their medication. Sleep deprivation in particular is a universal and powerful trigger of seizures. For this reason, people with epilepsy should make sure to get enough sleep and should try to stay on a regular sleep schedule as much as possible. For some people, light flashing at a certain speed or the flicker of a computer monitor can trigger a seizure; this problem is called photosensitive epilepsy. ''Smoking'' cigarettes also can trigger seizures. The ''nicotine'' in cigarettes acts on receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain, which increases neuronal firing. Seizures are not triggered by sexual activity except in very rare instances.' "
What Are the Different Kinds of Seizures?,"'Doctors have described more than 30 different types of seizures. Seizures are divided into two major categories -- focal seizures and generalized seizures. However, there are many different types of seizures in each of these categories.' "
Focal Seizures,"'Focal seizures, also called partial seizures, occur in just one part of the brain. About 60 percent of people with epilepsy have focal seizures. These seizures are frequently described by the area of the brain in which they originate. For example, someone might be diagnosed with focal frontal lobe seizures.''In a simple focal seizure, the person will remain conscious but experience unusual feelings or sensations that can take many forms. The person may experience sudden and unexplainable feelings of joy, anger, sadness, or ''nausea''. He or she also may hear, smell, taste, see, or feel things that are not real. ''In a complex focal seizure, the person has a change in or loss of consciousness. His or her consciousness may be altered, producing a dreamlike experience. People having a complex focal seizure may display strange, repetitious behaviors such as blinks, twitches, mouth movements, or even ''walking'' in a circle. These repetitious movements are called automatisms. More complicated actions, which may seem purposeful, can also occur involuntarily. Patients may also continue activities they started before the seizure began, such as washing dishes in a repetitive, unproductive fashion. These seizures usually last just a few seconds. ''Some people with focal seizures, especially complex focal seizures, may experience auras -- unusual sensations that warn of an impending seizure. These auras are actually simple focal seizures in which the person maintains consciousness. The symptoms an individual person has, and the progression of those symptoms, tend to be stereotyped, or similar every time. ''The symptoms of focal seizures can easily be confused with other disorders. For instance, the dreamlike perceptions associated with a complex focal seizure may be misdiagnosed as ''migraine'' ''headaches'', which also may cause a dreamlike state. The strange behavior and sensations caused by focal seizures also can be mistaken for symptoms of ''narcolepsy'', ''fainting'', or even mental illness. It may take many tests and careful monitoring by an experienced physician to tell the difference between epilepsy and other disorders.' "
Generalized Seizures,"'Generalized seizures are a result of abnormal neuronal activity on both sides of the brain. These seizures may cause loss of consciousness, falls, or massive muscle spasms. ''There are many kinds of generalized seizures. In absence seizures, the person may appear to be staring into space and/or have jerking or twitching muscles. These seizures are sometimes referred to as petit mal seizures, which is an older term. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of muscles of the body, generally those in the back, legs, and arms. Clonic seizures cause repeated jerking movements of muscles on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures cause jerks or twitches of the upper body, arms, or legs. Atonic seizures cause a loss of normal muscle tone. The affected person will fall down or may drop his or her head involuntarily. Tonic-clonic seizures cause a mixture of symptoms, including stiffening of the body and repeated jerks of the arms and/or legs as well as loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures are sometimes referred to by an older term: ''grand mal'' seizures.''Not all seizures can be easily defined as either focal or generalized. Some people have seizures that begin as focal seizures but then spread to the entire brain. Other people may have both types of seizures but with no clear pattern. '""Society's lack of understanding about the many different types of seizures is one of the biggest problems for people with epilepsy. People who witness a non-convulsive seizure often find it difficult to understand that behavior which looks deliberate is not under the person's control. In some cases, this has led to the affected person being arrested or admitted to a psychiatric hospital. To combat these problems, people everywhere need to understand the many different types of seizures and how they may appear."" "
What Are the Different Kinds of Epilepsy?,"'Just as there are many different kinds of seizures, there are many different kinds of epilepsy. Doctors have identified hundreds of different epilepsy syndromes -- disorders characterized by a specific set of symptoms that include epilepsy. Some of these syndromes appear to be hereditary. For other syndromes, the cause is unknown. Epilepsy syndromes are frequently described by their symptoms or by where in the brain they originate. People should discuss the implications of their type of epilepsy with their doctors to understand the full range of symptoms, the possible treatments, and the prognosis. ''People with absence epilepsy have repeated absence seizures that cause momentary lapses of consciousness. These seizures almost always begin in childhood or adolescence, and they tend to run in families, suggesting that they may be at least partially due to a defective gene or genes. Some people with absence seizures have purposeless movements during their seizures, such as a jerking arm or rapidly blinking eyes. Others have no noticeable symptoms except for brief times when they are ""out of it."" Immediately after a seizure, the person can resume whatever he or she was doing. However, these seizures may occur so frequently that the person cannot concentrate in school or other situations. Childhood absence epilepsy usually stops when the child reaches ''puberty''. Absence seizures usually have no lasting effect on intelligence or other brain functions. ''Temporal lobe epilepsy, or TLE, is the most common epilepsy syndrome with focal seizures. These seizures are often associated with auras. TLE often begins in childhood. Research has shown that repeated temporal lobe seizures can cause a brain structure called the hippocampus to shrink over time. The hippocampus is important for memory and learning. While it may take years of temporal lobe seizures for measurable hippocampal damage to occur, this finding underlines the need to treat TLE early and as effectively as possible. '""Neocortical epilepsy is characterized by seizures that originate from the brain's cortex, or outer layer. The seizures can be either focal or generalized. They may include strange sensations, visual hallucinations, emotional changes, muscle spasms, convulsions, and a variety of other symptoms, depending on where in the brain the seizures originate. """"There are many other types of epilepsy, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms. Many of these, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Rasmussen's ""'encephalitis'"", begin in childhood. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have severe epilepsy with several different types of seizures, including atonic seizures, which cause sudden falls and are also called drop attacks. This severe form of epilepsy can be very difficult to treat effectively. Rasmussen's encephalitis is a progressive type of epilepsy in which half of the brain shows continual inflammation. It sometimes is treated with a radical surgical procedure called hemispherectomy. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as childhood absence epilepsy, tend to go into remission or stop entirely during adolescence, whereas other syndromes such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are usually present for life once they develop. Seizure syndromes do not always appear in childhood, however. ""'Epilepsy syndromes that are easily treated, do not seem to impair cognitive functions or development, and usually stop spontaneously are often described as benign. Benign epilepsy syndromes include benign infantile ''encephalopathy'' and benign ''neonatal'"" convulsions. Other syndromes, such as early myoclonic encephalopathy, include neurological and developmental problems. However, these problems may be caused by underlying neurodegenerative processes rather than by the seizures. Epilepsy syndromes in which the seizures and/or the person's cognitive abilities get worse over time are called progressive epilepsy. ""'Several types of epilepsy begin in infancy. The most common type of infantile epilepsy is infantile spasms, clusters of seizures that usually begin before the age of 6 months. During these seizures the infant may bend and cry out. Anticonvulsant drugs often do not work for infantile spasms, but the seizures can be treated with ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) or ''prednisone''.' "
When Are Seizures Not Epilepsy?,"'While any seizure is cause for concern, having a seizure does not by itself mean a person has epilepsy. First seizures, ''febrile seizures'', nonepileptic events, and ''eclampsia'' are examples of seizures that may not be associated with epilepsy.' "
First Seizures,"'Many people have a single seizure at some point in their lives. Often these seizures occur in reaction to anesthesia or a strong drug, but they also may be unprovoked, meaning that they occur without any obvious triggering factor. Unless the person has suffered brain damage or there is a family history of epilepsy or other neurological abnormalities, these single seizures usually are not followed by additional seizures. One recent study that followed patients for an average of 8 years found that only 33 percent of people have a second seizure within 4 years after an initial seizure. People who did not have a second seizure within that time remained seizure-free for the rest of the study. For people who did have a second seizure, the risk of a third seizure was about 73 percent on average by the end of 4 years. ''When someone has experienced a first seizure, the doctor will usually order an ''electroencephalogram'', or ''EEG'"", to determine what type of seizure the person may have had and if there are any detectable abnormalities in the person's brain waves. Thedoctor also may order brain scans to identify abnormalities that may be visible in the brain. These tests may help the doctor decide whether or not to treat the person with antiepileptic drugs. In some cases, drug treatment after the first seizure may help prevent future seizures and epilepsy. However, the drugs also can cause detrimental side effects, so doctors prescribe them only when they feel the benefits outweigh the risks. Evidence suggests that it may be beneficial to begin anticonvulsant medication once a person has had a second seizure, as the chance of future seizures increases significantly after this occurs."" "
Febrile Seizures,"'Sometimes a child will have a seizure during the course of an illness with a high ''fever''. These seizures are called febrile seizures (febrile is derived from the Latin word for ""''fever''"") and can be very alarming to the parents and other caregivers. In the past, doctors usually prescribed a course of anticonvulsant drugs following a febrile seizure in the hope of preventing epilepsy. However, most children who have a febrile seizure do not develop epilepsy, and long-term use of anticonvulsant drugs in children may damage the developing brain or cause other detrimental side effects. Experts at a 1980 consensus conference coordinated by the National Institutes of Health concluded that preventive treatment after a febrile seizure is generally not warranted unless certain other conditions are present: a family history of epilepsy, signs of nervous system impairment prior to the seizure, or a relatively prolonged or complicated seizure. The risk of subsequent non-febrile seizures is only 2 to 3 percent unless one of these factors is present. ''Researchers have now identified several different genes that influence the risk of febrile seizures in certain families. Studying these genes may lead to new understanding of how febrile seizures occur and perhaps point to ways of preventing them.' "
Nonepileptic Events,"""Sometimes people appear to have seizures, even though their brains show no seizure activity. This type of phenomenon has various names, including nonepileptic events and pseudoseizures. Both of these terms essentially mean something that looks like a seizure but isn't one. Nonepileptic events that are psychological in origin may be referred to as psychogenic seizures. Psychogenic seizures may indicate dependence, a need for attention, avoidance of stressful situations, or specific psychiatric conditions. Some people with epilepsy have psychogenic seizures in addition to their epileptic seizures. Other people who have psychogenic seizures do not have epilepsy at all. Psychogenic seizures cannot be treated in the same way as epileptic seizures. Instead, they are often treated by ""'mental health'' specialists. ''Other nonepileptic events may be caused by ''narcolepsy'', ''Tourette syndrome'', cardiac arrythmia, and other medical conditions with symptoms that resemble seizures. Because symptoms of these disorders can look very much like epileptic seizures, they are often mistaken for epilepsy. Distinguishing between true epileptic seizures and nonepileptic events can be very difficult and requires a thorough medical assessment, careful monitoring, and knowledgeable health professionals. Improvements in brain scanning and monitoring technology may improve diagnosis of nonepileptic events in the future.' "
Eclampsia,'Eclampsia'' is a life-threatening condition that can develop in ''pregnant'' women. Its symptoms include sudden elevations of ''blood pressure'' and seizures. Pregnant women who develop unexpected seizures should be rushed to a hospital immediately. Eclampsia can be treated in a hospital setting and usually does not result in additional seizures or epilepsy once the ''pregnancy'' is over.' 
How is Epilepsy Diagnosed?,"'Doctors have developed a number of different tests to determine whether a person has epilepsy and, if so, what kind of seizures the person has. In some cases, people may have symptoms that look very much like a seizure but in fact are nonepileptic events caused by other disorders. Even doctors may not be able to tell the difference between these disorders and epilepsy without close observation and intensive testing. ''An EEG records brain waves detected by electrodes placed on the ''scalp'"". This is the most common diagnostic test for epilepsy and can detect abnormalities in the brain's electrical activity. People with epilepsy frequently have changes in their normal pattern of brain waves, even when they are not experiencing a seizure. While this type of test can be very useful in diagnosing epilepsy, it is not foolproof. Some people continue to show normal brain wave patterns even after they have experienced a seizure. In other cases, the unusual brain waves are generated deep in the brain where the EEG is unable to detect them. Many people who do not have epilepsy also show some unusual brain activity on an EEG. Whenever possible, an EEG should be performed within 24 hours of a patient's first seizure. Ideally, EEGs should be performed while the patient is sleeping as well as when he or she is awake, because brain activity during sleep is often quite different than at other times. """"Video monitoring is often used in conjunction with EEG to determine the nature of a person's seizures. It also can be used in some cases to rule out other disorders such as cardiac arrythmia or narcolepsy that may look like epilepsy. ""'One of the most important ways of diagnosing epilepsy is through the use of brain scans. The most commonly used brain scans include CT (computed tomography), PET (positron emission tomography) and ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging''). CT and MRI scans reveal the structure of the brain, which can be useful for identifying brain tumors, ''cysts'"", and other structural abnormalities. PET and an adapted kind of MRI called functional MRI (fMRI) can be used to monitor the brain's activity and detect abnormalities in how it works. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) is a relatively new kind of brain scan that is sometimes used to locate seizure foci in the brain. """"In some cases, doctors may use an experimental type of brain scan called a magnetoencephalogram, or MEG. MEG detects the magnetic signals generated by neurons to allow doctors to monitor brain activity at different points in the brain over time, revealing different brain functions. While MEG is similar in concept to EEG, it does not require electrodes and it can detect signals from deeper in the brain than an EEG. Doctors also are experimenting with brain scans called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that can detect abnormalities in the brain's biochemical processes, and with near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that can detect oxygen levels in brain tissue. """"Taking a detailed medical history, including symptoms and duration of the seizures, is still one of the best methods available to determine if a person has epilepsy and what kind of seizures he or she has. The doctor will ask questions about the seizures and any past illnesses or other symptoms a person may have had. Since people who have suffered a seizure often do not remember what happened, caregivers' accounts of the seizure are vital to this evaluation. ""'Doctors often take blood samples for testing, particularly when they are examining a child. These blood samples are often screened for metabolic or genetic disorders that may be associated with the seizures. They also may be used to check for underlying problems such as infections, ''lead poisoning'', ''anemia'', and ''diabetes'' that may be causing or triggering the seizures. ''Doctors often use tests devised to measure motor abilities, behavior, and intellectual capacity as a way to determine how the epilepsy is affecting that person. These tests also can provide clues about what kind of epilepsy the person has.' "
Can Epilepsy Be Prevented?,"'Many cases of epilepsy can be prevented by wearing seatbelts and bicycle helmets, putting children in car seats, and other measures that prevent head injury and other trauma. Prescribing medication after first or second seizures or febrile seizures also may help prevent epilepsy in some cases. Good ''prenatal care'', including treatment of ''high blood pressure'' and infections during pregnancy, can prevent brain damage in the developing baby that may lead to epilepsy and other neurological problems later. Treating ''cardiovascular disease'', ''high blood pressure'', infections, and other disorders that can affect the brain during adulthood and ''aging'' also may prevent many cases of epilepsy. Finally, identifying the genes for many neurological disorders can provide opportunities for genetic screening and ''prenatal diagnosis'' that may ultimately prevent many cases of epilepsy.' "
How Can Epilepsy Be Treated?,"'Accurate diagnosis of the type of epilepsy a person has is crucial for finding an effective treatment. There are many different ways to treat epilepsy. Currently available treatments can control seizures at least some of the time in about 80 percent of people with epilepsy. However, another 20 percent, about 600,000 people with epilepsy in the United States, have intractable seizures, and another 400,000 feel they get inadequate relief from available treatments. These statistics make it clear that improved treatments are desperately needed. ''Doctors who treat epilepsy come from many different fields of medicine. They include neurologists, pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, internists, and family physicians, as well as neurosurgeons and doctors called epileptologists who specialize in treating epilepsy. People who need specialized or intensive care for epilepsy may be treated at large medical centers and neurology clinics at hospitals or by neurologists in private practice. Many ''epilepsy treatment'' centers are associated with university hospitals that perform research in addition to providing medical care. ''Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. Research suggests that medication and other treatments may be less successful in treating epilepsy once seizures and their consequences become established. '""By far the most common approach to treating epilepsy is to prescribe antiepileptic drugs.  The first effective antiepileptic drugs were bromides, introduced by an English physician named Sir Charles Locock in 1857.  He noticed that bromides had a sedative effect and seemed to reduce seizures in some patients.  More than 20 different antiepileptic drugs are now on the market, all with different benefits and side effects.  The choice of which drug to prescribe, and at what dosage, depends on many different factors, including the type of seizures a person has, the person's lifestyle and age, how frequently the seizures occur, and, for a woman, the likelihood that she will become pregnant.  People with epilepsy should follow their doctor's advice and share any concerns they may have regarding their medication. ""'Doctors seeing a patient with newly developed epilepsy often prescribe ''carbamazepine'', valproate, ''lamotrigine'', ''oxcarbazepine'', or ''phenytoin'' first, unless the epilepsy is a type that is known to require a different kind of treatment.  For absence seizures, ''ethosuximide'' is often the primary treatment.  Other commonly prescribed drugs include ''clonazepam'', phenobarbital, and ''primidone''.   Some relatively new epilepsy drugs include ''tiagabine'', ''gabapentin'', ''topiramate'', ''levetiracetam'', and ''felbamate'"".   Other drugs are used in combination with one of the standard drugs or for intractable seizures that do not respond to other medications.  A few drugs, such as fosphenytoin, are approved for use only in hospital settings to treat specific problems such as status epilepticus (see section, “Are There Special Risks Associated With Epilepsy?”).  For people with stereotyped recurrent severe seizures that can be easily recognized by the person's family, the drug ""'diazepam'' is now available as a gel that can be administered rectally by a family member.  This method of drug delivery may be able to stop prolonged or repeated seizures before they develop into status epilepticus.  ''For most people with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with just one drug at the optimal dosage.  Combining medications usually amplifies side effects such as ''fatigue'' and ''decreased appetite'"", so doctors usually prescribe monotherapy, or the use of just one drug, whenever possible.  Combinations of drugs are sometimes prescribed if monotherapy fails to effectively control a patient's seizures. """"The number of times a person needs to take medication each day is usually determined by the drug's half-life, or the time it takes for half the drug dose to be metabolized or broken down into other substances in the body.  Some drugs, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, only need to be taken once a day, while others such as valproate must be taken two or three times a day. ""'Most side effects of antiepileptic drugs are relatively minor, such as ''fatigue'', ''dizziness'', or ''weight gain''.  However, severe and life-threatening side effects such as ''allergic'' reactions can occur.  Epilepsy medication also may predispose people to developing ''depression'' or psychoses.  People with epilepsy should consult a doctor immediately if they develop any kind of ''rash'' while on medication, or if they find themselves ''depressed'' or otherwise unable to think in a rational manner.  Other danger signs that should be discussed with a doctor immediately are extreme ''fatigue'', staggering or other movement problems, and slurring of words.  People with epilepsy should be aware that their epilepsy medication can interact with many other drugs in potentially harmful ways.  For this reason, people with epilepsy should always tell doctors who treat them which medications they are taking.  Women also should know that some antiepileptic drugs can interfere with the effectiveness of ''oral contraceptives'', and they should discuss this possibility with their doctors. ''Since people can become more sensitive to medications as they age, they may need to have their blood levels of medication checked occasionally to see if the dose needs to be adjusted.  The effects of a particular medication also sometimes wear off over time, leading to an increase in seizures if the dose is not adjusted.  People should know that some citrus fruit, in particular grapefruit juice, may interfere with breakdown of many drugs.  This can cause too much of the drug to build up in their bodies, often worsening the side effects. ''People taking epilepsy medication should be sure to check with their doctor and/or seek a second medical opinion if their medication does not appear to be working or if it causes unexpected side effects. '""When a person starts a new epilepsy drug, it is important to tailor the dosage to achieve the best results. People's bodies react to medications in very different and sometimes unpredictable ways, so it may take some time to find the right drug at the right dose to provide optimal control of seizures while minimizing side effects. A drug that has no effect or very bad side effects at one dose may work very well at another dose. Doctors will usually prescribe a low dose of the new drug initially and monitor blood levels of the drug to determine when the best possible dose has been reached. ""'Generic versions are available for many antiepileptic drugs. The chemicals in generic drugs are exactly the same as in the brand-name drugs, but they may be absorbed or processed differently in the body because of the way they are prepared. Therefore, patients should always check with their doctors before switching to a generic version of their medication. '""Some doctors will advise people with epilepsy to discontinue their antiepileptic drugs after 2 years have passed without a seizure. Others feel it is better to wait for 4 to 5 years. Discontinuing medication should always be done with a doctor's advice and supervision. It is very important to continue taking epilepsy medication for as long as the doctor prescribes it. People also should ask the doctor or pharmacist ahead of time what they should do if they miss a dose. Discontinuing medication without a doctor's advice is one of the major reasons people who have been seizure-free begin having new seizures. Seizures that result from suddenly stopping medication can be very serious and can lead to status epilepticus. Furthermore, there is some evidence that uncontrolled seizures trigger changes in neurons that can make it more difficult to treat the seizures in the future. """"The chance that a person will eventually be able to discontinue medication varies depending on the person's age and his or her type of epilepsy. More than half of children who go into remission with medication can eventually stop their medication without having new seizures. One study showed that 68 percent of adults who had been seizure-free for 2 years before stopping medication were able to do so without having more seizures and 75 percent could successfully discontinue medication if they had been seizure-free for 3 years. However, the odds of successfully stopping medication are not as good for people with a family history of epilepsy, those who need multiple medications, those with focal seizures, and those who continue to have abnormal EEG results while on medication. ""'When seizures cannot be adequately controlled by medications, doctors may recommend that the person be evaluated for surgery. Surgery for epilepsy is performed by teams of doctors at medical centers. To decide if a person may benefit from surgery, doctors consider the type or types of seizures he or she has. They also take into account the brain region involved and how important that region is for everyday behavior. Surgeons usually avoid operating in areas of the brain that are necessary for speech, language, ''hearing'', or other important abilities. Doctors may perform tests such as a Wada test (administration of the drug amobarbitol into the carotid artery) to find areas of the brain that control speech and memory. They often monitor the patient intensively prior to surgery in order to pinpoint the exact location in the brain where seizures begin. They also may use implanted electrodes to record brain activity from the surface of the brain. This yields better information than an external EEG. '""A 1990 National Institutes of Health consensus conference on surgery for epilepsy concluded that there are three broad categories of epilepsy that can be treated successfully with surgery. These include focal seizures, seizures that begin as focal seizures before spreading to the rest of the brain, and unilateral multifocal epilepsy with infantile hemiplegia (such as Rasmussen's encephalitis). Doctors generally recommend surgery only after patients have tried two or three different medications without success, or if there is an identifiable brain lesion--a damaged or dysfunctional area--believed to cause the seizures. ""'A study published in 2000 compared surgery to an additional year of treatment with antiepileptic drugs in people with longstanding temporal lobe epilepsy. The results showed that 64 percent of patients receiving surgery became seizure-free, compared to 8 percent of those who continued with medication only. Because of this study and other evidence, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) now recommends surgery for TLE when antiepileptic drugs are not effective. However, the study and the AAN guidelines do not provide guidance on how long seizures should occur, how severe they should be, or how many drugs should be tried before surgery is considered. A nationwide study is now underway to determine how soon surgery for TLE should be performed. ''If a person is considered a good candidate for surgery and has seizures that cannot be controlled with available medication, experts generally agree that surgery should be performed as early as possible. It can be difficult for a person who has had years of seizures to fully re-adapt to a seizure-free life if the surgery is successful. The person may never have had an opportunity to develop independence, and he or she may have had difficulties with school and work that could have been avoided with earlier treatment. Surgery should always be performed with support from rehabilitation specialists and counselors who can help the person deal with the many psychological, social, and employment issues he or she may face. ''While surgery can significantly reduce or even halt seizures for some people, it is important to remember that any kind of surgery carries some amount of risk (usually small). Surgery for epilepsy does not always successfully reduce seizures and it can result in cognitive or personality changes, even in people who are excellent candidates for surgery. Patients should ask their surgeon about his or her experience, success rates, and complication rates with the procedure they are considering. '""Even when surgery completely ends a person's seizures, it is important to continue taking seizure medication for some time to give the brain time to re-adapt. Doctors generally recommend medication for 2 years after a successful operation to avoid new seizures. ""'In cases where seizures are caused by a ''brain tumor'', ''hydrocephalus'"", or other conditions that can be treated with surgery, doctors may operate to treat these underlying conditions. In many cases, once the underlying condition is successfully treated, a person's seizures will disappear as well. ""'The most common type of surgery for epilepsy is removal of a seizure focus, or small area of the brain where seizures originate. This type of surgery, which doctors may refer to as a lobectomy or ''lesionectomy'', is appropriate only for focal seizures that originate in just one area of the brain. In general, people have a better chance of becoming seizure-free after surgery if they have a small, well-defined seizure focus. Lobectomies have a 55-70 percent success rate when the type of epilepsy and the seizure focus is well-defined. The most common type of lobectomy is a ''temporal lobe resection'', which is performed for people with temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal ''lobe resection'' leads to a significant reduction or complete cessation of seizures about 70 - 90 percent of the time. ''When seizures originate in part of the brain that cannot be removed, surgeons may perform a procedure called a ''multiple subpial transection''. In this type of operation, which has been commonly performed since 1989, surgeons make a series of ''cuts'"" that are designed to prevent seizures from spreading into other parts of the brain while leaving the person's normal abilities intact. About 70 percent of patients who undergo a multiple subpial transection have satisfactory improvement in seizure control. ""'Corpus callosotomy, or severing the network of neural connections between the right and left halves, or hemispheres, of the brain, is done primarily in children with severe seizures that start in one half of the brain and spread to the other side. Corpus callosotomy can end drop attacks and other generalized seizures. However, the procedure does not stop seizures in the side of the brain where they originate, and these focal seizures may even increase after surgery. '""These procedures remove half of the brain's cortex, or outer layer. They are used predominantly in children who have seizures that do not respond to medication because of damage that involves only half the brain, as occurs with conditions such as Rasmussen's encephalitis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and hemimegencephaly. While this type of surgery is very radical and is performed only as a last resort, children often recover very well from the procedure, and their seizures usually cease altogether. With intense rehabilitation, they often recover nearly normal abilities. Since the chance of a full recovery is best in young children, hemispherectomy should be performed as early in a child's life as possible. It is rarely performed in children older than 13. ""'The vagus nerve stimulator was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 for use in people with seizures that are not well-controlled by medication. The vagus nerve stimulator is a battery-powered device that is surgically implanted under the skin of the chest, much like a ''pacemaker'', and is attached to the vagus nerve in the lower neck. This device delivers short bursts of electrical energy to the brain via the vagus nerve. On average, this stimulation reduces seizures by about 20 - 40 percent. Patients usually cannot stop taking epilepsy medication because of the stimulator, but they often experience fewer seizures and they may be able to reduce the dose of their medication. Side effects of the vagus nerve stimulator are generally mild but may include ''hoarseness'', ear ''pain'', a ''sore throat'', or nausea. Adjusting the amount of stimulation can usually eliminate most side effects, although the ''hoarseness'' typically persists. The batteries in the vagus nerve stimulator need to be replaced about once every 5 years; this requires a minor operation that can usually be performed as an outpatient procedure. ''Several new devices may become available for epilepsy in the future. Researchers are studying whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a procedure which uses a strong magnet held outside the head to influence brain activity, may reduce seizures. They also hope to develop implantable devices that can deliver drugs to specific parts of the brain. ''Studies have shown that, in some cases, children may experience fewer seizures if they maintain a strict ''diet'' rich in ''fats'' and low in carbohydrates. This unusual diet, called the ''ketogenic diet'', causes the body to break down fats instead of carbohydrates to survive. This condition is called ketosis. One study of 150 children whose seizures were poorly controlled by medication found that about one-fourth of the children had a 90 percent or better decrease in seizures with the ketogenic diet, and another half of the group had a 50 percent or better decrease in their seizures. Moreover, some children can discontinue the ketogenic diet after several years and remain seizure-free. The ketogenic diet is not easy to maintain, as it requires strict adherence to an unusual and limited range of foods. Possible side effects include retarded growth due to nutritional deficiency and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can lead to ''kidney stones''. People who try the ketogenic diet should seek the guidance of a dietician to ensure that it does not lead to serious nutritional deficiency. ''Researchers are not sure how ketosis inhibits seizures. One study showed that a byproduct of ketosis called beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) inhibits seizures in animals. If BHB also works in humans, researchers may eventually be able to develop drugs that mimic the seizure-inhibiting effects of the ketogenic diet. ''Researchers are studying whether biofeedback -- a strategy in which individuals learn to control their own brain waves -- may be useful in controlling seizures. However, this type of therapy is controversial and most studies have shown discouraging results. Taking large doses of ''vitamins'"" generally does not help a person's seizures and may even be harmful in some cases. But a good diet and some vitamin ""'supplements'', particularly ''folic acid'', may help reduce some ''birth defects'' and medication-related nutritional deficiencies. Use of non-vitamin ''supplements'' such as ''melatonin'' is controversial and can be risky. One study showed that melatonin may reduce seizures in some children, while another found that the risk of seizures increased measurably with melatonin. Most non-vitamin supplements such as those found in health food stores are not regulated by the FDA, so their true effects and their interactions with other drugs are largely unknown'  "
How Does Epilepsy Affect Daily Life?,"'Most people with epilepsy lead outwardly normal lives. Approximately 80 percent can be significantly helped by modern therapies, and some may go months or years between seizures. However, the condition can and does affect daily life for people with epilepsy, their family, and their friends. People with severe seizures that resist treatment have, on average, a shorter life expectancy and an increased risk of cognitive impairment, particularly if the seizures developed in early childhood. These impairments may be related to the underlying conditions tha cause epilepsy or to epilepsy treatment rather than the epilepsy itself. ''It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems. Sometimes these problems are caused by embarrassment or frustration associated with epilepsy. Other problems may result from ''bullying'"", teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. In children, these problems can be minimized if parents encourage a positive outlook and independence, do not reward negative behavior with unusual amounts of attention, and try to stay attuned to their child's needs and feelings. Families must learn to accept and live with the seizures without blaming or resenting the affected person. Counseling services can help families cope with epilepsy in a positive manner. Epilepsy support groups also can help by providing a way for people with epilepsy and their family members to share their experiences, frustrations, and tips for coping with the disorder. ""'People with epilepsy have an increased risk of poor self-esteem, ''depression'', and ''suicide''. These problems may be a reaction to a lack of understanding or discomfort about epilepsy that may result in cruelty or avoidance by other people. Many people with epilepsy also live with an ever-present fear that they will have another seizure. '""For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence, in particular the ability to drive. Most states and the District of Columbia will not issue a driver's license to someone with epilepsy unless the person can document that they have gone a specific amount of time without a seizure (the waiting period varies from a few months to several years). Some states make exceptions for this policy when seizures don't impair consciousness, occur only during sleep, or have long auras or other warning signs that allow the person to avoid driving when a seizure is likely to occur. Studies show that the risk of having a seizure-related accident decreases as the length of time since the last seizure increases. One study found that the risk of having a seizure-related motor vehicle accident is 93 percent less in people who wait at least 1 year after their last seizure before driving, compared to people who wait for shorter intervals. """"The risk of seizures also restricts people's recreational choices. For instance, people with epilepsy should not participate in sports such as skydiving or motor racing where a moment's ""'inattention'' could lead to injury. Other activities, such as ''swimming'' and sailing, should be done only with precautions and/or supervision. However, jogging, football, and many other sports are reasonably safe for a person with epilepsy. Studies to date have not shown any increase in seizures due to sports, although these studies have not focused on any activity in particular. There is some evidence that regular ''exercise'' may even improve seizure control in some people. Sports are often such a positive factor in life that it is best for the person to participate, although the person with epilepsy and the coach or other leader should take appropriate safety precautions. It is important to take steps to avoid potential sports-related problems such as ''dehydration'', overexertion, and ''hypoglycemia'', as these problems can increase the risk of seizures. ''By law, people with epilepsy or other handicaps in the United States cannot be denied employment or access to any educational, recreational, or other activity because of their seizures. However, one survey showed that only about 56 percent of people with epilepsy finish high school and about 15 percent finish college -- rates much lower than those for the general population. The same survey found that about 25 percent of working-age people with epilepsy are unemployed. These numbers indicate that significant barriers still exist for people with epilepsy in school and work. Restrictions on driving limit the employment opportunities for many people with epilepsy, and many find it difficult to face the misunderstandings and social pressures they encounter in public situations. Antiepileptic drugs also may cause side effects that interfere with concentration and memory. Children with epilepsy may need extra time to complete schoolwork, and they sometimes may need to have instructions or other information repeated for them. Teachers should be told what to do if a child in their classroom has a seizure, and parents should work with the school system to find reasonable ways to accommodate any special needs their child may have. '""Women with epilepsy are often concerned about whether they can become pregnant and have a healthy child. This is usually possible. While some seizure medications and some types of epilepsy may reduce a person's interest in sexual activity, most people with epilepsy can become pregnant. Moreover, women with epilepsy have a 90 percent or better chance of having a normal, healthy baby, and the risk of birth defects is only about 4 to 6 percent. The risk that children of parents with epilepsy will develop epilepsy themselves is only about 5 percent unless the parent has a clearly hereditary form of the disorder. Parents who are worried that their epilepsy may be hereditary may wish to consult a genetic counselor to determine what the risk might be. ""'Amniocentesis'' and high-level ''ultrasound'' can be performed during pregnancy to ensure that the baby is developing normally, and a procedure called a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein test can be used for prenatal diagnosis of many conditions if a problem is suspected. ''There are several precautions women can take before and during pregnancy to reduce the risks associated with pregnancy and delivery. Women who are thinking about ''becoming pregnant'' should talk with their doctors to learn any special risks associated with their epilepsy and the medications they may be taking. Some seizure medications, particularly valproate, trimethidone, and phenytoin, are known to increase the risk of having a child with birth defects such as ''cleft palate'', ''heart'"" problems, or finger and toe defects. For this reason, a woman's doctor may advise switching to other medications during pregnancy. Whenever possible, a woman should allow her doctor enough time to properly change medications, including phasing in the new medications and checking to determine when blood levels are stabilized, before she tries to become pregnant. Women should also begin prenatal vitamin supplements -- especially with folic acid, which may reduce the risk of some birth defects -- well before pregnancy. Women who discover that they are pregnant but have not already spoken with their doctor about ways to reduce the risks should do so as soon as possible. However, they should continue taking seizure medication as prescribed until that time to avoid preventable seizures. Seizures during pregnancy can harm the developing baby or lead to ""'miscarriage'', particularly if the seizures are severe. Nevertheless, many women who have seizures during pregnancy have normal, healthy ''babies''. '""Women with epilepsy sometimes experience a change in their seizure frequency during pregnancy, even if they do not change medications. About 25 to 40 percent of women have an increase in their seizure frequency while they are pregnant, while other women may have fewer seizures during pregnancy. The frequency of seizures during pregnancy may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the woman's increased blood volume during pregnancy, which can dilute the effect of medication. Women should have their blood levels of seizure medications monitored closely during and after pregnancy, and the medication dosage should be adjusted accordingly. ""'Pregnant women with epilepsy should take ''prenatal vitamins'' and get plenty of sleep to avoid seizures caused by sleep deprivation. They also should take ''vitamin K'' supplements after 34 weeks of pregnancy to reduce the risk of a blood-clotting disorder in infants called neonatal coagulopathy that can result from fetal exposure to epilepsy medications. Finally, they should get good prenatal care, avoid tobacco, ''caffeine'', alcohol, and illegal drugs, and try to avoid stress. ''Labor and delivery'' usually proceed normally for women with epilepsy, although there is a slightly increased risk of hemorrhage, eclampsia, premature ''labor'', and cesarean section. Doctors can administer antiepileptic drugs intravenously and monitor blood levels of anticonvulsant medication during ''labor'' to reduce the risk that the ''labor'"" will trigger a seizure. Babies sometimes have symptoms of withdrawal from the mother's seizure medication after they are born, but these problems wear off in a few weeks or months and usually do not cause serious or long-term effects. A mother's blood levels of anticonvulsant medication should be checked frequently after delivery as medication often needs to be decreased. """"Epilepsy medications need not influence a woman's decision about breast-feeding her baby. Only minor amounts of epilepsy medications are secreted in ""'breast milk'', usually not enough to harm the baby and much less than the baby was exposed to in the womb. On rare occasions, the baby may become excessively drowsy or feed poorly, and these problems should be closely monitored. However, experts believe the benefits of breast-feeding outweigh the risks except in rare circumstances. '""To increase doctors' understanding of how different epilepsy medications affect pregnancy and the chances of having a healthy baby, Massachusetts General Hospital has begun a nationwide registry for women who take antiepileptic drugs while pregnant. Women who enroll in this program are given educational materials on pre-""'conception'' planning and perinatal care and are asked to provide information about the health of their children (this information is kept confidential). Women and physicians can contact this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or 617-726-1742 (fax: 617-724-8307). ''Women with epilepsy should be aware that some epilepsy medications can interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Women who wish to use oral contraceptives to prevent pregnancy should discuss this with their doctors, who may be able to prescribe a different kind of antiepileptic medication or suggest other ways of avoiding an unplanned pregnancy.'  "
Are There Special Risks Associated With Epilepsy?,"'Although most people with epilepsy lead full, active lives, they are at special risk for two life-threatening conditions: status epilepticus and sudden unexplained death. ''Status epilepticus is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a person either has an abnormally prolonged seizure or does not fully regain consciousness between seizures. Although there is no strict definition for the time at which a seizure turns into status epilepticus, most people agree that any seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes should, for practical purposes, be treated as though it was status epilepticus. ''While people with epilepsy are at an increased risk for status epilepticus, about 60 percent of people who develop this condition have no previous seizure history. These cases often result from tumors, trauma, or other problems that affect the brain and may themselves be life-threatening. ''While most seizures do not require emergency medical treatment, someone with a prolonged seizure lasting more than 5 minutes may be in status epilepticus and should be taken to an emergency room immediately. It is important to treat a person with status epilepticus as soon as possible. One study showed that 80 percent of people in status epilepticus who received medication within 30 minutes of seizure onset eventually stopped having seizures, whereas only 40 percent recovered if 2 hours had passed before they received medication. Doctors in a hospital setting can treat status epilepticus with several different drugs and can undertake emergency life-saving measures, such as administering oxygen, if necessary. ''People in status epilepticus do not always have severe convulsive seizures. Instead, they may have repeated or prolonged nonconvulsive seizures. This type of status epilepticus may appear as a sustained episode of ''confusion'' or agitation in someone who does not ordinarily have that kind of mental impairment. While this type of episode may not seem as severe as convulsive status epilepticus, it should still be treated as an emergency. ''For reasons that are poorly understood, people with epilepsy have an increased risk of dying suddenly for no discernible reason. This condition, called sudden unexplained death, can occur in people without epilepsy, but epilepsy increases the risk about two-fold. Researchers are still unsure why sudden unexplained death occurs. One study suggested that use of more than two anticonvulsant drugs may be a risk factor. However, it is not clear whether the use of multiple drugs causes the sudden death, or whether people' "
What Research Is Being Done on Epilepsy?,"'While research has led to many advances in understanding and treating epilepsy, there are many unanswered questions about how and why seizures develop, how they can best be treated or prevented, and how they influence other brain activity and brain development. Researchers, many of whom are supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), are studying all of these questions. They also are working to identify and test new drugs and other treatments for epilepsy and to learn how those treatments affect brain activity and development. '""The NINDS's Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP) studies potential new therapies with the goal of enhancing treatment for patients with epilepsy. Since it began in 1975, more than 390 public-private partnerships have been created. These partnerships have resulted in state-of-the-art evaluations of more than 25,000 compounds for their potential as antiepileptic drugs. This government-sponsored effort has contributed to the development of five drugs that are now approved for use in the United States. It has also aided in the discovery and profiling of six new compounds currently in various stages of clinical development. Besides testing for safer, more efficacious therapies, the Program is developing and validating new models that may one day find therapies that intervene in the disease process itself as well as models of resistant or refractory epilepsy. ""'Scientists continue to study how excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters interact with brain cells to control nerve firing. They can apply different chemicals to cultures of neurons in laboratory dishes to study how those chemicals influence neuronal activity. They also are studying how glia and other non-neuronal cells in the brain contribute to seizures. This research may lead to new drugs and other new ways of treating seizures. ''Researchers also are working to identify genes that may influence epilepsy in some way. Identifying these genes can reveal the underlying chemical processes that influence epilepsy and point to new ways of preventing or treating this disorder. Researchers also can study rats and mice that have missing or abnormal copies of certain genes to determine how these genes affect normal brain development and resistance to damage from disease and other environmental factors. In the future, researchers may be able to use panels of gene fragments, called ""gene chips,"" to determine each person\'s genetic ''makeup''. This information may allow doctors to prevent epilepsy or to predict which treatments will be most beneficial. ''Doctors are now experimenting with several new types of therapies for epilepsy. In one preliminary clinical trial, doctors have begun transplanting fetal pig neurons that produce GABA into the brains of patients to learn whether the cell transplants can help control seizures. Preliminary research suggests that stem cell transplants also may prove beneficial for treating epilepsy. Research showing that the brain undergoes subtle changes prior to a seizure has led to a prototype device that may be able to predict seizures up to 3 minutes before they begin. If this device works, it could greatly reduce the risk of injury from seizures by allowing people to move to a safe area before their seizures start. This type of device also may be hooked up to a treatment pump or other device that will automatically deliver an antiepileptic drug or an electric impulse to forestall the seizures. ''Researchers are continually improving MRI and other brain scans. Pre-surgical brain imaging can guide doctors to abnormal brain tissue and away from essential parts of the brain. Researchers also are using brain scans such as magnetoencephalograms (MEG) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to identify and study subtle problems in the brain that cannot otherwise be detected. Their findings may lead to a better understanding of epilepsy and how it can be treated.' "
How Can I Help Research on Epilepsy?,"'There are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. Pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry, which is maintained by the Genetics and Teratology Unit of Massachusetts General Hospital (see section on Pregnancy and Motherhood). People with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the Epilepsy Gene Discovery Project, which is supported by the Epilepsy Foundation. This project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. People who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. Researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary, and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. In many cases, identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. It also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. ''People with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications, surgical techniques, and other treatments by enrolling in ''clinical trials''. Information on clinical trials can be obtained from the NINDS as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies, universities, and other organizations. A person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. While experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials, patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. Therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work, and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. Patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. ''Patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. Brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders. Below are some brain banks that accept tissue from patients with epilepsy: ''Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders''University of Maryland''655 West Baltimore Street, Room 10-035 BRB''Baltimore, MD 21201-1559''800-847-1539''E-mail: ''[email\xa0protected]''http://medschool.umaryland.edu/BTBank/''(tissue from children only)''Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders''University of Miami''Department of Pathology, R-5''Papanicolaou Building, Room 410''Miami, FL 33136''800-59BRAIN (592-7246)''E-mail: ''[email\xa0protected]''(tissue from adults only)''Brain Endowment Bank''University of Miami''1501 NW Ninth Avenue, Suite #4013''Miami, FL 33136''305-243-6219''800-UM-BRAIN (862-7246) ''National Disease Research Interchange''8 Penn Center, 8th Floor''Philadelphia, PA 19103''215-557-7361''800-222-NDRI (6374)''E-mail: ''[email\xa0protected]''www.ndri.com''Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center''Neurology Research (127A)''W.

What to Do if You See Someone Having a Seizure,"""If you see someone having a seizure with convulsions and/or loss of consciousness, here's how you can help:"" Roll the person on his or her side to prevent choking on any fluids or vomit. Cushion the person's head.  Loosen any tight clothing around the neck.  Keep the person's airway open. If necessary, grip the person's jaw gently and tilt his or her head back.  Do NOT restrict the person from moving unless he or she is in danger.  Do NOT put anything into the person's mouth, not even medicine or liquid. These can cause choking or damage to the person's jaw, tongue, or teeth. Contrary to widespread belief, people cannot swallow their tongues during a seizure or any other time.  Remove any sharp or solid objects that the person might hit during the seizure.  Note how long the seizure lasts and what symptoms occurred so you can tell a doctor or emergency personnel if necessary.  Stay with the person until the seizure ends.  The person is pregnant or has diabetes. The seizure happened in water. The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes. The person does not begin breathing again or does not return to consciousness after the seizure stops. Another seizure starts before the person regains consciousness. The person injures himself or herself during the seizure. This is a first seizure or you think it might be. If in doubt, check to see if the person has a medical identification card or jewelry stating that they have epilepsy or a seizure disorder.  After the seizure ends, the person will probably be groggy and tired. He or she also may have a headache and be confused or embarrassed. Be patient with the person and try to help him or her find a place to rest if he or she is tired or doesn't feel well. If necessary, offer to call a taxi, a friend, or a relative to help the person get home safely.  If you see someone having a non-convulsive seizure, remember that the person's behavior is not intentional. The person may wander aimlessly or make alarming or unusual gestures. You can help by following these guidelines:  Remove any dangerous objects from the area around the person or in his or her path. Don't try to stop the person from wandering unless he or she is in danger. Don't shake the person or shout. Stay with the person until he or she is completely alert."
Conclusion,"'Many people with epilepsy lead productive and outwardly normal lives. Medical and research advances in the past two decades have led to a better understanding of epilepsy and seizures than ever before. Advanced brain scans and other techniques allow greater accuracy in diagnosing epilepsy and determining when a patient may be helped by surgery. More than 20 different medications and a variety of surgical techniques are now available and provide good control of seizures for most people with epilepsy. Other treatment options include the ketogenic diet and the first implantable device, the vagus nerve stimulator. Research on the underlying causes of epilepsy, including identification of genes for some forms of epilepsy and febrile seizures, has led to a greatly improved understanding of epilepsy that may lead to more effective treatments or even new ways of preventing epilepsy in the future.'

What is a seizure (definition)?,"'A ''seizure'' and a ''seizure'' disorder are not the same. A seizure is single occurrence of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain, usually for short time span. It can cause numerous signs and symptoms like convulsions, thought disturbances, ''loss of consciousness'', and/or other symptoms. Usually, doctors consider seizures a ''symptom of a disease''.\xa0''Epilepsy''\xa0is a ''chronic disorder of recurrent unprovoked ''seizures'', ''and is one type of seizure disorder. In epilepsy, the ''convulsion'' is a sudden, violent irregular movement of a limb of the body caused by involuntary contraction of muscles usually associated with ''epilepsy'' and/or toxic agents.\xa0' "
What is a seizure disorder (definition)?,"'A seizure disorder is a medical condition (one of about 40) characterized by episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain, thus producing symptoms that include two or more seizures. Doctors separate the disorders from each other by their potential causes and their own set of symptoms due to the affected area in the brain.' "
What are the types and symptoms of seizures?,"'1. Generalized seizures result in loss of consciousness.''2. Partial or focal seizures'' result in either no loss of consciousness or ''confusion'' for a few minutes.''3. Unknown onset seizure' Motor: Grand mal seizures (also called tonic-clonic with muscle jerks or spasms) and have signs and symptoms of stiffness of muscles (tonic), relaxed muscles (atonic), muscles that cause sporadic short jerking of body or limbs (myoclonic), and repetitive shaking or jerking of the body (clonic). Non-motor (absence): Symptoms include staring into space, sometimes with eye blinking. Aware: Twitching and/or sensation change Impaired awareness: No loss of consciousness, but you become confused for a few minutes Unclassified: It may share questionable features of generalized and/or focal seizures. Motor: Involving musculature Non-motor: Involving awareness"
What are the types of seizure disorders? Are the signs and symptoms the same?,"'There are about 40 different types of named ''seizure disorders''. However, all of the seizure disorders fit into one of the three seizure types listed previously. They differ from each other by some changes in the symptoms they produce. Although it is beyond the scope of this article to describe all types of seizure disorders, an example of how they are given names may give insight as to how their symptoms differ. For example:''Other symptoms of seizure disorders may include:''With these few examples, you can understand the complexity of seizure disorders and their symptoms.'   Simple partial seizure disorders differ from person to person depending upon the part of the brain affected. Benign Rolandic epilepsy in children causes tongue twitching, and may interfere with speech and cause drooling. Catamenial epilepsy refers to seizures that occur in relation to the menstrual cycle. Atonic seizures cause symptoms like falling usually not associated with loss of consciousness. Absence seizures cause a short loss of consciousness with little or no symptoms. Clonic seizures cause rhythmic jerks that involve both sides of the body simultaneously. Tonic seizures cause a stiffening of the muscles Febrile seizures usually occur in children between 6 months and 5 years of age. They are common in toddlers.  Convulsions Eye blinking The lips may slightly jerk and move. Sudden loss of muscle tone The head drops suddenly The person cries out The person falls to the ground Changes in tastes or smells Biting the tongue The person cannot answer questions. Thought disturbances Eye rolling The person involuntarily urinates or has a bowel movement."
Will I have to limit my activities after having a seizure? Can I drive?,"'Until your seizures are controlled, you should not do activities where loss of consciousness could be life threatening. For example, avoid driving, ''swimming'', climbing, operating power tools, or taking a bath in a bathtub until about six months after becoming seizure free. Some states require you to be free of seizures up to one year before you can drive.' "
How long do seizures last?,"'Although most seizures stop spontaneously after several minutes (average is about 1- 2 minutes), there are conditions that may cause ''brain damage'' and/or life-threatening situations due to seizures. Status epilepticus (seizures lasting 5 or more minutes or if there is more than one seizure within five minutes) is a medical emergency; call 911 as the patient needs emergency treatment, usually with an anticonvulsant such as ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan''), given intravenously.' "
How are seizures and seizure disorders treated and managed?,"'If you know the cause of your seizures or seizure disorder (such as alcohol intake or ''cocaine'' use, ''low blood sugar'', and ''encephalitis'""), you should stop what's triggering them and/or treat any underlying medical conditions. For example, stop drinking alcohol and/or abusing legal or illegal ""'drugs''; and manage your blood sugar if you have diabetes. Take your medication as your doctor or other health care professional has prescribed. Seizures that do not respond to treatment may cause you and your medical team (primary care doctor, neurologist, and neurosurgeon) to consider surgery or nerve stimulation treatment.'  "
Can seizures or seizures disorders be prevented?,"'Depending upon the cause of the seizure and/or seizure disorder, the chances of reducing or preventing some of them is possible. You can do this by avoiding any known potential causes or triggers of your seizures, like drinking excessive alcohol or using cocaine and other illegal drugs. You should take your medicine as your doctor has prescribed to reduce the chance of developing another seizure. For some patients, brain surgery may eliminate seizures by removing the epileptic focus the brain tissue. ''Vagus nerve stimulation'' is another potential way to prevent some seizures. However, none of these treatments provides 100% ''prevention''. In addition, it is difficult to prevent seizures caused by ''birth defects'', injuries, ''strokes'', or tumors.'  "
Seizure symptoms: how to assist the victim,"'Seizures'' occur because the brain becomes irritated and an ""electrical storm"" occurs. This ""electrical storm"" occurs because the normal connections between the cells in the brain do not function properly. This causes the brain to try to shut down because of the electrical surge. The muscle shaking occurs because the brain is ending out signals to every muscle group, asking them to contract. Most ''seizures'' are self-limiting and are followed by a so-called postictal period, in which the brain can be considered to ""reboot and restart"" all its programs, similar to a computer when it is rebooted.''Seizures are a common event, and 4% of people will experience one in their lifetime. The potential to have a ''seizure'' depends upon the threshold of the brain to withstand excess electrical activity. In infants and children, high ''fevers'' can cause this threshold to lower, resulting in febrile seizures. A blow to the head can cause an electrical spike causing a ''seizure'', and sometimes seizures just happen. ''The patient needs evaluation to look for the reason for the seizure. Is there an infection? Are there ''electrolyte'' abnormalities in the blood? Is there a structural problem in the brain? Often there is no obvious reason why the first seizure occurred, and CT or ''MRI'' scans of the brain as well as an ''EEG'' (''electroencephalogram'') may be ordered to look for a cause. ''Most people get a ""freebie"" seizure before requiring medication (medication should not necessarily be prescribed for every person who has had one seizure), but that doesn\'t mean that the event should be ignored. The chance of having another seizure sometime in the future is approximately 20%, and that is the reason why it is required that people need to be seizure free for 3-6 months before being allowed to drive a vehicle (the required time varies between states), scuba dive, sky dive, or participate in other potentially risky situations in which a seizure could put the individual or others in danger.''Generalized seizures are frightening to witness. There is ''loss of consciousness''; the body stiffens, arches, and may shake; and grunting sounds may be heard. But most seizures stop themselves and the role of the Good Samaritan, bystander, friend, or family is to protect the individual from themselves. ''Steps to take if you witness an individual having a seizure include:' The first step is to take a deep breath and try to stay calm. Make certain that there is nothing nearby that can be struck by the person having the seizure. Don't hold the person down. A seizure is a violent and forceful event, and bystander injury is a possibility. Do not put anything in the victim's mouth. A person who is seizing can't swallow their tongue and usually are breathing adequately. Forcing open the jaw can break teeth or get fingers bitten. If the individual's seizure lasts more than 3-5 minutes, call 911 immediately. After the seizure stops, lay the person on their side and stay with them until they are awake or until medical assistance arrives."
NIH on what are febrile seizures?,'Febrile seizures are convulsions brought on by a ''fever'' in infants or small children.' 
How common are febrile seizures?,"'Approximately one in every 25 children will have at least one febrile seizure, and more than one-third of these children will have additional febrile seizures before they outgrow the tendency to have them. Febrile seizures usually occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years and are particularly common in toddlers. Children rarely develop their first febrile seizure before the age of 6 months or after 3 years of age. The older a child is when the first febrile seizure occurs, the less likely that child is to have more. '  "
What are the symptoms of a febrile seizure?,"'During a febrile seizure, a child often loses consciousness and shakes, moving limbs on both sides of the body. Less commonly, the child becomes rigid or has twitches in only a portion of the body, such as an arm or a leg, or on the right or the left side only. Most febrile seizures last a minute or two, although some can be as brief as a few seconds while others last for more than 15 minutes.''The majority of children with febrile seizures have rectal temperatures greater than 102 degrees F. Most febrile seizures occur during the first day of a '""child's fever""'. Children prone to febrile seizures are not considered to have ''epilepsy'', since ''epilepsy'' is characterized by recurrent seizures that are not triggered by ''fever''.'  "
What makes a child prone to recurrent febrile seizures?,"""A few factors appear to boost a child's risk of having recurrent febrile seizures, including young age (less than 15 months) during the first seizure, frequent ""'fevers'', and having immediate family members with a history of febrile seizures. If the seizure occurs soon after a fever has begun or when the temperature is relatively low, the risk of recurrence is higher. A long initial febrile seizure does not substantially boost the risk of recurrent febrile seizures, either brief or long. ' "
Are febrile seizures harmful?,"'Although they can be frightening to parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures are harmless. During a seizure, there is a small chance that the child may be injured by falling or may choke from food or saliva in the mouth. Using proper ''first aid for seizures'' can help avoid these hazards (see section entitled ""What should be done for a child having a febrile seizure?"").''There is no evidence that febrile seizures cause ''brain damage'"". Large studies have found that children with febrile seizures have normal school achievement and perform as well on intellectual tests as their siblings who don't have seizures. Even in the rare instances of very prolonged seizures (more than 1 hour), most children recover completely.""'Between 95 and 98 percent of children who have experienced febrile seizures do not go on to develop ''epilepsy''. However, although the absolute risk remains very small, certain children who have febrile seizures face an increased risk of developing epilepsy. These children include those who have febrile seizures that are lengthy, that affect only part of the body, or that recur within 24 hours, and children with ''cerebral palsy'"", delayed development, or other neurological abnormalities. Among children who don't have any of these risk factors, only one in 100 develops epilepsy after a febrile seizure."" "
What should be done for a child having a febrile seizure?,"'Parents and caregivers should stay calm and carefully observe the child. To prevent accidental injury, the child should be placed on a protected surface such as the floor or ground. The child should not be held or restrained during a ''convulsion'"". To prevent choking, the child should be placed on his or her side or stomach. When possible, the parent should gently remove all objects in the child's mouth. The parent should never place anything in the child's mouth during a convulsion. Objects placed in the mouth can be broken and obstruct the child's ""'airway''. If the seizure lasts longer than 10 minutes, the child should be taken immediately to the nearest medical facility. Once the seizure has ended, the child should be taken to his or her doctor to check for the source of the fever. This is especially urgent if the child shows symptoms of ''stiff neck'', extreme lethargy, or abundant ''vomiting''. ' "
How are febrile seizures diagnosed and treated?,"'Before diagnosing febrile seizures in infants and children, doctors sometimes perform tests to be sure that seizures are not caused by something other than simply the fever itself. For example, if a doctor suspects the child has ''meningitis'' (an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain), a ''spinal tap'' may be needed to check for signs of the infection in the cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord). If there has been severe ''diarrhea'' or ''vomiting'', ''dehydration'"" could be responsible for seizures. Also, doctors often perform other tests such as examining the blood and urine to pinpoint the cause of the child's fever.""""A child who has a febrile seizure usually doesn't need to be hospitalized. If the seizure is prolonged or is accompanied by a serious infection, or if the source of the infection cannot be determined, a doctor may recommend that the child be hospitalized for observation."" "
How are febrile seizures prevented?,"'If a child has a fever most parents will use fever-lowering ''drugs'' such as ''acetaminophen'' or ''ibuprofen'' to make the child more comfortable, although there are no studies that prove that this will reduce the risk of a seizure. One preventive measure would be to try to reduce the number of febrile illnesses, although this is often not a practical possibility.''Prolonged daily use of oral anticonvulsants, such as phenobarbital or valproate, to prevent febrile seizures is usually not recommended because of their potential for side effects and questionable effectiveness for preventing such seizures.''Children especially prone to febrile seizures may be treated with the drug ''diazepam'' orally or rectally, whenever they have a fever. The majority of children with febrile seizures do not need to be treated with medication, but in some cases a doctor may decide that medicine given only while the child has a fever may be the best alternative. This medication may lower the risk of having another febrile seizure. It is usually well tolerated, although it occasionally can cause drowsiness, a lack of coordination, or ''hyperactivity''. Children vary widely in their susceptibility to such side effects.' "
What research is being done on febrile seizures?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sponsors research on all forms of febrile seizures in medical centers throughout the country. NINDS-supported scientists are exploring what environmental and genetic risk factors make children susceptible to febrile seizures. Some studies suggest that women who smoke or drink ''alcohol'' during their ''pregnancies'' are more likely to have children with febrile seizures, but more research needs to be done before this link can be clearly established. Scientists are also working to pinpoint factors that can help predict which children are likely to have recurrent or long-lasting febrile seizures.''Investigators continue to monitor the long-term impact that febrile seizures might have on intelligence, behavior, school achievement, and the development of epilepsy. For example, scientists conducting studies in animals are assessing the effects of seizures and anticonvulsant drugs on brain development.''Investigators also continue to explore which drugs can effectively treat or prevent febrile seizures and to check for side effects of these medicines.'

What is the definition of an epileptic seizure?,"'Epilepsy'', or seizure disorder, is a medical condition that produces seizures. A seizure usually involves convulsions and sometimes leads to loss of consciousness. ' "
What causes an epileptic seizure?,"""Seizures occur due to a malfunction of the brain's electrical system. Some seizures are caused by brain diseases, tumors, genetic conditions, or other illnesses or disorders that can be diagnosed (symptomatic seizures). When the cause for the seizures is unknown, they are referred to as idiopathic or cryptogenic seizures. ""'Seizure causes are also sub-classified into acute (an active cause, such as an active brain disease) or remote (caused by a previous event, such as injury).''Some people with seizure disorders have triggers that cause their seizures. Common seizure triggers include foods or medications, hormones, ''stress'', lack of ''sleep'', or ''sensitivity to light''. '  "
What are the symptoms of an epileptic seizure?,"'Generalized seizure symptoms include unconsciousness, muscle contractions and convulsions (which may appear as very dramatic jerking movements), tongue or lip biting, ''incontinence'', and clouded awareness. There may be weakness or loss of sensation. These symptoms may be brief or last a longer period of time. ''Some seizures only cause minor or mild symptoms and can be localized to a specific area of the body. These are called partial seizures. Symptoms of a ''partial seizure'' may include an aura (a warning symptom, often a strange sensation in the stomach), lip smacking, fidgeting, lack of awareness of surroundings, confusion, and sleepiness after the seizure. These symptoms typically last 30 seconds to 2 minutes. ' "
What first aid should be done for an epileptic seizure?,"'First aid for a seizure is aimed at keeping the person safe until the seizure stops on its own. Most seizures last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.'   Stay calm and reassure bystanders. Loosen anything around the person's neck (clothing, ties, jewelry, etc.) that may impede breathing. Do not restrain the person – this may result in injury. Do not put anything into the person's mouth, and do not try to hold the tongue or force the mouth open. This may also cause injury. Clear the area around the person and remove any objects that could injure them (glasses, furniture, etc.). Put something flat and soft under their head. After the seizure, lay the person on their side to facilitate breathing and keep the airway open. Do not leave a person alone after a seizure – they may be disoriented or confused. If the person is known to have epilepsy it may not be necessary to call 911. However, call 911 if:the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes,another seizure begins soon after the first one ends,the person does not awaken after movements have stopped,the person has another medical condition (such as heart disease),or you think anything else might be wrong. the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, another seizure begins soon after the first one ends, the person does not awaken after movements have stopped, the person has another medical condition (such as heart disease), or you think anything else might be wrong."
What can be done to prevent an epileptic seizure?,"""There may be some ways to prevent seizures in some people. Sometimes, there is no way to prevent seizures and a person may have a seizure even if they follow all of the doctor's recommendations.""'Avoid any known seizure triggers such as foods or medications, hormones, ''stress'', lack of ''sleep'', ''dehydration'', or sensitivity to light.' Anticonvulsant medication helps manage seizures in many patients. Take all prescribed medication regularly. Do not stop taking medications or change the dose without consulting a doctor. Avoid alcohol as it may interact with anticonvulsant medication, making it less effective. Consult a doctor before taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, or supplements as there may be drug interactions."
What is epilepsy?,"'An epileptic ''seizure'' is a sudden and transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms that are the result of an abnormal activity of the brain. Epileptic ''seizures'' are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. The diagnosis of epilepsy implies that there is an abnormality in the brain and that this abnormality will result in more epileptic seizures. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute ''trauma'' to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. In other words, epilepsy is the tendency to have repeated spontaneous seizures. '  "
What are the different types of clinical seizures?,"'There are different ''types of seizures'', which traditionally have been categorized as either generalized seizures or partial seizures. Generalized seizures are those in which the clinical manifestations indicate that the whole brain is involved from the beginning of the seizure. Partial seizures (local, focal) are those in which the epileptic event is limited to one part of the body or to a particular function of the brain, indicating that the epileptic seizure started in one limited area of the brain. Partial seizures may remain focal or may expand to the rest of the brain. When seizures expand to the rest of the brain these are referred to as secondary generalized seizures. Consciousness is always impaired in generalized seizures; however, in the case of partial seizures consciousness may be preserved , as in the so-called simple partial seizures, or it may be impaired, as is the case with the complex partial seizures.''Among the generalized seizures, the ''generalized tonic clonic seizure'' (traditionally recognized as a ''grand mal'' seizure) is the most common type. In this seizure there is a succession of muscle contractions (tonic component), more obvious in the extremities but affecting almost every muscle of the body, followed by sudden relaxation (clonic component) and further followed by another tonic component. This succession of events is repeated several times.''Simultaneously, there are other signs and symptoms including dilatation of the pupils, increased ''heart'' rate, and increased ''blood pressure''. ''Cyanosis'' (skin and lips ''turning blue''-purple) is also seen due to persistent contraction of the ''diaphragm'' muscle and holding of the breath. These convulsions are usually followed by a period of ''confusion''. In most instances these seizures, as well as most of the epileptic seizures, last for a few seconds or at the most for 2-3 minutes. Occasionally the seizure event may be prolonged, lasting several minutes. By definition, when the event lasts more than 30 minutes, it is described as status epilepticus.''Another type of generalized seizure is the '' ''absence seizure'', also called petit mal seizure, because the clinical symptoms are not as dramatic as with the generalized tonic clonic seizures. In the absence seizures, as the name implies, the patient looks absent, like ""not being here."" With this type of seizure there is a sudden interruption of activities, and the patient becomes unresponsive. Usually these seizures, particularly when they last longer than a few seconds, are associated with other subtle clinical signs such as eye blinking or twitching in the face or upper body. There is almost no confusion after these seizures, and the patient returns to his/her activities without even acknowledging that a seizure has occurred.''In the ''atonic seizures'' (drop attacks) there is a sudden loss of muscle activity, like a sudden ''paralysis''. The patient will collapse like a marionette when all its strings are cut at once. If these seizures happen when the individual is ''walking'', a fall will result, or if the patient is seated, he/she will experience a sudden drop of the head, usually without the motor reflexes that help people to prevent injuries. These seizures are very brief and might result in serious injuries, most often to the forehead, mouth, and/or face.''The ''myoclonic seizures'' consist of rapid, jerky contractions of isolated muscles or group of muscles which may or may not result in body movements.''The ''tonic seizures'' consist of a brief stiffening of the muscle groups, resulting most often in extension of the arms or legs or arching of the trunk. Some of these seizures might be associated with a forced ''exhalation'' of air, due to a sudden contraction of the expiratory muscle through partially contracted vocal cords, resulting in a loud sound.''With partial (focal, local) seizures, the clinical events originate in a limited area of the brain. The clinical manifestations depend upon the area of the brain that is abnormal. Many different clinical events can be seen with this type of seizure.''For example, with simple partial seizures (consciousness is not impaired) if the focal area of the brain involved is the motor area, the patient might have rhythmic contractions in one arm or leg. If the areas compromised are more involved with the visual system then the patient might complain of visual illusions.''Other abnormal sensations might be the result of lesions in the auditory, olfactory, or gustatory areas. Some other symptoms might include:''These patients are conscious when the symptoms occur, and their description of the symptoms can be very useful in determining which area of the brain is involved in the seizure. This has important implications for the selection of the appropriate treatment, especially for the decision about the need for surgery.''The complex partial seizures (sometimes called ""temporal lobe seizures"" or ""psychomotor seizures""), in which consciousness is impaired, have a greater range of symptoms. The symptoms already described in the simple partial seizures might be present and might be followed by complex automatic behaviors such as manipulating objects, walking around the room, or answering questions, usually done in a rumbling, difficult-to-understand language.' epigastric pain, sweating, pallor (paleness), flushing, pupillary dilatation, a sense of ""déjá vu,"" fear or anger."
What causes epilepsy in children?,"'Many different disorders of the brain may be associated with epilepsy.''For some patients the epileptic disorder is congenital, that is, the child is born with the predisposition to have epilepsy. In other patients, the epileptic disorder is acquired because of ''brain damage'' that occurred after birth.''The congenital epilepsies could be the result of the child having a gene that is responsible for the epileptic disorder; these are the genetic types of epilepsy. Alternatively, congenital epilepsy may be the result of factors that interfere with the development of the brain during gestation, resulting in brain malformations.''In acquired epileptic disorders, the damage might occur at the time of birth, for example the case of newborns that have oxygen deprivation during ''labor and delivery''; or intracranial bleeding, as seen in some children born prematurely. Also, the brain damage may occur any time after birth. For example, epilepsy could be a complication of infections in the brain (meningitis, ''encephalitis''), head injuries with brain damage, ''brain tumors'', or intracranial bleeding.' "
Are seizures bad for children?,"'Presently there is no indication that short-lasting seizures will result in any brain damage. However, prolonged seizures, especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in some cases could result in brain damage, but this is very unusual. ''Although brain damage is not likely, children can be injured at the time of the seizures. For example, in the atonic seizures there is a sudden loss of muscle power and, if this happens when the patient is standing, it is followed by a fall that might result in injuries to the face and/or mouth. Similar types of physical injuries can happen with other seizures.' "
How is epilepsy treated?,"'The main line of treatment is with antiepileptic ''drugs'', which are effective in controlling seizures in 70%-80% of patients with epilepsy. There are several antiepileptic medications. Since certain medications are much better for some seizures, the choice of the medication should be made by a physician who is familiar with these medications. If possible, the child should be evaluated in a center specializing in epilepsy. If this is not feasible, usually pediatric neurologists have training in epileptic disorders and are a good source for a referral.''When antiepileptic drugs fail to control the seizures, the patients may improve with surgical procedures.' "
Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?,"'Surgery is indicated in a small group of children.''It usually takes the failure of two or three antiepileptic medications before a child would be considered as a potential candidate for surgery. In general, this happens at least after two or three years of continuous treatment with medications. The failure might be due:'""Since surgical procedures might be very effective in some children, once it is clear that the child's epileptic disorder is not responding to treatment with antiepileptic medications, surgery should be considered. Young age is not a contraindication for surgery, and there is no benefit in waiting for the child to be older. In fact, there is considerable evidence that the younger a child is at the time of surgery, the better his/her potential will be for good function after the surgery. There is a certain degree of plasticity in the brain that helps with the recovery of functions that can be damaged at the time of surgery. This plasticity is higher in younger than in older children."" to a resistance to the antiepileptic medications that are available, to the presence of intolerable side effects to the antiepileptic medication, or a combination of both."
What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?,"'As previously mentioned, surgery is only preferred once it is clear that the child is resistant to or does not respond well to antiepileptic medications. Many tests are used to make this determination.''Electroencephalograms (''EEG'') are very important in determining the type of epileptic seizures as well as the area of the brain that is responsible for the seizure disorder. When the routine EEG (usually one hour long) does not give enough information, the child might need to be hospitalized (usually in special EEG wards) for a prolonged EEG with video monitoring. During the hospital admission (which may last several days) the EEG is recorded continuously throughout the entire day. The goal is to record epileptic events for further analysis. In some children it is necessary to stop the antiepileptic medications while the child is in the hospital to facilitate the emergence of an epileptic event. ''Neuroimaging studies are very important to help determine the presence of ''brain lesions''. A ''CT scan'' and an ''MRI'', in some cases, might be helpful to point to the specific area of the brain that is abnormal. These tests are very effective to identify developmental abnormalities, ''brain tumors'', ''scars'' due to prior bleeding events, or the presence of ''vascular malformations'' that might be responsible for the epileptic seizures. ''In some children, functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or ictal SPECT (an SPECT obtained at the time of the epileptic event) might also be indicated in order to determine the area of the brain to be excised.''In some cases the localization of the epileptogenic area requires invasive monitoring. In these children, electrodes that record the brain activity are placed either inside the brain (intracerebral electrodes) or directly on top of the brain (subdural electrodes). This procedure may be done at the time of the surgery or days before, in which case it requires a small operation and admission to the hospital for several days for continuous EEG recording. ''Resective surgery (removing specific areas of brain tissue) may result in functional deficits. The functional deficits relate to the area of the brain involved in the surgery. For example, operations near the motor area might result in motor paralysis; surgery in the posterior area of the brain (the occipital lobe) might result in visual deficiencies. Of particular importance is the surgery that is performed in or near the temporal lobe which, among other functions, is responsible for language comprehension and memory. In such cases a special test, called the WADA test, is performed to ensure that removal of the local lesion does not result in severe memory or language functional deficits.''Once the evaluation is completed the team will decide if the patient is a viable candidate for surgery and in that case, what type of surgery is indicated. ''It is worthwhile to mention that not all of the above-mentioned tests are necessary in all patients. ' "
Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery?,"'The actual surgery is performed by a neurosurgeon with specialized training and experience in pediatric epilepsy surgery. However, prior to the surgery the patient must be evaluated by a team of epileptologists, neuroradiologists, neuropsychologists, and neurosurgeons with specialized training in patients with refractory epilepsy. Most of these teams are in large academic medical centers with affiliations to medical schools. The team will tailor the surgery for each child on an individual basis.' "
What are the types of epilepsy surgery?,"'The following are the surgical interventions that are performed to control epileptic disorders. These procedures can be done directly on the brain, (resective surgery or corpus callosotomy), or by implanting a stimulator of the vagus nerve in the neck (vagal nerve stimulation). ' In resective surgery the part of the brain that causes the seizures is removed.  In corpus callosotomy   the major connection between the two sides of the brain is severed (cut). Vagus nerve stimulation is a procedure in which a small wire is attached to the vagus nerve in the neck. This wire is used to electrically stimulate the vagus nerve. "
Resective epilepsy surgery,"""Resective surgery is the best indication for those children with epilepsy that is resistant to the antiepileptic medications and in whom a focal area of the brain was identified as the cause of the seizures. Most of these children have focal seizures rather than generalized seizures. In this procedure, the portion of the child's cerebral cortex that is causing seizures is removed. In some children the epileptic area is restricted to one discrete area of the brain, for example the temporal lobe; in other children several areas of the brain might be involved. The type and the extent of the surgery depends upon the size and location of the epileptogenic area. When the lesion is very discrete, a small area of the brain might be removed, a procedure known as partial lobectomy. If the lesion is more extensive, the child might need a bigger resection, known as multilobar resection. In some extreme cases a full half of the brain might need to be removed, known as a hemispherectomy.""'Since resective surgery will result in the elimination of an area of the brain that might still be functioning before the operation is performed, it must be determined that the area in question can be removed without unacceptable problems, such as a loss of language capacity or a severe motor (movement) insufficiency.''In some children resective surgery could be the most effective form of treatment. For example, in children with mesial temporal sclerosis, a condition in which there is a well-localized lesion in the temporal lobe, the resection of the lesion can result in up to 80% of patients being seizure-free. Fifty percent of children with extensive malformations involving one hemisphere may be seizure-free after hemispherectomy. ''In general, for the selective group of children with well-localized lesions, resective surgery will be beneficial in most of them. ' "
Corpus callosotomy,"'The corpus callosum is a structure composed of nerve fibers that allows for communication between both sides of the brain. Corpus callosotomy consist of cutting the corpus callosum. In partial callosotomy, one section of the corpus callosum is cut, whereas in total callosotomy the whole length of the corpus callosum is cut. Since the fibers that go from one half of the brain to the other half are cut, the communication between the two halves of the brain is impaired. This is precisely the goal of the callosotomy. By limiting the communication between the two sides of the brain the callosotomy prevents the rapid spreading of the epileptic event from one half of the brain to the other.''The indication for this operation is rather limited, mostly to children who have frequent drop attacks, and at the present time is not frequently performed.' "
Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS),"'The vagus nerve is a nerve that connects the brain with several internal organs such as the ''lungs'', heart, stomach, and other organs. Stimulation of the vagus nerve sends information to the brain. Studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve results in an inhibition of seizure activity. However, the reasons for this improvement are not clear.''The vagus nerve stimulator (''VNS'') is a device that consists of a wire attached to an electrical stimulator. The wire is wrapped around the left vagus nerve in the neck, and the electrical stimulator is implanted in a pouch under the skin in the upper chest. The stimulator is programmed to send electrical signals continuously. The strength and the frequency of the electrical stimulation is adjusted as needed by professionals with special training in this technique. Additionally, the system has a magnetic hand-held device that can be used by the patient. Patients who can recognize the beginning of their seizures, for example those who have auras, can use this device to activate the system and abort the seizure. Also, since the stimulator can be activated at any time, if needed, it could be useful to shorten long-lasting seizures and also in the ''prevention'' of status epilepticus.''VNS seems to be effective in a variety of ''seizure disorders'' and epileptic syndromes. It has also proven to be effective in epileptic disorders that are resistant to antiepileptic treatment. Studies show that in many individuals with refractory seizures, VNS significantly reduced seizure activity, and some people have been rendered seizure-free.''VNS is indicated in children with epileptic disorders resistant to medication that are not candidates for surgery.''In the USA, VNS is approved for children older than 12 years of age; however, there is no age limit in the European Union. ''Potential side effects of VNS implantation are those from general anesthesia, the failure of the implant to work and infection at the implant site. Additionally, stimulation of the vagus nerve may cause ''hoarseness'', ''coughing'', and may even change the heart rate. Because the VNS is implanted outside the skull, there is little possibility of additional neurological damage.' "
What are the risks of epilepsy surgery?,"'Some of the risks associated with epilepsy surgery are related to the presurgical evaluation. Some of the tests performed require the use of contrast material that might result in severe ''allergic'' reactions. Implanting electrodes in the brain or placing electrodes on the surface of the brain for continuous monitoring requires surgical procedures that are not very complicated but may be associated with bleeding or infections.''Many tests, as well as the different surgical procedures, require the use of heavy sedation or general anesthesia. General anesthesia has a very small risk of death. ''There are several risks inherent to the surgery, for example, bleeding inside the brain. Bleeding inside the brain might result in additional brain damage, besides; the accumulation of blood might increase the pressure inside the cranium resulting in severe complications, including death. Also the operation may be complicated by infections that can result in meningitis. A later complication of these events could be the development of ''hydrocephalus'', which may require another surgical procedure.''As described before, resective surgery implies the removal of a piece of the brain that in some instances could be as much as the whole hemisphere. This resective surgery may aggravate prior functional deficits or may result in new ones. These complications may occur even after very careful evaluation. ''The range of complications varies with the extent of the surgery and the area removed. For example:''In the particular case of the callosotomy, since there is some degree of disconnection between the right and the left side of the brain, besides the complications already mentioned, some annoying subtle deficiencies may be experienced. For example, some patients may be able to identify, by visual recognition, objects presented to one side of the brain, but might not be able to name them because the memory of the name is in the other side of the brain. In general there are fewer complications with callosotomies than with resective surgery.''Yet, as in the case with all surgeries, there is always the risk of failure. In the case of epilepsy surgery this means recurrence of the epileptic seizures after the operation. Depending upon the type of pre-existing lesion, the failure rate may be as high as 50%. However, even in these cases, the seizures may be easily controlled with medications after the surgery.''In general there are very few complications observed after surgery. A small percentage of children who have had epilepsy surgery experience complications, and even fewer have neurological complications. Mortality (death) is very rare.''As previously mentioned, there is plasticity in the brain of young children, mostly up to the age of 7 to 9 years. The plasticity helps in the recovery of deficits that can be the result of surgery. For example, for children in whom the language areas were affected by the surgery there is remarkable recovery of language functions. Therefore, young children with intractable seizures who are candidates for surgery are much better off when the surgery is done sooner than later. ''Previous contributing medical author: Harley I. Kornblum, MD, PhD'  operations near the motor areas might result in paralysis or weakness in the arms or legs, or loss of fine motor coordination in the hands;  operations near the language areas might result in language disorders;  operations near the cortical visual areas might result in visual deficits."
EEG Introduction,"'An EEG, or electroencephalogram, is a test that can help diagnose ''epilepsy'"". During an EEG, the electrical signals of the brain are recorded. This electrical activity is detected by electrodes, or sensors, placed on the patient's ""'scalp'' and transmitted to a polygraph that records the activity.''Electrical signals produced by the brain neurons are picked up by the electrodes and transmitted to a polygraph, where they produce separate graphs on moving paper using an ink writing pen or on a computer screen.' "
How Do I Prepare For an EEG?,"'To prepare for your EEG you should:''Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor prior to your procedure.''Wash your hair the night before the test. Do not use hair cream, oils, or spray afterward.' "
What Happens During the EEG?,"'During an EEG, you lie down on the examining table or bed while about 20 electrodes are attached to your scalp. You are asked to relax and lie first with your eyes open, then later with them closed. You may be asked to breathe deeply and rapidly or to stare at a flashing light -- both of these activities produce changes in the brain-wave patterns. If you are prone to ''seizures'', it is rare that you may experience one during the test. If you are being evaluated for a ''sleep'' disorder, EEG may be performed continuously during the night while you are asleep. Such a recording, which may involve an evaluation of other body functions during ''sleep'', such as ''respiration'' and pulse, is referred to as polysomnography.' "
What Happens After an EEG?,"'When the EEG is done, the electrodes are removed and the glue that held them in place is washed away with acetone. You may have to use additional acetone at home to completely remove the glue. Unless you are actively having ''seizures'' or are restricted by your doctor, you may drive home. If the EEG was performed overnight, you should arrange to have someone drive you home. If you stopped taking anticonvulsant ''drugs'' for the EEG, you can usually start taking them again.''A ''neurologist'' examines the EEG recording for abnormalities in the brain-wave pattern, which may reflect diseases of the nervous system.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is a seizure (definition)?,"'A ''seizure'' and a ''seizure'' disorder are not the same. A seizure is single occurrence of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain, usually for short time span. It can cause numerous signs and symptoms like convulsions, thought disturbances, ''loss of consciousness'', and/or other symptoms. Usually, doctors consider seizures a ''symptom of a disease''.\xa0''Epilepsy''\xa0is a ''chronic disorder of recurrent unprovoked ''seizures'', ''and is one type of seizure disorder. In epilepsy, the ''convulsion'' is a sudden, violent irregular movement of a limb of the body caused by involuntary contraction of muscles usually associated with ''epilepsy'' and/or toxic agents.\xa0' "
What is a seizure disorder (definition)?,"'A seizure disorder is a medical condition (one of about 40) characterized by episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain, thus producing symptoms that include two or more seizures. Doctors separate the disorders from each other by their potential causes and their own set of symptoms due to the affected area in the brain.' "
What are the types and symptoms of seizures?,"'1. Generalized seizures result in loss of consciousness.''2. Partial or focal seizures'' result in either no loss of consciousness or ''confusion'' for a few minutes.''3. Unknown onset seizure' Motor: Grand mal seizures (also called tonic-clonic with muscle jerks or spasms) and have signs and symptoms of stiffness of muscles (tonic), relaxed muscles (atonic), muscles that cause sporadic short jerking of body or limbs (myoclonic), and repetitive shaking or jerking of the body (clonic). Non-motor (absence): Symptoms include staring into space, sometimes with eye blinking. Aware: Twitching and/or sensation change Impaired awareness: No loss of consciousness, but you become confused for a few minutes Unclassified: It may share questionable features of generalized and/or focal seizures. Motor: Involving musculature Non-motor: Involving awareness"
What are the types of seizure disorders? Are the signs and symptoms the same?,"'There are about 40 different types of named ''seizure disorders''. However, all of the seizure disorders fit into one of the three seizure types listed previously. They differ from each other by some changes in the symptoms they produce. Although it is beyond the scope of this article to describe all types of seizure disorders, an example of how they are given names may give insight as to how their symptoms differ. For example:''Other symptoms of seizure disorders may include:''With these few examples, you can understand the complexity of seizure disorders and their symptoms.'   Simple partial seizure disorders differ from person to person depending upon the part of the brain affected. Benign Rolandic epilepsy in children causes tongue twitching, and may interfere with speech and cause drooling. Catamenial epilepsy refers to seizures that occur in relation to the menstrual cycle. Atonic seizures cause symptoms like falling usually not associated with loss of consciousness. Absence seizures cause a short loss of consciousness with little or no symptoms. Clonic seizures cause rhythmic jerks that involve both sides of the body simultaneously. Tonic seizures cause a stiffening of the muscles Febrile seizures usually occur in children between 6 months and 5 years of age. They are common in toddlers.  Convulsions Eye blinking The lips may slightly jerk and move. Sudden loss of muscle tone The head drops suddenly The person cries out The person falls to the ground Changes in tastes or smells Biting the tongue The person cannot answer questions. Thought disturbances Eye rolling The person involuntarily urinates or has a bowel movement."
Will I have to limit my activities after having a seizure? Can I drive?,"'Until your seizures are controlled, you should not do activities where loss of consciousness could be life threatening. For example, avoid driving, ''swimming'', climbing, operating power tools, or taking a bath in a bathtub until about six months after becoming seizure free. Some states require you to be free of seizures up to one year before you can drive.' "
How long do seizures last?,"'Although most seizures stop spontaneously after several minutes (average is about 1- 2 minutes), there are conditions that may cause ''brain damage'' and/or life-threatening situations due to seizures. Status epilepticus (seizures lasting 5 or more minutes or if there is more than one seizure within five minutes) is a medical emergency; call 911 as the patient needs emergency treatment, usually with an anticonvulsant such as ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan''), given intravenously.' "
How are seizures and seizure disorders treated and managed?,"'If you know the cause of your seizures or seizure disorder (such as alcohol intake or ''cocaine'' use, ''low blood sugar'', and ''encephalitis'""), you should stop what's triggering them and/or treat any underlying medical conditions. For example, stop drinking alcohol and/or abusing legal or illegal ""'drugs''; and manage your blood sugar if you have diabetes. Take your medication as your doctor or other health care professional has prescribed. Seizures that do not respond to treatment may cause you and your medical team (primary care doctor, neurologist, and neurosurgeon) to consider surgery or nerve stimulation treatment.'  "
Can seizures or seizures disorders be prevented?,"'Depending upon the cause of the seizure and/or seizure disorder, the chances of reducing or preventing some of them is possible. You can do this by avoiding any known potential causes or triggers of your seizures, like drinking excessive alcohol or using cocaine and other illegal drugs. You should take your medicine as your doctor has prescribed to reduce the chance of developing another seizure. For some patients, brain surgery may eliminate seizures by removing the epileptic focus the brain tissue. ''Vagus nerve stimulation'' is another potential way to prevent some seizures. However, none of these treatments provides 100% ''prevention''. In addition, it is difficult to prevent seizures caused by ''birth defects'', injuries, ''strokes'', or tumors.'  "
Epilepsy and an overview of the types of seizures,"'Based on the type of behavior and brain activity, ''seizures'' are divided into two broad categories: generalized and partial (also called local or focal). Classifying the type of ''seizure'' helps physicians diagnose whether or not a patient has ''epilepsy''.''Generalized seizures are produced by electrical impulses from throughout the entire brain, whereas partial seizures are produced (at least initially) by electrical impulses in a relatively small part of the brain. The part of the brain generating the seizures is sometimes called the focus.' "
Generalized seizures,"'There are six types of ''generalized seizures''. The most common and dramatic, and therefore the most well known, is the generalized ''convulsion'', also called the ''grand-mal ''seizure''. In this type of seizure, the patient loses consciousness and usually collapses. The ''loss of consciousness'' is followed by generalized body stiffening (called the ""tonic"" phase of the seizure) for 30 to 60 seconds, then by violent jerking (the ""clonic"" phase) for 30 to 60 seconds, after which the patient goes into a deep ''sleep'' (the ""postictal"" or after-seizure phase). During grand-mal seizures, injuries and accidents may occur, such as tongue biting and ''urinary incontinence''.' "
Absence seizures,"'Absence seizures cause a short loss of consciousness (just a few seconds) with few or no symptoms. The patient, most often a child, typically interrupts an activity and stares blankly. These seizures begin and end abruptly and may occur several times a day. Patients are usually not aware that they are having a seizure, except that they may be aware of ""losing time.""'  "
Myoclonic seizures,"'Myoclonic seizures consist of sporadic jerks, usually on both sides of the body. Patients sometimes describe the jerks as brief electrical shocks. When violent, these seizures may result in dropping or involuntarily throwing objects.' "
Clonic seizures,"'Clonic seizures are repetitive, rhythmic jerks that involve both sides of the body at the same time.' "
Tonic seizures,'Tonic seizures are characterized by stiffening of the muscles.' 
Atonic seizures,"'Atonic seizures consist of a sudden and general loss of muscle tone, particularly in the arms and legs, which often results in a fall.' "
Partial seizures,"'Partial seizures ''are divided into simple, complex and those that evolve into secondary generalized seizures. The difference between simple and complex seizures is that during simple partial seizures, patients retain awareness; during complex partial seizures, they lose awareness.'  "
Simple partial seizures,"'Simple partial seizures are further subdivided into four categories according to the nature of their symptoms: motor, autonomic, sensory or psychological. Motor symptoms include movements such as jerking and stiffening. Sensory symptoms caused by seizures involve unusual sensations affecting any of the five senses (vision, ''hearing'', smell, taste or touch). When simple partial seizures cause sensory symptoms only (and not motor symptoms), they are called ""auras.""''Autonomic symptoms affect the autonomic nervous system, which is the group of nerves that control the functions of our organs, like the ''heart'', stomach, bladder, ''intestines''. Therefore autonomic symptoms are things like racing heart beat, stomach upset, ''diarrhea'', loss of bladder control. The only common autonomic symptom is a peculiar sensation in the stomach that is experienced by some patients with a type of ''epilepsy'' called temporal lobe ''epilepsy''. Simple partial seizures with psychological symptoms are characterized by various experiences involving memory (the sensation of deja-vu), emotions (such as fear or pleasure), or other complex psychological phenomena.' "
Complex partial seizures,"'Complex partial seizures, by definition, include impairment of awareness. Patients seem to be ""out of touch,"" ""out of it"" or ""staring into space"" during these seizures. There may also be some ""complex"" symptoms called automatisms. Automatisms consist of involuntary but coordinated movements that tend to be purposeless and repetitive. Common automatisms include lip smacking, chewing, fidgeting and ''walking''.' "
Focal seizures,"'Focal seizures, the third kind of ''partial seizure'' is one that begins as a focal seizure and evolves into a generalized convulsive (""grand-mal"") seizure. Most patients with partial seizures have simple partial, complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures. In about two-thirds of patients with partial epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with medications. Partial seizures that cannot be treated with medications can often be treated surgically.''Reviewed by The Cleveland Clinic Neuroscience Center.''Edited by Edited by Joseph R Carcione, MBA, DO on February 01, 2007''Portions of this page © The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2004' "
What is a breast self-exam?,"""A breast self-exam is a woman's examination of her own breasts. Breast self-exams were formerly encouraged to help women detect ""'breast cancer'', but experts and medical organizations do not agree about whether this is necessary or helps save lives. Many women feel comfortable doing breast self-exams as a way to monitor their own health.'  "
Is a breast self-exam necessary?,"'As mentioned, agencies that issue health practice guidelines do not agree on whether doing breast self-exams are helpful in terms of ''cancer'' detection or saving lives from ''cancer''. The best way to detect ''breast cancer'' is by having regular mammograms combined with a breast examination by a health care professional.''According to the American ''Cancer'' Society, breast self exam is an option for women starting in their 20s, but women should be informed about the limitations as well as the benefits of this practice. According to the ACS, ""Research has shown that BSE plays a small role in finding breast cancer compared with finding a ''breast lump'' by chance or simply being aware of what is normal for each woman.""' "
How should one do a breast self-exam?,"'If you choose to do breast self-exams, your doctor can help show you the best technique. Many women find it convenient to do the exam while bathing or showering. The best time to do the exam is 3 to 5 days after the start of the ''menstrual period'', since the breasts are not as tender or lumpy at this time of the cycle. Women who no longer have menstrual periods should do the exam about the same time each month.''Part of a breast self-exam involves examination of the appearance of the breasts in a mirror. For this step, it is best to stand in front of a mirror and examine your breasts in different positions: with your arms relaxed by your side, with your hands pressed down on your hips, leaning forward with chest muscles tightened, and with hands behind the head and chest muscles tightened. Turning from side to side may be helpful to view all angles. Look for any changes like sores on the skin, dimpling or puckering of the skin, or changes in skin color. Look for discharge or changes in the skin of the ''nipple'"" areas, as well. Don't forget to examine the skin underneath the breasts.""""Next, use the flat part of the fingers to feel your breasts, following an up and down or circular motion until you have examined all breast tissue from collarbone to the lower border of the breasts. Examine the armpit areas too since these may contain breast tissue. Look for lumps or irregularities in density or any changes since your last exam. Feel beneath the nipple for any changes. It's best to do this both standing (with your hand on your hip; use the opposite hand to do the exam) and while lying down."" "
What if I find a lump or abnormality on my breast self-exam?,"'See your doctor if you find any abnormality or unexplained change in your breasts. Most breast lumps are benign (non-cancerous), but it is important to have your doctor evaluate any changes you observe during the breast self-exam.' "
How Do I Know There Is A Recurrence?,"""If you've been treated for ""'breast cancer'', you should continue to practice breast self-examination, checking both the treated area and your other breast each month. You should report any changes to your doctor right away. Breast changes that might indicate a recurrence include:''In addition to performing monthly ''breast self-exams'', keep your scheduled follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider. During these appointments, your healthcare provider will perform a breast exam, order lab or imaging tests as needed, and ask you about any symptoms you might have. Initially, these follow-up appointments may be scheduled every three to four months. The longer you are ''cancer'""-free, the less often you will need to see your healthcare provider. Continue to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations on screening mammograms (usually recommended once a year)."" An area that is distinctly different from any other area on either breast 
 Lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm that persists through the menstrual cycle
 A change in the size, shape, or contour of the breast 
 A mass or lump, which may feel as small as a pea 
 A marble-like area under the skin 
 A change in the feel or appearance of the skin on the breast or nipple, including skin that is dimpled, puckered, scaly, or inflamed (red, warm or swollen) 
 Bloody or clear fluid discharge from the nipples 
 Redness of the skin on the breast or nipple "
What Factors Determine The Likelihood Of A Recurrence?,"'Prognostic indicators are characteristics of a patient and her ''tumor'' that may help a physician predict a ''cancer'' recurrence. These are some common indicators:' Lymph node involvement. Women who have lymph node involvement are more likely to have a recurrence. 
 Tumor size. In general, the larger the tumor, the greater the chance of recurrence. 
 Hormone receptors. About two-thirds of all breast cancers contain significant levels of estrogen receptors, which means the tumors are estrogen receptor positive (ER+). ER-positive tumors tend to grow less aggressively and may respond favorably to treatment with hormones. 
 Histologic grade. This term refers to how much the tumor cells resemble normal cells when viewed under the microscope; the grading scale is 1 to 4. Grade 4 tumors contain very abnormal and rapidly growing cancer cells. The higher the histologic grade, the greater chance of recurrence. 
 Nuclear grade. This is the rate at which cancer cells in the tumor divide to form more cells. Cancer cells with a high nuclear grade (also called proliferative capacity) are usually more aggressive (faster growing). 
 Oncogene expression. An oncogene is a gene that causes or promotes cancerous changes within the cell. Tumors that contain certain oncogenes may increase a patient's chance of recurrence. "
How Will My Prognosis Affect My Treatment?,"'Following surgery or ''radiation'', your treatment team will determine the likelihood that the cancer will recur outside the breast. This team usually includes a medical oncologist, a specialist trained in using medicines to treat breast cancer. The medical oncologist, who works with your surgeon, may advise the use of ''tamoxifen'' (tamoxifen citrate, ''Nolvadex'') or possibly ''chemotherapy''. These treatments are used in addition to, but not in place of, local breast cancer treatment with surgery and/or ''radiation therapy''.' "
How Would A Recurrence Be Treated?,"'The type of treatment for local breast cancer recurrences depends on your initial treatment. If you had a ''lumpectomy'', local recurrence is usually treated with mastectomy, since radiation therapy cannot be delivered twice to the same area. If the initial treatment was mastectomy, recurrence near the mastectomy site is treated by removing the tumor whenever possible, usually followed by radiation therapy.''In either case, ''hormone therapy'' and/or chemotherapy may be used after surgery and/or radiation therapy. If breast cancer is found in the other breast, it may be a new tumor unrelated to the first breast cancer. Treatment would include a lumpectomy or mastectomy and possibly systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy).''Women with distant recurrence involving organs such as the bones, lungs, brain, or other organs are treated with systemic therapy. Radiation therapy or surgery may also be recommended to relieve certain symptoms.''Immunotherapy with ''trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') alone or with chemotherapy may be recommended for women whose cancer cells have high levels of the HER2/neu protein. Immunotherapy is generally started after hormonal or chemotherapy are no longer effective.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic  Taussig Cancer Center.''Edited by  Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, February 2004.''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic''  2000-2004' "
Introduction to Masturbation,"'Masturbation is the self-stimulation of the genitals to achieve sexual arousal and pleasure, usually to the point of ''orgasm'' (sexual climax). It is commonly done by touching, stroking, or massaging the penis or clitoris until an orgasm is achieved. Some women also use stimulation of the vagina to masturbate or use ""sex toys,"" such as a vibrator. ' "
Who Masturbates?,"""Just about everybody. Masturbation is a very common behavior, even among people who have sexual relations with a partner. In one national study, 95% of males and 89% of females reported that they have masturbated. Masturbation is the first sexual act experienced by most males and females. In young children, masturbation is a normal part of the growing child's exploration of his or her body. Most people continue to masturbate in adulthood, and many do so throughout their lives. "" "
Why Do People Masturbate?,"'In addition to feeling good, masturbation is a good way of relieving the sexual tension that can build up over time, especially for people without partners or whose partners are not willing or available for sex. Masturbation also is a safe sexual alternative for people who wish to avoid ''pregnancy'' and the dangers of ''sexually transmitted diseases''. It also is necessary when a man must give a semen sample for  ''infertility'' testing or for sperm donation. When sexual dysfunction is present in an adult, masturbation may be prescribed by a sex therapist to allow a person to experience an orgasm (often in women) or to delay its arrival (often in men). ' "
Is Masturbation Normal?,"'While it once was regarded as a perversion and a sign of a mental problem, masturbation now is regarded as a normal, healthy sexual activity that is pleasant, fulfilling, acceptable and safe. It is a good way to experience sexual pleasure and can be done throughout life. ''Masturbation is only considered a problem when it inhibits sexual activity with a partner, is done in public, or causes significant distress to the person. It may cause distress if it is done compulsively and/or interferes with daily life and activities. ' "
Is Masturbation Harmful?,""" In general, the medical community considers masturbation to be a natural and harmless expression of sexuality for both men and women. It does not cause any physical injury or harm to the body, and can be performed in moderation throughout a person's lifetime as a part of normal sexual behavior. Some cultures and religions oppose the use of masturbation or even label it as sinful. This can lead to guilt or shame about the behavior. ""'Some experts suggest that masturbation can actually improve ''sexual health'' and relationships. By exploring your own body through masturbation, you can determine what is erotically pleasing to you and can share this with your partner. Some partners use mutual masturbation to discover techniques for a more satisfying sexual relationship and to add to their mutual intimacy. ''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is body dysmorphic disorder?,"'Body dysmorphic disorder'' is a serious mental health condition that affects about 1 out of every 50 people. In this, your mind is always preoccupied with a negative outlook toward your body features. It is estimated that nearly 5 to 10 million Americans suffer from this disorder. Figures may be more than these in reality. This is because people with body dysmorphic disorder feel awkward to consult their doctor regarding their negative thoughts and feelings; hence, the condition goes undiagnosed in many people. If not diagnosed and sought treatment early, it may lead to severe disruptions in the affected person’s daily life.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder?,"'If you suspect yourself of having dysmorphia, visit your doctor to get a correct diagnosis. Here are the signs and symptoms that you may feel if you suffer from body dysmorphia.\xa0' You will constantly check yourself in the mirror. You will constantly feel that you are ugly. You will always use makeup to hide the flaws you think you have. You will try to hide your face or other body parts under a hat or scarf. You will constantly compare yourself with others. You will frequently seek reassurance from the people about your looks. You will always take opinions from many healthcare providers about your appearance. You will be on the constant lookout for cosmetic procedures. You will often pick at your skin. You will feel ashamed of your appearance. You will avoid social gatherings."
What puts you at risk for body dysmorphic disorder?,'What causes body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is not well understood. It typically begins in the early teenage years.''Things that increase your chances of getting affected with BDD include:' Having family members with BDD or obsessive-compulsive disorder Bad experiences of teasing or abuse as a child Societal pressure of looking beautiful Suffering from anxiety or depression Being a perfectionist
How is body dysmorphia treated?,"'Treatment for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) includes:' Medications: Certain medicines used to treat depression are used in the treatment of BDD. The most commonly used drug class includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This therapy is used in treating a wide range of psychiatric illnesses. The therapist helps you change your false beliefs and automatic negative thoughts about how you look. They teach you how to avoid irresistible urges of unnecessarily looking into the mirror several times a day, asking people about your appearance, etc."
What is blood in the semen?,"'The presence of blood in the semen (ejaculate) is also called hematospermia. Hematospermia is not always noticed; therefore, it is difficult to make estimates of its incidence.' "
What are the causes of blood in the semen?,"'Blood in semen'' can be caused by many conditions affecting the male genitourinary system. Areas affected may include the bladder, urethra, the testicles, the tubes that distribute semen from the testicles (known as the seminal vesicles), the epididymis (a segment of the spermatic ducts that serves to store, mature, and transport sperm), and the ''prostate gland''.''Blood in the semen is most commonly a result of a prostate gland biopsy. A majority of men who undergo a prostate biopsy may have some blood in their semen that persists for three to four weeks. Likewise, ''vasectomy'' can lead to bloody semen for about one week after the procedure.''In men with hematospermia who have not had a recent prostate biopsy or vasectomy, a number of benign and ''malignant'' conditions of the male genital system may be the cause. In many situations, no definitive cause is found.''The following conditions have been reported in association with hematospermia:'   Benign or malignant tumors of the prostate, bladder, testes, or seminal vesicles Infections including, but not limited to, chlamydia, herpes, cytomegalovirus, and trichomoniasis Inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), epididymis (epididymitis), or urethra (urethritis) Calculi (stones similar to kidney stones) in the seminal vesicles or prostate Polyps in the urethra Ejaculation duct obstructions Metastatic cancers (that have spread from other sites in the body) located in the genitourinary system Cysts, hemorrhage, or other abnormalities in the seminal vesicles"
What are the symptoms of blood in the semen?,"'The symptoms that can occasionally accompany blood in the semen may be any of the following, depending upon the cause (these are not all inclusive):'   Painful urination Pain with ejaculation Blood in urine Lower back pain Fever Tenderness in the testes and/or scrotum Swelling in the testes and/or scrotum Swelling or tenderness in the groin area"
How is blood in the semen evaluated?,"'A number of diagnostic tests may be performed after the clinical history is evaluated and a physical examination is performed. Some of the most commonly performed diagnostic tests are a ''urinalysis'' and cultures to identify any sexually transmitted or other infections. When indicated, imaging studies such as ''ultrasound'' or ''MRI'' may reveal tumors or other abnormalities. In some situations, a semen analysis, in which the semen is analyzed under a microscope, may be recommended.' "
What is the treatment for blood in the semen?,"'Treatment of blood in the semen is directed toward the underlying cause if a cause has been found. Sometimes, treatment with antibiotics for a presumptive diagnosis of prostatitis (''inflammation of the prostate gland'') is given, since some studies have shown that up to about one-fourth of men with hematospermia have prostatitis. However, the benefit of such treatment has not been definitively established.''In most cases, if blood in the semen is not associated with any known abnormality of other troubling symptoms, no treatment is given, and the condition usually resolves on its own with time in these situations. Persistent hematospermia (for a month or more) even in the absence of other symptoms warrants further or follow-up evaluation.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for patients with blood in the semen?,"'The prognosis relates to the underlying cause of blood in the semen if a cause can be identified. However, most cases of hematospermia are benign and resolve without treatment. While ''cancer'' is a rare cause of blood in the semen, the majority of cases are not related to ''cancer'', especially in younger men.' "
What is an electromyogram?,"'An electromyogram (EMG) is a test that is used to record the electrical activity of muscles. When muscles are active, they produce an electrical current. This current is usually proportional to the level of the muscle activity. An EMG is also referred to as a myogram.''EMGs can be used to detect abnormal electrical activity of muscle that can occur in many diseases and conditions, including muscular dystrophy, inflammation of muscles, pinched nerves, peripheral nerve damage (damage to nerves in the arms and legs), ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'' (''ALS''), ''myasthenia gravis'', ''disc herniation'', and others.'  "
Why is an EMG test done?,"'An EMG is often performed when patients have unexplained muscle ''weakness''. The EMG helps to distinguish between muscle conditions in which the problem begins in the muscle and muscle weakness due to nerve disorders. The EMG can also be used to detect true weakness, as opposed to weakness from reduced use because of ''pain'' or lack of motivation. EMGs can also be used to isolate the level of nerve irritation or injury.'  "
How is an intramuscular EMG done?,"'A needle is inserted through the skin into the muscle. The electrical activity is detected by this needle (which serves as an electrode). The activity is displayed visually on an oscilloscope and may also be detected audibly with a speaker.''Since skeletal muscles are often large, several needle electrodes may need to be placed at various locations to obtain an informative EMG.''After placement of the electrode(s), the patient may be asked to contract the muscle (for example, to bend the leg).''The presence, size, and shape of the wave form (the action potential) produced on the oscilloscope provide information about the ability of the muscle to respond to nervous stimulation. Each muscle ''fiber'' that contracts produces an action potential. The size of the muscle fiber affects the rate (how frequently an action potential occurs) and the size (the amplitude) of the action potential.' "
Is an EMG painful?,"'Yes. There is some discomfort at the time the needle electrodes are inserted. They feel like shots (intramuscular injections), although nothing is injected during an EMG. Afterwards, the muscle may feel a little sore for up to a few days.'  "
How do you prepare for an intramuscular EMG?,"""For adults, no special preparation is needed. For infants and children, the physical and psychological preparation depends on the child's age, behavior, and prior experience. (For instance, has the child been traumatized by another medical or dental procedure?)"" "
What other test is done during an intramuscular EMG?,"""A nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test is often done at the same time as an EMG. In this test, the nerve is electrically stimulated while a second electrode detects the electrical impulse 'down-stream' from the first. This is usually done with surface patch electrodes (they are similar to those used for an ""'electrocardiogram'') that are placed on the skin over the nerve at various locations. One electrode stimulates the nerve with a very mild electrical impulse. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to calculate the speed of impulse transmission (nerve conduction velocity). A decreased speed of transmission indicates nerve disease.''The NCV test can be used to detect true nerve disorders (such as neuropathy) or conditions whereby muscles are affected by nerve injury (such as ''carpal tunnel syndrome''). Normal body temperature must be maintained for the NCV test, because low body temperatures slow nerve conduction.''Previous contributing authors and editors: Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor: Barbara K.

Introduction to senior sex,"'Many people want and need to be close to others as they grow older. This includes the desire to continue an active, satisfying sex life. But, with aging, there may be changes that can cause problems.' "
What are normal changes with age?,"'Normal aging brings physical changes in both men and women. These changes sometimes affect the ability to have and enjoy sex. A woman may notice changes in her vagina. As a woman ages, her vagina can shorten and narrow. Her vaginal walls can become thinner and also a little stiffer. Most women will have less vaginal lubrication. These changes could affect sexual function and/or pleasure. Talk with your doctor about these problems.''As men get older, ''impotence'' (also called ''erectile dysfunction'' - ''ED'') becomes more common. ''ED'' is the loss of ability to have and keep an erection for sexual intercourse. ''ED'' may cause a man to take longer to have an erection. His erection may not be as firm or as large as it used to be. The loss of erection after ''orgasm'' may happen more quickly, or it may take longer before another erection is possible. ED is not a problem if it happens every now and then, but if it occurs often, talk with your doctor.' "
What causes sexual problems as we age?,"'Some illnesses, disabilities, medicines, and surgeries can affect your ability to have and enjoy sex. Problems in your relationship can also affect your ability to enjoy sex.''''Arthritis.'' ''Joint pain'' due to arthritis can make sexual contact uncomfortable. Joint replacement surgery and ''drugs'' may relieve this ''pain''. ''Exercise'', rest, warm baths, and changing the position or timing of sexual activity can be helpful.''Chronic pain''.'' Any constant ''pain'' can interfere with intimacy between older people. ''Chronic pain'' does not have to be part of growing older and can often be treated. But, some pain medicines can interfere with sexual function. You should always talk with your doctor if you have unwanted side effects from any medication.''Dementia''.'' Some people with ''dementia'' show increased interest in sex and physical closeness, but they may not be able to judge what is appropriate sexual behavior. Those with severe dementia may not recognize their spouse but still seek sexual contact. This can be a confusing problem for the spouse. A doctor, nurse, or social worker with training in dementia care may be helpful.''''Diabetes''.'' This is one of the illnesses that can cause ED (''impotence'') in some men. In most cases, medical treatment can help. Less is known about how ''diabetes'' affects sexuality in older women. Women with diabetes are more likely to have vaginal yeast infections, which can cause ''itching'' and irritation and make sex uncomfortable or undesirable. Yeast infections can be treated.''''Heart disease''.'' Narrowing and ''hardening of the arteries'' can change blood vessels so that blood does not flow freely. As a result, men and women may have problems with orgasms, and men may have trouble with erections. People who have had a ''heart attack'"", or their partners, may be afraid that having sex will cause another attack. Even though sexual activity is generally safe, always follow your doctor's advice. If your ""'heart'' problems get worse and you have ''chest pain'' or ''shortness of breath'' even while resting, talk to your doctor. He or she may want to change your treatment plan.''''Incontinence.'' Loss of bladder control or leaking of urine is more common as we grow older, especially in women. ''Stress'' incontinence happens during ''exercise'', ''coughing'', ''sneezing'', or lifting, for example. Because of the extra pressure on your abdomen during sex, incontinence might cause some people to avoid sex. The good news is that this can usually be treated.''''Stroke''.'' The ability to have sex is sometimes affected by a ''stroke''. A change in positions or medical devices may help people with ongoing ''weakness'' or ''paralysis'' to have sex. Some people with paralysis from the waist down are still able to experience orgasm and pleasure.''Depression''.'' Lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy, such as intimacy and sexual activity, can be a symptom of ''depression'"". It's sometimes hard to know if you're ""'depressed''. Talk with your doctor. ''Depression'' can be treated.' "
What Else May Cause Sexuality Problems?,"'Surgery.'' Many of us worry about having any kind of surgery - it is especially troubling when the genital area is involved. Happily, most people do return to the kind of sex life they enjoyed before having surgery.\t''Hysterectomy'"" is surgery to remove a woman's uterus. Often, when an older woman has a hysterectomy, the ovaries are also removed. The surgery can leave both women and men worried about their sex lives. If you're afraid that a hysterectomy will change your sex life, talk with your gynecologist or surgeon. \t""'Mastectomy'"" is surgery to remove all or part of a woman's breast. This surgery may cause some women to lose their sexual interest or their sense of being desired or feeling feminine. In addition to talking with your doctor, sometimes it is useful to talk with other women who have had this surgery. Programs like the American ""'Cancer'' Society\'s (ACS) ""Reach to Recovery"" can be helpful for both women and men. If you want your breast rebuilt (reconstruction), talk to your ''cancer'' doctor or surgeon.\t''Prostatectomy'""  is surgery that removes all or part of a man's prostate because of ""'cancer'' or an ''enlarged prostate''. It may cause ''urinary incontinence'' or ED. If removal of the ''prostate gland'' is needed, talk to your doctor before surgery about your concerns.''''Medications.'' Some drugs can cause sexual problems. These include some blood pressure medicines, ''antihistamines'', antidepressants, tranquilizers, ''appetite suppressants'', ''diabetes drugs'', and some ulcer drugs such as ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac''). Some can lead to ''impotence'"" or make it hard for men to ejaculate. Some drugs can reduce a woman's sexual desire. Check with your doctor. She or he can often prescribe a different drug without this side effect.""'''Alcohol.'' Too much alcohol can cause erection problems in men and delay orgasm in women.' "
Am I too old to worry about safe sex?,"'Age does not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases. Older people who are sexually active may be at risk for diseases such as ''syphilis'', ''gonorrhea'',chlamydial infection, ''genital herpes'', ''hepatitis B'', ''genital warts'', and ''trichomoniasis''.''Almost anyone who is sexually active is also at risk of being infected with ''HIV'', the virus that causes ''AIDS''. The number of older people with ''HIV/AIDS'' is growing. You are at risk for ''HIV/AIDS'' if you or your partner has more than one sexual partner or if you are having unprotected sex. To protect yourself, always use a ''condom'' during sex. For women with ''vaginal dryness'', lubricated ''condoms'' or a water-based lubricating jelly with condoms may be more comfortable. A man needs to have a full erection before putting on a condom.''Talk with your doctor about ways to protect yourself from all sexually transmitted diseases. Go for regular checkups and testing. Talk with your partner. You are never too old to be at risk.'  "
Can emotions play a part?,"'Sexuality is often a delicate balance of emotional and physical issues. How you feel may affect what you are able to do. Many older couples find greater satisfaction in their sex life than they did when they were younger. They have fewer distractions, more time and privacy, no worries about ''getting pregnant'', and intimacy with a lifelong partner.''Some older people are concerned about sex as they age. A woman who is unhappy about how her looks are changing as she ages may think her partner will no longer find her attractive. This focus on youthful physical ''beauty'' may get in the way of her enjoyment of sex. Men may fear that ED will become a more common problem as they age. Most men have a problem with ED once in awhile. But, if you worry too much about that happening, you can cause enough ''stress'' to trigger ED.'""Older couples face the same daily stresses that affect people of any age. They may also have the added concerns of age, illness, retirement, and other lifestyle changes, all of which may lead to sexual difficulties. Try not to blame yourself or your partner. You may find it helpful to talk to a therapist. Some therapists have special training in helping with sexual problems. If your male partner is troubled by ED or your female partner seems less interested in sex, don't assume he or she is no longer interested in you or in sex. Many of the things that cause these problems can be helped.""  "
What can I do to have an active sex life as I age?,"""There are things you can do on your own for an active sexual life. Make your partner a high priority. Take time to enjoy each other and to understand the changes you both are facing. Try different positions and new times, like having sex in the morning when you both may be well rested. Don't hurry—you or your partner may need to spend more time touching to become fully aroused. ""'Masturbation'' is a sexual activity that many older people, with and without a partner, find satisfying.'""Don't be afraid to talk with your doctor if you have a problem that affects your sex life. He or she may be able to suggest a treatment. For example, the most common sexual difficulty of older women is ""'painful intercourse'' caused by ''vaginal dryness''. Your doctor or a pharmacist can suggest ''over-the-counter'' vaginal lubricants or moisturizers to use. Water-based lubricants are helpful when needed to make sex more comfortable. Moisturizers are used on a regular basis, every 2 or 3 days. Or, your doctor might suggest a form of vaginal estrogen.''If ED is the problem, it can often be managed and perhaps even reversed. There are pills that can help. They should not be used by men taking medicines containing ''nitrates'', such as ''nitroglycerin''. The pills do have possible side effects. Other available treatments include vacuum devices, self-injection of a drug, or ''penile implants''.''Physical problems can change your sex life as you get older. But, you and your partner may discover you have a new closeness. Talk to your partner about your needs. You may find that affection - hugging, kissing, touching, and spending time together - can make a good beginning.'  "
What is a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'Lymph nodes'' are small, bean-shaped structures that contain cells from the immune system. They filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid and are connected to lymph vessels. Lymph nodes can also contain ''cancer'' cells that have spread from the site of the ''cancer'' into the lymphatic fluid. The sentinel lymph nodes are the first few lymph nodes (""lymph gland"") to receive lymphatic drainage from a ''tumor'', meaning that sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes to which ''cancer'' cells would spread. It stands sentinel over the tumor, so to speak. The biopsy is performed to determine if there are cancer cells in the node. If the sentinel ''lymph node'' does not contain cancer cells (a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy), then the cancer has not likely spread to lymph nodes or other organs via the lymphatic system.''Sentinel node biopsy is a common technique to assess the extent of spread of ''breast cancer'' and can spare the patient more extensive axillary lymph node surgery (see below). It is also frequently used in evaluating patients with ''melanoma''.' "
What is the lymphatic drainage?,"'Lymphatic system refers to a collection of vessels that, like the system of blood vessels, circulates fluid through the tissues in all parts of the body. The lymphatic drainage refers to the manner in which tissue fluid, or lymph, is drained from the body and returns to a central location -- in this case, a lymph node. The lymphatic fluid has a milky appearance.' "
"Why do a 
sentinel node biopsy?","'Sentinel node (""gland"") biopsy is performed to examine the tissue of the node to learn whether that node does or does not have tumor cells within it. The biopsy is performed to verify if there are cancer cells present in the lymph node. This procedure helps the surgeon accurately stage the tumor. Staging a tumor refers to determining the extent to which it has spread in the body. A negative biopsy can avoid the removal of a large number of lymph nodes which can lead to ''lymphedema''. Although ''lymphedema'' can be a complication of sentinel lymph node biopsies, it is much more common when multiple lymph nodes need to be removed.'  "
How does a tumor spread?,"'Tumors have only four ways of spreading:''Some tumors spread preferentially by the lymphatic system, meaning that the cancer cells tend to spread by this method.' by local invasion of adjacent tissue, by direct growth or extension into nearby tissues, through the blood stream, and through the lymphatic system."
How is it determined which is the sentinel node?,'Which lymph nodes are the sentinel nodes for a given tumor is determined by injecting around the tumor a tracer substance that will travel through the lymphatic system to the first draining (sentinel) nodes and identify them. The tracer substance may be blue dye that can be visually tracked or a radioactive substance that can be detected as with a hand-held Geiger counter or both.' 
What types of specialists perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed by surgeons. This procedure is most commonly performed to evaluate breast ''cancers'' and melanomas, so breast surgeons often perform this procedure.' "
What happens during a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'After the tracer substance is injected, the surgeon identifies the sentinel lymph node and surgically removes it through a small incision. This may be done in an outpatient surgery center or a hospital operating room. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often done at the same time as the removal of a ''primary tumor''.' "
"What does the 
sentinel lymph node biopsy show?","'Biopsy of the sentinel lymph node can reveal whether there are or are not lymphatic metastases, which are cancer cells that have spread from the original primary tumor into the lymphatic drainage system. The sentinel node can be rapidly evaluated while the patient is still in surgery utilizing the technique of frozen section analysis. The final report on the sentinel node awaits the final analysis by the pathologist on what is called formalin fixed tissue.''If the sentinel node contains tumor cells, removal of more nodes in the area may be warranted. This may be done during the same procedure if the first sample is evaluated while the patient is still in the operating room. If the sentinel node is normal, it is unnecessary to remove many additional lymph nodes, such as the axillary lymph nodes (called an axillary lymph node dissection or ALND) in a patient with ''breast cancer''.' "
What are the benefits of a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'The sentinel node biopsy allows the examination of one lymph node to first determine if a tumor has spread to the lymph nodes at all. If the sentinel node is negative for tumor cells, it is not necessary to surgically remove additional lymph nodes. The procedure helps certain patients avoid more extensive surgical procedures involving the removal of multiple lymph nodes, such as axillary lymph node dissection in patients with ''breast cancer''. It means that the patient will not have to experience the side effects of a more extensive lymph node removal procedure, such as lymphedema (swelling) of the arm in patients who have had axillary node dissection. It can be performed in patients undergoing a ''mastectomy'' or ''lumpectomy'' for breast cancer.' "
What are the side effects and complications of a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'The most common side effects are short-term ''bruising'', ''pain'', or swelling at the biopsy site. As with any surgery, bleeding and infection are possible complications. Another possible risk is a false-negative result, which means that tumor cells are present but not detected by the procedure. Studies with breast cancer patients have shown false-negative rates of around 10%.' "
"Is the use of the 
sentinel lymph node biopsy common?","'Yes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has, for example, become a standard technique for determining the nodal stage of the disease in some patients with ''malignant melanoma'' and with breast cancer. The use of sentinel node biopsy is still being investigated with other types of cancer such as ''colon cancer'', stomach cancers, and others.' "
What is the recovery time after a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'The recovery time varies, depending on whether or not the sentinel node biopsy is associated with removal of the primary tumor and the extent of surgery required. In any case, sentinel lymph node biopsy offers a quicker recovery time than a more extensive lymph node dissection.' "
What is a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a specialized procedure to identify, remove, or examine any ''cancer'' cells present in the sentinel ''lymph nodes''. It is usually performed in people diagnosed with melanoma ''cancer''. If melanoma spreads, it will first extend to the nearest lymph node, that is, the sentinel lymph node.''Melanoma first extends to a group of lymph nodes known as the sentinel lymph nodes. Most of the individuals usually have between one and five sentinel lymph nodes.''A positive SLNB indicates that cancer has spread to the sentinel lymph nodes or other nearby lymph nodes. It also helps the physician to determine the exact stage of cancer and develop an appropriate treatment plan for the same.''Enlarged, irregular, firm, and palpable nodes may require a fine needle aspiration biopsy rather than SLNB.'

How is a sentinel lymph node biopsy performed?,"'A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has two parts:''Lymphatic mapping or lymphoscintigram usually involves injecting radioactive dye in the skin around the site of the original melanoma. The physician then with the help of a special camera locates the radioactive material as it travels from the original melanoma site to the sentinel lymph nodes.''After the completion of lymphatic mapping, the physician injects a second blue dye to visualize the lymph nodes already located by the specialized camera. The physician removes the sentinel lymph nodes and sends it for examination.''Another procedure for a biopsy includes wide local excision. In this, the physician removes the melanoma along with the biopsy tissue and some normal tissue surrounding it.' Lymphatic mapping Surgical procedure"
What are the outcomes of a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'After examination of the biopsied tissue, the sentinel lymph node may show evidence of melanoma in them. If the sentinel lymph nodes don’t show any evidence of melanoma, it is improbable that cancer has spread to the remaining lymph nodes, and no further surgery is needed. Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) is the complete removal of the affected sentinel lymph nodes and remaining lymph nodes in that area and is useful if one or more of the sentinel lymph nodes is positive for melanoma.'

What is separation anxiety disorder?,"""To understand separation anxiety disorder, it is important to first recognize the normal difficulty that infants and toddlers have with strangers and in separating from parents and caretakers. Infants show stranger anxiety by crying when someone unfamiliar to them approaches. This normal stage of development is connected with the baby learning to distinguish his or her parents or other familiar caretakers from people they don't know. Stranger anxiety usually starts at about 8 months of age and ends by the time the child is 2 years old, according to the American Academy of ""'Pediatrics''.''Separation anxiety as a normal life stage first develops at about 7 months of age, once a baby understands that his or her caregivers do not disappear when out of sight (object permanence). That leads to the baby developing a true attachment to those adults. Normal separation anxiety is most commonly at its strongest at 10-18 months of age and gradually subsides, usually by the time the child is 3 years old. Normal separation anxiety may result in parents having trouble with their ''babies'' at bedtime or other times of separation, in that the child becomes anxious, cries, or clings to the caretaker.'""In addition to the child's temperament, factors that contribute to how quickly or successfully he or she moves past separation anxiety by preschool age include how well the parent and child reunite, the skills the child and adult have at coping with the separation, and how well the adult responds to the infant's separation issues. For example, children of anxious parents tend to be anxious children.""'Separation anxiety disorder is a mental health disorder that usually begins in childhood and is characterized by worrying that is out of proportion to the situation of temporarily leaving home or otherwise separating from loved ones. Approximately 4%-5% of children and adolescents suffer from separation anxiety disorder.'  "
What are separation anxiety disorder symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of separation anxiety disorder may include''Examples of behavioral symptoms that children may exhibit to express the anxiety, hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal of events that separate them from loved ones include crying, having tantrums, whining, or begging. Examples of physical symptoms that separation anxiety disorder sufferers may have include stomach upset, ''headaches'', and ''diarrhea''. To qualify for the diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, a minimum of three of the above symptoms must persist for at least a month in children and adolescents and at least six months in adults, and cause significant ''stress'"" or problems with school, social relationships, or some other area of the sufferer's life. Also, the disorder is not considered to be present if symptoms only take place when the person is suffering from certain other mental-health problems, such as ""'schizophrenia'' or from a specific kind of developmental disability called pervasive developmental disorder. School refusal, also called school phobia, may be a symptom of separation anxiety disorder, but it can also occur as a symptom of other anxiety disorders and is not a diagnosis by itself.''Social phobia'', also an anxiety disorder, differs from separation anxiety disorder in that social phobia is characterized by severe fear of most, if not all, social situations, not just events that result in separating from primary caregivers. This illness affects about 1% of children and adolescents and up to 5% of adults.'""Individuals with social phobia may be children, teenagers, or adults, and the anxiety may interfere with the person's ability to function. Children with this problem may have difficulty with a number of ordinary activities, such as playing with their peers, talking in class, or speaking to adults.""   repeated excessive anxiety about something bad happening to loved ones or losing them; heightened concern about either getting lost or being kidnapped; repeated hesitancy or refusal to go to day care or school or to be alone or without loved ones or other adults who are important to the anxious child; persistent reluctance or refusal to go to sleep at night without being physically close to adult loved ones; repeated nightmares about being separated from the people who are important to the sufferer; recurrent physical complaints, such as headaches or stomachaches, when separation either occurs or is expected."
What are causes and risk factors for separation anxiety disorder?,"'Separation anxiety disorder (as with most mental-health conditions) is likely caused by the combination of genetic and environmental vulnerabilities rather than by any one thing.''In addition to being more common in children with family histories of anxiety, children whose mothers were stressed during pregnancy with them tend to be more at risk for developing this disorder.''A majority of children with separation anxiety disorder have school refusal as a symptom and up to 80% of children who refuse school qualify for the diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder. Approximately 50%-75% of children who suffer from this disorder come from homes of low socioeconomic status.'  "
How is separation anxiety disorder diagnosed?,"'Health-care professionals who have training and experience understanding symptoms of children and adolescents are usually the most qualified to assess separation anxiety disorder. The assessment most often involves a pediatrician and child psychologist, child psychiatrist, or other mental-health professional interviewing both the child and his or her parent(s) when assessing separation anxiety disorder. Those interviews often take place separately to allow everyone to speak freely. This is particularly important given how differently children and their parents may see the situation and how difficult it can be for children to hear their problems discussed. In addition to asking about specific symptoms of anxiety, the professional will likely explore whether the child has symptoms of any other mental-health issues and will recommend that the child receive a full physical examination and lab work to ensure that there is no medical reason for the issues the child is experiencing.' "
What is the treatment for separation anxiety disorder?,"'Counseling, rather than medication, is the treatment of choice for separation anxiety disorder that is mild in severity. For children who either have not improved with counseling alone, suffer from more severe symptoms, have other emotional problems in addition to separation disorder, treatment should consist of a combination of approaches. ''Psychotherapy'', medication, and parent counseling are three interventions that have been found to be effective for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder, particularly in combination.'""Behavioral modification therapy is an intervention that directly addresses the behavioral symptoms of separation anxiety disorder. This intervention tends to be more effective and less burdensome to the child if behaviors are addressed positively rather than negatively. The child is not usually punished for continuing to suffer from symptoms but rewarded for small victories over symptoms. For example, instead of withholding dessert from a preschooler who refuses to go into her room for bedtime, give hugs and praise for the child when she can go near her room at first, followed by being able to go in and stay for five minutes, increasing the length of time she needs to be in her room before being praised. Even if she needs significant parental support at first (for example, sitting in the room with her on the parent's lap, then next to her, then just outside the room after she becomes comfortable with each step), this approach allows the child to feel a sense of success at every step and build on it rather than experiencing a sense of failure, which tends to lower the child's likelihood of being able to overcome her anxiety. The implementation of behavioral therapy generally involves the practitioner providing ""'parenting'"" tips to the child's caregivers, regular meetings with the child, and may include guidance to teachers on how to help alleviate the child's anxiety.""'Cognitive therapy is used to help children learn how they think and increase their ability to solve problems and focus on the positive things that are going on, even in the midst of their anxiety. By learning to focus on more positive thoughts and feelings, children may become more open to learning strategies to deal with anxiety, such as playing games, coloring, watching television, or listening to music. Although formal relaxation techniques such as imagining themselves in a relaxing situation may be considered more appropriate interventions for older children, adolescents, and adults, even toddlers can be taught simple relaxation techniques, such as imitating their parents, taking deep breaths, or slowly counting to 10 as ways of calming themselves.'""If psychotherapy is unsuccessful or if the children's symptoms are so severe that they are nearly incapacitating, medication is considered a viable option. However, there are no medications specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat separation anxiety disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluvoxamine (""'Luvox'') have been found to be an effective treatment for separation anxiety disorder.''SSRIs are medications that increase the amount of the neurochemical serotonin in the brain. These medications work by selectively inhibiting (blocking) serotonin reuptake in the brain. This block occurs at the synapse, the place where brain cells (neurons) are connected to each other. Serotonin is one of the chemicals in the brain that carries messages across these connections (synapses) from one neuron to another.''The SSRIs work by keeping serotonin present in high concentrations in the synapses. These ''drugs'"" do this by preventing the reuptake of serotonin back into the sending nerve cell. The reuptake of serotonin is responsible for turning off the production of new serotonin. Therefore, the serotonin message keeps on coming through. It is thought that this, in turn, helps arouse (activate) cells that have been deactivated by anxiety, thereby relieving a child's anxiety symptoms.""'SSRIs have fewer side effects than the tricyclic ''antidepressants'' (TCAs). These medications do not tend to cause ''orthostatic hypotension'' (a sudden drop in ''blood pressure'' when sitting up or standing) or ''heart'' rhythm disturbances, like the TCAs. Therefore, SSRIs are often the first-line medication treatment for separation anxiety disorder. Examples of SSRIs include''SSRIs are generally well tolerated, and side effects are usually mild. The most common side effects are ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', agitation, ''insomnia'', and ''headache''. Side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use. Some patients experience ''tremors'' with SSRIs. The ''serotonin syndrome'' (also called serotonergic [caused by serotonin] syndrome) is a serious neurologic condition associated with the use of SSRIs, characterized by high ''fevers'', ''seizures'', and heart rhythm disturbances. There has also been heightened concern that children and adolescents are at increased risk of having the rare reaction of feeling acutely (suddenly and significantly) more anxious or newly ''depressed'', even to the point of wanting, planning, attempting or in extremely rare cases, completing ''suicide'' or homicide. Serotonin syndrome, as well as acute worsening of emotional symptoms, is very rare.'""All people are unique biochemically so the occurrence of side effects or the lack of a satisfactory result with one SSRI does not mean another medication in this group will not be beneficial. However, if someone in the patient's family had a positive response to a particular drug, that drug may be preferable to try first. Medications that are sometimes considered in treating separation anxiety disorder when SSRIs either don't work or are poorly tolerated include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and benzodiazepines. These medications were developed in the 1950s and 1960s to treat ""'depression''. TCAs work mainly by increasing the level of norepinephrine in the brain synapses, although they also may affect serotonin levels. Examples of tricyclic antidepressants include''TCAs are generally safe and well tolerated when properly prescribed and administered. Overdose of TCAs can cause life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances. Rarely, this can occur even if an overdose is not taken. Some TCAs can also have anticholinergic side effects, which are due to the blocking of the activity of the nerves that are responsible for control of the heart rate, gut motion, visual focus, and saliva production. Thus, some TCAs can produce ''dry mouth'', ''blurred vision'', ''constipation'', and ''dizziness'' upon standing. The ''dizziness'' results from ''low blood pressure''. TCAs should also be avoided in patients with ''seizure disorders'' or a history of ''strokes''.''Benzodiazepines tend to be the least-prescribed group of medications to children suffering from separation anxiety disorder. This group of medications is thought to work by increasing the activity of calming chemicals in the brain. Benzodiazepines include ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin''), ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan''), and ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax''). Unfortunately, there is a possible risk of the child becoming dependent on benzodiazepines. These medications tend to only be used as a last resort, when the child has had unsuccessful trials of the other two classes of medications or suffers from incapacitating symptoms of anxiety.'  fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), vortioxetine (Brintellix). amitriptyline (Elavil), desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor), imipramine (Tofranil)."
What happens if separation anxiety disorder is left untreated?,"'Potential complications of separation anxiety disorder include ''depression'' and anxiety problems as adults, as well as personality disorders, in which anxiety is a major symptom. Adults with separation anxiety disorder have a guarded prognosis due to their being at risk of being quite emotionally disabled.' "
Is it possible to prevent separation anxiety disorder?,"'Research indicates that educating parents on ways to help their child cope with anxiety may be helpful in the ''prevention'' of separation anxiety disorder. Specifically, helping parents guide their child through experiences that cause anxiety, as well as developing healthy ways to cope with such experiences, seems to decrease the likelihood of developing any anxiety disorder, including separation anxiety disorder.'

What is sepsis?,"   Sepsis is an illness that affects all parts of the body; it occurs in response to an infection and can become life-threatening. If not treated quickly, organ failure can occur, leading to septic shock, low blood pressure, and eventually, death. Sepsis is a general term that covers all types of infectious processes that can lead to the above symptoms. Many types of bacteria, viruses, and occasionally, fungi and parasites may cause sepsis; for the purpose of this article, the term pathogens will be used to include all of the above-mentioned organisms. Pathogens that cause sepsis usually first cause localized infections such as pneumonia, kidney infections, abdominal infections, sexually transmitted diseases, or septicemia (blood stream infections) that eventually may result in sepsis. The term sepsis is frequently preceded by other terms (for example, MRSA, neonatal, meningococcal, or neutropenic, for example); these terms usually indicate a sepsis subtype that may describe the infecting organism, like ""MRSA sepsis"" or a condition found in a subtype, like ""neutropenic sepsis."""
Is sepsis contagious?,"'Sepsis itself is not ''contagious'', but the pathogens that cause sepsis are usually contagious. What this means is that the pathogens that may cause sepsis can be transferred, usually from person to person, directly or indirectly (by contaminated items like utensils or clothing). If the pathogens are transferred, the person may or may not develop sepsis; consequently, most septic individuals, while capable of transferring pathogens the cause infection, will not necessarily transfer the condition of sepsis. The pathogens that cause sepsis may remain viable for a while after the death of a person; these pathogens are contagious although sepsis is not.' "
How will I know if someone has sepsis?,"'Sepsis is sometimes difficult to diagnose because it shares symptoms from other conditions. However, if a person has any of the following symptoms that are common to individuals with sepsis, he/she or his/her guardians need to contact a physician urgently. If the symptoms are more severe, he or she should go to an emergency department:''There are new definitions of sepsis. A person who meets at least two of the following criteria, plus has confirmed or suspected infection according to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) meets the definition for sepsis:''Consequently, a physician usually determines if a person is septic by physical exam and blood tests; people who are septic require hospitalization and immediate treatment.' Fever and chills Rapid heart rate Rapid breathing Low blood pressure Rash Confusion and/or disorientation Elevated heart rate greater than 90 Body temperature either high (greater than 100.4 F) or low (less than 98.6 F) Respiratory rate of greater than 20 breaths per minute or a reduced partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in arterial blood Abnormal white blood cell count (WBC) greater than 12,000 or less than 4,000 cells/ul or 10% bands (immature white blood cells)"
How does sepsis spread?,"""As stated previously, sepsis is not spread from person to person, although the pathogens that can cause sepsis may be spread among people, both directly and indirectly. However, sepsis spreads within a person's body, usually from a site of infection that is somewhat localized to one organ (for example, ""'pneumonia'' in the ''lungs'' or a ''wound'"" infection in the leg). When the localized infection is severe, the pathogen may reach the bloodstream, and when this happens, the pathogen spreads to other organs; in addition, some of the pathogens may quickly multiply in the blood. When these situations arise, the person's infection has spread internally, and the person is considered to be septic."" "
When will I know I am cured of sepsis?,"'Individuals can be cured of sepsis usually by being hospitalized and treated with IV antimicrobial medications that are effective against the organisms causing the infection. Surgical drainage or removal of the source may also be needed. Depending upon the exact cause of the infection, the duration that the person has been septic, and the severity of involvement of organs, recovery can be relatively quick, lengthy, or if treatment begins late in the septic process, organ damage and/or death may occur.''Sepsis is a serious condition; even patients with no signs of organ failure with a timely diagnosis have a 15%-30% chance of death; those patients with severe sepsis and shock have a ''death rate'' of about 40%-60%.' "
When should I contact a health care provider about sepsis?,"'The best time to contact a health care provider about sepsis is before it occurs. This may sound impossible, but in reality, it is easy to do. If a person has any signs of increasing difficulties or severe symptoms of any infectious disease (for example, pneumonia, ''meningitis'', wound infections, or organ infections, such as kidney infections), he or she should contact a physician or go to an emergency department quickly. Appropriate treatment of infections can reduce the chance of developing sepsis. Alternatively, if a person develops signs and symptoms of SIRS listed above, they should immediately go to an emergency department.''The key to preventing poor outcomes (organ damage, death) of sepsis is early and appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the infecting pathogen.'  "
What is blood poisoning?,"'Blood poisoning is a nonspecific term used mainly by nonmedical individuals that describes, in the broadest sense, any adverse medical condition(s) due to the presence of any toxic agent in the blood. Usually, the layperson using the term ''blood poisoning'' is referring to the medical condition(s) that arise when bacteria or their products (or both) reach the blood. ''Blood poisoning'' is not a medical term and does not appear in many medical dictionaries or scientific publications. However, when it is used, the correct medical term that most closely matches its intended meaning is ''sepsis''. Many medical authors consider the terms blood poisoning and sepsis to be interchangeable, but the trend in the medical literature is to use the term sepsis.'  "
What is sepsis?,"'The newest definition of sepsis has recently been published. In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force (Sepsis-3) defined sepsis as ""life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection."" The new criteria are based on just three symptoms:''Patients who meet the above criteria likely have sepsis and are also termed ''septic''. Blood tests are no longer required for the diagnosis. Essentially, patients who show two of the three criteria listed above are considered likely to be septic according to studies that led to the new criteria as part of the sepsis campaign to simplify and speed sepsis diagnosis. The term QSOFA (quick sequential organ failure assessment) represents a scoring system that gives one point to each of the three symptoms listed above; if the patient score is two or greater, the patient is likely to have sepsis according to the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force. Because sepsis is so serious a problem for the patient that usually requires emergency treatment, the goal of the task force was to simplify the criteria used to determine the likelihood of sepsis in an individual patient quickly.''These criteria may continue to be modified by other medical groups. For example, pediatric groups use somewhat different criteria for children. Other groups want to add other criteria. As stated by the 2016 group that produced the newest definitions, they consider definitions still as ""a work in progress.""''Terms that are often used in place of sepsis are ''bacteremia'', ''septicemia'', and ''blood poisoning''. However, bacteremia means the presence of bacteria in the blood; this can occur without any of the criteria listed above and should not be confused with sepsis. For example, you can brush your ''teeth'' and get bacteremia for a short time and have no SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) criteria occur. Unfortunately, septicemia has had multiple definitions over time; it has been defined as bacteremia, blood poisoning, bacteremia leading to sepsis, sepsis, and other variations. Although septicemia appears frequently in the medical literature, a reader must be sure which definition the author is using. Some experts suggest the terms blood poisoning and septicemia not be used since they are poorly defined, but it is difficult for the medical community to disregard such terms that have been used for many decades for these mainly bacterial disease-related problems.' Altered mental status Fast respiratory rate (> 22 breaths/minute) Low blood pressure (≤ 100 mm Hg systolic)"
What are the stages of sepsis?,"'Some medical researchers consider sepsis to have three stages. The first stage is the least severe and usually has symptoms of ''fever'' and an increased ''heart'' rate. The second stage is more severe and is characterized by symptoms of difficulty ''breathing'' and possible organ malfunctions, while the third is the most severe stage (''septic shock'' or severe sepsis) with life-threatening ''low blood pressure''. Not all researchers agree with these stages; some researchers choose not to consider sepsis in stages.' "
"Why are there so many diseases with ""sepsis,"" ""septic,"" ""septicemia,"" or ""blood poisoning"" in their name?","'Unfortunately, both medical personnel and laypeople have used these terms interchangeably and then linked them to either a particular organism (usually bacterial and often labeled according to the general bacterial type such as gram-negative or -positive) that can cause sepsis, to a site in the body in which an infection originates that leads to sepsis, or to a clinical situation that leads to sepsis as described above. For example, gram-negative meningococcal sepsis, meningococcal septicemia, septic meningitis, and meningococcal blood poisoning can refer to the same entity, an infection of the patient by the bacteria ''Neisseria meningitidis'' that has spread from the meninges (brain membranes) to the bloodstream, resulting in the patient having at least two of the four criteria outlined above for sepsis. Common examples of a clinical situation used in the same way are puerperal sepsis, puerperal septicemia, puerperal or ''childbirth'' blood poisoning, and maternal septicemia postpartum. All four terms represent infection that occurs during the puerperium (time around the ''delivery of a baby'') that leads to sepsis criteria for the patient. The infectious agent is not described when the body site or situation is linked to ""sepsis"" or the other terms. The following is a short partial list of both organism and organ system (and organ-related) terms that are seen in both the lay and medical literature:''There are many more examples of linking terms to sepsis (for example, ''AIDS'', ''tattoo'', ''spider bite''). Occasionally, terms like ''hemorrhagic septicemia'' are used to describe a symptom (''internal bleeding'') or a sign like neutropenic cells (low number of white blood cells) that may occur with sepsis. The trend in medicine currently is to decrease the use of the terms septicemia and blood poisoning in favor of the terms sepsis or septic, because sepsis is defined most concisely.' MRSA sepsis: sepsis caused by methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus bacteria VRE sepsis: sepsis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species of bacteria Urosepsis: sepsis originating from a urinary tract infection (UTI) Wound sepsis: sepsis originating from an infection of a wound Neonatal sepsis or septicemia: sepsis seen in newborns, usually in the first four weeks after birth; sepsis neonatorum means the same as neonatal sepsis Septic abortion: an abortion due to infection with sepsis in the mother"
What causes sepsis?,"'The majority of cases of sepsis are due to ''bacterial infections'', some are due to ''fungal infections'', and very few are due to other causes of infection or agents that may cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The infectious agents, usually bacteria, begin infecting almost any organ from any location (community-acquired or hospital-acquired) or implanted device (for example, skin, lung [''pneumonia''], gastrointestinal tract [bacterial penetration or ruptured intestine from ''trauma''], surgical site, intravenous catheter, etc.). The infecting agents or their toxins (or both) then spread directly or indirectly into the bloodstream. This allows them to spread to almost any other organ system. Criteria result as the body tries to counteract the damage done by these blood-borne agents.''Common bacterial causes of sepsis are gram-negative bacilli (for example, ''E. coli'', ''P. aeruginosa'', ''E. corrodens'', and ''Haemophilus influenzae'' in neonates). Other bacteria also causing sepsis are ''S. aureus'', ''Streptococcus'' species, ''Enterococcus'' species and ''Neisseria''; however, there are large numbers of bacterial genera that have been known to cause sepsis. ''Candida'' species are some of the most frequent fungi that cause sepsis.'  "
Is sepsis contagious? How long is the incubation and/or contagious period for sepsis?,"""In general, a person with sepsis can be contagious (for infectious causes like bacteria and fungi, for example), depending on the aggressiveness of the infecting organism, so precautions such as hand washing, sterile gloves, masks, and clothing coverage should be considered depending on the patient's infection source. However, most researchers suggest sepsis itself is not contagious but is a condition that can develop after one of many types of infectious agents invade the bloodstream. An incubation and/or contagious period cannot be assigned to sepsis itself; the particular organisms that may lead to the development of sepsis have their own individual incubation and contagious periods that vary depending on the organism."" "
What are the risk factors for sepsis?,"'The following groups are at increased risk for sepsis:' The very young and the elderly are at greatest risk People who are very ill due to an infectious agent People in an intensive care unit People with weakened immune systems People with pre-existing medical conditions People with devices such as IV catheters, breathing tubes, or other devices People with extensive burns People with severe trauma"
What are sepsis (blood poisoning) symptoms? What are the signs of sepsis?,"'The adult patient should have a proven or suspected source of an infection (usually bacterial) and have at least two of the following problems to be diagnosed as having sepsis:''However, patients may have many other signs and symptoms that can occur with sepsis, such as''In most cases, it is fairly easy to ascertain heart rate (count pulse per minute), fever, or hypothermia with a thermometer, and to count breaths per minute even at home. It may be more difficult to prove a source of infection, but if the person has symptoms of infection such as productive ''cough'', ''dysuria'', ''fevers'', or a wound with pus, it is fairly easy to suspect that a person with an infection may have sepsis. However, determination of the white blood cell count PaCO''2'' (carbon dioxide levels in the blood) and acidosis (measurement of low blood pH) is usually done by a lab. In most cases, the definitive diagnosis of sepsis is made by a physician in conjunction with laboratory tests.''Elderly patients have similar symptoms to those stated for adults, but the first apparent symptoms are often confusion along with chills, ''weakness'', possibly faster breathing, and a dusky skin appearance. Pediatric patients (infants, toddlers, and children) also may develop similar symptoms to those in adults, but the most common symptoms are fever and reduced urine output. Children may show signs of lethargy and decreased age-appropriate mental status. Neonatal sepsis (sepsis neonatorum) is suspected in neonates up to 28 days old if the rectal temperature is 100.4 F or higher. Other signs and symptoms for neonatal sepsis include fever in the mother (possible puerperal sepsis due to infection in her reproductive tract) at time of delivery, cloudy or smelly ''amniotic fluid'', abnormal vital signs, ''seizures'', and projectile ''vomiting''.''Some authors consider red lines or ''red streaks on the skin'' to be signs of sepsis. However, these streaks are due to local inflammatory changes in either local blood vessels or lymphatic vessels (lymphangitis). The red streaks or lines are worrisome as they usually indicate a spreading infection that can result in sepsis.''Septic shock is a condition in which overwhelming infection causes a dangerous drop in systolic blood pressure (''hypotension''). Additional symptoms that may accompany the low blood pressure associated with septic shock may include cool and pale extremities, ''dizziness'' or ''lightheadedness'', low or absent urine output, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, behavioral changes, and low or high body temperature.'   Altered mental status (for example, altered consciousness, mental confusion or delirium) Fast respiratory rate (> 22 breaths/minute) Low blood pressure (≤ 100 mm Hg systolic) elevated heart rate (tachycardia), fever, low body temperature (hypothermia), a reduced carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level in the blood, chills, dizziness, fatigue, shivering, facial flushing, shortness of breath, low urine production, skin discoloration, dysfunction of one or more organs, shock, and sleepiness."
What types of health care professionals specialize in the treatment of sepsis?,"""Often, the first health care professionals to treat the patient with sepsis are the patient's primary care physician or pediatrician, often immediately followed by a specialist in ""'emergency medicine'"". Almost all patients diagnosed with sepsis are treated in the hospital; there are no home remedies for sepsis. Hospitalists, critical care medicine physicians, and pulmonary specialists, infectious disease specialists, and occasionally a toxicologist or a surgeon may need to be consulted, depending upon the patient's condition and underlying medical cause of the sepsis."" "
How do health care professionals make a sepsis diagnosis? What are sepsis criteria?,"'Clinically, the patient needs to fit at least two of the diagnostic criteria listed above and have a suspected or proven infection. This is a screening tool to help health care professionals presumptively diagnose sepsis early in the disease process. Definitive diagnosis depends on a positive blood culture for an infectious agent and at least two of the criteria. However, other helpful tests depend on lab analysis such as white blood cell examinations, procalcitonin levels, and PaCO''2''. These tests, like blood cultures, are measured in clinical laboratories. Researchers are currently investigating other blood tests to diagnose early sepsis. In addition, other underlying causes for sepsis are often established by using CT imaging studies, ''MRI'', ''ultrasound'', and chest ''X-rays'"". Sometimes it's difficult to differentiate between underlying causes of sepsis and other emergency medical problems. Consequently, it is not unusual to run cardiac studies to rule out ""'heart disease'' on patients that may also have sepsis since some of the symptoms are similar.''In 2017, the U.S. FDA approved a diagnostic test that can aid the diagnosis of sepsis and, in the same test, identify many of the common bacterial causes and their susceptibility to antibiotics about an average of 42 hours faster than current tests. The blood test, Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit, made by Accelerate Diagnostic, may allow a more rapid and specific diagnosis and provide information about treatment options (antimicrobial ''drugs'') to treat the causative agent(s) of sepsis early and more effectively. The test can identify the genus and species of common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections that can lead to sepsis, show their sensitivity or resistance to several antibiotics, and can identify sepsis caused by ''Candida'' fungal species.'""There are other diagnostic findings that indicate the severity of the patient's sepsis. Severe sepsis is diagnosed when the septic patient has organ dysfunction (for example, low or no urine flow, altered mental status). Severe sepsis can also include sepsis-induced ""'hypotension'"" (also termed septic shock) when the patient's blood pressure falls, resulting in decreased blood flow."" "
What is the treatment for sepsis?,"'In almost every case of sepsis, patients need to be hospitalized, treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics (usually broad-spectrum), and given therapy to support any organ dysfunction. Sepsis can quickly cause organ damage and death; therapy should not be delayed as statistics suggest as high as a 7% mortality increase per hour if antibiotics are delayed in severe sepsis. Most cases of sepsis are treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital by critical care medicine specialists, infectious disease specialists, and others as needed.''Appropriate antibiotics to treat sepsis are combinations of two or three antibiotics given at the same time; most combinations usually include vancomycin to treat many ''MRSA'' and other antibiotic-resistant (drug-resistant) infections. Some of the commonly used antibiotics used are''However, once the infecting organism is isolated, labs can determine which antibiotics are most effective against the organisms, and those antibiotics should be used to treat the patient. In addition to antibiotics, two other major therapeutic interventions, organ-system support and surgery, may be needed. First, if an organ system needs support, the intensive care unit can often provide it (for example, ''intubation'' [mechanical ventilation] to support lung function or ''dialysis'"" to support kidney function) or a central venous catheter and fluid replacement with intravenous fluids and/or antihypotensive medication to raise blood pressure (norepinephrine [Levophed] or phenylephrine [Neo-Synephrine] administered by IV). Secondly, surgery may be needed to drain or remove the source of infection.

What is the prognosis with sepsis?,"""The prognosis of patients with sepsis is related to the severity or stage of sepsis as well as to the underlying health status of the patient. For example, patients with sepsis and no ongoing sign of organ failure at the time of diagnosis have about a 15%-30% chance of death. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock have a mortality (death) rate of about 40%-60%, with the elderly having the highest mortality rates. Newborns and pediatric patients with sepsis have about a 9%-36% mortality rate. Investigators have developed a scoring system (MEDS score) based on the patient's symptoms to estimate prognosis."" "
What are the complications of sepsis?,"'There are a large number of complications that may occur with sepsis. The complications are related to the type of initial infection (for example, in lung infection [''pneumonia''] with sepsis, a potential complication could be a need for respiratory support) and the severity of sepsis (for example, septic shock related to a limb infection that could require limb amputation). Consequently, each patient is likely to have the potential for complications related to the source of sepsis; in general, the complications are due to organ dysfunction, damage, or loss. Thus, some complications may cause long-term and life-changing problems. Death is usually due to multiorgan dysfunction (''liver'', kidney, or lung failure).''Physicians agree that the faster the patient with sepsis is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis and fewer complications, if any, for the patient.' "
Is it possible to prevent sepsis (blood poisoning)?,"'Risk factors that lead to sepsis can be reduced by many methods. Perhaps the most important way to reduce the chance for sepsis is to first prevent any infections. ''Vaccines'', good hygiene, hand washing, and avoiding sources of infection are excellent preventive methods. If infection occurs, immediate treatment of any infection before it has a chance to spread into the blood is likely to prevent sepsis. This is especially important in patients who are at greater risk for infection such as those who have suppressed immune systems, those with ''cancer'', people with ''diabetes'', or elderly patients.'

Facts you should know about septic arthritis (infectious arthritis)," Septic arthritis is infection of one or more joints by microorganisms. Septic arthritis can be caused by fungal, viral, and bacterial infections. Risks for the development of septic arthritis include a patient taking immune-suppression medicines, intravenous drug abuse, past joint disease, injury or surgery, and underlying medical illnesses, including diabetes, alcoholism, sickle cell disease, rheumatic diseases, and immune deficiency disorders. With septic arthritis, patients may experience symptoms and signs that includefever,chills, as well asjoint pain,swelling,redness,stiffness, andwarmth. fever, chills, as well as joint pain, swelling, redness, stiffness, and warmth. By identifying infected joint fluid, doctors may make a diagnosis of this type of arthritis. Septic arthritis treatment requires a patient to take antibiotics and a health care professional to drain the infected joint fluid from the joint."
What is septic arthritis?,"""Septic, or infectious, arthritis is infection of one or more joints by microorganisms. Normally, the joint is lubricated with a small amount of fluid that is referred to as synovial fluid or joint fluid. The normal joint fluid is sterile and, if removed and cultured in the laboratory, no microbes will be detected. With this form of arthritis, microbes are identifiable in an affected joint's fluid.""'Most commonly, infectious arthritis affects a single joint, but occasionally more joints are involved. The joints affected vary somewhat depending on the microbe causing the infection and the predisposing risk factors of the patient affected. Septic arthritis is also called infectious arthritis.'  "
What microbes cause septic arthritis?,"'Septic arthritis can be caused by bacteria, ''viruses'', and fungi. The most common causes of septic arthritis are bacterial, including ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (''staph'') and ''Haemophilus influenzae''. In certain ""high-risk"" individuals, other bacteria may cause septic arthritis, such as ''E. coli'' and ''Pseudomonas'' spp.'' in intravenous drug abusers and the elderly, ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' in sexually active young adults, and ''Salmonella'' spp.'' in young children or in people with sickle cell disease. Other bacteria that can cause septic arthritis include ''Mycobacterium ''tuberculosis'' and the spirochete bacterium that causes ''Lyme disease''.''Viruses that can cause septic arthritis include ''hepatitis A'', B, and C, parvovirus B19, ''herpes'' viruses, ''HIV'' (''AIDS'' virus), HTLV-1, ''adenovirus'', Coxsackieviruses, ''mumps'', and ''Ebola''. Fungi that can cause septic arthritis include ''Histoplasma'', ''Coccidioides'', and ''Blastomyces''.' "
Is septic arthritis contagious?,"'Septic arthritis is not ''contagious''. However, many of the microbes that cause infectious arthritis can be transmitted from an infected patient to another, including ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'', ''Staphylococcus'' aureus'', ''Mycobacterium ''tuberculosis'', and ''HIV''.' "
Who is at risk of developing septic arthritis?,"'While joint infection occasionally affects people with no known predisposing risk factors, it more commonly occurs when certain risk situations are present. Risks for the development of septic arthritis include taking medications that suppress the immune system, intravenous ''drug abuse'', past joint disease, injury, or surgery, and underlying medical conditions and diseases including ''diabetes'', alcoholism, sickle cell disease, rheumatic diseases (for example, ''rheumatoid arthritis''), and immune deficiency disorders. People with any of these conditions who develop symptoms of septic arthritis should promptly seek medical attention.' "
What are symptoms and signs of septic arthritis?,"'Clinical symptoms of septic arthritis include ''fever'', chills, as well as joint ''pain'', swelling, redness, stiffness, and warmth. Joint ''pain'' most commonly affects large joints, such as the knees, ankles, hips, and elbows. In patients with risk factors for joint infection, unusual joints can be infected, including the joint where the collarbone (clavicle) meets the breastbone (sternum). With uncommon microbes, such as ''Brucella spp.'', atypical joints can be infected, such as the sacroiliac joints.'  "
Which health care professionals specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis?,"'Septic arthritis is a medical emergency. Doctors who treat septic arthritis include emergency physicians, internists, ''rheumatologists'', orthopedists, infectious disease physicians, and rehabilitation-medicine providers.' "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of septic arthritis?,"'Health care professionals make a diagnosis of septic arthritis by identifying infected joint fluid. During an ''arthrocentesis'' (''joint aspiration''), synovial fluid can easily be removed from the joint space of a patient in an office, hospital, or clinical setting with a needle and syringe. The synovial fluid is analyzed in a laboratory to determine if there is an elevated number of white blood cells to suggest inflammation. A culture of the synovial fluid can identify the particular microbe and determine its susceptibility to a variety of antibiotics.''X-ray studies of the joint can be helpful to detect injury of bone adjacent to the joint. ''MRI'' scanning is very sensitive in evaluating joint destruction. Blood tests are frequently used to detect and monitor inflammation. These tests include the white blood cell count, ''sedimentation rate'', and ''C-reactive protein''.'  "
What is the treatment for septic arthritis?,"'Treatment of septic arthritis includes antibiotic therapy and drainage of the infected joint (synovial) fluid from the joint (arthrocentesis).''Optimally, antibiotics are given immediately. Often, health care professionals administer intravenous antibiotics in a hospital setting. The choice of antibiotics can be guided by the results of the culture of joint fluid. Until those results are known, empiric antibiotics are chosen to cover a wider range of possible infectious agents. Sometimes, combinations of antibiotics are given. Antibiotics may be required for four to six weeks.''Drainage is essential for rapid clearing of the infection. Drainage of a joint effusion can be done by regular aspirations with a needle and syringe, often daily early on, or via surgical procedures. ''Arthroscopy'' can be used to irrigate the joint and remove infected joint lining tissue. If adequate drainage cannot be accomplished with joint aspirations or arthroscopy, open joint surgery is used to drain the joint. After arthroscopy or open joint surgery, drains are sometimes left in place to drain excess fluid that can accumulate after the procedure.'  "
Are there home remedies for septic arthritis?,'No. Septic arthritis is a medical emergency and requires acute treatment by an appropriate medical team.' 
What are complications of septic arthritis?,"'Rapid clearing of the infection is critical to preserve the joint. If appropriate antibiotics are begun immediately, joint integrity can be maintained, and return to function is expected. If the infection has been longstanding, the possibility of joint destruction exists. The keys to successful outcome are rapid medical attention and drainage and the accurate administration of antibiotics to which the offending microbes are susceptible.' "
What is the prognosis of septic arthritis?,"'The outlook for septic arthritis depends on the precise microbe causing the infection, the duration of the infection, and the underlying overall health of the individual infected. Some types of microorganisms are more aggressive and difficult to treat than others. The longer the infection is present, the more opportunity for damage to affect the joint. People whose immune systems are not functioning optimally are also at risk for more joint damage. Moreover, if septic arthritis leads to infection in other parts of the body, other organs can be affected.' "
Is it possible to prevent septic arthritis?,"'It is possible to prevent septic arthritis by avoiding infections, ''puncture wounds'', and damage to the skin.' "
What is septic shock?,"'The definition of septic shock is ever changing as the medical community learns more about how the body fails in the face of overwhelming infection. The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine agreed upon the most recent definitions in 2017.''Sepsis'"" is a life-threatening bacterial infection that causes a generalized inflammatory response in the body that affects the immune system and causes it to not respond properly to the infection. This may result in the failure of the body's organs.""'The formal definition of sepsis: ""life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection."" The SOFA score (sequential sepsis related organ failure assessment -- a scoring system to assess and track a patients severity of sepsis) needs to be 2 or more.''Septic shock'' is a worsening of sepsis and ''hypotension'' (''low blood pressure'"") requiring medications (vasopressors) to increase blood pressure into the normal range and elevated lactate levels in the blood (lactate is a measure of waste products on the blood) define it. Vasopressors are intravenous medications that are continuously infused that increase blood pressure by narrowing arteries and increasing the heart's pumping capabilities.""'The formal definition of septic shock: ""circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. These patients can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a MAP ≥ 65mmHg and serum lactate >2mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia.""''SOFA criteria assign points for blood pressure, ''platelet count'', lung function (oxygen levels in the blood), brain function (Glasgow ''Coma'' Scale), and liver and kidney function.''The quick SOFA score (qSOFA) measures blood pressure, respiratory rate, and Glasgow ''Coma'' Scale).''Doctors do not understand the exact mechanism as to why sepsis and septic shock occur.' "
What are the causes and risk factors of septic shock?,"'Bacterial infections'' that invade the body and overwhelm the immune system cause sepsis and septic shock.''Most commonly, the initial infection arises in the lung (''pneumonia''), kidneys (''urinary tract infection''), or abdomen (GI=gastrointestinal) tract.''Less commonly, infections may begin in the skin (''cellulitis'' or ''abscess''), central nervous system (meningitis), and bone (''osteomyelitis'').''Risk factors for developing septic shock include the following:' Patients at extremes of age, including the elderly and the very young Those with underlying medical illnesses like diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease, or cancer Patients with immune compromise: This may include those on chemotherapy or other medications that affect the body's ability to fight infection. IV drug users Delay in making the diagnosis of an infection Delay in starting antibiotic treatment increases the risk of developing sepsis"
What are septic shock symptoms and signs?,"'Patients in septic shock are critically ill. In addition to the signs and symptoms of the underlying infection, they may also have'  low blood pressure, rapid heart rate,  increased breathing rate, fever, shakes, chills (Some very ill patients may be cold and no longer able to mount a fever response to infection.), confusion, lethargy, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting."
How do doctors diagnose septic shock?,"'An initial diagnosis begins with the care provider taking a history and performing a physical exam to try to find the source of the infection. Because these patients are critically ill and unstable, the history and physical often occur at the same time as medical professionals take blood tests and ''X-rays'', and start the patient on intravenous fluids.''Initial blood tests may include a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), chemistries to look at ''electrolyte'' levels, kidney and ''liver function'', coagulation tests, and blood lactate levels.''Searching for the source of infection may include getting a urine sample and ''chest X-ray''. Other X-rays and ''CT scans'' will depend upon where the search for the source of infection takes the provider and patient.''Medical professionals perform blood cultures and urine cultures to try and identify the type of bacteria causing the infection.''Your doctor may perform a ''lumbar puncture'' to obtain a sample of cerebral spinal fluid if there is concern for meningitis or ''encephalitis''. Medical professionals will then culture the cerebral spinal fluid.' "
What are treatments for septic shock?,"'The initial treatment for septic shock incorporates the ABCs of resuscitation (''airway'', breathing, circulation). Patients in septic shock need to be admitted to an intensive care unit for treatment. This may include intubating the patient and using a ventilator to help with breathing.''Intravenous fluids support blood pressure. By definition, for it to be septic shock, a vasopressor medication (for example, ''dopamine'', dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine) also needs to be required to help elevated blood pressure.''Early intravenous antibiotics are important to fight the underlying infection and empiric broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is recommended. Even if the source of infection is known, the type of bacteria, and how susceptible it might be to a specific antibiotic is not. For that reason, your doctor will start you on multiple antibiotics, and as test results return, only those antibiotics that work against a specific infection will be continued.''The cause of the original infection, as well as what organs are failing, will determine other treatment options.' "
What are the complications of septic shock?,"'By definition, septic shock requires that various organs in the body fail to work. These include the heart, ''lungs'', liver, and kidneys among others. If the infection cannot be controlled and treated, at the same as vital signs are being restored (circulation and breathing), the patient may die.' "
What is the prognosis and mortality rate for septic shock?,"'Septic shock is a catastrophic worsening of sepsis. The prognosis is dire, even with the best of intensive care, with mortality rates approaching 50%. With early diagnosis and aggressive treatment, mortality rates may be closer to 10%.' "
What is blood poisoning?,"'Blood poisoning is a nonspecific term used mainly by nonmedical individuals that describes, in the broadest sense, any adverse medical condition(s) due to the presence of any toxic agent in the blood. Usually, the layperson using the term ''blood poisoning'' is referring to the medical condition(s) that arise when bacteria or their products (or both) reach the blood. ''Blood poisoning'' is not a medical term and does not appear in many medical dictionaries or scientific publications. However, when it is used, the correct medical term that most closely matches its intended meaning is ''sepsis''. Many medical authors consider the terms blood poisoning and sepsis to be interchangeable, but the trend in the medical literature is to use the term sepsis.'  "
What is sepsis?,"'The newest definition of sepsis has recently been published. In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force (Sepsis-3) defined sepsis as ""life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection."" The new criteria are based on just three symptoms:''Patients who meet the above criteria likely have sepsis and are also termed ''septic''. Blood tests are no longer required for the diagnosis. Essentially, patients who show two of the three criteria listed above are considered likely to be septic according to studies that led to the new criteria as part of the sepsis campaign to simplify and speed sepsis diagnosis. The term QSOFA (quick sequential organ failure assessment) represents a scoring system that gives one point to each of the three symptoms listed above; if the patient score is two or greater, the patient is likely to have sepsis according to the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force. Because sepsis is so serious a problem for the patient that usually requires emergency treatment, the goal of the task force was to simplify the criteria used to determine the likelihood of sepsis in an individual patient quickly.''These criteria may continue to be modified by other medical groups. For example, pediatric groups use somewhat different criteria for children. Other groups want to add other criteria. As stated by the 2016 group that produced the newest definitions, they consider definitions still as ""a work in progress.""''Terms that are often used in place of sepsis are ''bacteremia'', ''septicemia'', and ''blood poisoning''. However, bacteremia means the presence of bacteria in the blood; this can occur without any of the criteria listed above and should not be confused with sepsis. For example, you can brush your ''teeth'' and get bacteremia for a short time and have no SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) criteria occur. Unfortunately, septicemia has had multiple definitions over time; it has been defined as bacteremia, blood poisoning, bacteremia leading to sepsis, sepsis, and other variations. Although septicemia appears frequently in the medical literature, a reader must be sure which definition the author is using. Some experts suggest the terms blood poisoning and septicemia not be used since they are poorly defined, but it is difficult for the medical community to disregard such terms that have been used for many decades for these mainly bacterial disease-related problems.' Altered mental status Fast respiratory rate (> 22 breaths/minute) Low blood pressure (≤ 100 mm Hg systolic)"
What are the stages of sepsis?,"'Some medical researchers consider sepsis to have three stages. The first stage is the least severe and usually has symptoms of ''fever'' and an increased ''heart'' rate. The second stage is more severe and is characterized by symptoms of difficulty ''breathing'' and possible organ malfunctions, while the third is the most severe stage (''septic shock'' or severe sepsis) with life-threatening ''low blood pressure''. Not all researchers agree with these stages; some researchers choose not to consider sepsis in stages.' "
"Why are there so many diseases with ""sepsis,"" ""septic,"" ""septicemia,"" or ""blood poisoning"" in their name?","'Unfortunately, both medical personnel and laypeople have used these terms interchangeably and then linked them to either a particular organism (usually bacterial and often labeled according to the general bacterial type such as gram-negative or -positive) that can cause sepsis, to a site in the body in which an infection originates that leads to sepsis, or to a clinical situation that leads to sepsis as described above. For example, gram-negative meningococcal sepsis, meningococcal septicemia, septic meningitis, and meningococcal blood poisoning can refer to the same entity, an infection of the patient by the bacteria ''Neisseria meningitidis'' that has spread from the meninges (brain membranes) to the bloodstream, resulting in the patient having at least two of the four criteria outlined above for sepsis. Common examples of a clinical situation used in the same way are puerperal sepsis, puerperal septicemia, puerperal or ''childbirth'' blood poisoning, and maternal septicemia postpartum. All four terms represent infection that occurs during the puerperium (time around the ''delivery of a baby'') that leads to sepsis criteria for the patient. The infectious agent is not described when the body site or situation is linked to ""sepsis"" or the other terms. The following is a short partial list of both organism and organ system (and organ-related) terms that are seen in both the lay and medical literature:''There are many more examples of linking terms to sepsis (for example, ''AIDS'', ''tattoo'', ''spider bite''). Occasionally, terms like ''hemorrhagic septicemia'' are used to describe a symptom (''internal bleeding'') or a sign like neutropenic cells (low number of white blood cells) that may occur with sepsis. The trend in medicine currently is to decrease the use of the terms septicemia and blood poisoning in favor of the terms sepsis or septic, because sepsis is defined most concisely.' MRSA sepsis: sepsis caused by methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus bacteria VRE sepsis: sepsis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species of bacteria Urosepsis: sepsis originating from a urinary tract infection (UTI) Wound sepsis: sepsis originating from an infection of a wound Neonatal sepsis or septicemia: sepsis seen in newborns, usually in the first four weeks after birth; sepsis neonatorum means the same as neonatal sepsis Septic abortion: an abortion due to infection with sepsis in the mother"
What causes sepsis?,"'The majority of cases of sepsis are due to ''bacterial infections'', some are due to ''fungal infections'', and very few are due to other causes of infection or agents that may cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The infectious agents, usually bacteria, begin infecting almost any organ from any location (community-acquired or hospital-acquired) or implanted device (for example, skin, lung [''pneumonia''], gastrointestinal tract [bacterial penetration or ruptured intestine from ''trauma''], surgical site, intravenous catheter, etc.). The infecting agents or their toxins (or both) then spread directly or indirectly into the bloodstream. This allows them to spread to almost any other organ system. Criteria result as the body tries to counteract the damage done by these blood-borne agents.''Common bacterial causes of sepsis are gram-negative bacilli (for example, ''E. coli'', ''P. aeruginosa'', ''E. corrodens'', and ''Haemophilus influenzae'' in neonates). Other bacteria also causing sepsis are ''S. aureus'', ''Streptococcus'' species, ''Enterococcus'' species and ''Neisseria''; however, there are large numbers of bacterial genera that have been known to cause sepsis. ''Candida'' species are some of the most frequent fungi that cause sepsis.'  "
Is sepsis contagious? How long is the incubation and/or contagious period for sepsis?,"""In general, a person with sepsis can be contagious (for infectious causes like bacteria and fungi, for example), depending on the aggressiveness of the infecting organism, so precautions such as hand washing, sterile gloves, masks, and clothing coverage should be considered depending on the patient's infection source. However, most researchers suggest sepsis itself is not contagious but is a condition that can develop after one of many types of infectious agents invade the bloodstream. An incubation and/or contagious period cannot be assigned to sepsis itself; the particular organisms that may lead to the development of sepsis have their own individual incubation and contagious periods that vary depending on the organism."" "
What are the risk factors for sepsis?,"'The following groups are at increased risk for sepsis:' The very young and the elderly are at greatest risk People who are very ill due to an infectious agent People in an intensive care unit People with weakened immune systems People with pre-existing medical conditions People with devices such as IV catheters, breathing tubes, or other devices People with extensive burns People with severe trauma"
What are sepsis (blood poisoning) symptoms? What are the signs of sepsis?,"'The adult patient should have a proven or suspected source of an infection (usually bacterial) and have at least two of the following problems to be diagnosed as having sepsis:''However, patients may have many other signs and symptoms that can occur with sepsis, such as''In most cases, it is fairly easy to ascertain heart rate (count pulse per minute), fever, or hypothermia with a thermometer, and to count breaths per minute even at home. It may be more difficult to prove a source of infection, but if the person has symptoms of infection such as productive ''cough'', ''dysuria'', ''fevers'', or a wound with pus, it is fairly easy to suspect that a person with an infection may have sepsis. However, determination of the white blood cell count PaCO''2'' (carbon dioxide levels in the blood) and acidosis (measurement of low blood pH) is usually done by a lab. In most cases, the definitive diagnosis of sepsis is made by a physician in conjunction with laboratory tests.''Elderly patients have similar symptoms to those stated for adults, but the first apparent symptoms are often confusion along with chills, ''weakness'', possibly faster breathing, and a dusky skin appearance. Pediatric patients (infants, toddlers, and children) also may develop similar symptoms to those in adults, but the most common symptoms are fever and reduced urine output. Children may show signs of lethargy and decreased age-appropriate mental status. Neonatal sepsis (sepsis neonatorum) is suspected in neonates up to 28 days old if the rectal temperature is 100.4 F or higher. Other signs and symptoms for neonatal sepsis include fever in the mother (possible puerperal sepsis due to infection in her reproductive tract) at time of delivery, cloudy or smelly ''amniotic fluid'', abnormal vital signs, ''seizures'', and projectile ''vomiting''.''Some authors consider red lines or ''red streaks on the skin'' to be signs of sepsis. However, these streaks are due to local inflammatory changes in either local blood vessels or lymphatic vessels (lymphangitis). The red streaks or lines are worrisome as they usually indicate a spreading infection that can result in sepsis.''Septic shock is a condition in which overwhelming infection causes a dangerous drop in systolic blood pressure (''hypotension''). Additional symptoms that may accompany the low blood pressure associated with septic shock may include cool and pale extremities, ''dizziness'' or ''lightheadedness'', low or absent urine output, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, behavioral changes, and low or high body temperature.'   Altered mental status (for example, altered consciousness, mental confusion or delirium) Fast respiratory rate (> 22 breaths/minute) Low blood pressure (≤ 100 mm Hg systolic) elevated heart rate (tachycardia), fever, low body temperature (hypothermia), a reduced carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level in the blood, chills, dizziness, fatigue, shivering, facial flushing, shortness of breath, low urine production, skin discoloration, dysfunction of one or more organs, shock, and sleepiness."
What types of health care professionals specialize in the treatment of sepsis?,"""Often, the first health care professionals to treat the patient with sepsis are the patient's primary care physician or pediatrician, often immediately followed by a specialist in ""'emergency medicine'"". Almost all patients diagnosed with sepsis are treated in the hospital; there are no home remedies for sepsis. Hospitalists, critical care medicine physicians, and pulmonary specialists, infectious disease specialists, and occasionally a toxicologist or a surgeon may need to be consulted, depending upon the patient's condition and underlying medical cause of the sepsis."" "
How do health care professionals make a sepsis diagnosis? What are sepsis criteria?,"'Clinically, the patient needs to fit at least two of the diagnostic criteria listed above and have a suspected or proven infection. This is a screening tool to help health care professionals presumptively diagnose sepsis early in the disease process. Definitive diagnosis depends on a positive blood culture for an infectious agent and at least two of the criteria. However, other helpful tests depend on lab analysis such as white blood cell examinations, procalcitonin levels, and PaCO''2''. These tests, like blood cultures, are measured in clinical laboratories. Researchers are currently investigating other blood tests to diagnose early sepsis. In addition, other underlying causes for sepsis are often established by using CT imaging studies, ''MRI'', ''ultrasound'', and chest ''X-rays'"". Sometimes it's difficult to differentiate between underlying causes of sepsis and other emergency medical problems. Consequently, it is not unusual to run cardiac studies to rule out ""'heart disease'' on patients that may also have sepsis since some of the symptoms are similar.''In 2017, the U.S. FDA approved a diagnostic test that can aid the diagnosis of sepsis and, in the same test, identify many of the common bacterial causes and their susceptibility to antibiotics about an average of 42 hours faster than current tests. The blood test, Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit, made by Accelerate Diagnostic, may allow a more rapid and specific diagnosis and provide information about treatment options (antimicrobial ''drugs'') to treat the causative agent(s) of sepsis early and more effectively. The test can identify the genus and species of common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections that can lead to sepsis, show their sensitivity or resistance to several antibiotics, and can identify sepsis caused by ''Candida'' fungal species.'""There are other diagnostic findings that indicate the severity of the patient's sepsis. Severe sepsis is diagnosed when the septic patient has organ dysfunction (for example, low or no urine flow, altered mental status). Severe sepsis can also include sepsis-induced ""'hypotension'"" (also termed septic shock) when the patient's blood pressure falls, resulting in decreased blood flow."" "
What is the treatment for sepsis?,"'In almost every case of sepsis, patients need to be hospitalized, treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics (usually broad-spectrum), and given therapy to support any organ dysfunction. Sepsis can quickly cause organ damage and death; therapy should not be delayed as statistics suggest as high as a 7% mortality increase per hour if antibiotics are delayed in severe sepsis. Most cases of sepsis are treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital by critical care medicine specialists, infectious disease specialists, and others as needed.''Appropriate antibiotics to treat sepsis are combinations of two or three antibiotics given at the same time; most combinations usually include vancomycin to treat many ''MRSA'' and other antibiotic-resistant (drug-resistant) infections. Some of the commonly used antibiotics used are''However, once the infecting organism is isolated, labs can determine which antibiotics are most effective against the organisms, and those antibiotics should be used to treat the patient. In addition to antibiotics, two other major therapeutic interventions, organ-system support and surgery, may be needed. First, if an organ system needs support, the intensive care unit can often provide it (for example, ''intubation'' [mechanical ventilation] to support lung function or ''dialysis'"" to support kidney function) or a central venous catheter and fluid replacement with intravenous fluids and/or antihypotensive medication to raise blood pressure (norepinephrine [Levophed] or phenylephrine [Neo-Synephrine] administered by IV).

What is the prognosis with sepsis?,"""The prognosis of patients with sepsis is related to the severity or stage of sepsis as well as to the underlying health status of the patient. For example, patients with sepsis and no ongoing sign of organ failure at the time of diagnosis have about a 15%-30% chance of death. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock have a mortality (death) rate of about 40%-60%, with the elderly having the highest mortality rates. Newborns and pediatric patients with sepsis have about a 9%-36% mortality rate. Investigators have developed a scoring system (MEDS score) based on the patient's symptoms to estimate prognosis."" "
What are the complications of sepsis?,"'There are a large number of complications that may occur with sepsis. The complications are related to the type of initial infection (for example, in lung infection [''pneumonia''] with sepsis, a potential complication could be a need for respiratory support) and the severity of sepsis (for example, septic shock related to a limb infection that could require limb amputation). Consequently, each patient is likely to have the potential for complications related to the source of sepsis; in general, the complications are due to organ dysfunction, damage, or loss. Thus, some complications may cause long-term and life-changing problems. Death is usually due to multiorgan dysfunction (''liver'', kidney, or lung failure).''Physicians agree that the faster the patient with sepsis is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis and fewer complications, if any, for the patient.' "
Is it possible to prevent sepsis (blood poisoning)?,"'Risk factors that lead to sepsis can be reduced by many methods. Perhaps the most important way to reduce the chance for sepsis is to first prevent any infections. ''Vaccines'', good hygiene, hand washing, and avoiding sources of infection are excellent preventive methods. If infection occurs, immediate treatment of any infection before it has a chance to spread into the blood is likely to prevent sepsis. This is especially important in patients who are at greater risk for infection such as those who have suppressed immune systems, those with ''cancer'', people with ''diabetes'', or elderly patients.'

What is deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy/turbinoplasty?,'Nasal obstruction is often caused by a deviated or crooked septum or enlarged tissues (inferior turbinates or inferior nasal conchae) within the nose. A septoplasty is an operation to correct a deformity of the partition (the septum) between the two sides of the nose. A turbinectomy is the surgical reduction or actual removal of an abnormally enlarged turbinate from inside the nose to improve ''breathing''.''The goals of nasal airway surgery include the following:' Improve airflow through the nose Control nosebleeds Enhance visualization of the inside of the nose (to identify other nasal problems) Relieve nasal or sinus headaches associated with swelling of the inside of the nose Promote drainage of the sinus cavities
What are risks and complications of deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'Although the surgery will be performed safely and with care in order to obtain the best possible results, patients have the right to be informed that the surgery may involve risks of unsuccessful results, complications, or injury from both known and unforeseen causes. Because individuals differ in their response to surgery, anesthetic reactions, and healing outcomes, ultimately, there can be no guarantee made as to the results or potential complications. Furthermore, surgical outcomes may be dependent on preexisting or concurrent medical conditions. Additional surgery may be necessary after the nose has had a chance to heal after surgery. Moreover, adherence to follow-up instructions and appointments by the patient can influence the surgical results.''The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. They are listed here for information only, not to frighten patients, but to make them aware and more knowledgeable concerning these surgical procedures. Although many of these complications are rare, they can occur even in the hands of experienced surgeons practicing the standard of care for the procedure. Anyone who is contemplating surgery must weigh the potential risks and complications against the potential benefits of the surgery, or any alternative to surgery. The following is a list of complications that may occur with these nasal surgeries:' Nasal obstruction due to failure to straighten the septum or later re-deviation of the septum, or the re-growth or swelling of the turbinates. This may necessitate revision surgery. Failure to resolve coexisting sinus infections or recurrence of coexisting sinus problems and/or polyps, or need for further or more aggressive surgery. Bleeding. In rare situations, a need for blood products or a blood transfusion. Chronic nasal drainage, or excessive dryness or crusting of the nose or sinuses Need for allergy evaluation, treatments, or environmental controls. Surgery is neither a cure for nor a substitute for good allergy control or treatment. Failure to improve or resolve concurrent respiratory illnesses such as, but not limited to asthma, bronchitis, or cough. Failure to resolve associated ""sinus or nasal"" headaches. The exact cause of headaches can be difficult to determine and have many causes that are not due to nasal septum or turbinates. Patients may require consultation with another specialist such as a neurologist. Damage to the eye and its associated structures. Brain fluid (CSF) leak or infection. Permanent numbness of the upper teeth, palate, or face. Prolonged pain, impaired healing, and the need for hospitalization. Septal perforation, which is a hole inside the nose (septum) that produces an open connection between the right and left sides of the nose. Failure to restore or worsening of the sense of smell or taste, or failure to relieve nosebleeds."
What happens before deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either a hospital or surgicenter. In both facilities, quality health care is provided. An anesthesiologist will monitor the sedated patient throughout the procedures. If the doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, patients should arrange to have these done several days in advance. Patients should bring a copy of these results with them the day of surgery for the anesthesiologist and surgeon to review. Patients need to arrange for someone to transport them home from the surgical facility, and to spend the first night after surgery with the patient, as previously mentioned.'""After surgery, the doctor may ask patients to start using salt water (saline) irrigation's. The doctor will instruct the patient on how, what, and when to start and using irrigation.""'Patients should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days prior to the surgery date. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen'' or ''naproxen'') should not be taken within 7 days prior to the surgery date. If you are on any blood thinners, sucha as Courmadin or ''Eliquis'', tell your doctor, and follow any instructions. Many ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or ibuprofen type ''drugs'"" so it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question individuals should call the health care professional's office or consult a Pharmacist. ""'Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Usually the doctor will give necessary prescription medications at the preoperative visit. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of surgery.'""Patients will receive instructions about eating and drinking limitations prior to surgery. These instructions also will include water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication. Patient's who smoke should make every effort to stop ""'smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding. Patients should discuss this precaution specifically with their surgeon and specifically inform the anesthesiologist about their ''smoking'"" history so that the doctors clearly understand the patient's preoperative condition.""'If patients are sick or have a ''fever'"" the day before surgery, they should call the doctor's office. If they wake up sick the day of surgery, they could still proceed to the surgical facility as planned for an evaluation. The doctor will decide if it's safe to proceed with surgery."" "
What happens the day of deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'It is important for patients to know precisely what time to check in with the surgical facility, and to allow sufficient preparation time. Patients should bring all papers and forms with them including any pre-operative orders and history sheets. They should wear comfortable loose fitting clothes which do not have to be pulled over the head. All jewelry and valuables should be left at home. All make-up should be removed with a cleansing cream. Patients should thoroughly wash their face with soap and water. They should not apply make-up, lotion, or cream to the face.''Patients should not take any medication unless instructed by the doctor or anesthesiologist. Usually in the pre-operative holding room, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) and patients may be given a sedative medication to help them relax.' "
"What happens during deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or 
turbinectomy?","'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a ''gas'' and an intravenous medication to put the patient to ''sleep'' and to maintain anesthetic sedation at a safe and comfortable level. During the procedure, the patient will be continuously monitored with devices including a pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation) and a cardiac rhythm monitor (''EKG'""). The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room. The entire procedure takes approximately one hour, however this can vary greatly depending on the patient's anatomical considerations for the surgeon. The doctor will come to the waiting room to talk with any family or friends once the patient is safely transported to the recovery room."" "
What happens after deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'After surgery, the patient will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor the patient. They will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. The patient will need a friend or family member to pick them up from the surgical facility and take them home. It may be necessary for the family member or friend to spend the first night with the patient after surgery for assistance.''When patients arrive home from the surgical facility, they should go to bed and rest with their head elevated on two to three pillows. By keeping the head elevated above the ''heart'' they can minimize fluid accumulation in the tissues (''edema'') and swelling. They may get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom. Patients should avoid straining while urinating or passing ''stool''. If constipated they should take a ''stool softener'' or a gentle ''laxative''.''Patients may have some swelling of the nose, upper lip, cheeks, or around the eyes for several days after surgery. This swelling will gradually resolve and is normal. They can help reduce the swelling by putting ice on the face, ''bridge'' of the nose, and eyes as much as tolerated. This will also help with postoperative edema and pain. Some patients have found frozen vegetable in packages (for example ''bags'' of frozen peas) to be a convenient ice pack which is more likely to conform to the face.''Moderate bleeding from the nose is normal, and will gradually decrease. The gauze dressing (""mustache dressing"") will collect blood and should be changed only when saturated. It is not unusual to change these dressings every hour during the first 24 hours after surgery. After a few days, patients will usually no longer need to use the dressing. Patients should not take aspirin, aspirin-containing medications, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs'') such as ibuprofen or naproxen for three weeks following surgery.''It is best for patients to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated once recovered fully from the anesthetic. Hot liquids should be avoided for several days. Even though the individual may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to proceed slowly with food intake to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, the person may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery; if ''vomiting'' persists, the doctor can prescribe medication to settle the stomach. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''Patients will be prescribed antibiotics after surgery, and should finish all the pills that have been prescribed. Some form of a narcotic may also be prescribed and is to be taken as needed. If patients require narcotics, they are cautioned not to drive. In some situations, the doctor may prescribe steroids to reduce inflammation either preoperatively and/or postoperatively. It is very important that patients take this medication as prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. If patients have ''nausea'' or vomiting postoperatively, they may be prescribed ''anti-nausea'' medications (''antiemetics''). If patients have any questions or they feel they are developing a reaction to any of these medications, they should consult their doctor. Patients should not take any other medication, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless they have discussed the medications with the doctor.' "
General instructions and follow-up care for deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy,"'In most situations, packs will have been placed in the nose to control bleeding; often times a septal splint is placed that will be removed by the surgeon at the first post-operative visit. The doctor will let the patient know when they are to return to the office to have these packs removed. Patients may need to call the office to schedule this postoperative appointment and should arrange for someone to drive them to and from the office for this first visit. They should eat a light meal before going, and avoid taking excessive pain medications. They may also have several subsequent office visits to assess healing, remove crusts (debris) that may accumulate at the surgical site, especially if combined with ''sinus surgery''. Such visits help insure a speedy recovery. The nose will probably be tender after surgery, so the doctor will spray it with a special numbing medication before removing crusts.'""After the packing has been removed, patients may breathe through the nose, but are not to blow or sneeze through the nose for 7 to 10 days. If the person must sneeze, they should open their mouth. Patients can expect some light blood-tinged drainage from the nose for several days. If bleeding becomes excessive, apply ice and rest quietly with head elevated while holding the nose. If bleeding continues, they should call the surgeon's office for advice.""'One of the most important things patients can do after surgery is nasal irrigation (rinsing). Immediately after the nasal packs are removed they should use a saline nasal spray such as ""Ocean Spray"" several times per day to prevent crusts from forming in their nose. Patients are to continue using irrigation until the doctor tells them to stop. Many patients will use irrigations (for example, neti-pots) indefinitely or when they have an ''upper respiratory infection''. Failure to irrigate especially as instructed after surgery will likely cause the surgery to fail.''Patients may go back to work or school only when the doctor indicates it is safe to return. They should rest for the first week following surgery. They must also avoid excessive talking, smiling, chewing hard foods, strenuous activities, bumping their nose, bending over, and lifting heavy objects. They should not rest glasses on the bridge of the nose until soreness and swelling subsides. They may wear ''contact lenses'' once eye swelling and any irritation has resolved. ''Alcohol'' and tobacco products should be avoided because they may prolong swelling and healing. Smoke, dust, and fumes may irritate the nose and cause an infection. Facial tanning is discouraged for six months after surgery. If patients must be in the sun they should use a number 15 or greater sun block. Patients may use their usual make-up any time after surgery.''Patients should lubricate the nostrils, as instructed with a Q-tip and Vaseline to soften crusts that are hard and firmly attached to healing tissue. Peroxide helps to loosen crusts. After several days they may notice a few of the absorbable ''sutures'' and should not try to disturb or remove them. They must be gentle while brushing the upper ''teeth''. These teeth will often be tender for several weeks, and there may be some numbness of the teeth and palate for several months.''After three weeks if patients are not having problems with bleeding, they may resume ''exercise'' and ''swimming'', but no diving for two months. They should plan to stay in town and not travel for three weeks to allow for postoperative care and in case bleeding occurs.' "
When to call the doctor after septoplasty or turbinectomy,"'Patients should notify the doctor if they have:''Most surgeons want to know about complications or problems that develop with their patients, so do not\xa0hesitate to call the surgeon to inform them and ask questions about any problems you are experiencing.' A sudden increase in the amount of bleeding from the nose unrelieved by pressure, ice, and head elevation. A fever greater than 101.5 F (38.6 C) that persists despite increasing the amount of fluid and acetaminophen (Tylenol). A person with a fever should try to drink approximately one cup of fluid each waking hour. Persistent sharp pain or headache which is not relieved by the pain medication prescribed. Increased swelling or redness of the nose or eyes."
What is deviated septum?,"'The thin wall between the nostrils is made of cartilage and bone and is called the septum. The septum is made up of bone and cartilage. When this cartilage or bone is off-center (deviated to one side) or crooked, it is referred to as a deviated septum.' A deviated septum may be present at birth, may become crooked during growth, or maybe caused by injury to the nose and face. A deviated septum often does not have any symptoms, but some symptoms include difficulty breathing through the nose, nasal congestion, sinus infections, nosebleeds, sleep problems, headache, and postnasal drip. Some symptoms of deviated septum may be treated with medication. More severe cases of deviated septum may require surgery to repair the septum."
What are the symptoms of deviated septum?,"'A deviated septum may not cause any problems in some people. When a deviated septum does cause symptoms, they may include:'   Difficulty breathing through the nose Nasal congestion, usually one side more than the other Recurrent sinus infections Nosebleeds Sleep problems, such as contributing to loud snoring or sleep apnea Headache postnasal drip"
What are the causes of deviated septum?,"'Most people do not have a perfectly straight septum, but it may be misaligned due to a two main causes: '   A person can be born with a deviated 
septum (congenital), or it can bend due to normal growth during childhood.  Another cause of deviated septum is 
injury or trauma, such as a broken nose. "
When should I see a doctor about a deviated septum?,"'See your doctor about a deviated septum if you have:''A deviated septum may cause any of these problems, however, there are other reasons these symptoms may occur and it is important to see a doctor for a correct diagnosis and treatment.' trouble with nasal breathing, sleep problems (particularly sleep apnea), or chronic sinus problems."
How is deviated septum diagnosed?,"'Your health care professional can diagnose a deviated septum during the physical examination. Usually a bright light and an instrument that can help visualize the nasal septum by opening the nostril (nasal speculum) will help make the correct diagnosis. Some deviated septums are deep in the nose and may require further evaluation in the office with a small telescope or endoscope. Imaging may occasionally be done with a ''CT scan'' to view the extent and other associated to findings, but this is not often done.' "
How is deviated septum treated?,"'A deviated septum is an extremely common condition and many people with a deviated septum do not need treatment.''Some symptoms such as a stuffy nose or postnasal drip may be alleviated with medication, including decongestants, ''antihistamines'', or nasal sprays. In many cases, medications are tried before surgery is recommended.''If a person has a deviated septum and it causes breathing problems or ''sleep'' apnea and ''snoring'', surgery may be recommended to repair the septum. Surgery to fix a deviated septum is called'  a septoplasty, submucous resection of the septum, or septal reconstruction."
Can deviated septum be prevented?,"'A deviated septum that is caused by injury to the nose or face may be prevented by following safety precautions:' Always wear proper helmets and headgear 
when playing sports Always wear your seatbelt when riding 
in a car"

What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.
	"
"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: These are rare tumors that have both solid and cystic components and are found mainly in young Asian and black women. They may reach a large size and can become malignant. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical resection of these tumors."
How do medical professionals diagnose pancreatic cysts?,"'Since the majority of pancreatic cysts are small and produce no symptoms, they often are discovered incidentally when abdominal scans (''ultrasound'' [US], ''computerized tomography'' or CT, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or ''MRI'') are performed to investigate unrelated symptoms. Unfortunately, ultrasound, CT, and MRI cannot reliably distinguish benign cysts (cysts that usually need no treatment) from precancerous and cancerous cysts (cysts that usually require surgical removal).''Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is becoming increasingly useful in determining whether a pancreatic cyst is likely to be benign, precancerous, or cancerous. During endoscopic ultrasound, an endoscope with a small ultrasound transducer at its tip is inserted into the mouth and is passed through the\xa0''esophagus''\xa0and stomach into the duodenum. From this location, which is very close to the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, accurate and detailed images can be obtained of the liver, pancreas and the gallbladder.''During endoscopic ultrasound, fluid from cysts and samples of tissue also can be obtained by passing special needles through the endoscope and into the cysts. The process of obtaining tissue or fluid with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).''The fluid obtained by FNA can be analyzed for cancerous cells (cytology), amylase content, and for tumor markers. Tumor markers, such as CEA (''carcinoembryonic antigen''), are proteins produced in large quantities by cancer cells. For example, pancreatic pseudocyst fluid will typically have high amylase levels but low CEA levels. A benign serous cyst adenoma will have low amylase and low CEA levels, whereas a precancerous or cancerous mucinous cyst adenoma will have low amylase levels but high CEA levels. Most recently, DNA from cells that are aspirated from the cyst has been analyzed for changes suggestive of cancer.''The risks of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration are small and consist of a very small incidence of bleeding and infection.''Occasionally, it is difficult even with the diagnostic tools of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to determine if a pancreatic cyst is cancerous or precancerous. If the answer is not clear, sometimes repeated endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration are done if the suspicion for cancer or precancer is high. In other cases, the cyst is reexamined by CT, MRI, or even endoscopic ultrasound after a few months to detect changes that more strongly suggest that cancer has developed. In still others, surgery is recommended.'  "
What is the treatment for pancreatic cysts?,"'The most important aspect of management of pancreatic cysts is the determination of whether a cyst is benign (and usually needs no treatment) or if it is precancerous or cancerous and must be removed.''The second most important aspect of management is to determine whether a patient with a precancerous or cancerous pancreatic cyst is a suitable surgical candidate. In medical centers experienced in performing pancreatic surgery, surgical removal of precancerous or cancerous cysts results in a high rate of cure.'""Very small cysts can be followed to detect an increase in size that may indicate cancer or an increased risk of developing cancer.\xa0Management decisions must be individualized for each patient after discussions with a doctor familiar with the patient's health status. The following are examples of how a doctor might manage pancreatic cysts.""   Pancreatic pseudocysts need treatment if they persist beyond six weeks after acute pancreatitis, especially if they reach a large size and cause symptoms such as obstruction of the stomach or common bile duct, abdominal pain, or become infected. Small pancreatic cysts (for example, cysts smaller than one cm) will have little chance of being cancerous. Nevertheless, even these small cysts can grow in size and turn cancerous in the future. Thus, these patients are monitored with yearly scans (for example, yearly ultrasound or MRI). The cysts do not have to be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If the cysts grow in size and/or cause symptoms, the patient will be evaluated further using endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm can be studied with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If fluid cytology, CEA measurements or analysis of DNA suggest cancerous or precancerous changes, the patients can be evaluated for pancreatic surgery."
What is Sever's condition?,"""Sever's condition is an inflammation of the growth plate of the bone at the back of the heel (apophysitis of the calcaneus). The inflammation of Sever's condition is at the point where the Achilles tendon attaches to the back of the heel bone."" "
What causes Sever's condition?,"""Sever's condition is caused by sprain injury where the Achilles tendon attaches to the calcaneus bone at the back of the heel."" "
What are signs and symptoms of Sever's condition?,"   Sever's condition causes pain at the back of the heel. The pain is increased with plantar flexion of the ankle (pushing down with the foot as if stepping on the gas), particularly against resistance. Sever's condition also causes tenderness and swelling in the area of the pain."
Who gets Sever's condition?," Sever's condition occurs in adolescent or older children, particularly active boys. It can be very painful. It is one of those conditions commonly referred to as ""growing pains."" Patients are evaluated for signs of conditions that can mimic Sever's condition, such as ankylosing spondylitis and other forms of arthritis. Usually, Sever's condition is self-limited; that is, it disappears as the child ages."
How do health care professionals diagnose Sever's condition?,"""Sever's condition is diagnosed by detecting the characteristic symptoms and signs above in the older children, particularly boys between 8 and 15 years of age. Sometimes X-ray testing can be helpful as it can occasionally demonstrate irregularity of the calcaneus bone at the point where the Achilles tendon attaches."" "
What is the treatment for Sever's condition?,"'When the condition flares, it is treated'  with activity limitation, medication to reduce inflammation (such as ibuprofen [Advil] or naproxen [Aleve]), shoe inserts, heel lifts, cold packs, and sometimes casting when it becomes especially severe."
What is the prognosis of Sever's condition? How long does it last?,"""Sever's condition is generally a self-limited problem that usually improves within a year."" "
What is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)?,"""SARS is an infectious respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus. The first cases of SARS occurred in late 2002 in the Guangdong Province of the People's Republic of China. Because of the ""'contagious'' nature of the disease and the delayed public-health response, the epidemic spread rapidly around the globe. Final statistics from the World Health Organization showed 8,096 reported illnesses and 774 deaths.''The rapid transmission and high mortality rate (about 10%) of SARS drew international attention and concern. Fortunately, public-health efforts to identify and quarantine infected people proved highly effective. By July 2003, human-to-human transmission of SARS had stopped.'""Unfortunately, future outbreaks of SARS are still possible because the virus lives in wild bats and civets in China and in laboratory cultures. In fact, there were a few human cases of SARS in 2004 as a result of laboratory accidents in the People's Republic of China. No human cases have been identified since.""'The previously unknown coronavirus that causes this syndrome was first identified in Asia in early 2003, hence its name, ""SARS-associated coronavirus"" or SARS-CoV. As of October 2012, SARS-CoV has been added to the National Select Agent Registry, which regulates the handling and possession of bacteria, ''viruses'', or toxins that have potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety. The addition of SARS-CoV permits maintenance of a national database and inspection of entities that possess, use, or transfer SARS-CoV; it also ensures that all individuals who work with these agents undergo security-risk assessment performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation/Criminal Justice Information Service.''Middle East respiratory syndrome'' coronavirus (''MERS-CoV'') is another coronavirus in humans that was identified in an outbreak in residents and ''travelers'' to the Arabian peninsula in 2012. It is not the same coronavirus as SARS-CoV, but it is similar to bat coronaviruses, and it is likely to have originated in animals as well. MERS-CoV is discussed in another article.''In late 2019, medical professionals noted yet another coronavirus outbreak. The new virus, ''Wuhan virus'' (also termed ''2019-nCoV''), an RNA virus related to both SARS and MERS coronaviruses, likely originated in infected animals marketed as food in Wuhan, China. The virus, like SARS, may cause moderate to severe respiratory problems in individuals and appears to spread from person to person. Most patients with the ''Wuhan virus'' require hospitalization. Within 1 month, the virus spread to at least 6 countries, including the U.S.' "
What causes SARS? How is SARS transmitted?,"'SARS is caused by a virus referred to as ""SARS-CoV"" from the coronavirus genus; SARS-CoV means severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Many coronaviruses infect animals and humans, and the ''common cold'' is caused by some coronaviruses and several other viruses. SARS-CoV virus had never been identified before 2002. This was not entirely surprising because there are many types of coronaviruses, and they are known to mutate easily.''SARS-CoV likely originated in wild bats and then spread to palm civets or similar mammals. The virus then mutated and adapted itself in these animals until it eventually infected humans. There was ample opportunity for the virus to come into contact with humans. Bats serve as a food source in parts of Asia, and their feces are sometimes used in folk medicines. Civets are cat-like mammals that live in the tropics of Africa and Asia and produce musk from their scent glands, which is used in perfumes. Civets are also hunted for meat in some parts of the world. These animals could easily transmit the virus to humans.''SARS-CoV is spread from person to person through respiratory secretions. SARS often affected people caring for a sick individual and spread readily through health care facilities until infection-control measures were established. SARS-CoV was isolated from many hospital surface areas, including elevator buttons, likely contributing to the spread of the disease among healthcare workers. During the outbreak, one in about every 20 infected people was a health care worker who cared for a patient with SARS; nearly 2,000 health care workers became ill.' "
Is SARS contagious? How long is the contagious period for SARS?,"'SARS is contagious from person to person by droplets in respiratory secretions, such as during ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'', much like the ''common cold''. In addition, droplets on surfaces can be touched and rubbed into eyes, nose, or mouth membranes. Relatively close contact is required, such as being within 3 ''feet'' of a symptomatic person while living with them, sleeping in the same room, sharing household items with them, or providing medical care for them.''The contagious period is generally from the time symptoms start (end of the incubation period) and is greatest during the second week of symptoms. People with SARS should avoid leaving home until 10 days after symptoms end due to possible contagiousness.' "
What is the incubation period for SARS?,'The time between getting infected and the start of symptoms (the incubation period) is about two to seven days but occasionally has been up to 14 days.' 
What are risk factors for SARS?,"'SARS-CoV can infect a person regardless of their health status or age group. However, it was clear that some people were at increased risk during the 2002-2003 outbreak. This included people over the age of 50 (some reported mortality rates of about 50%), ''pregnant'' women, and those with underlying ''diabetes'', ''heart disease'', or ''liver disease''. A major risk factor is simply close association with any person infected with SARS-CoV since the virus can be spread through droplets sprayed into the air by coughing, sneezing, or even talking.''Other risk factors include the following:' Recent travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan or close contact with ill people 
with a history of recent travel to these areas Employment in an occupation at risk for SARS-CoV exposure, including a health care worker with direct contact with a patient having SARS-CoV, or a worker in a laboratory that contains live SARS-CoV Relationship with a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis"
What are SARS symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms begin two to seven days after acquiring the virus. Initially, the illness resembles ''influenza'' and lasts for up to one week. Symptoms include ''fever'', ''chills'', ''headache'',aches or ''pain'' in the muscles, general feeling of ''weakness'' (malaise), and poor appetite.\xa0''Nausea'', ''vomiting'' and ''diarrhea'' are less common. This period is followed by a syndrome suggesting atypical ''pneumonia'', including dry ''cough'' and progressively worsening to severe shortness of breath (dyspnea) and inability to maintain oxygenation (''hypoxia''). Progression may be rapid or it may take several days. Severely affected people develop a potentially fatal form of respiratory failure, known as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARD or ''ARDS''). In addition to the attacking the alveoli (air sacs) in the ''lungs'', the virus also infects other organs in the body, causing ''kidney failure'', inflammation of the ''heart'' sac (''pericarditis''), or severe systemic bleeding from disruption of clotting system (''disseminated intravascular coagulation''), reduced lymphocyte cell counts (lymphopenia), inflammation of the arteries (''vasculitis''), and inflammation of the gut with ''diarrhea''. People with compromised immune systems such as severe ''rheumatoid arthritis'' or organ transplantation may not experience respiratory symptoms but can have ''fever'' or ''diarrhea''.' "
What kind of specialists treat SARS?,"'Most people with SARS would see a primary-care provider or an emergency-medicine doctor as illness rapidly progressed. Depending on the stage of illness, they would be admitted to a hospital as oxygen levels decreased. In the hospital, a person with SARS would likely be managed by a hospitalist or critical-care doctor, with consultations to an infectious-disease doctor and a lung doctor (''pulmonologist''). ' "
How do health care professionals diagnose SARS?,"'SARS-CoV is detected using enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA) or reverse transcriptase ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') tests, which are available through the CDC. These tests are performed on respiratory secretions or blood.'"" These tests are performed only when the patient's history makes SARS likely and usually in consultation with infectious-disease doctors, public-health authorities, and the Centers for Disease Control and ""'Prevention''. If a test is positive, it will be confirmed by the CDC. Other tests may be abnormal, but they are not specific for SARS. The ''chest X-ray'' shows pneumonia, which may look patchy at first. White blood cells and platelet (clotting cell) counts in the blood are usually decreased. '' SARS should be considered in people with the appropriate symptoms who work with SARS-CoV in a laboratory or who have recent exposure to infected people or mammals in Southern China. No human cases of SARS have been reported since 2004 in the United States, so it is extremely unlikely that a patient in the U.S. will have SARS without a history of such exposure. It is possible, however, that a new outbreak might occur. Therefore, SARS (along with other similar viruses) should also be considered when there is a cluster of unusually severe pneumonia that has no other explanation.' "
What is the treatment for SARS?,"'Patients with SARS often require oxygen therapy, and severe cases require tracheal ''intubation'"" and mechanical ventilation to support life until recovery begins. Severely ill patients should be admitted to the intensive-care unit. No medication has been proven to treat SARS effectively, and treatment is supportive and directed by the patient's clinical condition. Medical caregivers need to follow strict policies on gloves, masks, gowns, and other protocols to avoid becoming infected. "" "
What is the prognosis of SARS?,"'During the pandemic, approximately 25% of people with SARS developed severe respiratory failure or ''ARDS''. In the general population, people with SARS had approximately a 10% chance of dying. Deaths in children were rare. However, up to 50% of people with underlying medical conditions died. People over 50 years old also had a similar death rate. Unfortunately, many people who eventually recovered from SARS in China suffered disabling lung scarring (''pulmonary fibrosis''), thinning of bones (''osteoporosis''), and severe damage to the hip bone (femoral head necrosis).' "
Is it possible to prevent SARS?,"'Travelers'' to affected areas can protect themselves by taking simple measures that help prevent the spread of germs. Frequent hand washing with soap and water, or using an ''alcohol'""-based hand sanitizer, avoiding close contact with sick people, and not touching one's eyes, nose, and mouth can prevent the spread of viruses.""""The SARS pandemic was brought to an end by basic public-health and infection-control measures. In the health care setting, someone with a suspected case of SARS is placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). This is a patient care room used to isolate people with suspected or confirmed airborne infectious diseases. The air is under negative pressure, meaning that contaminated air is continually sucked into the room instead of letting it leak out into the hospital environment. This air is exhausted outside, or it circulates back into the room after passing through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to decontaminate it. If an AIIR not available, the patient must wear a face mask and is isolated in a single-patient room with the door closed. The number of staff assigned and the patient's movements outside of the room must be minimized. Before entering the isolation room, health care workers caring for the patient must wear a gown, gloves, eye shield, and mask or a portable air purifier that filters out small infectious particles (N95 mask). Before leaving the room, any disposable gear such as gowns, gloves, and mask must be discarded. Hands must be cleansed with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after leaving the room and before attending to another patient.""'Most public-health officials recommend isolation for anyone diagnosed with SARS-CoV.''The key to preventing another outbreak is to identify the first infected patients promptly before they have time to spread the illness more widely. People who have been exposed to an infected individual should be carefully monitored for fever or respiratory symptoms. Exposure is defined as living with or caring for an infected person, being within 3 feet of the sick person, exposure to bodily fluids, or direct physical contact. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not mandate quarantine measures for exposed individuals who are otherwise healthy and allows this decision to be handled on a case-by-case basis. Local public-health authorities should be consulted promptly when the diagnosis is suspected. If a significant outbreak of SARS occurs again, people may be advised to maintain a distance from others in the community (""social distancing"") by avoiding large gatherings or close contact with others. However, isolation and quarantine methods have been effective in the prevention of SARS spread.' "

Introduction to sexual and urological problems of diabetes,'Troublesome bladder symptoms and changes in sexual function are common health problems as people age. Having diabetes can mean early onset and increased severity of these problems. Sexual and urologic complications of diabetes occur because of the damage diabetes can cause to blood vessels and nerves. Men may have difficulty with erections or ejaculation. Women may have problems with sexual response and vaginal lubrication.''Urinary tract infections'' and bladder problems occur more often in people with diabetes. People who keep their diabetes under control can lower their risk of the early onset of these sexual and urologic problems.' 
Diabetes and sexual problems,"'Both men and women with diabetes can develop sexual problems because of damage to nerves and small blood vessels. When a person wants to lift an arm or take a step, the brain sends nerve signals to the appropriate muscles. Nerve signals also control internal organs like the ''heart'"" and bladder, but people do not have the same kind of conscious control over them as they do over their arms and legs. The nerves that control internal organs are called autonomic nerves, which signal the body to digest food and circulate blood without a person having to think about it. The body's response to sexual stimuli is also involuntary, governed by autonomic nerve signals that increase blood flow to the genitals and cause smooth muscle tissue to relax. Damage to these autonomic nerves can hinder normal function. Reduced blood flow resulting from damage to blood vessels can also contribute to sexual dysfunction."" "
What sexual problems can occur in men with diabetes?,"'Erectile Dysfunction''''Erectile dysfunction'' is a consistent inability to have an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. The condition includes the total inability to have an erection and the inability to sustain an erection.''Estimates of the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes vary widely, ranging from 20 to 75 percent. Men who have diabetes are two to three times more likely to have erectile dysfunction than men who do not have diabetes. Among men with erectile dysfunction, those with diabetes may experience the problem as much as 10 to 15 years earlier than men without diabetes. Research suggests that erectile dysfunction may be an early marker of diabetes, particularly in men ages 45 and younger.''In addition to diabetes, other major causes of erectile dysfunction include ''high blood pressure'', ''kidney disease'', ''alcohol abuse'', and blood vessel disease. Erectile dysfunction may also occur because of the side effects of medications, psychological factors, ''smoking'', and hormonal deficiencies.'""Men who experience erectile dysfunction should consider talking with a health care provider. The health care provider may ask about the patient's medical history, the type and frequency of sexual problems, medications, ""'smoking'' and drinking habits, and other health conditions. A physical exam and laboratory tests may help pinpoint causes of sexual problems. The health care provider will check blood glucose control and hormone levels and may ask the patient to do a test at home that checks for erections that occur during ''sleep''. The health care provider may also ask whether the patient is ''depressed'' or has recently experienced upsetting changes in his life.''Treatments for erectile dysfunction caused by nerve damage, also called neuropathy, vary widely and range from oral pills, a vacuum pump, pellets placed in the urethra, and shots directly into the penis, to surgery. All of these methods have advantages and disadvantages. Psychological counseling to reduce ''anxiety'' or address other issues may be necessary. Surgery to implant a device to aid in erection or to repair arteries is usually used as a treatment after all others fail.''Retrograde Ejaculation '' '""Retrograde ejaculation is a condition in which part or all of a man's semen goes into the bladder instead of out the tip of the penis during ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when internal muscles, called sphincters, do not function normally. A sphincter automatically opens or closes a passage in the body. With retrograde ejaculation, semen enters the bladder, mixes with urine, and leaves the body during urination without harming the bladder. A man experiencing retrograde ejaculation may notice that little semen is discharged during ejaculation or may become aware of the condition if ""'fertility'' problems arise. Analysis of a urine sample after ejaculation will reveal the presence of semen.''Poor blood glucose control and the resulting nerve damage can cause retrograde ejaculation. Other causes include prostate surgery and some medications.''Retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes or surgery may be helped with a medication that strengthens the muscle tone of the sphincter in the bladder. A ''urologist'' experienced in ''infertility'' treatments may assist with techniques to promote fertility, such as collecting sperm from the urine and then using the sperm for ''artificial insemination''.'  "
What sexual problems can occur in women with diabetes?,"'Many women with diabetes experience sexual problems. Although research about sexual problems in women with diabetes is limited, one study found 27 percent of women with ''type 1 diabetes'' experienced sexual dysfunction. Another study found 18 percent of women with ''type 1 diabetes'' and 42 percent of women with type 2 diabetes experienced sexual dysfunction.''Sexual problems may include''Decreased or absent sexual response can include the inability to become or remain aroused, reduced or no sensation in the genital area, and the constant or occasional inability to reach ''orgasm''.''Causes of sexual problems in women with diabetes include nerve damage, reduced blood flow to genital and vaginal tissues, and hormonal changes. Other possible causes include some medications, ''alcohol abuse'', ''smoking'', psychological problems such as ''anxiety'' or ''depression'', gynecologic infections, other diseases, and conditions relating to ''pregnancy'' or ''menopause''.'""Women who experience sexual problems or notice a change in sexual response should consider talking with a health care provider. The health care provider will ask about the patient's medical history, any gynecologic conditions or infections, the type and frequency of sexual problems, medications, smoking and drinking habits, and other health conditions. The health care provider may ask whether the patient might be ""'pregnant'' or has reached ''menopause'' and whether she is depressed or has recently experienced upsetting changes in her life. A physical exam and laboratory tests may also help pinpoint causes of sexual problems. The health care provider will also talk with the patient about blood glucose control.''Prescription or ''over-the-counter'' vaginal lubricants may be useful for women experiencing vaginal dryness. Techniques to treat decreased sexual response include changes in position and stimulation during sexual relations. Psychological counseling may be helpful. Kegel exercises that help strengthen the pelvic muscles may improve sexual response. Studies of drug treatments are under way.'  decreased vaginal lubrication, resulting in vaginal dryness uncomfortable or painful sexual intercourse decreased or no desire for sexual activity decreased or absent sexual response"
Diabetes and urologic problems,"'Urologic problems that affect men and women with diabetes include bladder problems and urinary tract infections.''Bladder Problems'""Many events or conditions can damage nerves that control bladder function, including diabetes and other diseases, injuries, and infections. More than half of men and women with diabetes have bladder dysfunction because of damage to nerves that control bladder function. Bladder dysfunction can have a profound effect on a person's quality of life. Common bladder problems in men and women with diabetes include the following:""'Overactive bladder.'' Damaged nerves may send signals to the bladder at the wrong time, causing its muscles to squeeze without warning. The symptoms of overactive bladder include''Poor control of sphincter muscles.'' Sphincter muscles surround the urethra - the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body - and keep it closed to hold urine in the bladder. If the nerves to the sphincter muscles are damaged, the muscles may become loose and allow leakage or stay tight when a person is trying to release urine.''Urine retention.'' For some people, nerve damage keeps their bladder muscles from getting the message that it is time to urinate or makes the muscles too weak to completely empty the bladder. If the bladder becomes too full, urine may back up and the increasing pressure may damage the kidneys. If urine remains in the body too long, an infection can develop in the kidneys or bladder. Urine retention may also lead to overflow ''incontinence'' - leakage of urine when the bladder is full and does not empty properly.''Diagnosis of bladder problems'""Diagnosis of bladder problems may involve checking both bladder function and the appearance of the bladder's interior. Tests may include x rays, urodynamic testing to evaluate bladder function, and ""'cystoscopy'', a test that uses a device called a cystoscope to view the inside of the bladder.''Treatment of bladder problems''Treatment of bladder problems due to nerve damage depends on the specific problem. If the main problem is urine retention, treatment may involve medication to promote better bladder emptying and a practice called timed voiding - urinating on a schedule - to promote more efficient urination. Sometimes people need to periodically insert a thin tube called a catheter through the urethra into the bladder to drain the urine. Learning how to tell when the bladder is full and how to ''massage'' the lower abdomen to fully empty the bladder can help as well. If urinary leakage is the main problem, medications, strengthening muscles with Kegel exercises, or surgery can help. Treatment for the urinary urgency and frequency of overactive bladder may involve medications, timed voiding, Kegel exercises, and surgery in some cases.''Urinary Tract Infections''Infections can occur when bacteria, usually from the ''digestive system'', reach the urinary tract. If bacteria are growing in the urethra, the infection is called ''urethritis''. The bacteria may travel up the urinary tract and cause a ''bladder infection'', called ''cystitis''. An untreated infection may go farther into the body and cause ''pyelonephritis'', a ''kidney infection''. Some people have chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. Symptoms of urinary tract infections can include''If the infection is in the kidneys, a person may have ''nausea'', feel ''pain'' in the back or side, and have a ''fever''. ''Frequent urination'' can be a sign of high blood glucose, so results from recent blood glucose monitoring should be evaluated.''The health care provider will ask for a urine sample, which will be analyzed for bacteria and pus. Additional tests may be done if the patient has frequent urinary tract infections. An ''ultrasound'' exam provides images from the echo patterns of sound waves bounced back from internal organs. An intravenous pyelogram uses a special dye to enhance x-ray images of the urinary tract. Cystoscopy might be performed.''Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent more serious infections. To clear up a ''urinary tract infection'', the health care provider will probably prescribe antibiotic treatment based on the type of bacteria in the urine. Kidney infections are more serious and may require several weeks of antibiotic treatment. Drinking plenty of fluids will help prevent another infection.''' urinary frequency - urination eight or more times a day or two or more times 
a night urinary urgency - the sudden, strong need to urinate immediately urge incontinence - leakage of urine that follows a sudden, strong urge to urinate a frequent urge to urinate pain or burning in the bladder or urethra during urination cloudy or reddish urine in women, pressure above the pubic bone in men, a feeling of fullness in the rectum"
Who is at risk for developing sexual and urologic problems of diabetes?,"'Risk factors are conditions that increase the chances of getting a particular disease. The more risk factors people have, the greater their chances of developing that disease or condition. ''Diabetic neuropathy'' and related sexual and urologic problems appear to be more common in people who' have poor blood glucose control have high levels of blood cholesterol have high blood pressure are overweight are older than 40 smoke are physically inactive"
Can diabetes-related sexual and urologic problems be prevented?,"'People with diabetes can lower their risk of sexual and urologic problems by keeping their blood glucose, blood pressure, and ''cholesterol levels'' close to the target numbers their health care provider recommends. Being physically active and maintaining a healthy weight can also help prevent the long-term complications of diabetes. For those who smoke, quitting will lower the risk of developing sexual and urologic problems due to nerve damage and also lower the risk for other health problems related to diabetes, including ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and kidney disease.'

Hope through research,"'The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) was established by Congress in 1950 as one of the National Institutes of Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NIDDK conducts and supports research on diabetes, glucose metabolism, and related conditions. NIDDK-supported research on the sexual and urologic complications of diabetes includes research conducted as part of the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study. The EDIC is an observational follow-up study of people who originally participated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The DCCT showed that intensive blood glucose control can reduce the risk of complications of ''type 1 diabetes''. EDIC study results suggest that tight glucose control can delay the onset of erectile dysfunction in men with type 1 diabetes.''A recent study focused on ''urinary incontinence in women'' at high risk for developing ''type 2 diabetes'' who participated in the NIDDK-sponsored ''Diabetes Prevention'' Program (DPP). The women had pre-diabetes, a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. Women who were in the DPP group that used a lifestyle change approach to diabetes ''prevention'' and lost 5 to 7 percent of their weight through dietary changes and increased physical activity were compared with those in other DPP groups who received standard education and maintained a stable weight. The women in the lifestyle intervention group had fewer problems with ''urinary incontinence'' than women in the other groups. This finding adds to other results of the DPP study that indicate the value of lifestyle changes for preventing or delaying the development of ''type 2 diabetes''.''Participants in ''clinical trials'' can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research.

What are sexual problems in men?,"'Sexual health'"" is an important part of a man's life, no matter his age, civil status, or sexual orientation. It is also an important part of a couple's foundation and contributes to the quality of life. Sexual problems in men are very common and impact sexual health. Many problems with sexual health can be treated. Therefore, it is important for a man to discuss these issues with a physician.""""The definition of sexual dysfunction is the inability to have a satisfactory sexual relationship. This definition depends on each person's own interpretation on what he judges satisfactory. In general, sexual dysfunction can affect the quality of life and, even more importantly, can be the first symptom of another medical or psychological problem. Any sexual complaint should be taken seriously and evaluated."" "
How does sexual function work?,"'Sexual activity involves coordination between various systems of the body. Hormones and neurological pathways must be in sync for sexual desire to be present. Blood vessels, nerves, and penile integrity must all be present for an adequate erection and its maintenance during the sexual relation. Muscles and nerves coordinate ejaculation achieved when the physiological passageway for sperm (from the testicles to the urethra) is present. ''Orgasm'"" is a complex phenomenon that isn't completely understood, but it involves the coordination of muscles and nerves. When sexual dysfunction is present, the physician must evaluate all the possible problems in this chain of events."" "
What are the types of sexual dysfunction in men?,"'Types of sexual dysfunction include disorders involving sexual desire or libido, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. They will be described separately, but understand that some medical conditions can affect two or more disorders at the same time.'  "
How are sexual problems in men diagnosed?,"""Evaluation of sexual dysfunction starts with a detailed medical, sexual, and psychological history, followed by a thorough physical examination. The second step must not be overlooked because sexual dysfunction can have many causes. Sometimes, the patient's partner can also contribute to the evaluation and could provide useful information as well.""'A detailed medical, psychological, and sexual history is acquired during the interview with the physician. Some of the questions that are asked can be intimate and might cause you to feel too shy to answer thoroughly. It is imperative to give the proper information, even though it is understandable that it can take time to be comfortable talking about this. Having a good relationship with your physician is always helpful.''Some of the questions the doctor could ask might concern the frequency of sexual relations, your sexual orientation, if the frequency or quality of sexual relations are satisfying, and your number of sexual partners, among others. They will also inquire about nonsexual-related complaints.''A complete physical examination is performed including assessing the pulses in the legs and a thorough examination of the external genitalia (penis, scrotum, and perineum) and their reflexes.''One of the possible tests is a ''nocturnal'' tumescence test to evaluate nocturnal erections. Your physician might also ask for tests for penile blood vessel function or some tests of the nervous system to help differentiate between possible causes of sexual dysfunction.' "
What is the treatment for sexual problems in men?,"'The treatment plan depends greatly on the precise cause of the sexual problem. If the cause is psychological, help from a psychiatrist or psychologist can be helpful. Often in this situation, ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' is the treatment used. Sometimes the treatment will include couples therapy. If the cause of the diminished libido is from medications being taken, sometimes there are alternative medications without sexual side effects. For others, hormonal replacement may be suggested. Talk to your doctor about any changes in libido you have experienced.'  "
What is low libido (low sexual desire)?,"'The definition of ''low libido'"" is when sexual desire is diminished or absent. The definition also varies according to the patient's level of satisfaction of his own sexual desire. Some men can be very fulfilled with what some men consider scarce sexual activity.""'Sexual desire problems affect a small percentage of men in the general population. Libido is mainly a hormonal and brain phenomenon. Sexual desire requires normal levels of testosterone (male hormone) in the blood and a certain attraction for the partner in question.' "
What are the symptoms of low libido?,"""The person that lacks sexual desire won't want to initiate the sexual relation. If the act is initiated, ""'low libido'' can also present itself as the inability to attain an erection. If the patient experiences a first episode of ''erectile dysfunction'' without any previous sexual symptoms and adequate nocturnal erection, the cause is probably psychogenic and the problem is not the erection. It is also important to specify if the low libido is new in onset or if one has always felt this way about sexual relations.' "
What causes a low sex drive in men?,"'Many causes have been identified as contributing to the diminishment of sexual desire. They include:' Medications (SSRIs, anti-androgens, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, opioid analgesics) Alcoholism Depression Fatigue Hypoactive sexual disorder Recreational drugs Relationship problems Other sexual dysfunction (fear of humiliation) Sexual aversion disorder Systemic illness Testosterone deficiency Stress Lack of time History of sexual abuse Hormonal problems such as hyperthyroidism"
What are risk factors for low libido?,"'Risk factors for low libido in men include:' Age because testosterone concentration will decrease over the years Alcohol consumption Malnourishment Smoking Drug consumption Conditions requiring medication that lowers testosterone, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), pain, and prostate cancer"
What is erectile dysfunction (impotence)? Who gets it?,"'Erectile dysfunction'' (''ED'') is the inability to acquire or maintain a satisfactory erection. The prevalence of ''erectile dysfunction'"" varies according to the patient's age. About 16% of men from 50 to 59 years of age will suffer from erectile dysfunction and 44% of those aged 70 to 75 years will, too.""'There are three types of erections -- those caused by tactile stimulation, those caused by mental stimulation, and those that men experience while sleeping. This classification can be important when the cause of erectile dysfunction is yet to be determined.''In order to have an erection, men need stimuli; they need blood arriving from the arteries and have veins capable of locking the blood in place. Each of the numerous steps in this system can fail making erectile dysfunction a complex problem for investigation.' "
What are the symptoms of erectile dysfunction?,"'Erectile dysfunction will cause the penis to be unable to acquire or maintain a satisfactory erection. It is important to specify to the doctor the rapidity of onset, the presence of nocturnal erections, and the quality of the erection if it can be attained but not maintained. The quality of an erection can be judged according to the rigidity and the functionality (Is the penis erect enough to allow for vaginal penetration?).''Erectile dysfunction with sudden onset and no previous history of sexual dysfunction suggests a psychogenic cause, unless there was a previous surgery or a genital ''trauma''. The loss of nocturnal erections will suggest a neurologic or vascular cause. Finally, when an erection is not sustained, its loss may be due to an underlying psychological cause or vascular problem. Talk to your doctor if you have noticed any problems with your erectile function.' "
What causes erectile dysfunction?,"'There are numerous potential causes of erectile dysfunction.''Neurologic causes include:''Vascular causes include:''Hormonal causes include:''Pharmacological causes include:''Penile dysfunction causes include:''Psychiatric causes include:''Functional causes include:' Stroke Spinal cord or back injury Multiple sclerosis Dementia Pelvic trauma Prostate surgery (even with nerve-sparing surgeries it can take up to 24 months to regain normal sexual function) Priapism Nervous system tumor Epilepsy Diabetic neuropathy Arteriovenous fistula Diabetes Atherosclerosis Congenital anomaly Low testosterone blood level (The patient can achieve an erection but it won't always be turgid enough for vaginal penetration.) Hyperprolactinemia Hyperthyroidism Hypothyroidism Cushing's disease Addison's disease Antidepressants (mainly SSRIs) Spironolactone Sympathetic blockers (clonidine, guanethidine, or methyldopa) Thiazide diuretics Ketoconazole Cimetidine Peyronie's disease Loss of feeling toward the other person Stress Fear of non-performance Bicycling irritating the nerves and tissue of the penis"
What are the risk factors for erectile dysfunction?,'The risk factors for erectile dysfunction include:' Obesity Smoking Diabetes High blood pressure High cholesterol Cardiovascular disease Medication use Obstructive sleep apnea Restless leg syndrome Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) Peyronie's disease Prostate cancer treatment
What is the treatment for erectile dysfunction?,"'Nowadays, there are many options for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Before suggesting pharmacological help, the doctor may suggest a change in lifestyle habits. Since many causes of erectile dysfunction are disorders in which lifestyle changes will have a positive effect, addressing these issues can be helpful. Therefore, regular ''exercise'', a healthy ''diet'', ''smoking cessation'', and limiting alcohol consumption can all have an impact on erectile function. Lifestyle changes can also include the use of a more genitalia-friendly bicycle seat.' "
What are nonsurgical treatments for erectile dysfunction?,"'There are many nonsurgical treatments available for erectile dysfunction.''Oral pharmacological treatment''The first line of pharmacological treatment is a class of medication called phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitors. This class includes ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra''), and ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis''). They will improve the ability to attain and maintain the erection, but sexual stimulation is still required for this medication to work. It should be taken some time before the sexual act is planned, but has a long timeframe of action. Side effects include visual disturbances, flushing, ''back pain'', and ''muscle pain''. Most side effects will abate with time. Usually, there will be no side effects at all. If you are taking ''nitrates'', phosphodiesterase inhibitors are not recommended since both medications taken simultaneously could cause severe ''hypotension'' (excessive ''low blood pressure'').'""Other types of oral medication are available. Apomorphine will enhance penile erection. And there are others. You should ask your doctor for other types of medication if the first one didn't work. Other treatment options should also be discussed.""'Transurethral therapy''Another type of pharmacological solution is a liquid that can be applied in the urethra that manages to improve erection. The erection can be maintained by applying an elastic band at the base of the penis.''Intracavernous injection''Injections at the base of the penis (intracavernous) can help attain and maintain an erection. There are various types of solutions that can be injected -- ''papaverine'"", alprostadil, and drug combinations. These injections are considered the most effective treatments for erectile dysfunction. They are also convenient for the patients who don't tolerate the oral therapies.""'Side effects include priapism (prolonged and painful erection) and fibrosis (scarring) but they are rare. There are ways to prevent these side effects (especially the prolonged and painful erection). The patient must follow the training and recommendations given at the beginning of this type of therapy. Contraindications for intracavernous injections include ''sickle cell anemia'', ''schizophrenia'', and severe psychiatric disorder.''Vacuum constriction device''This is a ''plastic'' cylinder connected to a vacuum-generating source that creates a negative pressure that draws the blood to the penis and makes way for an erection. An elastic band must be placed at the base of the penis to maintain the rigidity. The base of the penis will stay flaccid which might make the genitalia pivot. Side effects include ejaculatory problems, ''penile pain'', and blood pooling because of ruptured blood vessels (ecchymosis or ''petechiae'').' "
What are surgical treatments for erectile dysfunction?,"'There are numerous surgical treatments available for erectile dysfunction.''Penile vascular surgery'""Bypass surgery can be performed when there is an isolated artery occlusion disrupting blood flow in the penis. With any surgical procedure, it's necessary to consider the patient's surgical risk. Not all patients will be able to qualify for this type of intervention.""'Prosthesis''Various types of prosthesis are available -- malleable, mechanical, and inflatable. The patient should discuss the type he would prefer with his physician. The majority of prostheses will need replacement after 10 to 15 years. Surgical complications include infection, mechanical failure, cylinder leaks, perforation, penile shortening, autoinflation, and ''pain''.' "
What is premature ejaculation?,"'Premature ejaculation is the most common of the ejaculatory disorders; approximately 20% to 30% of men will have premature ejaculation. Ejaculation problems involve the improper discharge of sperm, prostatic, and seminal vesicle fluid through the urethra.''There are three different types of premature ejaculation:' Premature ejaculation is ejaculation after minimal or no physical stimulation. Retarded ejaculation is ejaculation after a long delay of physical stimulation. Retrograde ejaculation is orgasm without ejaculation, also called ""dry"" ejaculation."
What are the symptoms of premature ejaculation?,"'Classically, premature ejaculation includes:''Generally, premature ejaculators will only have about a minute or less of intravaginal time before they ejaculate.''Retarded ejaculation will present as a long delay of intravaginal time to the point where the patient will not be satisfied with the sexual relation.'""Anejaculation or retrograde ejaculation is the experience of a dry orgasm. The semen doesn't go out of the urethra. It can either flow to the bladder instead or not be produced at all. Following the sexual act in the latter case, patients will notice the presence of semen in their first urine."" Brief ejaculatory latency Loss of control Psychological distress in the patient and/or partner"
What causes premature ejaculation?,"'There are many potential causes of premature ejaculation. These include neurological causes that affect the following areas:''Premature ejaculation may be caused by negative conditioning and penile hypersensitivity. Retarded ejaculation may be an early sign of ''diabetes'' or may develop following surgery for ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''). Anejaculation (retrograde ejaculation) may be caused by radical ''prostatectomy'', cystoprostatectomy (removal of the bladder and the rectum), or the use of certain medications such as alpha-blockers (''tamsulosin'') and antidepressants (SSRIs).' Central control of ejaculation Innervations to the seminal tract Sensory innervation to the genitalia/prostate"
What is the treatment for premature ejaculation?,"'The treatment will vary according to the cause of premature ejaculation. Couples sexual therapy or psychological therapy can be useful when psychological causes are involved. Other nonpharmacological therapies include actively trying to ""hold it in."" Drug therapy has also proven to be successful. The medications used to treat premature ejaculation are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (TCAs).' "
What is disordered orgasm?,'Disordered orgasm is the inability to reach an orgasm after adequate stimulation. Orgasm is still a phenomenon that is poorly understood.' 
What causes disordered orgasm?,"'The causes of disordered orgasm include:' Psychiatric disorder Diabetic neuropathy Multiple sclerosis Complications from genital surgery Pelvic trauma Drugs (alpha-blockers, antidepressants)"
What is the treatment for disordered orgasm?,'Anorgasmia will be treated with psychiatric help or by treating the underlying cause.' 
What are other kinds of sexual dysfunction in men?,"""Another category of sexual problem is sexual pain. A penile lesion, injury, or a skin disease can be the cause among others. Men's sexual pain occurs less frequently than women's."" "
At what age do men experience sexual dysfunction?,"'There are normal changes in sexual function in the elderly. Older men can have the following symptoms of sexual dysfunction:''These phenomena can be experienced as patients grow old. Nevertheless, it can be addressed so that those affected can still have a very satisfactory sexual life.' Longer delay between stimulation and erection Erection is less turgid Ejaculation is less strong Ejaculatory volume is smaller Time between erections is longer Less sensitivity to tactile stimuli Lower testosterone Orgasm is attained more slowly"
Can sexual problems in men be prevented?,"'Lifestyle changes can be useful to help treat or improve sexual dysfunction, but more importantly, they can have an impact before the development of the disease itself. You can prevent the incidence of sexual troubles by having a healthy lifestyle; ''exercise'' regularly, eat well, limit alcohol consumption, and ''quit smoking'', if you are a smoker. Lifestyle changes take time and effort, but the results are worthwhile.' "
What is the prognosis for sexual problems in men? Can they be cured?,"'Prognosis varies according to the method of treatment and the underlying disease. Nowadays, many innovations have changed the face of male sexual dysfunction giving men multiple options regarding treatment. Not only do men have choices but the developing technologies and medications have also given men a voice to share their experience.'""It's very important that you speak to your doctor about any concern regarding your sexual function or that of your partner."" "
Which types of doctors or specialists treat sexual problems in men?,"'Psychiatrists, psychologists, and sexologists can be involved in the management of sexual dysfunction. Psychiatrists or psychologists can especially help when the cause of the dysfunction is psychogenic. Therapies targeting cognition and behavior usually have good success rates. Sexologists can also contribute to these therapies.' "
What Causes Sexual Problems?,"'Sexual dysfunction can be a result of a physical or psychological problem.' Physical causes: Many physical and/or medical conditions can cause sexual problems. These conditions include diabetes, heart disease, neurological diseases, hormonal imbalances, menopause, chronic diseases such as kidney disease or liver failure, and 
	alcoholism and drug abuse. In addition, the side effects of certain medications, including some 
	antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual desire and function. Psychological causes: These include work-related stress and anxiety, concern about sexual performance, marital or relationship problems, depression, feelings of guilt, and the effects of a past sexual trauma. "
Who Is Affected by Sexual Problems?,"'Both men and women are affected by sexual problems. Sexual problems occur in adults of all ages. Among those commonly affected are those in seniors, which may be related to a decline in health associated with ''aging''.' "
How Do Sexual Problems Affect Women?,"'The most common problems related to sexual dysfunction in women include:' Inhibited sexual desire: This involves a lack of sexual desire or interest in sex. Many factors can contribute to a lack of desire, including hormonal changes, medical conditions and treatments (for example cancer and chemotherapy), depression, pregnancy, stress, and fatigue. Boredom with regular sexual routines also may contribute to a lack of enthusiasm for sex, as can lifestyle factors, such as careers and the care of children. 
 Inability to become aroused: 
 For women, the inability to become physically aroused during sexual activity often involves insufficient vaginal lubrication. The inability to become aroused also may be related to anxiety or inadequate stimulation. In addition, researchers are investigating how blood flow problems affecting the vagina and clitoris may contribute to arousal problems. Lack of orgasm (anorgasmia): 
  This is the absence of sexual climax (orgasm). It can be caused by sexual inhibition, inexperience, lack of knowledge, and psychological factors such as guilt, anxiety, or a past sexual trauma or abuse. Other factors contributing to anorgasmia include insufficient stimulation, certain medications, and chronic diseases. 
   Painful intercourse: Pain during intercourse can be caused by a number of problems, including endometriosis, a pelvic mass, ovarian cysts, vaginitis, poor lubrication, the presence of 
scar tissue from surgery or a 
sexually transmitted disease. A condition called vaginismus is a painful, involuntary spasm of the muscles that surround the vaginal entrance. It may occur in women who fear that penetration will be painful and also may stem from a sexual phobia or from a previous traumatic or painful experience. 
"
How Is a Female Sexual Problem Diagnosed?,"""To diagnose a woman's sexual problem, the doctor likely will begin with a thorough evaluation of symptoms and a physical exam. The doctor may perform a ""'pelvic exam'' to evaluate the health of the reproductive organs and a ''Pap smear'' to detect changes in the cells of the cervix (to check for ''cancer'' or a pre-cancerous condition). He or she may order other tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the problem.''An evaluation of your attitude regarding sex, as well as other possible contributing factors (fear, ''anxiety'', past sexual trauma/abuse, relationship problems, ''alcohol'' or ''drug abuse'', for example) will help the doctor understand the underlying cause of the problem and make appropriate recommendations for treatment.' "
How Are Female Sexual Problems Treated?,"'The ideal approach to treating sexual problems in women involves a team effort between the woman, doctors, and trained therapists. Most types of sexual problems can be corrected by treating the underlying physical or psychological problems. Other treatment strategies focus on the following:' Providing education. Education about human anatomy, sexual function, and the normal changes associated with aging, as well as sexual behaviors and responses, may help a woman overcome her anxieties about sexual function and performance. Enhancing stimulation. This may include the use of erotic materials (videos or books), masturbation, and changes to sexual routines. 
   Providing distraction techniques. Erotic or non-erotic fantasies, exercises with intercourse, music, videos, or television can be used to increase relaxation and eliminate anxiety. 
   Encouraging non-coital behaviors. Non-coital behaviors (physically stimulating activity that does not include intercourse), such as sensual massage, can be used to promote comfort and increase communication between partners. 
   Minimizing pain. Using sexual positions that allow the woman to control the depth of penetration may help relieve some pain. The use of vaginal lubricants can help reduce pain caused by friction, and a warm bath before intercourse can help increase relaxation.

Can Female Sexual Problems Be Cured?,"'The success of treatment for female sexual dysfunction depends on the underlying cause of the problem. The outlook is good for sexual problems related to a treatable or reversible physical condition. Mild dysfunction that is related to stress, fear, or anxiety often can be successfully treated with counseling, education, and improved communication between partners.' "
How Do Hormones Affect Sexual Function?,"'Hormones play an important role in regulating sexual function in women. With the decrease in the female hormone estrogen that is related to aging and ''menopause'', many women experience some changes in sexual function as they age, including poor vaginal lubrication and decreased genital sensation. Further, research suggests that low levels of the male hormone testosterone also contribute to a decline in sexual arousal, genital sensation, and orgasm. Researchers still are investigating the benefits of hormones and other medications, including drugs like ''Viagra'', to treat sexual problems in women.' "
What Effect Does a Hysterectomy Have on Sexual Function?,"'Many women experience changes in sexual function after a ''hysterectomy'' (surgical removal of the uterus). These changes may include a loss of desire as well as decreased vaginal lubrication and genital sensation. These problems may be associated with the hormonal changes that occur with the loss of the uterus. Furthermore, nerves and blood vessels critical to sexual function can be damaged during the surgery.' "
How Does Menopause Affect a Woman's Sexual Function?,"'The loss of estrogen following ''menopause'"" can lead to changes in a woman's sexual functioning. Emotional changes that often accompany menopause can add to a woman's loss of interest in sex and/or ability to become aroused. ""'Hormone replacement therapy'' -- ''HRT'' -- may improve certain conditions, such as loss of vaginal lubrication and genital sensation, which can create problems with sexual function.''It should be noted that some ''postmenopausal'' women report an increase in sexual satisfaction. This may be due to decreased anxiety over getting ''pregnant''. In addition, postmenopausal woman often have fewer child-rearing responsibilities, allowing them to relax and enjoy intimacy with their partners.' "
"When Should I Call My Doctor About Sexual 
Problems?","'Many women experience a problem with sexual function from time to time. However, when the problems are persistent, they can cause distress for the women and her partner, and can have a negative impact on their relationship. If you consistently experience these problems, see your doctor for evaluation and treatment.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Facts you should know about sexual addiction," Sexual addiction, also often referred to as hypersexuality, sexual dependency and compulsive sexual behavior disorder, is a condition that involves the sufferer becoming excessively preoccupied with thoughts or behaviors that give a desired sexual effect. More than 30 million people suffer from a sexual addiction in the United States alone. Paraphilias are disorders that involve the sufferer becoming sexually aroused by objects or actions considered less conventional and/or less easily accessible to the sex addict. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) classifies sexual addictions as specific paraphilic disorders or as other specified paraphilic disorders. No one factor causes sexual addiction, but there are thought to be biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to the development of these disorders. Sex addicts suffer from a negative pattern of sexual behavior that leads to significant problems or distress. As is true with virtually any other mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has a sexual addiction. Therefore, health care practitioners diagnose these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information to distinguish sexual addiction from medical and other mental health disorders. Many people with a sexual addiction benefit from the support and structure of recovery groups or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). When compulsive sexual behaviors become severe, the sufferer may require inpatient treatment or participation in an intensive outpatient treatment program. Serotonergic (SSRI) antidepressants, antiseizure medications, naltrexone, and medications that decrease male hormones decrease the compulsive urges and/or impulses associated with sexual addictions for some sufferers. The prognosis of sexual addictions depends on a number of factors. Prevention of sexual addiction may involve interventions that enhance self-esteem and self-image, addressing emotional problems, educating children about the dangers of excessive internet use, monitoring and limiting computer use, and screening out pornographic sites. Sex addiction is associated with a number of potential medical, occupational, legal, social, and emotional complications. Research on sexual addiction includes exploring potential risk factors and developing accurate screening and assessment tools for these disorders."
"What is sexual addiction, and what are the types of sexual addiction?","'Hypersexuality, sexual dependency, and compulsive sexual behavior disorder are other names for sexual addiction. As with other dependencies, sexual addiction is a condition that involves the sufferer becoming excessively preoccupied with thoughts or behaviors that give a desired effect. It involves spending an exorbitant amount of time thinking about and/or engaging in sexually addictive behaviors. Examples of sexual behavioral addictions may involve easily accessible or less accessible (paraphilic) behaviors. Examples of more easily accessible addictive acts may include having one-night stands or multiple affairs, contacts with prostitutes, viewing pornographic pictures or videos, or compulsive ''masturbation''. The sufferer may engage in behaviors like frequenting chat rooms, engaging in personal ads, or making obscene phone calls.''Statistics show that a small percentage of college-aged people suffer from a sex addiction at any one time. In the general adult population, about 12 million people have a sex addiction.''Paraphilias are disorders that involve the sufferer becoming sexually aroused by objects or actions that are less conventional or less easily accessible to the addict. Examples of paraphilias include ''fetishism'' (arousal by objects or specific body parts), ''voyeurism'' (arousal by watching sexual behaviors), ''exhibitionism'' (arousal by having others view his or her sexual behaviors) and pedophilia (arousal by sexual contact with children). When paraphilias include the sufferer having obsessions about the object of their desire, they may be considered sexually addicted. The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM) only refers to nonparaphilic sexual addictions in the category of sexual disorder, not otherwise specified.''Sexually addictive behaviors have been described in modern times for more than 100 years. During the 19th century, people described sex addicts as frenetic masturbators and as having nymphomania (primarily ascribed to women), satyriasis (primarily assigned to men), compulsive sexuality, and sexual intoxication.' "
What are causes and risk factors for sexual addiction?,"'Though no single factor causes sexual addiction, there are biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to the development of these disorders. For example, the intoxication associated with sexual addiction is the result of changes in certain areas and chemicals in the brain elicited by the compulsion. Research differs somewhat in terms of gender-based patterns of sexual addiction. For example, some studies describe males who are introverted and highly educated as more inclined to develop an Internet addiction, including sexual Internet addiction. Other studies indicate that middle-aged women using home computers were more at risk for Internet sexual addiction.''Psychological risk factors for sexual addiction include ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The presence of a ''learning disability'' increases the risk of developing a sex addiction as well. As people with a history of suffering from drug, porn, or any other addiction are at risk for developing another addiction, being dependent on something else makes it more likely for sexual addiction to occur.''Sufferers of these disorders tend to be socially isolated and have personality traits like insecurity, ''impulsivity'', compulsivity, trouble with relationship stability and intimacy, low ability to tolerate frustration, and a tendency to have trouble coping with emotions. People who suffer sexual abuse are at somewhat higher risk of developing a sexual addiction.' "
What are sexual addiction symptoms and signs?,"'While the ''DSM'' has yet to describe specific diagnostic criteria for nonparaphilic sex addictions, some researchers have suggested symptoms and signs that are similar to other addictions for both paraphilic and nonparaphilic sex addictions. Specifically, sex addicts suffer from a negative pattern of sexual behavior that leads to significant problems or distress that may include the following:' A need for more amount or intensity of behavior to achieve the desired effect (tolerance) Physical or psychological feelings of withdrawal when unable to engage in the addictive behavior The person making plans for, engaging in, or recovering from the behavior more or longer than planned Desire or unsuccessful attempts to decrease or stop the behavior Neglecting important social, work, or school activities because of the behavior Continuing the behavior despite suffering physical or psychological problems because of or worsened by the sexual behavior."
How do medical professionals assess and diagnose sexual addiction?,"""As is true with virtually any mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has a sexual addiction. Therefore, health care practitioners diagnose these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information. The psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, psychiatric nurse, physician's assistant, or certified counselor will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has a medical condition that might have mental health symptoms.""'In asking questions about mental health symptoms, mental health professionals are often exploring if the individual suffers from sexual obsession or compulsions but also ''depression'' or ''manic'' symptoms, ''anxiety'', ''alcoholism'' or other ''substance abuse'', ''hallucinations'' or ''delusions'', as well as some personality and behavioral disorders that may have excessive sexual activity as part of the associated symptoms. Practitioners may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test as a screening tool for sexual addiction. Since some of the symptoms of sex addiction can also be co-occurring with other mental illnesses, the mental health screening is to determine if the individual suffers from an ''anxiety disorder'' like ''panic disorder'', ''generalized anxiety disorder'', ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), or the cyclical ''mood swings'' of ''bipolar disorder''. The examiner also explores whether the person with a sex addiction suffers from other mental illnesses like ''schizophrenia'', ''schizoaffective disorder'', and other ''psychotic disorders'' or a ''drug addiction'', personality, or behavior disorder like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'').''Any condition associated with hypersexual disordered behavior, like some developmental disorders, ''borderline personality disorder'', dependent personality disorder, ''antisocial personality disorder'', or ''multiple personality disorder'"" (MPD), may be particularly challenging to distinguish from a sex addiction. In order to assess the person's current emotional state, health care practitioners perform a mental-status examination, as well.""'In an effort to establish a sexual addiction diagnosis, health care professionals will work to distinguish sexual addictions from medical conditions that may include hypersexual symptoms. Examples of such conditions include ''seizures'', tumors, ''dementia'"", and Huntington's disease, which may involve injuries to certain areas of the brain like the frontal or temporal lobes and therefore affect behavior."" "
What is the treatment for sexual addiction?,"'Many people with a sexual addiction benefit from the support and structure of self-help recovery groups like Sex Addicts Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous. Therapists often use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help individuals with sex addiction learn their individual triggers for sexually destructive (acting out) behaviors, reevaluating distortions in their thoughts that contribute to their acting out behaviors, and ultimately controlling those behaviors. Some mental health professionals also use psychodynamic ''psychotherapy'"" to address sexual addiction. That approach to treatment focuses more on the addict's basic internal emotional developmental difficulties that contribute to the development of their hypersexual disorder. These difficulties began during childhood, often as a part of the afflicted person's relationships with early caretakers. When sexual compulsions become severe, the sufferer may require inpatient treatment centers or intensive outpatient programs.""'Serotonergic (SSRI) medications that are treatment options for depressive and ''anxiety'' disorders and mood stabilizers that treat ''bipolar disorder'' also decrease the compulsive urges associated with sexual addictions for some sufferers. Examples of SSRIs include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''fluvoxamine'' (''Luvox''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro'').''People generally tolerate SSRIs well, and side effects are usually mild. The most common side effects are ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', ''agitation'', ''insomnia'', and ''headache''. However, these side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use. Some patients experience sexual side effects, such as decreased sexual desire (''decreased libido''), delayed ''orgasm'', or an inability to have an orgasm. Some patients experience ''tremors'' with SSRIs. The so-called serotonergic (meaning caused by serotonin) syndrome is a serious neurologic condition associated with the use of SSRIs. High ''fevers'', ''seizures'', and ''heart''-rhythm disturbances characterizes serotonergic syndrome. This condition is very rare and appears only in very ill psychiatric patients taking multiple psychiatric medications.''Mood stabilizers like ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), ''divalproex'' sodium (''Depakote''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'') sometimes treat ''OCD'', particularly in individuals who also suffer from ''bipolar disorder'"". They may also be helpful in decreasing the impulsive behaviors suffered by some sex addicts. The side effects that professionals look for tend to vary depending on the prescribed medication. Health care professionals tend to watch for mild side effects like sleepiness when using Depakote or Tegretol or stomach upset when using one of those medications or Lamictal. Health care professionals also monitor patients for serious side effects like severely low white blood cell count in people taking Tegretol or severe autoimmune symptoms like Steven Johnson's syndrome in those taking Depakote and Lamictal.""'Naltrexone, a medication that decreases the effects of narcotic medications, may be useful for decreasing the sexual compulsions, sex drive, or arousal of some sex offenders. That may be particularly important for people who have a sexual addiction and seek celibacy to abstain from their compulsive sexual activity. That has also been found for medications that decrease male hormones, called anti-androgens. One example of an anti-androgenic medication is ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate (MPA), also known by its trade name of ''Depo-Provera''.' "
What is the prognosis of sexual addiction?,"'Studies show that the prognosis of sexual addictions depends on a number of factors, including the type of addiction, whether or not it involves paraphilic behaviors or, sexually violent behaviors, or if the person with the hypersexual disorder who engages in sexually violent behaviors suffers from another mental health diagnosis. For sexual offenders, factors that indicate a poor treatment prognosis include a higher number and more than one kind of sexual offences, having a previous criminal history, offending against boys outside their own family, low empathy for their victim, increased anger at the time of the offense, violent sexual fantasies, and attitudes that their victim enjoys it. Choosing an occupation that puts the offender in close proximity to potential victims and the use of sadomasochistic or pedophilic pornography are also associated with a worse prognosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent sexual addiction?,"'As the driving forces for sexual addiction seem to be more poor self-esteem rather than excessive thrill seeking, interventions that enhance self-esteem and self-image appear to be key in preventing these disorders. Suggestions for preventing Internet addiction may be useful in the prevention of sexual Internet addiction and include parents educating their children about the dangers of such behaviors, monitoring and limiting computer use, screening out pornographic Internet sites, offering other activities that do not involve computer use, and having a therapist address emotional problems like ''depression'' and ''anxiety'', which are risk factors for developing a sexual addiction.' "
What are complications of sexual addiction?,"'There are a number of potentially devastating complications of sexual addiction. Possible medical complications include contracting ''sexually transmitted diseases'', including the potentially fatal ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') or ''hepatitis B'' or C. Examples of occupational consequences include decreased work performance or attendance due to the preoccupation with the addiction. If the behaviors result in unwanted sexual advances on others, legal problems like sexual harassment or ''rape'' perpetration may result. Individuals whose sexual addiction involves attraction to minors might engage in child molestation.''Depending on the financial demands of the addiction, the sufferer of a sexual addiction may incur a great deal of debt or engage in illegal or otherwise unsafe activity associated with the behavior. Emotionally, individuals with a sexual addiction are at risk for terrible guilt and shame at their actions and the secrecy involved. They are also more likely to experience broken relationships, separation, divorce, and the many challenges involved.' "

Introduction to sexual and urological problems of diabetes,'Troublesome bladder symptoms and changes in sexual function are common health problems as people age. Having diabetes can mean early onset and increased severity of these problems. Sexual and urologic complications of diabetes occur because of the damage diabetes can cause to blood vessels and nerves. Men may have difficulty with erections or ejaculation. Women may have problems with sexual response and vaginal lubrication.''Urinary tract infections'' and bladder problems occur more often in people with diabetes. People who keep their diabetes under control can lower their risk of the early onset of these sexual and urologic problems.' 
Diabetes and sexual problems,"'Both men and women with diabetes can develop sexual problems because of damage to nerves and small blood vessels. When a person wants to lift an arm or take a step, the brain sends nerve signals to the appropriate muscles. Nerve signals also control internal organs like the ''heart'"" and bladder, but people do not have the same kind of conscious control over them as they do over their arms and legs. The nerves that control internal organs are called autonomic nerves, which signal the body to digest food and circulate blood without a person having to think about it. The body's response to sexual stimuli is also involuntary, governed by autonomic nerve signals that increase blood flow to the genitals and cause smooth muscle tissue to relax. Damage to these autonomic nerves can hinder normal function. Reduced blood flow resulting from damage to blood vessels can also contribute to sexual dysfunction."" "
What sexual problems can occur in men with diabetes?,"'Erectile Dysfunction''''Erectile dysfunction'' is a consistent inability to have an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. The condition includes the total inability to have an erection and the inability to sustain an erection.''Estimates of the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes vary widely, ranging from 20 to 75 percent. Men who have diabetes are two to three times more likely to have erectile dysfunction than men who do not have diabetes. Among men with erectile dysfunction, those with diabetes may experience the problem as much as 10 to 15 years earlier than men without diabetes. Research suggests that erectile dysfunction may be an early marker of diabetes, particularly in men ages 45 and younger.''In addition to diabetes, other major causes of erectile dysfunction include ''high blood pressure'', ''kidney disease'', ''alcohol abuse'', and blood vessel disease. Erectile dysfunction may also occur because of the side effects of medications, psychological factors, ''smoking'', and hormonal deficiencies.'""Men who experience erectile dysfunction should consider talking with a health care provider. The health care provider may ask about the patient's medical history, the type and frequency of sexual problems, medications, ""'smoking'' and drinking habits, and other health conditions. A physical exam and laboratory tests may help pinpoint causes of sexual problems. The health care provider will check blood glucose control and hormone levels and may ask the patient to do a test at home that checks for erections that occur during ''sleep''. The health care provider may also ask whether the patient is ''depressed'' or has recently experienced upsetting changes in his life.''Treatments for erectile dysfunction caused by nerve damage, also called neuropathy, vary widely and range from oral pills, a vacuum pump, pellets placed in the urethra, and shots directly into the penis, to surgery. All of these methods have advantages and disadvantages. Psychological counseling to reduce ''anxiety'' or address other issues may be necessary. Surgery to implant a device to aid in erection or to repair arteries is usually used as a treatment after all others fail.''Retrograde Ejaculation '' '""Retrograde ejaculation is a condition in which part or all of a man's semen goes into the bladder instead of out the tip of the penis during ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when internal muscles, called sphincters, do not function normally. A sphincter automatically opens or closes a passage in the body. With retrograde ejaculation, semen enters the bladder, mixes with urine, and leaves the body during urination without harming the bladder. A man experiencing retrograde ejaculation may notice that little semen is discharged during ejaculation or may become aware of the condition if ""'fertility'' problems arise. Analysis of a urine sample after ejaculation will reveal the presence of semen.''Poor blood glucose control and the resulting nerve damage can cause retrograde ejaculation. Other causes include prostate surgery and some medications.''Retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes or surgery may be helped with a medication that strengthens the muscle tone of the sphincter in the bladder. A ''urologist'' experienced in ''infertility'' treatments may assist with techniques to promote fertility, such as collecting sperm from the urine and then using the sperm for ''artificial insemination''.'  "
What sexual problems can occur in women with diabetes?,"'Many women with diabetes experience sexual problems. Although research about sexual problems in women with diabetes is limited, one study found 27 percent of women with ''type 1 diabetes'' experienced sexual dysfunction. Another study found 18 percent of women with ''type 1 diabetes'' and 42 percent of women with type 2 diabetes experienced sexual dysfunction.''Sexual problems may include''Decreased or absent sexual response can include the inability to become or remain aroused, reduced or no sensation in the genital area, and the constant or occasional inability to reach ''orgasm''.''Causes of sexual problems in women with diabetes include nerve damage, reduced blood flow to genital and vaginal tissues, and hormonal changes. Other possible causes include some medications, ''alcohol abuse'', ''smoking'', psychological problems such as ''anxiety'' or ''depression'', gynecologic infections, other diseases, and conditions relating to ''pregnancy'' or ''menopause''.'""Women who experience sexual problems or notice a change in sexual response should consider talking with a health care provider. The health care provider will ask about the patient's medical history, any gynecologic conditions or infections, the type and frequency of sexual problems, medications, smoking and drinking habits, and other health conditions. The health care provider may ask whether the patient might be ""'pregnant'' or has reached ''menopause'' and whether she is depressed or has recently experienced upsetting changes in her life. A physical exam and laboratory tests may also help pinpoint causes of sexual problems. The health care provider will also talk with the patient about blood glucose control.''Prescription or ''over-the-counter'' vaginal lubricants may be useful for women experiencing vaginal dryness. Techniques to treat decreased sexual response include changes in position and stimulation during sexual relations. Psychological counseling may be helpful. Kegel exercises that help strengthen the pelvic muscles may improve sexual response. Studies of drug treatments are under way.'  decreased vaginal lubrication, resulting in vaginal dryness uncomfortable or painful sexual intercourse decreased or no desire for sexual activity decreased or absent sexual response"
Diabetes and urologic problems,"'Urologic problems that affect men and women with diabetes include bladder problems and urinary tract infections.''Bladder Problems'""Many events or conditions can damage nerves that control bladder function, including diabetes and other diseases, injuries, and infections. More than half of men and women with diabetes have bladder dysfunction because of damage to nerves that control bladder function. Bladder dysfunction can have a profound effect on a person's quality of life. Common bladder problems in men and women with diabetes include the following:""'Overactive bladder.'' Damaged nerves may send signals to the bladder at the wrong time, causing its muscles to squeeze without warning. The symptoms of overactive bladder include''Poor control of sphincter muscles.'' Sphincter muscles surround the urethra - the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body - and keep it closed to hold urine in the bladder. If the nerves to the sphincter muscles are damaged, the muscles may become loose and allow leakage or stay tight when a person is trying to release urine.''Urine retention.'' For some people, nerve damage keeps their bladder muscles from getting the message that it is time to urinate or makes the muscles too weak to completely empty the bladder. If the bladder becomes too full, urine may back up and the increasing pressure may damage the kidneys. If urine remains in the body too long, an infection can develop in the kidneys or bladder. Urine retention may also lead to overflow ''incontinence'' - leakage of urine when the bladder is full and does not empty properly.''Diagnosis of bladder problems'""Diagnosis of bladder problems may involve checking both bladder function and the appearance of the bladder's interior. Tests may include x rays, urodynamic testing to evaluate bladder function, and ""'cystoscopy'', a test that uses a device called a cystoscope to view the inside of the bladder.''Treatment of bladder problems''Treatment of bladder problems due to nerve damage depends on the specific problem. If the main problem is urine retention, treatment may involve medication to promote better bladder emptying and a practice called timed voiding - urinating on a schedule - to promote more efficient urination. Sometimes people need to periodically insert a thin tube called a catheter through the urethra into the bladder to drain the urine. Learning how to tell when the bladder is full and how to ''massage'' the lower abdomen to fully empty the bladder can help as well. If urinary leakage is the main problem, medications, strengthening muscles with Kegel exercises, or surgery can help. Treatment for the urinary urgency and frequency of overactive bladder may involve medications, timed voiding, Kegel exercises, and surgery in some cases.''Urinary Tract Infections''Infections can occur when bacteria, usually from the ''digestive system'', reach the urinary tract. If bacteria are growing in the urethra, the infection is called ''urethritis''. The bacteria may travel up the urinary tract and cause a ''bladder infection'', called ''cystitis''. An untreated infection may go farther into the body and cause ''pyelonephritis'', a ''kidney infection''. Some people have chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. Symptoms of urinary tract infections can include''If the infection is in the kidneys, a person may have ''nausea'', feel ''pain'' in the back or side, and have a ''fever''. ''Frequent urination'' can be a sign of high blood glucose, so results from recent blood glucose monitoring should be evaluated.''The health care provider will ask for a urine sample, which will be analyzed for bacteria and pus. Additional tests may be done if the patient has frequent urinary tract infections. An ''ultrasound'' exam provides images from the echo patterns of sound waves bounced back from internal organs. An intravenous pyelogram uses a special dye to enhance x-ray images of the urinary tract. Cystoscopy might be performed.''Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent more serious infections. To clear up a ''urinary tract infection'', the health care provider will probably prescribe antibiotic treatment based on the type of bacteria in the urine. Kidney infections are more serious and may require several weeks of antibiotic treatment. Drinking plenty of fluids will help prevent another infection.''' urinary frequency - urination eight or more times a day or two or more times 
a night urinary urgency - the sudden, strong need to urinate immediately urge incontinence - leakage of urine that follows a sudden, strong urge to urinate a frequent urge to urinate pain or burning in the bladder or urethra during urination cloudy or reddish urine in women, pressure above the pubic bone in men, a feeling of fullness in the rectum"
Who is at risk for developing sexual and urologic problems of diabetes?,"'Risk factors are conditions that increase the chances of getting a particular disease. The more risk factors people have, the greater their chances of developing that disease or condition. ''Diabetic neuropathy'' and related sexual and urologic problems appear to be more common in people who' have poor blood glucose control have high levels of blood cholesterol have high blood pressure are overweight are older than 40 smoke are physically inactive"
Can diabetes-related sexual and urologic problems be prevented?,"'People with diabetes can lower their risk of sexual and urologic problems by keeping their blood glucose, blood pressure, and ''cholesterol levels'' close to the target numbers their health care provider recommends. Being physically active and maintaining a healthy weight can also help prevent the long-term complications of diabetes. For those who smoke, quitting will lower the risk of developing sexual and urologic problems due to nerve damage and also lower the risk for other health problems related to diabetes, including ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and kidney disease.'

Hope through research,"'The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) was established by Congress in 1950 as one of the National Institutes of Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NIDDK conducts and supports research on diabetes, glucose metabolism, and related conditions. NIDDK-supported research on the sexual and urologic complications of diabetes includes research conducted as part of the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study. The EDIC is an observational follow-up study of people who originally participated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The DCCT showed that intensive blood glucose control can reduce the risk of complications of ''type 1 diabetes''. EDIC study results suggest that tight glucose control can delay the onset of erectile dysfunction in men with type 1 diabetes.''A recent study focused on ''urinary incontinence in women'' at high risk for developing ''type 2 diabetes'' who participated in the NIDDK-sponsored ''Diabetes Prevention'' Program (DPP). The women had pre-diabetes, a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. Women who were in the DPP group that used a lifestyle change approach to diabetes ''prevention'' and lost 5 to 7 percent of their weight through dietary changes and increased physical activity were compared with those in other DPP groups who received standard education and maintained a stable weight. The women in the lifestyle intervention group had fewer problems with ''urinary incontinence'' than women in the other groups. This finding adds to other results of the DPP study that indicate the value of lifestyle changes for preventing or delaying the development of ''type 2 diabetes''.''Participants in ''clinical trials'' can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research. For information about current studies, visit ''www.ClinicalTrials.gov''.' "
What is the most common cause of sex problems among men and women?,"'While they can take many forms, sexual problems are defined as any physical or emotional issue that prevents a couple from achieving a mutually satisfying intimate relationship. Among the most common for men include prostate problems, a decrease in the blood supply to the penis due to ''diabetes'', ''heart disease'', or other health concerns, nerve damage to the spinal cord, or a decrease in the hormone testosterone. ''Common sexual problems in women common problems include a lack of desire caused by a decrease in the hormone estrogen, ''thyroid disorders'' (which can also affect some men), and ''pain'' during intercourse caused by any number of vaginal problems, including a lack of lubrication. ''Some couples also find that the use of certain ''drugs'' can also cause sexual problems. These include ''alcohol'', ''nicotine'', narcotics, ''stimulants'', some ''blood pressure'' drugs, ''antihistamines'', and certain ''antidepressant'' medications.' "
What is the most common sexual problem in men?,"'Studies show it is ''premature ejaculation'', which can affect up to 75% of men. Clinically it is defined as the release of the ejaculate from the penis either before intercourse can take place, or quickly after it starts, usually within less than 15 ""thrusts."" While every man will experience premature ejaculation at least once in their life, for some the problem is chronic. When this is the case causes can be linked to a highly sensitive and easily stimulated nervous system, ''obsessive compulsive disorder'"", or sometimes a lack of control over the body's response to excitement. A frequently overlooked cause of temporary premature ejaculation is an infection in the ""'prostate gland'' known as ''prostatitis''. When this is the case, a course of antibiotics often solves the problem. Temporary problems can also result from ''stress'', or from the use of certain medications including some ''cold'' pills.''Treatments for chronic premature ejaculation include the antidepressant medication ''Anafranil'' taken 12 hours before sex, and use of a ''condom'' to help reduce sensation. Sometimes a prescription ''lidocaine'' cream can also help by reducing sensation, but that can also impact the partner.' "
What is the true definition of erectile dysfunction -- and what are the most common causes?,"'Erectile dysfunction'' (''ED''), also known as ''impotence'', has a far broader definition than many couples realize. It includes, of course, not being able to obtain an erection, but also the inability to sustain an erection sufficient for intercourse, as well as the inability to ejaculate on a consistent basis. ''While once believed to be largely an emotional problem, today doctors know ''ED'' is often the result of other health concerns including ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', ''kidney failure'', early ''heart disease'', prostate problems, and ''depression''. Additionally, ''alcohol abuse'' is a major contributing factor, and in some men, ''cigarette smoking''. Chronic ''stress'' can also play a role. In some men certain drugs can result in ''erectile dysfunction'', most notably some ''high blood pressure'' medications and some treatments for ''depression''.' "
What causes sexual dysfunction in women?,"'Unlike men who require physiological events to have intercourse, women have no such restrictions. As such, the most common reasons for sexual dysfunction are often based in matters of desire, sexual arousal, or sometimes ''painful intercourse''. Some women also report an inability to have an ''orgasm'' or experience ''pain'' when achieving one.''While a decrease in desire can be caused by many things, including a negative relationship with a partner, or other life stresses, physical causes are often traced to a decrease in the hormones estrogen and testosterone that occur during ''menopause''. Not only can this put a damper on desire, it can also cause a decrease in vaginal lubrication making it more difficult to become aroused and causing intercourse to be painful. In addition, certain illnesses, most notably a thyroid disorder or ''depression'"", can also impact a woman's desire. The inability to achieve orgasm is seldom caused by a physical problem, but more often the result of inadequate stimulation by a woman's partner."" "
What causes pain in the penis?,"'Like in any other part of the body, pain in the penis can be the result of many things, including infection, ''trauma'', or disease. Excessive manipulation can sometimes lead to pain, as can simple things such as ''insect bites'' or ''pimples''. At the same time, painful lesions or sores on the penis may be ''genital herpes'' or another infection. Additionally, ''prostate inflammation'', ''urethritis'' (an infection of the urinary tube frequently caused by ''gonorrhea'' or''chlamydia''), and sometimes ''sickle cell anemia'"" can also cause penis pain. A condition known as Peyronie's disease results in an abnormal bend in the penis that makes intercourse painful for a man. In rare instances, pain can be a sign of ""'penile cancer'', so always check with your doctor if discomfort is significant and does not subside within a few days.' "
Why do some women have painful intercourse?,"'Medically known as dyspareunia, in up to 80% of women the cause is physiological. This can be the result of a decrease in female hormones leading to ''vaginal dryness'', the presence of yeast or other sexually transmitted infections, ''cystitis'' orurethritis (infections of the urinary tract), or certain orthopaedic problems. In some instances, even chronic ''constipation'' may play a role. A condition known as vulvar vestibulitis, an inflammation in a particular area of the vagina, is the most commonly overlooked cause of dyspareunia.''A specific type of dyspareunia known as vaginismus causes involuntary spasms of the muscles within the vagina. In some instances, they can be so strong, the vagina seals shut making penetration extremely painful or sometimes, impossible. It often has roots in psychological trauma.' "
"What is retrograde ejaculation, and how is it treated?","""A form of male sexual dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation means the ejaculate fluid that normally leaves the penis during orgasm takes a wrong biological turn and ends up depositing in the bladder. Here it mixes with urine and eventually leaves the body as a waste product. The problem isn't harmful unless the couple is ""'trying to conceive''. Retrograde ejaculation can occur either partially or completely. In either instance the cause is frequently linked to prior prostate or urethral surgery, ''diabetes'', and the use of certain drugs including ''medications for high blood pressure''. Controlling blood ''sugar'' can help improve the problem, as can some epinephrine-like drugs. Sometimes switching blood pressure medications also works.' "
Is having an erection for an extended period of time dangerous?,"'A lot depends on your definition of ""extended."" The condition itself is known as ''priapism'"" and it's defined, in clinical terms, as an erection that lasts four hours or more without sexual stimulation. Normally, stimulation causes blood to flow into the penis, which in turn results in an erection. After ejaculation -- or if stimulation is discontinued -- the blood drains and the erection recedes. When priapism occurs, blood that is sent to fill the penis becomes trapped, causing the erection to remain without relief. Not only can this be extremely painful, if not treated early on it can result in scarring inside the penis, and sometimes, permanent ""'erectile dysfunction''. Priapism can occur in any male, even newborns, but most commonly develops between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, and 20 and 50 years old. Treatment can be as simple as applying ice packs, or may involve injecting the penis with medications, or removing blood from the penis to reduce pain and swelling. Occasionally surgery is necessary to restore proper blood flow and drainage.' "
Which medications commonly cause sex problems for men or women?,"'The most well-known medications are antidepressant drugs such as ''Prozac'', or tranquilizers, such as ''Valium'', both of which can impact sex drive in both men and women. For women, certain ''birth control pills'' can put a damper on desire, as can some formulations of ''HRT'' used to treat ''menopause symptoms''. Drugs known to increase the risk of impotency in men include certain ''high blood pressure'' drugs, antihistamines used for colds or ''allergies'', somenonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') (like ''ibuprofen''), ''heartburn'' drugs such as ''Tagamet'', ''Zantac'', and''Pepcid'', some ''lipid''-lowering drugs for ''cholesterol'', and certain medications used to treat '""Parkinson's""' disease or ''cancer''.' "
Is it true that sex can actually give some people a headache?,"""Yes, it's true. Medically, the condition is known as coital cephalalgia, and surprisingly, it affects men more often than women -- surprising because in general women get more ""'headaches'"" than men. While no one is certain what's behind the problem, some say it may be related to the sudden change in blood flow and subsequent drop in blood pressure following orgasm. Others contend it may be the result of a release of adrenaline that floods the body during periods of intense sexual activity. While some folks can have sex ""'headaches'' for several weeks followed by permanent remission, for others the problem may come and go indefinitely, or sometimes be present with every sexual encounter. Although you might not suffer from ''migraine'' ''headaches'', sex ''headaches'"" are thought to be chemically related and frequently respond to similar treatments. One word of caution: Don't assume that a ""'headache'' you experience after sex is a sex ''headache'"". Experts say sometimes benign lesions in the brain or aneurysms (a blood vessel disorder) can also cause headaches after sex. To rule out such problems, don't diagnose yourself -- see your doctor.""'WebMD Medical Reference' "
Introduction to the sexual response cycle,"'The sexual response cycle refers to the sequence of physical and emotional changes that occur as a person becomes sexually aroused and participates in sexually stimulating activities, including intercourse and ''masturbation''. Knowing how your body responds during each phase of the cycle can enhance your relationship and help you pinpoint the cause of any sexual problems.'  "
What Are the Phases of the Sexual Response Cycle?,"'The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, ''orgasm'"", and resolution. Both men and women experience these phases, although the timing usually is different. For example, it is unlikely that both partners will reach orgasm at the same time. In addition, the intensity of the response and the time spent in each phase varies from person to person. Understanding these differences may help partners better understand one another's bodies and responses, and enhance the sexual experience."" "
Phase 1: Excitement,"'General characteristics of the excitement phase, which can last from a few minutes to several hours, include the following:' Muscle tension increases. Heart rate quickens and breathing is accelerated. Skin may become flushed (blotches of redness appear on the chest and back). Nipples become hardened or erect. Blood flow to the genitals increases, resulting in swelling of the woman's clitoris and labia minora (inner lips), and erection of the man's penis. Vaginal lubrication begins. The woman's breasts become fuller and the vaginal walls begin to swell. The man's testicles swell, his scrotum tightens, and he begins secreting a lubricating liquid."
Phase 2: Plateau,"'General characteristics of the plateau phase, which extends to the brink of orgasm, include the following:' The changes begun in phase 1 are intensified. The vagina continues to swell from increased blood flow, and the vaginal walls turn a dark purple. The woman's clitoris becomes highly sensitive (may even be painful to touch) and retracts under the clitoral hood to avoid direct stimulation from the penis. The man's testicles are withdrawn up into the scrotum. Breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure continue to increase. Muscle spasms may begin in the feet, face, and hands. Muscle tension increases."
Phase 3: Orgasm,"'The orgasm is the climax of the sexual response cycle. It is the shortest of the phases and generally lasts only a few seconds. General characteristics of this phase include the following:' Involuntary muscle contractions begin. Blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing are at their highest rates, with a rapid intake of oxygen. Muscles in the feet spasm. There is a sudden, forceful release of sexual tension. In women, the muscles of the vagina contract. The uterus also undergoes rhythmic contractions. In men, rhythmic contractions of the muscles at the base of the penis result in the ejaculation of semen. A rash, or ""sex flush"" may appear over the entire body."
Phase 4: Resolution,"'During resolution, the body slowly returns to its normal level of functioning, and swelled and erect body parts return to their previous size and color. This phase is marked by a general sense of well-being, enhanced intimacy and, often, ''fatigue''. Some women are capable of a rapid return to the orgasm phase with further sexual stimulation and may experience multiple orgasms. Men need recovery time after orgasm, called a refractory period, during which they cannot reach orgasm again. The duration of the refractory period varies among men and usually lengthens with advancing age.''SOURCE:''Discovery Health.''Reviewed by Robert S.

How does menopause affect a woman’s sexual life?,"'Menopause'' marks the end of the reproductive era in a woman’s life. Some women view it positively as periods no longer trouble them and there is no chance of ''getting pregnant'' even with unprotected sex. However, as the estrogen and testosterone levels take a plunge during ''menopause'', some women experience the sexual side effects of ''menopause''. These are''Some other problems that come with menopause can also aggravate the sexual side effects of menopause. These include' Vaginal dryness: A decrease in estrogen levels causes less blood supply to the vagina. This causes vaginal thinning and drying leading to vaginal itching and burning. As a result, penetration can become painful or uncomfortable. A decrease in sexual desire, response, and pleasure: Reduced estrogen levels can also make the clitoris less sensitive. Orgasms may become weaker, take longer to come or their frequency gets curtailed drastically. Bladder control problem Hot flashes Depression  Anxiety  Medications Insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep) Other health issues"
How can women treat vaginal dryness during menopause?,"'Water-based lubricants:'' Women can use water-based ''over-the-counter'' lubricants before and after sex. They should avoid using oil-based lubricants as these can damage the latex of the ''condom''; if the woman is at the perimenopausal stage, she can still get ''pregnant'' or contract ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'') from her partner.''Vaginal moisturizers: ''Applying over-the-counter moisturizers every few days can help increase moisture over the vaginal area.''Estrogen cream, tablet or ring: ''Application of estrogen cream or inserting an estrogen tablet or ring into the vagina helps increase the sensations and moisture.''Oral hormonal therapy: ''Prescription medicines such as an oral pill containing estrogen and ''progesterone'' or only progestin can help combat ''vaginal dryness'' and reduce the ''pain''/discomfort during sex.\xa0''Non-hormonal tablets: ''Ospemifene (Osphena) is a non-hormonal oral pill that is taken once a day and is effective in making the vagina thicker and thereby treats vaginal dryness. This is a prescription medication and consultation with a doctor is necessary before taking it. Another drug by the name of flibanserin is an ''antidepressant'' and it is also used for low sexual drive.''Bioidentical hormone therapy'':'' These prescription medications contain natural hormones made from plant derivatives and have been shown to help treat menopausal symptoms, including vaginal dryness. But, the FDA has advised caution with their use as there are insufficient studies that prove their safety.' "
How can women deal with the sexual side effects of menopause? 10 ways,"'Some steps and lifestyle modifications can help women deal with the sexual side effects that come with menopause. These are''Women who fail to find any improvement with the above measures and feel the need to be sexually active should visit a doctor who will help them chalk out a tailor-made therapy. The doctor may prescribe the ‘Eros Clitoral Therapy Device’ that applies a gentle vacuum to the clitoris and increases the vaginal blood flow.\xa0 This device may help\xa0 provide sexual satisfaction that is lost in some women after menopause.' Being physically active: Physical activity can lift a woman’s mood and improve her body image. This can help increase sexual drive. Avoiding smoking: Smoking causes a further drop in estrogen levels making it difficult for a woman to get aroused. Avoiding drugs and alcohol: They can dampen a woman’s sexual response. Treating vaginal dryness: Applying a vaginal lubricant before and after sex helps reduce pain and discomfort. Having sex frequently: Having sex more often enhances the vaginal blood supply, thereby improving vaginal health. Talking with a partner: Women can discuss issues about comfort during sex with their partner. They can ask them to be patient and allow time for getting aroused (arousal is associated with fluid secretion) which can help them have comfortable sex. Experimenting with different positions: If intercourse is painful, women can suggest their partner try new positions that may be more comfortable.  Practicing pelvic floor exercises: These exercises increase vaginal blood flow and also help strengthen the muscles involved in sexual arousal. Not using harsh products: Bubble bath and strong soaps might irritate the vagina and cause infections.  Vibrators: A small bullet vibrator or getting the partner to wear a vibrating ring during sex can increase the chance of having an orgasm."
What to do if you have been diagnosed with an STD?,"'If you are diagnosed with a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD''), you must observe the following precautions:' Immediately contact your doctor/venereologist/gynecologist Contact your partner(s) and let them know that they also need to get tested and treated Abstinence from sex until the infection is either cured or until your doctor gives approval In case of bacterial infection, you should abstain from sex until the medications have cured you and your partner. In case of a viral infection, you should abstain from sex as long as you or your partner are on the antiviral medications."
What things one should know during the treatment of an STD?,"'Following are the things you should know while seeking help from your doctor:' If you are diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD), do not try to self-medicate. These diseases are contagious and serious, so you must see a doctor. If the infection is bacterial, you can be cured with antibiotics if they are started early enough. Your doctor may prescribe you antivirals to manage your symptoms, but a small amount of virus may continue to exist in your system. Hepatitis B vaccination may help you to protect from contracting Hepatitis B; however, it cannot treat it.  If you have been given antibiotics for your STD infection by your doctor, you should take the entire prescribed drug course even if the symptoms go away. You should not take other subsequent medications without asking your doctor to avoid undesirable medicine interactions."
What are the specific treatments for curable STDs?,"'The treatments, complications, and outcomes for viral STIs depend on the particular virus:''Clap (''Gonorrhea''):\xa0''Chancroid'' (''Syphilis''):\xa0''Trich (''Trichomoniasis''):\xa0' Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics once you are tested positive for gonorrhea or even if you have no symptoms but are exposed to them.  Your partner will also have to be treated even if they have no symptoms.  Certain types of gonorrhea may not respond to some antibiotics and then you may need to take more than one drug to fight against gonorrhea. You must make sure that your partner also seeks treatment.  You should get retested after three months to make sure the infection has been cleared, even if your partner has been treated.  Failure to treat gonorrhea infection may cause permanent damage to your sex organs and the ability to get pregnant. Your doctor may prescribe penicillin if you get Chancroid.  Early treatment is essential to prevent the bacteria from spreading and causing further damage to other organs. Genital warts (Human papillomavirus [HPV]):  Most genital warts will disappear without treatment, so your doctor may choose to do nothing. However, you will still carry the virus that causes warts and can still transmit it to your partners. If you do choose to treat genital warts, you have several options, such as freezing with nitrogen, cryotherapy, acid therapy, and surgical removal. You can still transmit the infection to others even if you clear the infection. Infection by this organism is treated with the antifungal drug, and 90% of the time it gets cured.  If you're pregnant, you may be given the drug in your second or third trimester.  Your partner should also get treated.  You get retested after three months to be certain that the infection has cleared. Do this even if your partner has been treated."
What are the specific treatments for some incurable STDs?,"'Most ''STDs'' are curable through the use of antibiotics or antiviral medications. However, there are still some incurable ''STDs'':''Human immunodeficiency virus''/''Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''HIV/AIDS''):''Hepatitis B'':\xa0''\xa0''Herpes'':\xa0' The treatment focuses on keeping HIV levels in check.  Your doctor may prescribe you antiretroviral drugs as a standard therapy if you are diagnosed with HIV infection.  Usually, you will be given several drug cocktails. When to begin HIV treatment is still controversial. Some doctors may start it early for better management of HIV infection, whereas others wait because of unpleasant side effects and drug resistance.  You must talk to your doctor about your opinion about the beginning of antiretroviral therapy. The goal of hepatitis B treatment is to stop liver damage by preventing the virus from spreading.  Your doctor may prescribe antivirals such as adefovir, entecavir, interferon-alpha, and lamivudine.  Each has benefits and side effects that you should discuss with your doctor.  If you develop significant liver damage from hepatitis B, a liver transplant may be necessary. Once you get infected with herpes simplex virus, the virus remains in your body for life. After the first outbreak, herpes may flare up several times per year, but these episodes may decrease over time.  Antiviral medications (e.g., Famvir) can help reduce the length and severity of both the initial and subsequent herpes outbreaks. If you have outbreaks often, your doctor may give you daily doses of suppressive therapy to prevent you from getting a herpes outbreak."
What are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?,"'Sexually transmitted diseases'' (STDs) are infections that can be transferred from one person to another through any type of sexual contact. STDs are sometimes referred to as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since they involve the transmission of a disease-causing organism from one person to another during sexual activity. It is important to realize that sexual contact includes more than just sexual intercourse (vaginal and anal). Sexual contact includes kissing, oral-genital contact, and the use of sexual ""toys,"" such as vibrators. STDs probably have been around for thousands of years, but the most dangerous of these conditions, the ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS'' or ''HIV'' disease), has only been recognized since 1984.''Many STDs are treatable, but effective cures are lacking for others, such as ''HIV'', ''HPV'', and ''hepatitis B'' and ''hepatitis C''. Even gonorrhea, once easily cured, has become resistant to many of the older traditional antibiotics. Many STDs can be present in, and spread by, people who do not have any symptoms of the condition and have not yet been diagnosed with an ''STD''. Therefore, public awareness and education about these infections and the methods of preventing them is important.''There really is no such thing as ""safe"" sex. The only truly effective way to prevent STDs is abstinence. Sex in the context of a monogamous relationship wherein neither party is infected with an STD also is considered ""safe."" Most people think that kissing is a safe activity. But unfortunately, ''syphilis'', ''herpes'', and other infections can be contracted through this relatively simple and apparently harmless act. All other forms of sexual contact carry some risk. Condoms are commonly thought to protect against STDs. Condoms are useful in decreasing the spread of certain infections, such as ''chlamydia'' and gonorrhea; however, they do not fully protect against other infections such as genital herpes, ''genital warts'', syphilis, and ''AIDS''. ''Prevention'' of the spread of STDs is dependent upon the counseling of at-risk individuals and the early diagnosis and treatment of infections.' "
What are the most common STDs in women?,"'Common STDs in women include Chlamydia, genital herpes, ''human papillomavirus'' (HPV) infection, syphilis, and gonorrhea. In 2019 the ''Sexually Transmitted Disease'' Surveillance Report released US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that the three most common reportable STDs- syphilis, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia- were on the rise. The numbers of syphilis and gonorrhea cases reported from 2017-2018 were higher than any point since 1991, and the number of Chlamydia cases reported (almost 1.7 million cases) was the highest ever recorded.''A serious consequence of the increase in syphilis is a dramatic increase in the number of newborns affected by syphilis. Congenital syphilis is passed from a mother the baby during ''pregnancy'' is a serious condition that can lead to ''miscarriage'', ''stillbirth'', ''newborn'' death, and severe medical and neurological problems.' "
1. Gonorrhea,"'Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection caused by the organism ''Neisseria gonorrheae'' (also known as gonococcus bacteriae) that is transmitted by sexual contact. Gonorrhea is one of the oldest known sexually transmitted diseases. It is estimated that over one million women are currently infected with gonorrhea. Among women who are infected, a significant percentage also will be infected with chlamydia, another type of bacteria that causes another STD. (Chlamydia infection is discussed later in this article.)''Contrary to popular belief, gonorrhea cannot be transmitted from toilet seats or door handles. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea requires very specific conditions for growth and reproduction. It cannot live outside the body for longer than a few minutes, nor can it live on the skin of the hands, arms, or legs. It survives only on moist surfaces within the body and is found most commonly in the vagina, and, more commonly, the cervix. (The cervix is the end of the uterus that protrudes into the vagina.) It can also live in the tube (urethra) through which urine drains from the bladder. Gonorrhea can also exist in the back of the throat (from oral-genital contact) and in the rectum.''A majority of infected women have no symptoms, especially in the early stages of the infection. When women do experience signs and symptoms gonorrhea they include''If untreated, gonorrhea can lead to a severe pelvic infection with inflammation of the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. Gonorrhea can also spread through the body to infect joints to cause gonococcal ''arthritis''. Gonorrheal infection of the Fallopian tubes can lead to a serious, painful infection of the pelvis known as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' or PID. PID occurs in a significant portion of women with gonorrheal infection of the uterine cervix. Symptoms of pelvic infection include ''fever'', pelvic cramping, ''abdominal pain'', or ''pain'' with intercourse. Pelvic infection can lead to difficulty in ''becoming pregnant'' or even sterility. Occasionally, if the infection is severe enough, a localized area of infection and pus (an ''abscess'') forms, and major surgery may be necessary and even lifesaving. Gonorrhea infection in people with conditions causing serious abnormal immune function, such as ''AIDS'', can also be more serious.''Testing for gonorrhea is done by swabbing the infected site (rectum, throat, cervix) and identifying the bacteria in the laboratory either through culturing of the material from the swab (growing the bacteria) or identification of the genetic material from the bacteria. Sometimes the tests do not show bacteria because of sampling errors (the sampled area does not contain bacteria) or other technical difficulties, even when the woman has an infection. Newer tests to diagnose gonorrhea involve the use of DNA probes or amplification techniques (for example, ''polymerase chain reaction'', or ''PCR'') to identify the genetic material of the bacteria. These tests are more expensive than cultures but typically yield more rapid results.''In the past, the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea was fairly simple. A single injection of ''penicillin'' cured almost every infected person. Unfortunately, there are new ''strains'' of gonorrhea that have become resistant to various antibiotics, including ''penicillins'', and are therefore more difficult to treat. Fortunately, gonorrhea can still be treated by other injectable or oral medications.''Uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum, are usually treated by a single injection of ceftriaxone or by oral ''cefixime'' (''Suprax''). For uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the pharynx, the recommended treatment is ceftriaxone in a single IM dose.''Alternative regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum include spectinomycin in nonpregnant women (not available in the United States) or single doses of other cephalosporins such as ceftizoxime or cefoxitin, administered with ''probenecid'' (Benemid), 1 g orally; or cefotaxime.''Treatment for gonorrhea should always include medication that will treat chlamydia [for example, ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'', ''Zmax'') or ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox'' and others)] as well as gonorrhea, because gonorrhea and chlamydia frequently exist together in the same person. The sexual partners of women who have had either gonorrhea or chlamydia must receive treatment for both infections since their partners may be infected as well. Treating the partners also prevents reinfection of the woman. Women suffering from PID or gonococcal arthritis require more aggressive treatment that is effective against the bacteria that cause gonorrhea as well as against other organisms. These women often require intravenous administration of antibiotics.''It is important to note that doxycycline, one of the recommended ''drugs'' for treatment of PID, is not recommended for use in ''pregnant'' women.''Gonorrhea is one of the easier STDs to prevent because the bacterium that causes the infection can survive only under certain conditions. The use of condoms protects against gonorrhea infection. Since the organism can live in the throat, condoms should be used during oral-genital contact as well.'  burning during urination, frequent urination, a yellowish vaginal discharge, redness and swelling of the genitals, and vaginal itching or burning."
2. Chlamydia,"'Chlamydia (''Chlamydia trachomatis'') is a bacterium that causes an infection that is very similar to gonorrhea in the way that it is spread and the symptoms it produces. It is common; estimates indicate 2.9 million infections occur annually in the U.S. Like gonorrhea, the chlamydia bacterium is found in the cervix and urethra and can live in the throat or rectum. Both infected men and infected women frequently lack ''symptoms of chlamydia'' infection. Thus, these individuals can unknowingly spread the infection to others. Another strain (type) of ''Chlamydia trachomatis'',, which can be distinguished in specialized laboratories, causes the STD known as ''lymphogranuloma venereum'' (''LGV''; see below).''The majority of women with chlamydia do not have symptoms. Cervicitis (infection of the uterine cervix) is the most common manifestation of the infection. While about half of women with chlamydial cervicitis have no symptoms, others may experience vaginal discharge or ''abdominal pain''. Infection of the urethra is often associated with chlamydial infection of the cervix. Women with infection of the urethra (''urethritis'') have the typical symptoms of a ''urinary tract infection'', including ''pain'' upon urination and the frequent and urgent need to urinate.''Chlamydia is very destructive to the Fallopian tubes. It can also cause severe pelvic infection. If untreated, some women with chlamydia will develop ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID; see above). Because it is common for infected women to have no symptoms, chlamydial infection is often untreated and results in extensive destruction of the Fallopian tubes, ''fertility'' problems and ''tubal pregnancy''.''Chlamydial infection, like gonorrhea, is associated with an increased incidence of premature births. In addition, the infant can acquire the infection during passage through the infected birth canal, leading to serious eye damage or ''pneumonia''. For this reason, all newborns are treated with eye drops containing an antibiotic that kills chlamydia. Treatment of all newborns is routine because of the large number of infected women without symptoms and the dire consequences of chlamydial eye infection to the newborn.''Chlamydia can be detected on material collected by swabbing the cervix during a traditional examination using a speculum, but noninvasive screening tests done on urine or on self-collected vaginal swabs are less expensive and sometimes more acceptable to patients. While culturing of the organism can confirm the diagnosis, this method is limited to research laboratories and forensic investigations. For routine diagnostic use, newer and inexpensive diagnostic tests that depend upon identification and amplification of the genetic material of the organism have replaced the older, time-consuming culture methods.''Treatment of chlamydia involves antibiotics. A convenient single-dose therapy for chlamydia is oral azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax). Alternative treatments are often used, however, because of the high cost of this medication. The most common alternative treatment is doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox, and others). Unlike gonorrhea, there has been little, if any, resistance of chlamydia to current antibiotics. There are many other antibiotics that also have been effective against chlamydia. As with gonorrhea, a ''condom'' or other protective barrier prevents the spread of the infection.' "
4. Syphilis,"'Syphilis is an STD that has been around for centuries. It is caused by a bacterial organism called a spirochete. The scientific name for the organism is ''Treponema pallidum''. The spirochete is a wormlike, spiral-shaped organism that wiggles vigorously when viewed under a microscope. It infects the person by burrowing into the moist, mucous-covered lining of the mouth or genitals. The spirochete produces a classic, painless ulcer known as a ''chancre''.''There are three stages of syphilis, along with an inactive (latent) stage. ''Formation of an ulcer (chancre) is the first stage.'' The chancre develops any time from 10 to 90 days after infection, with an average time of 21 days following infection until the first symptoms develop. Syphilis is highly ''contagious'' when the ulcer is present.'""The infection can be transmitted from contact with the ulcer that teems with spirochetes. If the ulcer is outside of the vagina or on the male's scrotum, condoms may not prevent transmission of the infection by contact. Similarly, if the ulcer is in the mouth, merely kissing the infected individual can spread the infection. The ulcer can resolve without treatment after three to six weeks, but the disease can recur months later as secondary syphilis if the primary stage is not treated.""'In most women, an early infection resolves on its own, even without treatment. However, some will proceed to the ''second stage of the infection called ""secondary"" syphilis'', which develops weeks to months after the primary stage and lasts from four to six weeks. Secondary syphilis is a systemic stage of the disease, meaning that it can involve various organ systems of the body. In this stage, patients can initially experience many different symptoms, but most commonly they develop a skin ''rash'', typically appearing on the palms of the hands or the bottoms of the ''feet'', that does not ''itch''. Sometimes the skin ''rash'' of secondary syphilis is very faint and hard to recognize; it may not even be noticed in all cases. This secondary stage can also include ''hair loss'', ''sore throat'', ''fever'', ''headaches'', and white patches in the nose, mouth, and vagina. There can be lesions on the genitals that look like ''genital warts'' but are caused by spirochetes rather than the wart virus. These wart-like lesions, as well as the skin rash, are highly contagious. The rash can occur on the palms of the hands, and the infection can be transmitted by casual contact.''Subsequent to secondary syphilis, some patients will continue to carry the infection in their body without symptoms. ''This is the so-called latent stage of the infection.'' Then, with or without a latent stage, which can last as long as 20 or more years, the third (tertiary) stage of the disease can develop. At this stage, syphilis usually is no longer contagious. Tertiary syphilis is also a systemic stage of the disease and can cause a variety of problems throughout the body including:''Syphilis can be diagnosed by scraping the base of the ulcer and looking under a special type of microscope (dark field microscope) for the spirochetes. However, because these spirochetes are rarely detected, the diagnosis is most often made and treatment is prescribed based upon the appearance of the chancre. Diagnosis of syphilis is complicated by the fact that the causative organism cannot be grown in the laboratory. Therefore, cultures of affected areas cannot be used for diagnosis.''Special blood tests can also be used to diagnose syphilis. The standard screening blood tests for syphilis are called the ''Venereal Disease'"" Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Rapid Plasminogen Reagent (RPR) tests. These tests detect the body's response to the infection, but not to the actual ""'Treponema'' organism that causes the infection. These tests are thus referred to as non-treponemal tests. Although the non-treponemal tests are very effective in detecting evidence of infection, they can also produce a positive result when no infection is actually present (so-called false-positive results for syphilis). Consequently, any positive non-treponemal test must be confirmed by a treponemal test specific for the organism causing syphilis, such as the microhemagglutination assay for ''T. pallidum'"" (MHA-TP) and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-ABS). These treponemal tests directly detect the body's response to ""'Treponema pallidum''.''Depending on the stage of disease and the clinical manifestations, the treatment options for syphilis vary. Long-acting penicillin injections have been very effective in treating both early and late stage syphilis. The treatment of neurosyphilis requires the intravenous administration of penicillin. Alternative treatments include oral doxycycline or ''tetracycline''.''Women who are infected during pregnancy can pass on the infection to the fetus through the placenta. Penicillin must be used in pregnant patients with syphilis since other antibiotics do not effectively cross the placenta to treat the infected fetus. Left untreated, syphilis can lead to ''blindness'' or even death of the infant.'

 abnormal bulging of the large vessel leaving the heart (the aorta), resulting in heart problems; the development of large nodules (gummas) in various organs of the body; infection of the brain, causing a stroke, mental confusion, meningitis (type of brain infection), problems with sensation, or weakness (neurosyphilis); involvement of the eyes leading to sight deterioration; or involvement of the ears resulting in deafness. The damage sustained by the body during the tertiary stage of syphilis is severe and can even be fatal."
5. Genital herpes,"'Genital herpes, also commonly called ""herpes,"" is a viral infection by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that is transmitted through intimate contact with the mucous-covered linings of the mouth or the vagina or the genital skin. The virus enters the linings or skin through microscopic tears. Once inside, the virus travels to the nerve roots near the spinal cord and settles there permanently.''When an infected person has a herpes outbreak, the virus travels down the nerve fibers to the site of the original infection. When it reaches the skin, the typical redness and ''blisters'' occur. After the initial outbreak, subsequent outbreaks tend to be sporadic. They may occur weekly or even years apart.''Two types of herpes ''viruses'' are associated with genital lesions: herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more often causes blisters of the mouth area while HSV-2 more often causes genital sores or lesions in the area around the anus. The outbreak of herpes is closely related to the functioning of the immune system. Women who have suppressed immune systems, because of ''stress'', infection, or medications, have more frequent and longer-lasting outbreaks.''Genital herpes is spread only by direct person-to-person contact. It is believed that a majority of sexually active adults carry the herpes virus. Part of the reason for the continued high infection rate is that most women infected with the herpes virus do not know that they are infected because they have few or no symptoms. In many women, there are ""atypical"" outbreaks where the only symptom may be mild ''itching'' or minimal discomfort. Moreover, the longer the woman has had the virus, the fewer the symptoms they have with their outbreaks. Finally, the virus can shed from the cervix into the vagina in women who are not experiencing any symptoms.''Once exposed to the virus, there is an incubation period that generally lasts 3 to 7 days before a lesion develops. During this time, there are no symptoms and the virus cannot be transmitted to others. An outbreak usually begins within two weeks of initial infection and manifests as an ''itching'' or tingling sensation followed by redness of the skin. Finally, a ''blister'' forms. The blisters and subsequent ulcers that form when the blisters break, are usually very painful to touch and may last from 7 days to 2 weeks. The infection is definitely contagious from the time of itching to the time of complete healing of the ulcer, usually within 2 to 4 weeks. However, as noted above, infected individuals can also transmit the virus to their sex partners in the absence of a recognized outbreak.''Genital herpes is suspected when multiple painful blisters occur in a sexually exposed area. During the initial outbreak, fluid from the blisters may be sent to the laboratory to try and culture the virus, but cultures only return a positive result in about 50% of those infected. In other words, a negative test result from a blister is not as helpful as a positive test result, because the test may be a false-negative test. However, if a sample of a fluid-filled blister (in the early stage before it dries up and crusts) tests positive for herpes, the test result is very reliable. Cultures taken during an initial outbreak of the condition are more likely to be positive for the presence of HSV than cultures from subsequent outbreaks.''There are also blood tests that can detect antibodies to the herpes viruses that can be useful in some situations. These tests are specific for HSV-1 or HSV-2 and are able to demonstrate that a person has been infected at some point in time with the virus, and they may be useful in identifying infection that does not produce characteristic symptoms. However, because false-positive results can occur and because the test results are not always clear-cut, they are not recommended for routine use in screening low-risk populations for HSV infection.''Other diagnostic tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the genetic material of the virus and rapid fluorescent antibody screening tests are used to identify HSV in some laboratories.''Although there is no known cure for herpes, there are treatments for the outbreaks. There are oral medications, such as ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax''), ''famciclovir'' (''Famvir''), or ''valacyclovir'' (''Valtrex'') that prevent the virus from multiplying and even shorten the length of the eruption. Although topical (applied directly on the lesions) agents exist, they are generally less effective than other medications and are not routinely used. Medication that is taken by mouth, or in severe cases intravenously, is more effective. It is important to remember that there is still no cure for genital herpes and that these treatments only reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks.''Since the initial infection with HSV tends to be the most severe episode, an antiviral medication usually is warranted. These medications can significantly reduce pain and decrease the length of time until the sores heal, but treatment of the first infection does not appear to reduce the frequency of recurrent episodes.''In contrast to a new outbreak of genital herpes, recurrent herpes episodes tend to be mild, and the benefit of antiviral medications is only derived if therapy is started immediately prior to the outbreak or within the first 24 hours of the outbreak. Thus, the antiviral drug must be provided for the patient in advance. The patient is instructed to begin treatment as soon as the familiar pre-outbreak ""tingling"" sensation occurs or at the very onset of blister formation.''Finally, suppressive therapy to prevent frequent recurrences may be indicated for those with more than six outbreaks in a given year. Acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex) may all be given as suppressive therapies.''Herpes can be spread from one part of the body to another during an outbreak.' Therefore, it is important not to touch the eyes or mouth after touching the blisters or ulcers. Thorough hand washing is a must during outbreaks. Clothing that comes in contact with ulcers should not be shared with others. Couples that want to minimize the risk of transmission should always use condoms if a partner is infected. Unfortunately, even when an infected partner isn't currently having an outbreak, herpes can be spread. Couples may also want to consider avoiding all sexual contact, including kissing, during an outbreak of herpes. Since an active genital herpes outbreak (with blisters) during labor and delivery can be harmful to the infant, pregnant women who suspect that they have genital herpes should tell their doctor. Women who have herpes and are pregnant can have a vaginal delivery as long as they are not experiencing symptoms or actually having an outbreak while in labor."
6. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and genital warts,"'More than 40 types of HPV, which are the cause of genital ''warts'' (also known as condylomata acuminata or venereal ''warts''), can infect the genital tract of men and women. These warts are primarily transmitted during sexual contact. Other, different HPV types generally cause ''common warts'' elsewhere on the body. HPV infection has long been known to be a cause of ''cervical cancer'' and other anogenital ''cancers'' in women, and it has also been linked with both anal and ''penile cancer'' in men.''HPV infection is now considered to be the most common ''sexually transmitted infection'' in the US, and it is believed that at a majority of the reproductive-age population has been infected with sexually transmitted HPV at some point in life.''HPV infection is common and does not usually lead to the development of warts, cancers, or specific symptoms. In fact, the majority of people infected with HPV have no symptoms or lesions at all. The ultimate test to detect HPV involves identification of the genetic material (DNA) of the virus.''Of note, it has not been definitively established whether the immune system is able to permanently clear the body of an HPV infection. For this reason, it is impossible to predict exactly how common HPV infection is in the general population.''Asymptomatic people (those without HPV-induced warts or lesions) who have HPV infections are still able to spread the infections to others through sexual contact.''A typical appearance of a genital lesion may prompt the physician to treat without further testing, especially in someone who has had prior outbreaks of genital warts. Genital warts usually appear as small, fleshy, raised ''bumps'', but they can sometimes be extensive and have a cauliflower-like appearance. They may occur on any sexually-exposed area. In many cases genital warts do not cause any symptoms, but they are sometimes associated with itching, burning, or tenderness.''HPV can sometimes be suspected by changes that appear on a ''Pap smear'', although Pap smears were not really designed to detect HPV. In the case of an abnormal Pap smear, the clinician will often do advanced testing on the material to determine if, and which kind, of HPV may be present. HPV can also be detected if a biopsy (for example, from a ''genital wart'' or from the uterine cervix) is sent to the laboratory for analysis.''There is no cure or treatment that can eradicate HPV infection, so the only treatment is to remove the lesions caused by the virus. Unfortunately, even removal of the warts does not necessarily prevent the spread of the virus, and genital warts frequently recur. None of the available treatments are ideal or clearly superior to others.'""A treatment that can be administered by the patient is a 0.5% solution or gel of podofilox (podophyllotoxin). The medication is applied to the warts twice per day for three days followed by 4 days without treatment. Treatment should be continued up to three to four weeks or until the lesions are gone. Podofilox may also be applied every other day for a total of three weeks. Alternatively, a 5% cream of imiquimod (a substance that stimulates the body's production of cytokines, chemicals that direct and strengthen the immune response) is likewise applied by the patient three times a week at bedtime, and then washed off with mild soap and water 6-10 hours later. The applications are repeated for up to 16 weeks or until the lesions are gone. Sinecatechin 15% ointment, a green-tea extract with an active product (catechins), is another topical treatment that can be applied by the patient. This drug should be applied three times daily until complete clearance of warts, for up to 16 weeks.""'Only an experienced physician can perform some of the treatments for genital warts. These include, for example, placing a small amount of a 10% to 25% solution of podophyllin resin on the lesions, and then, after a period of hours, washing off the podophyllin. The treatments are repeated weekly until the genital warts are gone. An 80% to 90% solution of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloracetic acid (BCA) can also be applied weekly by a physician to the lesions. Injection of 5-fluorouracil epinephrine gel into the lesions has also been shown to be effective in treating genital warts.''Alternative methods include ''cryotherapy'' (freezing the genital warts with liquid nitrogen) every one to two weeks, surgical removal of the lesions, or laser surgery. Laser surgery and surgical excision both require a local or general anesthetic, depending upon the extent of the lesions.''Women who have evidence of moderate to severe ''precancerous'' changes in the uterine cervix require treatment to ensure that these cells do not become invasive ''cancer''. In this case, treatment usually involves surgical removal or destruction of the involved tissue. Conization is a procedure that removes the precancerous area of the cervix using a knife, a laser, or a procedure known as ''LEEP'' (''loop electrosurgical excision procedure'', which uses an electric current passing through a thin wire that acts as a knife). Cryotherapy (freezing) or laser therapy may be used to destroy tissue areas that contain potentially precancerous changes.''Both people with HPV infection and their partners need to be counseled about the risk of spreading HPV and the appearance of the lesions. They should understand that the absence of lesions does not exclude the possibility of transmission and that condoms are not completely effective in preventing the spread of the infection. It is important to note that it is not known whether treatment decreases infectivity. Finally, female partners of men with genital warts should be reminded of the importance of regular Pap smears to screen for ''cervical cancer'"" and precancerous changes in the cervix, since precancerous changes can be treated and reduce a woman's risk of developing cervical ""'cancer''. Similarly, men should be informed of the potential risk of anal cancers, although it is not yet been determined how to best screen for or manage early ''anal cancer''.''A ''vaccine'' available against four common HPV types associated with the development of genital warts and cervical and anogenital carcinomas. This vaccine (''Gardasil'') has received FDA approval for use in males and females between 9 and 26 years of age.' "
7. Chancroid,"'Chancroid'' is an infection caused by the bacterium ''Hemophilus ducreyi'', which is passed from one sexual partner to another. It begins in a sexually exposed area of the genital skin, most commonly the penis and vulva (the female external genital organs including the labia, clitoris, and entrance to the vagina). Chancroid starts out as a tender bump that emerges 3 to10 days (the incubation period) after the sexual exposure. The cells that form the bump then begin to die, and the bump becomes an ulcer (an open sore) that is usually painful. Often, there is an associated tenderness and swelling of the glands (''lymph nodes'') in the groin that normally drain lymph (tissue fluid) from the genital area; however, the painful ulcer and tender lymph nodes occur together in only about one-third of infections. Chancroid is common in developing countries but is a relatively rare cause of genital ulcers in the U.S.''A clinical diagnosis of chancroid (which is made from the medical history and physical examination) can be made if the patient has one or more painful ulcers in the genital area and tests are negative for syphilis or herpes. (The word ''chancroid'' means resembling a chancre, the genital ulcer that is caused by syphilis. Chancroid sometimes is called soft chancre to distinguish it from the chancre of syphilis that feels hard to the touch. The ulcer of chancroid also is painful, unlike the ulcer of syphilis that is painless.) The diagnosis of chancroid can be confirmed by a culture of the material from within the ulcer for the bacterium ''Hemophilus ducreyi''. The clinical diagnosis justifies the treatment of chancroid even if cultures are not available.''Chancroid is almost always cured with a single oral dose of azithromycin (Zithromax) or a single injection of ceftriaxone (Rocephin). Alternative medications are ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'') or ''erythromycin''. Whichever treatment is used, the ulcers should improve within seven days. If no improvement is seen after treatment, the patient should be reevaluated for causes of ulcers other than chancroid. HIV-infected individuals are at an increased risk for failing treatment for chancroid and should be observed closely to assure that the treatment has been effective.'""A health care professional should evaluate anyone who has had sexual contact with a person with chancroid. Whether or not exposed individuals have an ulcer, they should be treated. Moreover, if the contact was 10 days or less before the onset of their partner's ulcer, they should be treated."" "
8. Pubic lice and scabies (ectoparasitic infections),"'Ectoparasitic infections are infections that are caused by tiny parasitic bugs, such as ''lice'' or mites. They are transmitted by close physical contact, including sexual contact. The parasites affect the skin or hair and cause itching.''Pediculosis'' pubis is an infection of the genital area caused by the crab louse (Phthirus pubis). The lice (commonly called ''crabs'') are small bugs that are visible to the naked eye without the aid of a magnifying glass or microscope. The lice live on pubic hair (or any other hair) and are associated with itching.''The treatment for ''pubic lice'"" is usually with a 1% cream rinse of permethrin that is applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes. Alternative treatments include pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide applied for 10 minutes before washing off. None of these treatments should be used for involvement near the eyes because they can be very irritating. The patient's bedding and clothing should be machine-washed with hot water. All sexual partners within the preceding month should be treated for ""'pubic lice'' and evaluated for other STDs.''Scabies'' is an ectoparasitic infection caused by a ''mite'' (known as Sarcoptes scabiei) that is not visible with the naked eye but can be seen with a magnifying glass or microscope. The parasites live on the skin and cause itching over the hands, arms, trunk, legs, and buttocks. The itching usually starts several weeks after exposure to a person with ''scabies'' and is often associated with small bumps over the area of itching. The itching from ''scabies'' is usually worse at night.''The standard treatment for scabies is a 5% cream of permethrin (''Elimite''), which is applied to the entire body from the neck down and then washed off after 8 to 14 hours. Treatment is repeated in one week.''Ivermectin'' (''Stromectol'') is a drug taken by mouth that has also been successfully used to treat scabies. The CDC recommends taking this drug at a dosage of 200 micrograms per kilogram body weight as a single dose, followed by a repeat dose two weeks later. While a patient my find that taking a drug by mouth is more convenient than application of the cream, ivermectin has a greater risk of toxic side effects than permethrin and has not been shown to be superior to permethrin in eradicating scabies.''An alternative treatment is 1 ounce of a 1% lotion or 30 grams of cream of lindane, applied from the neck down and washed off after approximately eight hours. Unfortunately, itching may persist for up to two months after successful therapy. Since lindane can cause ''seizures'' when it is absorbed through the skin, it should not be used if skin is significantly irritated or wet, such as with extensive skin disease, rash, or after a bath. As an additional precaution, lindane should not be used in pregnant or ''nursing'' women or children younger than 2 years old.''As with pubic lice infection, both the bedding and clothing of an infected individual should be machine-washed in hot water. Finally, all sexual and close personal and household contacts within the month before the infection should be examined and treated if infection is found.' "
9. HIV and AIDS,"'Infection with the ''human immunodeficiency virus'"" (HIV) weakens the body's immune system and increases the body's vulnerability to many different infections, as well as the development of certain cancers.""'HIV is a viral infection that is primarily transmitted by sexual contact or sharing needles, or from an infected pregnant woman to her newborn. Negative antibody tests do not rule out recent infection. Most people who are infected will have a positive HIV antibody test within 12 weeks of exposure.''Although there are no specific symptoms or signs that confirm HIV infection, many people will develop a nonspecific illness two to four weeks after they have been infected. This initial illness may be characterized by fever, ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', muscle and ''joint pains'', ''headache'', ''sore throat'', and/or painful lymph nodes. On average, people are ill for up to two weeks with the initial illness. In rare cases, the initial illness has occurred up to 10 months after infection. It is also possible to become infected with the HIV virus without having recognized the initial illness.''The average time from infection to the development of symptoms related to immunosuppression (decreased functioning of the immune system) is 10 years. Serious complications include unusual infections or cancers, ''weight loss'', intellectual deterioration (''dementia''), and death. When the symptoms of HIV are severe, the disease is referred to as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Numerous treatment options now available for HIV-infected individuals allow many patients to control their infection and delay the progression of their disease to AIDS.' "
How can women prevent from getting STDs?,"'The most important fact to remember about sexually transmitted infections is that all of them are preventable. However, the risks of these infections are often downplayed and thus forgotten by many. The use of condoms can help decrease the risk of transmission of certain infections, but they do not prevent the transmission of many infections. There is truly no such thing as ''safe sex''. Sex in the context of a monogamous relationship wherein neither party is infected with a STD is, however, considered safe.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat STDs in women?,"'STDs in women can be treated by primary care providers, including internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians. In many cases, obstetrician-gynecologists treat STDs in women. For certain STDs, like HIV and ''hepatitis'', other specialists including immunologists, hepatologists, and gastroenterologists may be consulted.' "
Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) Introduction,"'Sexually transmitted diseases'', commonly called ''STDs'', are infections that are spread by having sex with someone who has a ''STD''. You can get a ''sexually transmitted disease'' from sexual activity that involves the mouth, anus, or vagina.''''STDs'' are serious illnesses that require treatment, regardless of whether or not you are ''pregnant''. But, when you are pregnant, you are not the only one at risk; many STDs can be especially harmful to you and your baby. Some STDs, like ''HIV/AIDS'', cannot be cured and may be deadly.''Your health care provider will likely screen for some STDs at your first ''prenatal'' visit, but if you have sex with someone who might be infected, you will need to be screened at subsequent appointments and treated. If you suspect you have been exposed to a STD, be sure to tell your doctor immediately. Fast treatment is the best way to protect you and your baby.' "
STDs include:," Herpes HIV/AIDS Genital warts (caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV) Hepatitis B Chlamydia Syphilis Gonorrhea Trichomoniasis"
What Are the Symptoms of STDs?,"'Sometimes, there are no symptoms of a STD. If symptoms are present, they may include:' Bumps, sores, or warts near the mouth, anus, penis, or vagina Swelling or redness near the penis or vagina Skin rash with or without pain Painful urination Weight loss, loose stool, night sweats Aches, pains, fever, and chills Yellowing of the skin (jaundice) Discharge from the penis or vagina (vaginal discharge may have an odor) Bleeding from the vagina other than during a monthly period Painful sex Severe itching near the penis or vagina"
How Can STDs Affect My Pregnancy?,"'STDs in ''pregnancy'' can harm you and your developing baby depending on the type of infection.' HIV/AIDS: Thanks to the creation of powerful medications, transmission of HIV infection to your infant is almost completely preventable. But, when the disease is passed on, the results are catastrophic -- the baby may develop HIV infection. Herpes: Herpes infection in a pregnant woman is relatively safe until she gets ready to deliver. Active herpes lesions on the genitals are highly contagious and can infect the infant as he or she is being born. Also, the virus may begin multiplying and become infectious before any skin symptoms appear. Therefore, many women with herpes have a cesarean section to prevent the transmission of herpes to the newborn. Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a very common STD, usually diagnosed by performing a test on a swab of vaginal fluid. If contracted during pregnancy, the infection can cause vaginal discharge, burning while emptying the bladder, or abdominal pain. A pregnant woman with untreated gonorrhea has an increased risk of miscarriage or preterm delivery. A baby that is born while the mother has an active infection can develop blindness, joint infection, or a life threatening blood infection. HPV (Genital Warts): This is a very common STD. The genital warts often appear as small cauliflower-like clusters which may burn or itch. If you contract genital warts during pregnancy, treatment may be delayed until after you deliver. Sometimes the hormones from pregnancy can make them grow larger. If they grow large enough to block the birth canal, the baby may need to be delivered by a cesarean section. Chlamydia: Chlamydia may cause an increased risk of miscarriage and preterm delivery. Newborns who are exposed can get severe eye infections and pneumonia. Syphilis: Syphilis is most often diagnosed with a blood test, although a syphilitic skin lesion can also be tested. Syphilis is easily passed on to your unborn child. It is likely to cause a very serious infection to your baby that can be fatal. The infants are often premature. Untreated infants that survive tend to develop problems in multiple organs including the brain, eyes, ears, heart, skin, teeth, and bones. Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. If a pregnant woman is infected with hepatitis B, she can transmit the infection to her baby through the placenta. Also, her newborn can become infected. In addition, women with hepatitis B are more likely to have a premature delivery. Luckily, early screening and the more widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine can prevent infection. Trichomoniasis: Trichomoniasis is an infection that can cause yellow-green vaginal discharge and pain with sex or when emptying the bladder. It can increase the risk of having a preterm baby. Rarely, the new baby can get the infection during delivery and have a vaginal discharge after birth."
How Can I Find Out If I Have an STD?,"'At your prenatal visit, your health care provider will screen for a number of STDs. But, if you think you have a STD, tell your provider. He or she can examine you and perform other tests to determine if you have a sexually transmitted disease. Be especially vigilant if you have a new sexual partner during pregnancy.' "
How Are STDs Treated During Pregnancy?,"'Treatment of a STD during pregnancy depends on how far the infection has progressed and how far along you are in your pregnancy. Many bacterial STDs like syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia are treated with antibiotics given as a shot or taken by mouth. Below are common treatments for STDs in pregnant women and newsborns.'""If you are given an antibiotic to treat a STD, it's important that you take all of your medicine, even if the symptoms go away. Also never take someone else's medicine to treat your illness. By doing so, you may make it more difficult to treat the infection. Likewise, you should not share your medicine with others."" HIV/AIDS: Although an incurable disease, you can prevent transmitting the virus to your baby by taking a multitude of medication. Herpes: Your doctor can prescribe antiviral pills to treat these lesions. Women with active herpes lesions at delivery will likely have a cesarean section to prevent transmitting the infection to the baby. Gonorrhea: Pregnant women with the infection can be treated with antibiotics. Because gonorrhea is often without symptoms, all newborn babies are given medications in their eyes at birth to prevent development of the gonorrhea eye infection. HPV (Genital Warts): If you contract genital warts during pregnancy, treatment may be delayed until after you deliver. Chlamydia: Mothers with chlamydia are treated with antibiotics. The drug used on all newborns to prevent a gonorrhea eye infection also prevents chlamydia from infecting the eye, but it can't prevent the pneumonia that may develop later. Syphilis: Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics during your pregnancy to decrease risk of transmitting the infection to your baby and stop the syphilis from progressing in you. Hepatitis B: If you have hepatitis B, your doctor will give your newborn an injection of antibodies to prevent him or her from becoming infected. Trichomoniasis: Pregnant women can be treated with medication to cure the infection. 
"
How Can I Protect Myself From STDs?,"'Here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting STDs:' Consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent STDs. Use a latex condom every time you have sex, particularly if you have more than one sex partner. (If you use a lubricant, make sure it is water-based.) Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to catch a STD. Practice monogamy. This means having sex with only one person. That person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk. Choose your sex partners with care. Don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have a STD or who has many sexual partners. Get checked for STDs. Don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. Just because you've been screened for STDs early on in your pregnancy, does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. If you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last STD screen, you need another set of screening tests. Also, you should be concerned if your partner may be having unprotected sex with other people. Don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. Plus, alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby. Know the signs and symptoms of STDs. Look for them in yourself and your sex partners. Learn about STDs. The more you know about STDs, the better you can protect yourself."
How Can I Avoid Spreading a STD?,"'WebMD Medical Reference' Stop having sex until you see a health care provider and are treated. Follow your health care provider's instructions for treatment. Use condoms whenever you have sex, especially with new partners. Don't resume having sex unless your health care provider says it's OK. Return to your health care provider to get rechecked. Be sure your sex partner or partners are also treated."
What are the basic functions of the liver?,"'The ''liver'' is located in the right upper portion of the abdominal ''cavity'' just beneath the rib cage. The liver has many functions that are vital to life. Briefly, some of the important functions of the human liver are:' Detoxification of blood Production of important clotting factors, albumin, and many other important proteins Metabolizing (processing) medications and nutrients Processing of waste products of hemoglobin and other cells Storing of vitamins, fat, cholesterol, and bile Production of glucose (gluconeogenesis or glucose synthesis/release during starvation)"
What are common liver blood function tests?,"'Liver blood tests are some of the most commonly performed blood tests. These tests can be used to assess liver functions or liver injury. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the level of certain liver enzymes (proteins) in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes mostly reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured for any reason, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream. Enzymes are proteins that are present throughout the body, each with a unique function. Enzymes help to speed up (catalyze) routine and vital chemical reactions in the body.''Among the most sensitive and widely used liver enzymes are the aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes are normally predominantly contained within liver cells and to a lesser degree in the muscle cells. If the liver is injured or damaged, the liver cells spill these enzymes into the blood, raising the AST and ALT enzyme blood levels and signaling ''liver disease''.''Other blood tests pertaining to the liver are measurements of some of the other enzymes found the liver. In addition to AST and ALT, ''alkaline phosphatase'"", 5' nucleotidase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are a few of the other enzymes located in the liver. The focus of this article is mainly on the most common liver enzymes, AST and ALT.""  "
"What are the aminotransferases enzymes (ALT, AST)?","'The aminotransferases enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in which an amino group from one amino acid (amino acids are building blocks of proteins) is transferred from a donor molecule to a recipient molecule, hence, the names ""aminotransferases.""''Medical terms can sometimes be confusing, as is the case with these enzymes because they have interchangeable names that commonly appear in both medical and non-medical articles. For example:''To put matters briefly, AST = SGOT and ALT = SGPT; they are enzymes produced by the liver, and other types of cells).' Another name for aminotransferase is transaminase. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is also known as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
"Normally, where are AST and ALT (aminotransferase enzymes)?","'AST (SGOT) is normally found in a variety of tissues including liver, ''heart'', muscle, kidney, and the brain. It is released into the serum when any one of these tissues is damaged. For example, AST level in serum is elevated in ''heart attacks'' or with muscle injury. It is therefore, not a highly specific indicator of liver injury as its elevation can occur as a result of other injured tissues.''ALT (SGPT) is, by contrast, normally found largely in the liver. This is not to say that it is exclusively located in the liver, but that is where it is most concentrated. It is released into the bloodstream as the result of liver injury. Thus, it serves as a fairly specific indicator of liver status.' "
What are normal levels of AST and ALT?,"""However, the ranges of AST and ALT numbers may differ slightly depending on the technique and protocols used by different laboratories worldwide. However, normal reference ranges are routinely provided by each laboratory and printed with each patient's individual report.""   The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is about 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is about 7 to 56 units per liter of serum."
What do high (elevated) liver tests (AST and ALT) mean?,"'AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. However, it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with ''liver disease''. They may mean liver problems or they may not. For example, elevations of these enzymes can occur with muscle damage. The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT results depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual, and so it is best done by physicians experienced in evaluating liver disease and muscle disease.''Moreover, the precise levels of these liver enzyme tests do not correlate well with the extent of liver problems or the prognosis (outlook). Thus, the exact levels of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future prognosis for ''liver function''. For example, individuals with acute ''viral hepatitis'' A may develop very high AST and ALT levels (sometimes in the thousands of units/liter range), but most people with acute viral ''hepatitis A'' recover fully without residual liver disease. Conversely, people with chronic ''hepatitis C'' infection typically have only a little elevation in their AST and ALT levels while having substantial liver injury and even advanced scarring of the liver (''cirrhosis'') from ongoing minor inflammation of the liver.' "
Do AST and ALT test results indicate liver function?,"'It is important to clarify that ALT and AST levels do not reflect the function of the liver, even though in the medical community and in medical publications they commonly, and incorrectly, are referred to as liver function tests. Even in conditions when AST and ALT are very elevated, the liver still may function properly. Consequently, if you have ""elevated liver enzymes"" or a high or abnormal liver test, you need to ask your physician exactly what all of the tests indicate.' "
What blood tests are done to detect liver function?,"'The blood tests that truly reflect liver function are the following; normal values (ranges) listed are for adult men - women and children have similar but slightly different ranges of normal test values'   Coagulation panel (prothrombin time or PT, and international normalized ratio or INR): These tests measure blood's ability for normal clotting and prevention of bleeding and bruising. This is the function of certain proteins called clotting factors that normally are produced in the liver. Normal values are about 9.5 to 13.8 seconds. Albumin level (hypoalbuminemia): Albumin is a very common protein found in the blood with a variety of functions. It also is produced only in the liver, and if its levels are lower than normal it can be suggestive of chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. Of note, many conditions other than liver disease also may cause low albumin levels. Normal values are about 3.5 to 5 g/dL. Bilirubin: This molecule is a byproduct of the routine destruction of red blood cells occurring in the liver. It is normally released as bile in the feces. Elevation of the bilirubin can suggest liver dysfunction. However, other conditions with increased destruction of red blood cells also can cause elevated bilirubin levels despite normal liver function. Normal values are about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL."
What blood tests are done to detect liver function? (Continued),"'Note that many hospitals and doctor\'s offices list a liver function panel as part of a lab workup. These panels vary and may consist of AST, ALT and some or all of the tests listed above. In addition, the normal panel values may vary somewhat, especially between adult men, women and children so viewing the ""normal"" ranges of test values is always recommended, and a thorough discussion with the physician is necessary. In addition, some clinicians recommend other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. ''There are other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. There are home liver tests for blood enzyme levels and liver function however, individuals who use these tests should first discuss their use and results with their health care professional.' Platelet count: Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) has many causes, one of which can be advanced liver disease. Normal platelet counts are about 150,000 to 400,000 per (µL). Glucose: Glucose level is maintained in the body by a variety of mechanisms. The liver can release glucose in the blood for nourishment of other cells in case of starvation with insufficient oral intake of glucose. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is another major function of the liver. In advanced liver disease, this function of the liver can be compromised leading to unusually low glucose levels in the absence of adequate oral intake. Conversely, a large number of people with liver cirrhosis become glucose intolerant and develop diabetes. GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase): This enzyme is thought to indicate possible liver damage; the higher the abnormal level, the more likely there is liver damage. Normal levels of GGT are about 9 to 48 U/L. ALP (alkaline phosphatase): The liver synthesizes the highest amounts of this enzyme so high levels in the blood may suggest liver injury among other causes. Normal levels of ALP are about 45 to 115 U/L. LD or LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase): This enzyme may be elevated in many types of diseases, including liver disease. Normal levels are about 122 to 222U/L."
What are some common reasons for abnormal liver tests?,"'Abnormal liver tests may be detected in the blood in a variety of liver conditions.' Mild to moderate elevations of the liver enzymes are common. They are often unexpectedly encountered on routine blood screening tests in otherwise healthy individuals. The AST and ALT readings in such cases are usually between twice the upper limits of normal and several hundred units/liter. One of the most common causes of mild to moderate elevations of these liver tests is a condition referred to as fatty liver (steatohepatitis or hepatic steatosis). In the United States, the most frequent cause of fatty liver is alcohol abuse. Other causes of fatty liver include diabetes mellitus and obesity. Fatty liver tests are composed of several tests including blood tests, CT and/or MRI tests and in some individuals, a liver biopsy. Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are other causes of chronic mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation. In these conditions, ALT and AST may be only slightly high and the degree of abnormality in liver function tests can indicate the degree if injury. Chronic and acute alcohol use also can commonly cause abnormal liver blood tests. In alcoholic hepatitis, the range of liver tests can vary greatly. In chronic alcohol liver disease or alcoholic cirrhosis, slight elevation of ALT and AST may be observed, whereas in acute alcoholic hepatitis, high liver enzyme numbers are often seen. Many medications can be responsible for mild to moderate increase in the liver enzyme tests (see below)."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT) levels?,"'A variety of medications can cause abnormal liver enzymes levels in some individuals.''Examples of some of the common medications with potential liver toxicity include:''Pain'' relief medications ''such as:''Anti-''seizure'' medications'' such as:''Antibiotics ''such as:' aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Naprelan, Anaprox, Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR), and phenylbutazone (Butazolidine) phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equertro), and phenobarbital tetracyclines, (for example, tetracycline [Achromycin]) sulfonamides, isoniazid (INH) (Nydrazid, Laniazid) sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), trimethoprim (Trimpex; Proloprim, Primsol) nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin; Furadantin; Macrobid), fluconazole (Diflucan ) and some other anti-fungals, etc."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT)? (continued),"'Cholesterol lowering ''drugs'' ''such as ''statins'':''Cardiovascular drugs ''such as:''Other drugs'""With drug-induced liver enzyme abnormalities, the enzymes usually normalize weeks to months after stopping the medications. Typically, the physician will want to monitor the patient's liver enzymes over time to confirm that the values are normalizing."" lovastatin (Mevacor, Altocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and niacin amiodarone (Cordarone), hydralazine (Apresoline) quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), etc. Antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic type"
What conditions can cause very high AST or ALT levels?,"'AST and ALT serum levels in some liver conditions can range anywhere from ten times the upper limits of normal to thousands of units/liter. The highest levels of AST and ALT are found with disorders that cause rapid death of numerous liver cells (extensive hepatic necrosis). Although this degree of liver enzymes elevation is not common, it can occur in such conditions as:''Also, very high AST and ALT levels can be a result of severe muscle diseases.' Acute viral hepatitis A or B Profound liver damage inflicted by toxins as from an overdose of acetaminophen (brand-name Tylenol) or mushroom poisoning Prolonged collapse of the circulatory system (shock) when the liver is deprived of fresh blood providing oxygen and nutrients"
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood and function tests?,"'Less common causes of abnormal liver enzymes in the United States include ''hemochromatosis'' (''iron overload'""), Wilson's disease, alpha-1-""'antitrypsin'' deficiency, ''celiac disease'"", Crohn's disease, ""'ulcerative colitis'', and autoimmune hepatitis. Though not as common as ''hepatitis C'', ''hepatitis B'' can cause chronic liver disease with persistently abnormal liver enzymes.' Hemochromatosis is a genetic (inherited) disorder in which there is excessive absorption of dietary iron leading to accumulation of iron in the liver with resultant inflammation and scarring of the liver. If undiagnosed or untreated, hemochromatosis can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder with excessive accumulation of copper in diverse tissues including the liver and the brain. Excess copper in the liver can lead to chronic liver inflammation, while copper in the brain can cause psychiatric and motor disturbances. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the lack of a glycoprotein (carbohydrate-protein complex) called alpha-1-antitrypsin lead to chronic lung disease (emphysema) and chronic liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis results from liver injury brought about by the body's own antibodies and defense systems attacking the liver."
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood tests? (continued)," Celiac disease (celiac sprue) is a disease of the small intestine where a person has an allergy to gluten and develops gas, bloating, diarrhea, and in advanced cases malnutrition. Patients' with celiac disease can also develop mildly abnormal ALT and AST levels. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases with chronic inflammation of the intestines (collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases). In these individuals inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) also can occur, causing abnormal liver tests. Viral infections other than common hepatitis viruses (A, B, C) can sometimes cause elevation of liver enzymes as they can result in generalized body infection and liver inflammation. Non-viral infections of the liver are rare, but they can cause liver damage. Bacterial and amebic (parasitic) hepatic (liver) abscesses typically present as focal infection and inflammation of the liver as opposed to viral hepatitis where generalized liver inflammation occurs. Liver enzyme elevation is usually seen in the setting of these infections. Rarely, abnormal liver enzymes can be a sign of liver cancer. Cancer arising from liver cells is called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma. Cancers spreading to the liver from other organs (such as colon, pancreas, stomach, and others) are called metastatic malignancies (to the liver). Liver hemangiomas (masses of abnormal and atypical blood vessels within the liver) are the most common tumors in the liver. However, hepatic hemangiomas are benign and in general do not cause elevation of liver tests. Another rare condition that causes elevation of liver tests is called the Budd-Chiari Syndrome. In this condition, obstruction of blood flow in the liver by a blood clot can damage the liver by limiting blood flow leading to injury of liver cells. As a result of this insult, liver enzymes may rise indicating hepatic inflammation. Glycogen storage disorders are genetic conditions seen in pediatric population (detected at birth in severe types or later in childhood in less severe types). They impair the ability of the liver to store and metabolize glycogen, a complex sugar necessary for production of nutrients and energy in the body. Glycogen storage disorders cause varying degrees of liver enzyme abnormalities."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels?,"""Evaluation of healthy individuals with abnormal liver enzymes needs to be individualized. A doctor may ask for the patient's blood test data from old records for comparison. If no old records are available, the doctor may repeat blood tests in weeks to months to see whether these abnormalities persist.""'In the meantime, along with a physical examination, by performing thorough medical history the doctor will search for potential infectious and non-infectious causes and risk factors for liver disease such as:''A complete list of routine medications including ''over-the-counter'' medications will be reviewed.''Signs and symptoms of liver disease may or may not be present in individuals with mild increase in liver enzymes. Signs of liver damage can include ''jaundice'', ''easy bruising'', ''ascites'' (distention of abdomen as result of retained fluid), ''enlarged spleen'' (''splenomegaly''), and ''confusion''. Symptoms of liver disease are non-specific and numerous. Some of the more common liver disease symptoms may include ''fatigue'', ''itching'', yellow skin, poor appetite, and abdominal discomfort.''The pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities can sometimes provide useful clues as to the cause of the liver condition. For example, in a majority of people with alcoholic liver disease, liver enzyme levels are not as high as the levels reached in acute viral hepatitis. In alcoholic liver disease, frequently AST tends to be higher (usually under 300 units/liter) than ALT (usually under 100 units/ liter).' Medications Alcohol use Sexual exposures History of blood transfusions History of injectable drug use Occupational exposure to blood products Family history of liver disease (for the possibility of inherited diseases such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency)."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels? (continued),"""If alcohol or medication is responsible for the abnormal liver enzyme tests, stopping alcohol or the culprit medication (under a health care professional's supervision only) should bring the enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels in weeks to months. If obesity is suspected as the cause of ""'fatty liver disease'', weight reduction of about 5% to 10% should also bring the AST and ALT liver blood tests to normal or near normal levels in some individuals.''If abnormal liver enzymes persist despite abstinence from alcohol, weight reduction, and stopping certain suspected drugs, other tests can be performed to help diagnose other possible treatable liver diseases. The blood can be tested for the presence of ''hepatitis B'"" and C viruses and their related antibodies. Blood levels of iron, iron saturation, and ferritin (another measurement of the amount of iron stored in the body) are usually elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis. Blood levels of a substance called ceruloplasmin are usually decreased in people with Wilson's disease. Blood levels of certain antibodies (anti-nuclear antibody or ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-liver and kidney microsomal antibody) are elevated in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis.""'Liver ''ultrasound'' and ''CT scan'' of the abdomen are sometimes used to exclude tumors in the liver or other conditions such as ''gallstones'' or tumors obstructing the ducts that drain the liver. These tests also can provide important visual information about the liver such as size, contour, scarring, and anatomically important data. A CT liver scan is very useful to detect traumatic injuries to the liver.''Liver biopsy can occasionally assist in determining the cause of liver disease. In this procedure a needle is inserted through the skin over the right upper abdomen to obtain a thin strand of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. Liver biopsy is oftentimes performed after ultrasound study has located the liver. Not everybody with abnormal liver enzymes needs a liver biopsy. The doctor will usually recommend this procedure if:'""Liver biopsy is most useful in confirming a diagnosis of a potentially treatable condition including chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency."" The information obtained from the liver biopsy will likely be helpful in planning treatment The doctor needs to know the extent and severity of liver inflammation/damage Effectiveness of a certain treatment requires close monitoring at the tissue level No obvious cause of elevated liver tests has been found despite thorough investigation"
How do health care professionals monitor a person's liver blood values?,"'What is usually most helpful is serial testing of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) over time to determine whether the levels are increasing, remaining stable, or decreasing. For example, individuals undergoing treatment for chronic hepatitis C should be monitored with serial liver enzyme tests. Those responding to treatment will experience lowering of liver enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels. Those who develop relapse of hepatitis C after completion of treatment will usually develop abnormal liver enzyme levels again.' "
What other liver enzymes cause medical problems?,"'Aside from AST and ALT, there are other enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, 5\'-nucleotidase (""5 prime"" nucleotidase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that are often used to detect for liver disease.''LDH is not specific to the liver and can be elevated in many diseases with inflammation in other tissues.''Alkaline phosphatase is another liver enzyme that is frequently measured. This enzyme is usually found in the walls of the bile ducts (tube-like structures within the liver that connect liver cells together). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase may indicate an injury to the biliary cells. Common causes of biliary injury or biliary obstruction (''cholestasis'') are ''gallstones'"" and certain medications, although, some of the conditions listed previously can also raise the levels of this enzyme. Alkaline phosphate is also found in the bone and can be elevated in bone diseases. GGT and 5' nucleotidase levels can be elevated in biliary conditions (disease of the gallbladder and bile ducts) along with alkaline phosphatase."" "
What are the basic functions of the liver?,"'The ''liver'' is located in the right upper portion of the abdominal ''cavity'' just beneath the rib cage. The liver has many functions that are vital to life. Briefly, some of the important functions of the human liver are:' Detoxification of blood Production of important clotting factors, albumin, and many other important proteins Metabolizing (processing) medications and nutrients Processing of waste products of hemoglobin and other cells Storing of vitamins, fat, cholesterol, and bile Production of glucose (gluconeogenesis or glucose synthesis/release during starvation)"
What are common liver blood function tests?,"'Liver blood tests are some of the most commonly performed blood tests. These tests can be used to assess liver functions or liver injury. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the level of certain liver enzymes (proteins) in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes mostly reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured for any reason, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream. Enzymes are proteins that are present throughout the body, each with a unique function. Enzymes help to speed up (catalyze) routine and vital chemical reactions in the body.''Among the most sensitive and widely used liver enzymes are the aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes are normally predominantly contained within liver cells and to a lesser degree in the muscle cells. If the liver is injured or damaged, the liver cells spill these enzymes into the blood, raising the AST and ALT enzyme blood levels and signaling ''liver disease''.''Other blood tests pertaining to the liver are measurements of some of the other enzymes found the liver. In addition to AST and ALT, ''alkaline phosphatase'"", 5' nucleotidase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are a few of the other enzymes located in the liver. The focus of this article is mainly on the most common liver enzymes, AST and ALT.""  "
"What are the aminotransferases enzymes (ALT, AST)?","'The aminotransferases enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in which an amino group from one amino acid (amino acids are building blocks of proteins) is transferred from a donor molecule to a recipient molecule, hence, the names ""aminotransferases.""''Medical terms can sometimes be confusing, as is the case with these enzymes because they have interchangeable names that commonly appear in both medical and non-medical articles. For example:''To put matters briefly, AST = SGOT and ALT = SGPT; they are enzymes produced by the liver, and other types of cells).' Another name for aminotransferase is transaminase. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is also known as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
"Normally, where are AST and ALT (aminotransferase enzymes)?","'AST (SGOT) is normally found in a variety of tissues including liver, ''heart'', muscle, kidney, and the brain. It is released into the serum when any one of these tissues is damaged. For example, AST level in serum is elevated in ''heart attacks'' or with muscle injury. It is therefore, not a highly specific indicator of liver injury as its elevation can occur as a result of other injured tissues.''ALT (SGPT) is, by contrast, normally found largely in the liver. This is not to say that it is exclusively located in the liver, but that is where it is most concentrated. It is released into the bloodstream as the result of liver injury. Thus, it serves as a fairly specific indicator of liver status.' "
What are normal levels of AST and ALT?,"""However, the ranges of AST and ALT numbers may differ slightly depending on the technique and protocols used by different laboratories worldwide. However, normal reference ranges are routinely provided by each laboratory and printed with each patient's individual report.""   The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is about 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is about 7 to 56 units per liter of serum."
What do high (elevated) liver tests (AST and ALT) mean?,"'AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. However, it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with ''liver disease''. They may mean liver problems or they may not. For example, elevations of these enzymes can occur with muscle damage. The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT results depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual, and so it is best done by physicians experienced in evaluating liver disease and muscle disease.''Moreover, the precise levels of these liver enzyme tests do not correlate well with the extent of liver problems or the prognosis (outlook). Thus, the exact levels of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future prognosis for ''liver function''. For example, individuals with acute ''viral hepatitis'' A may develop very high AST and ALT levels (sometimes in the thousands of units/liter range), but most people with acute viral ''hepatitis A'' recover fully without residual liver disease. Conversely, people with chronic ''hepatitis C'' infection typically have only a little elevation in their AST and ALT levels while having substantial liver injury and even advanced scarring of the liver (''cirrhosis'') from ongoing minor inflammation of the liver.' "
Do AST and ALT test results indicate liver function?,"'It is important to clarify that ALT and AST levels do not reflect the function of the liver, even though in the medical community and in medical publications they commonly, and incorrectly, are referred to as liver function tests.

Medications Alcohol use Sexual exposures History of blood transfusions History of injectable drug use Occupational exposure to blood products Family history of liver disease (for the possibility of inherited diseases such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency)."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels? (continued),"""If alcohol or medication is responsible for the abnormal liver enzyme tests, stopping alcohol or the culprit medication (under a health care professional's supervision only) should bring the enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels in weeks to months. If obesity is suspected as the cause of ""'fatty liver disease'', weight reduction of about 5% to 10% should also bring the AST and ALT liver blood tests to normal or near normal levels in some individuals.''If abnormal liver enzymes persist despite abstinence from alcohol, weight reduction, and stopping certain suspected drugs, other tests can be performed to help diagnose other possible treatable liver diseases. The blood can be tested for the presence of ''hepatitis B'"" and C viruses and their related antibodies. Blood levels of iron, iron saturation, and ferritin (another measurement of the amount of iron stored in the body) are usually elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis. Blood levels of a substance called ceruloplasmin are usually decreased in people with Wilson's disease. Blood levels of certain antibodies (anti-nuclear antibody or ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-liver and kidney microsomal antibody) are elevated in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis.""'Liver ''ultrasound'' and ''CT scan'' of the abdomen are sometimes used to exclude tumors in the liver or other conditions such as ''gallstones'' or tumors obstructing the ducts that drain the liver. These tests also can provide important visual information about the liver such as size, contour, scarring, and anatomically important data. A CT liver scan is very useful to detect traumatic injuries to the liver.''Liver biopsy can occasionally assist in determining the cause of liver disease. In this procedure a needle is inserted through the skin over the right upper abdomen to obtain a thin strand of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. Liver biopsy is oftentimes performed after ultrasound study has located the liver. Not everybody with abnormal liver enzymes needs a liver biopsy. The doctor will usually recommend this procedure if:'""Liver biopsy is most useful in confirming a diagnosis of a potentially treatable condition including chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency."" The information obtained from the liver biopsy will likely be helpful in planning treatment The doctor needs to know the extent and severity of liver inflammation/damage Effectiveness of a certain treatment requires close monitoring at the tissue level No obvious cause of elevated liver tests has been found despite thorough investigation"
How do health care professionals monitor a person's liver blood values?,"'What is usually most helpful is serial testing of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) over time to determine whether the levels are increasing, remaining stable, or decreasing. For example, individuals undergoing treatment for chronic hepatitis C should be monitored with serial liver enzyme tests. Those responding to treatment will experience lowering of liver enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels. Those who develop relapse of hepatitis C after completion of treatment will usually develop abnormal liver enzyme levels again.' "
What other liver enzymes cause medical problems?,"'Aside from AST and ALT, there are other enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, 5\'-nucleotidase (""5 prime"" nucleotidase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that are often used to detect for liver disease.''LDH is not specific to the liver and can be elevated in many diseases with inflammation in other tissues.''Alkaline phosphatase is another liver enzyme that is frequently measured. This enzyme is usually found in the walls of the bile ducts (tube-like structures within the liver that connect liver cells together). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase may indicate an injury to the biliary cells. Common causes of biliary injury or biliary obstruction (''cholestasis'') are ''gallstones'"" and certain medications, although, some of the conditions listed previously can also raise the levels of this enzyme. Alkaline phosphate is also found in the bone and can be elevated in bone diseases. GGT and 5' nucleotidase levels can be elevated in biliary conditions (disease of the gallbladder and bile ducts) along with alkaline phosphatase."" "
What is shaken baby syndrome?,"'Dr. Robert Reece provided one definition of shaken baby syndrome (also called the shaken impact syndrome). He described the syndrome as ""the constellation of signs and symptoms resulting from violent shaking or shaking and impacting the head of an infant or small child."" The alternative descriptive phrase ""abusive head trauma"" serves as an umbrella term implying injury to the skull, brain, and spinal cord as a result of shaking and/or trauma to the head. Implicit in any terminology is that an adult purposefully inflicts such trauma on the infant. Research indicates that very\xa0young children (ages 4 and younger) are the most frequent victims of child fatalities. Although more recent statistics are not yet available, the National ''Child Abuse'' and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) data for 2010 demonstrated that children younger than 1 year accounted for 47.7 percent of fatalities; children younger than 4 years accounted for nearly four-fifths (79.4 percent) of fatalities. These children are the most vulnerable for many reasons, including their dependency, small size, and inability to defend themselves. Of these lethal events, inflicted head trauma is the primary cause of such mortality. Amazingly, the most frequent etiology (cause) of fatal ''head injury'' to children below 2 years of age is inflicted head trauma. Inflicted head trauma is a subset of the larger problem of child abuse (lethal and nonlethal). Unfortunately, solid statistics are limited regarding the incidence of shaken baby syndrome. This partially is due to various terms used in medical and hospital records as well as under-recognition of shaken baby syndrome since symptoms and signs may be more subtle than those of general body injury seen in globally battered children. CDC statistics reflect the broad problem of physical violence against children, reporting approximately 122,500 victims, of whom 840 died. Of those who died, 60% were boys.' "
What causes shaken baby syndrome?,"'The first few months of childhood are tremendously stressful to new parents. Mothers (who often carry more than their fair share of this newly acquired responsibility) are struggling to recover from ''pregnancy'', ''labor'', and delivery as well as deal with an individual who is completely dependent upon them. ''Breastfeeding'"" mothers may carry an even larger responsibility since they are uniquely responsible for their infant's ""'nutrition''. Studies of normal and healthy infants have demonstrated that the number of minutes per day spent crying increases weekly during the first two months of life, stabilizes for three to four weeks, and then drops remarkably. This mixture of physical and emotional parental exhaustion, coupled with what seems to be never-ending crying, can push many over the edge. High-risk infants (premature ''babies'', those with chronic medical conditions, etc.) commonly extract an even higher toll on parents. This may be due to the more demanding requirements of such children and/or a belief of an increase in infant vulnerability. For some caregivers, physical punishment represents the only way to free themselves of their frustrations.' "
What are the risk factors for shaken baby syndrome?,"'Risk factors for shaken baby syndrome (as well as other types of inflicted trauma on children) may be conceptualized into two broad categories:''Family risk factors''Infant risk factors' Young and/or single parents Lower educational background Unstable family dynamics Financial/food/housing concerns and stresses Domestic violence Drug/alcohol abuse Parental mental illness, especially postpartum depression Limited or no immediate support system (for example, relatives, church groups, etc.) Unrelated adults staying in the home Perinatal risk factors (for example, threatened miscarriage, prematurity, infant malformations, multiple births (twins, triplets, etc.) Colicky infants -- often aggravated by the natural history of increase in infant crying 
during the first two months of life (see above) Male gender Unwanted pregnancy"
What are shaken baby syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms and signs of shaken baby syndrome have an extremely broad range to display. This range is due to the nature of the inflicted trauma, including the frequency, duration, and whether the result of a single event or multiple events. Behavioral changes may include the following:''Physical changes associated with shaken baby syndrome may include the following:''It is crucial to note that many studies have demonstrated that 20%-50% of children who sustain shaken baby syndrome have evidence of other episodes of inflicted trauma, such as intentional ''burns'', broken bones (most commonly rib and the long bones of the arms and legs), and/or bruising not consistent with routine and age-appropriate injury.'   Extreme irritability and high-pitched crying Lethargy and poor feeding Vomiting without obvious reason Loss of social engagement (smiling, cooing, 
etc.) Poor suck/swallow coordination Unusual breathing patterns 
(continuous deep pattern or rapid and shallow pattern) Bruising of the body due either to the grip strength of the individual 
inflicting trauma or as a consequence of hitting or being hit by blunt objects 
(for example, wooden spoons)
 Head trauma: bruising, swelling, and/or laceration of the 
scalp, deformity of the skull (commonly a depression due to a skull fracture)
  
Inability of the infant eyes to track or focus on an object
 Abnormal 
increase in muscle tone or evidence of an increase in pressure of the structures 
of the skull (for example, brain)
 Seizures
 Hemorrhages of the retina
 Bleeding 
of the surrounding or supporting structures of the brain or in the brain 
substance itself (most frequently diagnosed via 
CT or MRI studies)
 Bleeding 
and/or drainage of clear fluid (spinal fluid -- clear fluid that surrounds the 
brain) from the nose or ear canal"
How do physicians diagnose shaken baby syndrome?,"'A classic triad most commonly seen consists of (1) single or multiple subdural hematomas (localized bleeding outside of the brain substance), (2) diffuse and multi-depth retinal hemorrhages, and (3) diffuse ''brain injury'' without a reasonable explanation for such severe (and often repeated) trauma. Several agencies, including the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'', recommend that the term ''shaken baby syndrome'' be replaced with ''abusive head trauma'"". Such a change broadens the various mechanisms of injury commonly seen besides shaking. Blunt head trauma is commonly seen in addition to shaking. Common mechanisms of direct blows to the head include punching the infant, hitting the head or face with a hard object (for example, wooden spoon), or slamming the infant's head against the wall or floor.""'Because children may not present for evaluation with evidence of trauma (bruising, lacerations, etc.), a high index of suspicion must be maintained by those responsible for evaluating such children. Missed cases of shaken baby syndrome may be incorrectly diagnosed as viral infection (especially ''gastroenteritis'', in which children will be lethargic and have a history of repeated ''vomiting'') or accidental head injury (for example, fell while being carried by a parent, rolled off of a bed, or abuse by an older sibling). Multiple studies have demonstrated that, while the duration of shaking necessary to inflict such substantial trauma may be accomplished in 15-20 seconds, adult strength is necessary to inflict such damage (for example, parental perpetrators may attempt to blame a childhood sibling as the culprit). Likewise, rolling off of a bed or couch or being held during a parental fall are extremely unlikely to cause such injury. Documentation of old skeletal ''fractures'', ''burns'' (commonly ''cigarette'' or hot water immersion), healing ''bruises'', or ligature injury may be discovered during an investigation.''Those most likely to inflict trauma on an infant tend to be the father (50%), stepfather, male partner of the mother (20%), female babysitters (17%), and the mother (12%).' "
What is the treatment for shaken baby syndrome?,"'The first step in successful treatment for shaken baby syndrome demands accurate diagnosis and removal of the infant (and any siblings) from the household in which the abuse occurred. Once diagnosed, supportive care provides the mainstay of medical management. Neurosurgical procedures may be indicated as well as orthopedic management of bone fractures. Eye specialists (ophthalmologists) are critical in the evaluation and monitoring of retinal hemorrhages. Once the infant is medically stable, a series of developmental evaluations are necessary to provide a baseline at the time of diagnosis. Follow-up evaluations monitor for long-term side effects of head trauma. The perpetrator will need to undergo psychological evaluation.' "
What are complications and long-term effects of shaken baby syndrome?,"'Neurologic side effects of either shaking or blunt skull trauma may span from developmental delays, ''seizure disorders'', visual impairment, and ''blindness'' to death. Orthopedic consequences of inflicted trauma range from the need for recurrent surgery to permanent loss of function if the back (and thus spinal cord) is involved. Scarring of the skin is a common side effect of inflicted burns. ''Plastic'' and reconstructive surgery may be necessary depending on the nature of the trauma (for example, immersion into hot water). Emotional side effects may be obvious or subtle and may not necessarily be present or detectable at the time of diagnosis. Counseling and psychological support and intervention may require repeated or long-lasting attention.' "
What is the prognosis of shaken baby syndrome?,"'The primary predictor for an optimal prognosis is establishing the diagnosis and thus removing the child (and any siblings) from the abusive home. The nature of the neurological injuries help shape realistic prognostic expectations. The ""plastic"" nature of the immature brain and peripheral nervous system allow those counseling caregivers of children who have sustained shaken baby syndrome to be more optimistic than those counseling after adult ''traumatic brain injury''. One study found that approximately one-third of those who suffered abusive head injury have no discernable side effect; unfortunately, such a statistic implies that two-thirds of such victims will have residual long-term complications.' "
Is it possible to prevent shaken baby syndrome?,"'Many studies have determined that what is felt to be incessant crying is the primary stimulus leading to a frustrated ''caregiver'' loosing control. Expectant parents must be counseled regarding the nature of crying and various management strategies for both the infant and themselves. It is important to underscore that many times there is no obvious or discernable cause for the infant\'s crying. Likewise, it is important for parents and all caregivers to understand that allowing an infant to cry for a reasonably short period (10-15 minutes) does not lead to short- or long-term physical or emotional-health issues. Most importantly, those caring for children must be assured that asking for help is an excellent strategy when they find themselves ""at the end of their rope.""' "
What can caregivers or parents do to calm a crying baby?,"'Most caregivers will initiate a series of approaches in an effort to address a crying infant. Reviewing the feeding schedule and checking for a soiled ''diaper'' are common. Consideration of health problems (an ''ear infection'' or upper ''respiratory infection''), the need to ''burp'' the child, or infant ''tiredness'' or boredom can all be considered. For infants who seem to have crying in association with feeding or evidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER), a discussion with their pediatrician is in order. ''Breastfed'' infants may cry in response to certain foods (for example, ''caffeinated'' ''beverages'') ingested by their mother. Rarely, infants will have continuous crying if a long hair (most commonly from a parent) has accidently wrapped around a toe or finger. Diagnosis is considered if prominent swelling and skin discoloration is noted at the site of the ligature.''Various approaches to the crying infant are commonplace. These include picking up the baby and socially interacting with the child, ''walking'"" and rocking the child, addressing the possibility of hunger or a soiled diaper, and a quick visual survey of the infant to confirm no unusual changes exist. It is important for parents to accept that the majority of the time their investigation will be fruitless in determining causation of their infant's crying. The fact that he or she cries is not an indictment of their ""'parenting'' skills. There is generally no hidden management secret other than time and patience.' "
What is shigellosis?,"'Shigellosis is a diarrheal disease caused by a group of bacteria called ''Shigella''. ''Shigella'' causes about 500,000 cases of ''diarrhea'' in the United States annually. There are four different species of ''Shigella'':''S. dysenteriae'' and ''S. boydii'' are rare in the United States, though they continue to be important causes of disease in the developing world. ''Shigella dysenteriae'' type 1 can cause deadly epidemics.'   Shigella sonnei (the most common species in the United States) Shigella flexneri Shigella boydii Shigella dysenteriae"
What are the symptoms of Shigella?,'Symptoms of shigellosis typically start 1-2 days after exposure and include:' Diarrhea (sometimes bloody) Fever Abdominal pain Tenesmus (a painful sensation of needing to pass stools even when bowels are empty)
How long after infection do symptoms appear?,'Symptoms of shigellosis generally begin 1 to 2 days after becoming infected with the bacteria.' 
How long will symptoms last?,"'In persons with healthy immune systems, symptoms usually last about 5 to 7 days. Persons with diarrhea usually recover completely, although it may be several months before their bowel habits are entirely normal. Once someone has had shigellosis, they are not likely to get infected with that specific type again for at least several years. However, they can still get infected with other types of ''Shigella''.' "
Can there be any complications from Shigella infections?,"'Possible complications from ''Shigella'' infections include:' Post-infectious arthritis. About 2% of persons who are infected with Shigella flexneri later develop pains in their joints, irritation of the eyes, and painful urination. This is called post-infectious arthritis. It can last for months or years, and can lead to chronic arthritis. Post-infectious arthritis is caused by a reaction to Shigella infection that happens only in people who are genetically predisposed to it. Blood stream infections. Although rare, blood stream infections are caused either by Shigella organisms or by other germs in the gut that get into the bloodstream when the lining of the intestines is damaged during shigellosis. Blood stream infections are most common among patients with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, cancer, or severe malnutrition. Seizures. Generalized seizures have been reported occasionally among young children with shigellosis, and usually resolve without treatment. Children who experience seizures while infected with Shigella typically have a high fever or abnormal blood electrolytes (salts), but it is not well understood why the seizures occur. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome or HUS. HUS occurs when bacteria enter the digestive system and produce a toxin that destroys red blood cells. Patients with HUS often have bloody diarrhea. HUS is only associated with Shiga-toxin producing Shigella, which is found most commonly in Shigella dysenteriae."
How can Shigella infections be diagnosed?,"'Many different kinds of germs can cause diarrhea, so establishing the cause will help guide treatment. Healthcare providers can order laboratory tests to identify ''Shigella'' in the stools of an infected person. The laboratory can also do special tests to determine which antibiotics, if any, would be best to treat the infection.' "
How can Shigella infections be treated?,"'Diarrhea caused by ''Shigella'' usually resolves without antibiotic treatment in 5 to 7 days. People with mild shigellosis may need only fluids and rest. Bismuth subsalicylate (e.g., Pepto-Bismol) may be helpful, but medications that cause the gut to slow down, such as loperamide (e.g., Imodium) or diphenoxylate with atropine (e.g., Lomotil), should be avoided. Antibiotics are useful for severe cases of shigellosis because they can reduce the duration of symptoms. However, ''Shigella'' is often resistant to antibiotics. If you require antibiotic treatment for shigellosis, your healthcare provider can culture your ''stool'' and determine which antibiotics are likely to work. Tell your healthcare provider if you do not get better within a couple of days after starting antibiotics. He or she can do additional tests to learn whether your strain of ''Shigella'' is resistant to the antibiotic you are taking.'  "
Is antibiotic resistance a problem with Shigella?,"'In 2013, CDC declared antibiotic-resistant ''Shigella'' an urgent threat in the United States. Resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics like ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is common among ''Shigella'' globally, and resistance to some other important antibiotics is increasing. While ''travelers'' to the developing world are at particular risk of acquiring antibiotic-resistant shigellosis, outbreaks of shigellosis resistant to ciprofloxacin or ''azithromycin'' -- the two antibiotics most commonly used to treat shigellosis -- have been reported recently within the United States and other industrialized countries. About 27,000 ''Shigella'' infections in the United States every year are resistant to one or both of these antibiotics. When pathogens are resistant to common antibiotic medications, patients may need to be treated with medications that may be less effective, but more toxic and expensive.' "
How will I know if I have an antibiotic-resistant Shigella infection?,"'Shigella'"" infections are diagnosed through laboratory testing of stool specimens (feces). Healthcare providers can order tests to check which antibiotics are likely to help treat a particular patient's infection. If you were treated with antibiotics for shigellosis but do not feel better within a couple of days, tell your healthcare provider. You may need additional tests to check whether your ""'Shigella'' strain is resistant to the antibiotics.' "
What should I do if I have an antibiotic-resistant Shigella infection?,"'Please follow the advice of your healthcare provider. If you do not feel better within a couple of days after beginning treatments, tell your healthcare provider. Protect others by washing your hands carefully with soap after using the toilet, and wait until your diarrhea has stopped before preparing food for others, ''swimming'', or having sex.' "
How can we reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistant Shigella?,"'Reducing the spread of antibiotic-resistant ''Shigella'' requires a multi-pronged approach: preventing infections, tracking resistance, improving antibiotic use, and developing new treatments.' "
How is Shigella spread?,"'Shigella'' germs are present in the stools of infected persons while they have diarrhea and for up to a week or two after the diarrhea has gone away. ''Shigella'' is very contagious; exposure to even a tiny amount of contaminated fecal matter -- too small to see-- can cause infection. Transmission of ''Shigella'' occurs when people put something in their mouths or swallow something that has come into contact with stool of a person infected with ''Shigella''. This can happen when:' Contaminated hands touch your food or mouth. Hands can become contaminated through a variety of activities, such as touching surfaces (e.g., toys, bathroom fixtures, changing tables, diaper pails) that have been contaminated by stool from an infected person. Hands can also become contaminated with Shigella while changing the diaper of an infected child or caring for an infected person. Eating food contaminated with Shigella. Food may become contaminated if food handlers have shigellosis. Produce can become contaminated if growing fields contain human sewage. Flies can breed in infected feces and then contaminate food when they land on it. Swallowing recreational (for example lake or river water while swimming) or drinking water that was contaminated by infected fecal matter. Exposure to feces through sexual contact."
How can I reduce my risk of getting shigellosis?,"'Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent shigellosis. However, you can reduce your risk of getting shigellosis by:' Carefully washing your hands with soap during key times:Before eating.After changing a diaper or helping to clean another person who has defecated (pooped). Before eating. After changing a diaper or helping to clean another person who has defecated (pooped). If you care for a child in diapers who has shigellosis, promptly discard the soiled diapers in a lidded, lined garbage can, and wash your hands and the child's hands carefully with soap and water immediately after changing the diapers. Any leaks or spills of diaper contents should be cleaned up immediately. Avoid swallowing water from ponds, lakes, or untreated swimming pools. When traveling internationally, follow food and water precautions strictly and wash hands with soap frequently. Avoid sexual activity with those who have diarrhea or who recently recovered from diarrhea."
I was diagnosed with shigellosis. What can I do to avoid giving it to other people?," Wash your hands with soap carefully and frequently, especially after using the toilet. Do not prepare food for others while you are sick. After you get better, wash your hands carefully with soap before preparing food for others. For those who work in healthcare, food service, or childcare facilities should not prepare or handle food for others until their local health department has authorized them to return to work. Improvements in worker sick leave policies and providing adequate hygiene facilities and education for food service workers may prevent shigellosis caused by contaminated foods. Avoid swimming until you have fully recovered. Don't have sex until several days after you no longer have diarrhea."
My child was diagnosed with shigellosis. How can I keep others from catching it?," Supervise handwashing of toddlers and small children after they use the toilet. Wash infants' hands with soap and water after diaper changes. Dispose of soiled diapers properly, and clean diaper changing areas after using them. Keep the child out of childcare and group play settings while ill with diarrhea, and follow the guidance of your local health department about returning your child to his or her childcare facility. Avoid taking your child swimming or to group water play venues until after he or she has fully recovered."
Should an infected person be excluded from school or work?,"'School and work exclusion policies differ by local jurisdiction. Check with your local or state health department to learn more about the laws where you live. It is critical to practice good hand-washing after changing diapers, after using the toilet, and before preparing or eating food to prevent the spread of these and many other infections.' "
What else can be done to prevent shigellosis?," Providing municipal water service, this may be lacking in many lower income countries. Making municipal water supplies available and safe and treating sewage are highly effective prevention measures that have been in place for many years. Following these guidelines to make your food safer to eat. People with shigellosis should not prepare food or drinks for others until they are well. Food service workers should not prepare or handle food for others until their local health department has authorized them to return to work. Improvements in worker sick leave policies and providing adequate hygiene facilities and education for food service workers may prevent shigellosis caused by contaminated foods. At swimming beaches, providing enough bathrooms and handwashing stations with soap near the swimming area helps keep the water from becoming contaminated."
What can be done if an outbreak of Shigella occurs in the childcare setting?," Exclude any child with diarrhea from the childcare setting until the diarrhea has stopped. Children who have recently recovered from shigellosis can be grouped together in one classroom (cohorted) to minimize exposing uninfected children and staff to Shigella. Assign separate staff to change diapers and prepare or serve food. Reassign adults with diarrhea to jobs that minimize opportunities for spreading infection (for example, administrative work instead of food preparation). Establish, implement, and enforce policies on water-play and swimming that:Exclude children ill with diarrhea from water-play and swimming activities.Exclude children diagnosed with Shigella from water-play and swimming activities for an additional week after their diarrhea has resolved.Have children and staff wash their hands before using water tables.Have children and staff shower with soap before swimming in the water.If a child is too young to shower independently, have staff wash the child, particularly the rear end, with soap and water.Take frequent bathroom breaks or check their diapers often.Change children's diapers in a diaper-changing area or bathroom and not by the water.Discourage children from getting the water in their mouths and swallowing it.Prohibit the use of temporary inflatable or rigid fill-and-drain swimming pools and slides because they can spread germs in childcare facilities. Exclude children ill with diarrhea from water-play and swimming activities. Exclude children diagnosed with Shigella from water-play and swimming activities for an additional week after their diarrhea has resolved.

Prohibit the use of temporary inflatable or rigid fill-and-drain swimming pools and slides because they can spread germs in childcare facilities."
People at Risk," Young children are the most likely to get shigellosis, but people from all age groups are affected. Many outbreaks are related to childcare settings and schools, and illness commonly spreads from young children to their family members and others in their communities because it is so contagious. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are more likely to acquire shigellosis than the general adult population. Shigella passes from stools [poop] or soiled fingers of one person to the mouth of another person, which can happen during sexual activity. Many shigellosis outbreaks among MSM have been reported in the United States, Canada, Tokyo, and Europe since 1999. HIV-infected persons can have more severe and prolonged shigellosis, including having the infection spread into the blood, which can be life-threatening. Large outbreaks of Shigella have occurred in traditionally observant Jewish communities. Documented outbreaks in traditionally observant Jewish communities often begin in childcare settings and spread within and between households during social gatherings. Travelers to developing countries may be more likely to get shigellosis, and to become infected with strains of Shigella that are resistant to important antibiotics. Travelers may be exposed through contaminated food, water (both drinking and recreational water), or surfaces. Travelers can protect themselves by strictly following food and water precautions, and washing hands with soap frequently."
Incidence,"'In 2013, the average annual incidence of shigellosis in the United States was 4.82 cases per 100,000 individuals.' "
Facts you should know about shin splints," Shin splints are a type of ""overuse injury"" to the legs. The pain is characteristic and located on the outer edge of the mid region of the leg next to the shinbone (tibia). It can be extreme and halt workouts. The diagnosis requires a careful focused examination. A multifaceted approach of ""relative rest"" can restore a pain-free level of activity and a return to competition. The relative rest approach includes a change in the workout, ice, rest, anti-inflammatory medications, stretching exercises, possible change in footwear, and gradual increase in running activities."
What are shin splints?,"'Shin splints are injuries to the front of the outer leg. While the exact injury is not known, shin splints seem to result from inflammation due to injury of the soft tissues in the front of the outer leg.''Shin splints are a member of a group of injuries called overuse injuries. Shin splints occur most commonly in runners or aggressive walkers.' "
What are risk factors for shin splints?,"'Risk factors for shin splints include running and over-training on hills, inadequate footwear for athletic activity, and poor biomechanics of the design of the legs and ''feet''.' "
What are shin splints symptoms? What do shin splints feel like?,"'Shin splints cause pain in the front of the outer leg below the knee. The pain of shin splints is characteristically located on the outer edge of the mid region of the leg next to the shinbone (tibia). An area of discomfort measuring 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) in length is frequently present. Pain is often noted at the early portion of the workout, then lessens, only to reappear near the end of the training session. Shin splint discomfort is often described as dull at first. However, with continuing ''trauma'', the pain can become so extreme as to cause the athlete to stop workouts altogether.'  "
What causes shin splints?,"'A primary culprit causing shin splints is a sudden increase in distance or intensity of a workout schedule. This increase in muscle work can be associated with inflammation of the lower leg muscles, those muscles used in lifting the foot (the motion during which the foot pivots toward the tibia). Such a situation can be aggravated by a tendency to pronate the foot (roll it excessively inward onto the arch).''Similarly, a tight Achilles tendon or weak ankle muscles are also often implicated in the development of shin splints.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose shin splints?,"""The diagnosis of shin splints is usually made during physical examination. It depends upon a careful review of the patient's history and a focused physical exam (on the examination of the shins and legs where local tenderness is noted).""'Specialized (and costly) tests (for example, bone scans) are generally only necessary if the diagnosis is unclear. Radiology tests, such as ''X-rays'', ''bone scan'', or ''MRI'' scan, can be helpful in this setting to detect ''stress fracture'' of the tibia bone.' "
What is the treatment for shin splints?,"'Previously, two different treatment management strategies were used: total rest or a ""run through it"" approach. The total rest was often an unacceptable option to the athlete. The run through it approach was even worse. It often led to worsening of the injury and of the symptoms.''Currently, a multifaceted approach of relative rest is successfully utilized to restore the athlete to a pain-free level of competition.'  "
What is the multifaceted relative rest approach?,"'The following steps are part of the multifaceted approach:' Workouts such as stationary bicycling or pool running: These will allow maintenance of cardiovascular fitness. Application of ice packs reduces inflammation. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve/Naprosyn), are also a central part of rehabilitation. A 4-inch wide Ace bandage wrapped around the region or a Neoprene calf sleeve also helps to reduce discomfort. Calf and anterior (front of) leg stretching and strengthening address the biomechanical problems discussed above and reduce pain. Pay careful attention to selecting the correct running shoe based upon the foot type (flexible pronator vs. rigid supinator). This is extremely important. In selected cases, shoe inserts (orthotics) may be necessary. Stretching and strengthening exercises are done twice a day. Run only when symptoms have generally resolved (often about two weeks) and with several restrictions:A level and soft terrain is best.Distance is limited to 50% of that tolerated preinjury.Intensity (pace) is similarly cut by one-half.Over a three- to six-week period, a gradual increase in distance is allowed.Only then can a gradual increase in pace be attempted. A level and soft terrain is best. Distance is limited to 50% of that tolerated preinjury. Intensity (pace) is similarly cut by one-half. Over a three- to six-week period, a gradual increase in distance is allowed. Only then can a gradual increase in pace be attempted."
What is the prognosis (outlook) for shin splints?,"'The extent of injury that occurs prior to any rehabilitation program plays a significant role in determining the time frame necessary for complete recovery. Generally, the outlook is excellent for full recovery, but physical therapy treatment can be necessary.' "
Is it possible to prevent shin splints?,"'To the extent that shin splints are an overuse injury, shin splints can be prevented by gradually increasing ''exercise'' activities. Proper footwear can also help to prevent shin splints.' "
What is shingles? What does shingles look like?,"'Shingles is a disease characterized by a painful, blistering skin rash that affects one side of the body, typically the face or torso. This condition may also be referred to as herpes zoster, zoster, or zona. The word ''shingles'' comes from the Latin word ''cingulum'', which means belt. There are approximately 1 million estimated new cases per year in the U.S., with almost one out of every three people developing shingles at some point in their lifetime. Though most people who develop shingles will only have a single episode, there are some who develop recurrent cases of shingles. Shingles is more common in older individuals and in those with weakened immune systems.''The characteristic rash of shingles typically appears after an initial period of burning, tingling, ''itching'', or stinging in the affected area. After a few days, the rash then appears in a stripe or band-like pattern along a nerve path (called a dermatome), affecting only one side of the body without crossing the midline. The rash erupts as clusters of small red patches that develop into ''blisters'', which may appear similar to ''chickenpox''. The blisters then break open and slowly begin to dry and eventually crust over.'  "
What causes shingles?,"'Shingles is caused when the varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivates, the same virus that causes chickenpox (varicella). Varicella-zoster belongs to the ''Herpesviridae'' family. Only those who have previously had chickenpox can develop shingles later in life, and rarely, those who have received the varicella vaccine can develop shingles later in life. Initial exposure to VZV, which typically occurs in children or adolescents, leads to the development of varicella. After the episode of chickenpox has resolved, the virus remains in a dormant state in the nervous system in certain nerve cells of the body located in the spine. While in this inactive state, you will not experience any symptoms from the varicella zoster virus. However, in certain individuals and for reasons that are not completely clear, the varicella zoster virus may re-emerge years later and travel along nerve fibers to cause shingles. The location and pattern of the ensuing rash reflects the region of the affected nerves.''Though similar in name, herpes zoster is not the same disease as herpes simplex (which is caused by the herpes simplex virus causing ''cold sores'', ''fever blisters'', or ''genital herpes'').' "
What are risk factors for shingles?,"'Shingles can only occur in individuals who have previously been exposed to the varicella zoster virus. Risk factors for the development of shingles include the following:' Increasing age: Though shingles can rarely occur in children, it is much more common in older adults, with the incidence increasing with age. This is thought to be in large part due to waning immunity as people age. Approximately 50% of all cases of shingles occur in adults 60 years of age or older. Weakened immune system: Individuals with impaired immune systems have a higher probability of developing shingles. This can be seen in diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS, or in individuals taking certain medications. Patients taking steroids or other immunosuppressive medications, such as people who have undergone organ transplants, and individuals with certain autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) are at increased risk for developing shingles. Psychological and emotional stressors are also thought to possibly contribute to the development of shingles, perhaps from the detrimental effects of stress on the immune system and the person's health."
What is the contagious period for shingles?,"'The virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be transmitted from person to person by direct contact with the fluid from the active blistering rash. Therefore, susceptible individuals should avoid contact with people who have active shingles, especially ''pregnant'' women who have never had chickenpox and immunocompromised individuals. It cannot be transmitted by ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'', and it is not ''contagious'' before the blisters appear. Once the shingles rash has dried and developed crusting, it generally is not considered to be contagious.''There are a few important points to consider when discussing the varicella zoster virus and transmissibility. If an individual who has never had chickenpox or the ''chickenpox vaccine'' comes in direct contact with the fluid from the shingles rash, they may go on to develop chickenpox, but they will not immediately develop shingles. It is possible, however, for them to develop shingles later in life, just as it is with others who have previously been exposed to the virus and developed chickenpox. Also, if you have previously been exposed to the varicella zoster virus and you have had chickenpox, you will not contract the virus from others with shingles.' "
What are shingles symptoms and signs? What are the stages of shingles?,"'Shingles usually starts with burning, tingling, itching, or stinging in the region where the rash will ultimately develop. Sometimes, this pain can be severe and individuals may complain of extremely sensitive skin. This discomfort typically occurs a few days before the visible rash develops. In rare instances, the characteristic shingles rash will not appear (a condition called zoster sine herpete).''Often, individuals may also experience other symptoms such as''A few days after the skin discomfort begins (or rarely, several weeks afterward), the characteristic rash of shingles will appear. It typically begins as clusters of small red patches that eventually develop into small blisters. These fluid-filled blisters eventually break open, and the small sores begin to slowly dry and scab over. The crusts usually fall off after several weeks, and the shingles rash typically clears up after approximately two to four weeks. Though uncommon, in cases of a severe rash, skin discoloration or scarring of the skin is possible.''The location of the shingles rash can vary. Though shingles can appear almost anywhere on the body, it most commonly affects the torso and the face (including the eyes, ears, and mouth). It is often present in the area of the ribcage or the waist. This characteristic rash is in a stripe or band-like pattern that affects only one side of the body (the right or the left), and it usually does not cross over the midline. In some cases, the rash can affect adjacent dermatomes (an area of skin that is supplied by a single ''spinal nerve''), and rarely it can affect three or more dermatomes (a condition termed disseminated zoster). Disseminated zoster generally occurs only in individuals with a compromised immune system.'

How do health care professionals diagnose shingles?,"'Shingles can often be diagnosed by your doctor based upon the distinctive appearance and distribution of the characteristic shingles rash. A painful, blistering rash that is localized to defined dermatomes is a sign highly suggestive of shingles. Blood work or other testing is usually not necessary. Diagnosing shingles before the appearance of the rash or in cases of zoster sine herpete (zoster without rash) can be challenging. In cases where the diagnosis is unclear, laboratory tests are available to help confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the clinical situation, testing can be done using either blood work (to detect antibodies to the varicella zoster virus) or by specialized testing of skin lesion samples.' "
What types of health care professionals treat shingles?,"'Shingles is most commonly diagnosed and treated by a primary care physician (family practitioner, pediatrician, and internist) or an ''emergency medicine'' physician. For certain individuals who develop complications of shingles, a specialist in ophthalmology, neurology, or infectious disease may also be involved. Select patients with postherpetic neuralgia may require the care of a pain specialist.' "
What are medical treatments for shingles?,"'The treatment for shingles is aimed at diminishing the effects of the virus, as well as ''pain management''. There are several medications that can be used, and your doctor will discuss the best treatment options for your particular situation. The vast majority of cases of shingles can be managed at home. In some cases, people with an impaired immune system or individuals with severe symptoms and/or complications may require hospital admission.''Antiviral ''drugs'' (medications used to combat viral infections) are used against the varicella zoster virus. These medications help shorten the course of the illness, decrease the severity of the illness, and hasten the healing of the skin lesions. They may also help prevent the potential complications sometimes encountered with shingles. Antiviral medications are most effective when started within 72 hours of the first appearance of the rash, however, in select cases of shingles (for example, in an immunocompromised person), it can be started after 72 hours. There are several antiviral medications that can be used, including ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax''), ''famciclovir'' (''Famvir''), and ''valacyclovir'' (''Valtrex''). In certain situations, intravenous (IV) antiviral medication may need to be administered.''Pain medication can be used to help relieve the discomfort caused by the rash, which can sometimes be severe. For some individuals with mild ''shingles pain'', ''over-the-counter'' analgesics such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or the anti-inflammatory drug ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'' or ''Advil'') may be all that is needed. Individuals with more severe pain may require stronger opioid pain medication.''Over-the-counter ''antihistamine'' medication such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') may help alleviate the localized itching.''The use of a ''corticosteroid'' medication, such as ''prednisone'', is used only in select cases of complicated shingles, such as those with eye or ear involvement, and it should be used with concurrent antiviral therapy. Prednisone is not generally recommended in cases of uncomplicated shingles.'

Are there any home remedies for shingles?,"'Care of the skin rash can be provided at home, and this can offer some symptom relief. Topical ''calamine lotion'"" can be applied to the rash in order to decrease itching. Cool wet compresses against the painful rash can sometimes be soothing, and for some individuals, a compress with aluminum acetate solution (Burow's solution or ""'Domeboro'') may also be helpful. For some, colloidal oatmeal baths may also provide relief from the itching. It is important to maintain good personal hygiene, avoid scratching the rash, wear loose-fitting clothes, and to try to keep the affected area clean in order to prevent a secondary bacterial infection of the skin. The rash should be covered to decrease the risk of transmissibility should you come into contact with susceptible individuals.' "
What is the duration of a shingles outbreak?,"'The duration of an acute shingles outbreak may vary, but typically it will last anywhere between two to four weeks. In some individuals, it may last longer.' "
What are complications of shingles?,"'Though shingles often resolves without any major problems, there are several potential complications that can arise from shingles.'   Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN): This is the most common complication of shingles. PHN is characterized by persistent pain and discomfort in the area affected by shingles. The pain can last for months to several years after the rash has cleared up. This complication is thought to occur because of damage to the affected nerves. The pain can sometimes be severe and difficult to control, and the likelihood of developing postherpetic neuralgia increases with age. This chronic post-herpetic pain can sometimes lead to depression and disability. In people 60 years of age and older with shingles, postherpetic neuralgia will develop in approximately 15%-25% of cases. It rarely occurs in people under 40 years of age. Timely treatment with antiviral medication during a shingles outbreak may help reduce the incidence of developing postherpetic neuralgia. If postherpetic neuralgia develops, there are various treatment options available including topical creams such as capsaicin (Zostrix), topical anesthetic lidocaine patches (Lidoderm), antiseizure medications such as gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), tricyclic antidepressant medications, and opioid pain medications. Intrathecal glucocorticoid injections may be useful for select patients with postherpetic neuralgia who do not respond to conventional medications and treatment measures."
What are complications of shingles? (Part 2)," Ramsay Hunt syndrome: If shingles affects the nerves of the face, this uncommon complication can lead to facial muscle paralysis, and the characteristic rash can affect the ear and the ear canal, and rarely the mouth. Symptoms may include ear pain, ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and dizziness. Though most people recover fully with treatment, some individuals may have permanent facial weakness and/or hearing loss. Bacterial skin infection: A secondary bacterial infection of the skin blisters can sometimes develop, leading to cellulitis or impetigo. These skin infections may be characterized by increasing redness, tenderness, and warmth in and around the area of the rash. Most of these bacterial skin infections are caused by either Staphylococcus aureus or group A Streptococcus bacteria. These bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics."
What are complications of shingles? (Part 3)," Eye involvement: Shingles can sometimes affect the eye, a condition termed herpes zoster ophthalmicus. In certain cases, it can lead to blindness. Individuals with a rash involving the eye, forehead, or nose should have a careful eye evaluation performed by a doctor, as prompt medical treatment may be necessary. Encephalitis: Rarely, individuals with shingles may develop inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). This condition can be life-threatening if severe, especially in people with an impaired immune system. Disseminated herpes zoster: This serious and potentially life-threatening condition occurs most commonly in people with an impaired immune system. It is rare in individuals who are otherwise healthy. With disseminated herpes zoster, the varicella zoster virus becomes more widespread. In addition to causing a more widespread rash, the virus can also spread to other organs of the body, including the brain, lung, and liver."
What can be done for recurrent shingles?,"'Though most people will experience only one episode of shingles during their lifetime, recurrence can occur in certain individuals. In order to help prevent recurrent episodes of shingles, individuals with no contraindications can receive the zoster vaccine (Shingrix), which can prevent recurrent episodes of shingles. Otherwise, people who do experience a recurrent case of shingles should see their doctor as soon as the rash appears to promptly receive antiviral medication.' "
What is the prognosis of shingles?,"'Generally speaking, shingles typically resolves within two to four weeks in most individuals. The prognosis is excellent for younger and healthy individuals who develop shingles, with very few experiencing any complications. However, in older individuals and in those with compromised immune systems, the prognosis is more guarded, as complications and more severe outbreaks of shingles occur more commonly in these groups.''Approximately 1%-4% of people who develop shingles require hospitalization for complications, and about 30% of those hospitalized have impaired immune systems. In the U.S., it is estimated that there are approximately 96 deaths per year directly related to the varicella zoster virus, the vast majority of which occur in the elderly and in those who are immunocompromised.' "
Is it possible to prevent shingles with a vaccine?,"'In October 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Shingrix, a non-live vaccine to prevent shingles. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) subsequently endorsed Shingrix as the preferred vaccine for the ''prevention'' of herpes zoster and its related complications in healthy adults 50 years of age and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults who previously received the current ''shingles vaccine'' ''Zostavax'', which was approved by the FDA in 2006. Shingrix, a two-dose vaccine, was found to prevent shingles in more than 90% of patients who received it in ''clinical trials''. By preventing shingles, Shingrix also decreases the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. Not only does Shingrix provide superior efficacy across all age groups, but it is also felt to confer longer lasting immunity than Zostavax, which has experienced temporary vaccine shortages due to supply issues. Shingrix is expected to be widely available to U.S. consumers in early 2018. During clinical trials, the most common side effects associated with Shingrix included pain, swelling, and redness at the site of injection, ''headache'', muscle aches, fever, chills, and ''upset stomach''.''Research funded and conducted by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) on shingles and the varicella zoster virus is ongoing to better understand the behavior of this virus. Several other organizations are also involved in research to understand, treat, and prevent varicella zoster virus reactivation.'

Who should get the shingles vaccine?,"'At this time, Shingrix is recommended for healthy adults who are 50 years of age or older. Individuals should receive the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, as data shows that more than 99% of Americans over 40 years of age have had chickenpox, even if they do not remember having had it. Shingrix is also recommended for individuals who have already received the Zostavax vaccine, as Shingrix has demonstrated superior efficacy and longer lasting protection.''Shingrix is not indicated for the prevention of primary varicella (chickenpox) infection. The CDC recommends the varicella vaccine for healthy people who do not have evidence of immunity to varicella, including children, adolescents, and adults.' "
What is shingles?,"'Shingles is a painful skin rash caused by reactivation of prior infection with the same virus that previously caused ''chickenpox'', known as ''varicella'' zoster virus (VZV). VZV belongs to the ''herpes'' family of ''viruses'', but it is not the same virus that causes ''genital herpes'' or ''cold sores'' on the mouth. When a person is infected with VZV in childhood, they typically develop ''chickenpox'', but after the illness resolves the VZV remains in a dormant state in the nervous system and is never fully cleared from the body. Under certain circumstances, such as emotional ''stress'', immune deficiency (from ''AIDS'' or ''chemotherapy''), or with ''cancer'', the virus reactivates and causes the skin and nerve inflammation known as shingles.''Shingles occurs most commonly in people over the age of 60, but anyone who has ever had chickenpox is at risk, including pregnant women. It has been estimated that up to 1,000,000 cases of shingles occur each year in the U.S.' "
What do shingles look like?, 
What are the signs and symptoms of shingles?,"'The hallmark symptom of shingles is a painful, blistering rash. ''Pain'' from shingles may be severe in intensity. The pain, or a tingling sensation in some cases, may precede the development of the actual rash, making the cause of the pain hard to ascertain. Small ''blisters'' form on a red base, and new ''blisters'' continue to appear for 3 to 5 days. The rash follows the path of individual nerves, and typically presents in a band-like pattern on one side of the body. After the blisters rupture, they begin to crust over and heal. The entire outbreak from onset to healing takes about 3 to 4 weeks.''Fever'', ''headache'', ''chills'', and ''nausea'' can sometimes accompany the painful skin rash.' "
How is shingles diagnosed?,"'The characteristic rash of shingles typically suggests the diagnosis, and in most cases, no specific diagnostic tests are required. In cases in which there is pain but no apparent rash, the diagnosis can be very difficult. Laboratory testing to detect the genetic material or surface proteins of the VZV can be used in atypical or difficult cases.' "
"What is the 
	treatment for shingles in pregnancy?","'Treatment for shingles is generally prescription or over-the-counter antiviral, pain, and antihistamine medication.' "
Antiviral medication to treat shingles,"'The prescription antiviral medications typically used to treat shingles are safe to take during pregnancy. These drugs include ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax''), ''valacyclovir'' (''Valtrex''), or ''famciclovir'' (''Famvir''). Antiviral medications can reduce the severity and duration of the rash if started early (within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash).' "
Pain medication to treat shingles,"'Pain medications, such as acetaminophen, can also be used for pain relief, although these will not affect the progression of the blisters and rash. Pregnant women should discuss any pain relief medications with their health care professional. Pregnant women should not take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs'') like ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'', ''Nuprin'', etc.) late in the pregnancy.' "
Antihistamine medication to treat shingles,"'Antihistamines such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') can help reduce any associated ''itching''. Other home remedies for itching include oatmeal baths and ''calamine lotion''. Many women find that applying cool cloths or compresses provides relief as well. Keeping the affected areas covered with clean gauze and wearing loose clothing can help speed healing and prevent secondary infection of the affected skin.'

"What are the 
	complications of shingles in pregnancy?","'Postherpetic neuralgia'' is the most common complication of shingles. This condition develops in about 20% of people who have shingles and is characterized by persistent pain at the affected site after the rash has disappeared. It goes away by 4 months after the initial rash in most people. This complication is less common in pregnant women since it rarely occurs in people under 40 years of age. Postherpetic neuralgia is more common in people over 60 who do not receive treatment for shingles. ''Shingles that affects the eye is another uncommon condition. It is essential to see a doctor if you develop shingles around the eye area. In very rare cases, the virus can spread to the brain and membranes around the central nervous system. Other potential complications include ''hearing'' or balance problems and ''weakness'' of the muscles on one side of the face, known as ''Ramsay Hunt syndrome''. All of these complications, like postherpetic neuralgia, are more common in older adults and affect pregnant women less commonly.''Sometimes, secondary ''bacterial infections'' develop at the site of the rash. These can be treated with antibiotics, and antibiotics can be chosen that are safe for use in pregnancy.'

What is the outlook (prognosis) for shingles in pregnancy?,'Most cases of shingles heal without a risk of serious complications or long-term problems. ' 
Can shingles in pregnancy be prevented?,"'If you have had chickenpox in the past, you have been infected with the VZV and there is no absolute way to prevent shingles. However, you cannot catch shingles from someone else who has shingles or chickenpox if you have had chickenpox or have immunity to the chickenpox virus. However, pregnant women who have not had chickenpox may catch chickenpox from someone with shingles or chickenpox. Chickenpox infection during pregnancy can be dangerous to the unborn baby, so it is important to avoid contact with people with shingles or chickenpox if you have not had the condition or the vaccine.''Children in the US today are typically vaccinated against the VZV (''chickenpox vaccine''). A vaccine to prevent shingles (''Zostavax'') is also available that reduces the incidence of shingles by about 50%, but the vaccine cannot be taken by pregnant women. Women who receive the Zostavax vaccine should wait at least 3 months before attempting pregnancy.' "
What is shock?,"""Shock is a life-threatening medical condition as a result of insufficient blood flow throughout the body. Shock often accompanies severe injury or illness. Medical shock is a medical emergency and can lead to other conditions such as lack of oxygen in the body's tissues (""'hypoxia''), ''heart attack'' (''cardiac arrest'') or organ damage. It requires immediate treatment as symptoms can worsen rapidly. ''Medical shock is different than emotional or psychological shock that can occur following a traumatic or frightening emotional event. ' "
What are the 5 types of shock?,"'Septic shock'' results from bacteria multiplying in the blood and releasing toxins. Common causes of this are ''pneumonia'', ''urinary tract infections'', skin infections (''cellulitis''), intra-abdominal infections (such as a ruptured ''appendix''), and meningitis.''Anaphylactic shock'' is a type of severe hypersensitivity or ''allergic'' reaction. Causes include ''allergy'' to ''insect stings'', medicines, or foods (nuts, berries, seafood), etc.''Cardiogenic shock'' happens when the heart is damaged and unable to supply sufficient blood to the body. This can be the end result of a heart attack or ''congestive heart failure''.''Hypovolemic shock'' is caused by severe blood and fluid loss, such as from traumatic bodily injury, which makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to the body, or severe ''anemia'' where there is not enough blood to carry oxygen through the body.''Neurogenic shock'' is caused by ''spinal cord injury'', usually as a result of a traumatic accident or injury.'  "
What are the 8 main causes of shock?,"'There are several main causes of shock:'   Heart conditions (heart attack, heart failure) Heavy internal or external bleeding, such as from a serious injury or rupture of a blood vessel Dehydration, especially when severe or related to heat illness. Infection (septic shock) Severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock) Spinal injuries (neurogenic shock) Burns Persistent vomiting or diarrhea"
What are the symptoms of shock?,"'Low blood pressure'' and rapid heart rate (tachycardia) are the key signs of shock. ''Symptoms of all types of shock include: ''Depending on the type of shock the following symptoms may also be observed:'   Rapid, shallow breathing Cold, clammy skin Rapid, weak pulse Dizziness or fainting Weakness Eyes appear to stare Anxiety or agitation Seizures Confusion or unresponsiveness Low or no urine output Bluish lips and fingernails Sweating Chest pain "
When should I seek medical care for shock?,"""Medical shock is a medical emergency. If you suspect shock after an injury, even if the person seems stable, call 911 or get them to an emergency department immediately. Prompt treatment can save a person's life. """"The sooner shock is treated, the better. When treated quickly there is less risk of damage to a person's vital organs. "" "
What is the treatment for shock?,"'Depending on the type or the cause of the shock, treatments differ. In general, fluid resuscitation (giving a large amount of fluid to raise blood pressure quickly) with an IV in the ambulance or emergency room is the first-line treatment for all types of shock. The doctor will also administer medications such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or ''dopamine'"" to the fluids to try to raise a patient's blood pressure to ensure blood flow to the vital organs.""'Tests (for example, ''X-rays'"", blood tests, EKGs) will determine the underlying cause of the shock and uncover the severity of the patient's illness.""'Septic shock'' is treated with prompt administration of antibiotics depending on the source and type of underlying infection. These patients are often dehydrated and require large amounts of fluids to increase and maintain blood pressure.''Anaphylactic shock'' is treated withdiphenhydramine (Benadryl), epinephrine (an ""Epi-pen""), steroid medications ''methylprednisolone'' (''Solu-Medrol''), and sometimes a H2-Blocker medication (for example,''famotidine'' [''Pepcid''],''cimetidine'' [''Tagamet''], etc.).''Cardiogenic shock'' is treated by identifying and treating the underlying cause. A patient with a heart attack may require a surgical procedure called a  ''cardiac catheterization'"" to unblock an artery. A patient with congestive heart failure may need medications to support and increase the force of the heart's beat. In severe or prolonged cases, a ""'heart transplant'' may be the only treatment.''Hypovolemic shock'' is treated with fluids (saline) in minor cases, but may require multiple blood transfusions in severe cases. The underlying cause of the bleeding must also be identified and corrected.''Neurogenic shock'' is the most difficult to treat. Damage to the spinal cord is often irreversible and causes problems with the natural regulatory functions of the body. Besides fluids and monitoring, immobilization (keeping the spine from moving), anti-inflammatory medicine such as steroids, and sometimes surgery are the main parts of treatment.''Self-Care at Home'  Call 911 for immediate medical attention any time a person has symptoms of 
shock. Do not wait for symptoms to worsen before calling for help. Stay with the 
person until help arrives, and if possible, stay on the line with the 911 
	dispatcher because they may have specific instructions for you.  While waiting for help or on the way to the emergency room, check the 
person's airway, breathing and circulation (the ABCs). Administer CPR if you are trained. 
If the person is breathing on his or her own, continue to check breathing every 
	2 minutes until help arrives.  Do NOT move a person who has a known or suspected spinal injury (unless 
	they are in imminent danger of further injury). Have the person lie down on his or her back with the feet elevated above 
the head (if raising the legs causes pain or injury, keep the person flat) to 
increase blood flow to vital organs. Do not raise the head. Keep the person warm and comfortable. Loosen tight clothing and cover them 
with a blanket.  Do not give fluids by mouth, even if the person complains of thirst. There 
is a choking risk in the event of sudden loss of consciousness.  Give appropriate first aid for any injuries.  Direct pressure should be applied to any
	wounds that are bleeding 
	significantly."
Can shock be prevented?,"'Learn ways to prevent ''heart disease'', injuries, dehydration and other causes of shock. ''If you have a known ''allergy'', carry an epinephrine pen, which your doctor can prescribe. Avoid severe ''allergy'' triggers.' "
What is the outlook for shock?,"'Prompt treatment of medical shock is essential for the best outcome. Moreover, the outlook depends on the cause of the shock, the general health of the patient, and the promptness of treatment and recovery.' Generally, hypovolemic shock and anaphylactic shock respond well to medical 
treatment if initiated early. Septic shock is a serious condition with a mortality rate of 24% 
	to 50% 
according to some estimates. The sooner the infection is treated and fluids are 
administered, the greater the chances of success. Hospitals are now developing 
	and utilizing specific protocols to identify and aggressively treat septic 
	shock patients. Cardiogenic shock has a poor prognosis, with only 1/3 of patients surviving. 
Because this type of shock results from injury or dysfunction of the heart it is 
often difficult to treat and overcome.  Spinal shock also has a very poor prognosis because the spinal cord mediates 
so many important bodily functions. There are currently very few effective 
treatments but medical research is making advances in the treatment of spinal 
injuries. "
Facts you should know about the birth control pill vs. Depo-Provera,"   The choice of what birth control method is highly personal and depends upon many factors. It is important to consider your age, overall health status, and how long you would like the birth control method to last. It also is important to look at how well each method works (its effectiveness) in preventing pregnancy, how easy each method is for you to use, and any side effects or drug interactions it may cause. The birth control pill (""the pill"", oral contraceptives) and the Depo-Provera hormone injection (""shot"") are just two of the many choices a woman has to prevent pregnancy. This article compares birth control pills (known as oral contraceptives) with the birth control shot (Depo-Provera injection). Women who have been using the shot may also have some delay in their ability to get pregnant after stopping it, for up to about 10 months in contrast to about 6 months for birth control pills."
What is the effectiveness of the birth control vs. Depo-Provera?," Both the pill and the shot are very effective methods of birth control. When combination birth control pills are taken correctly, they are up to 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. Progestin-only pills are about 95% effective. The birth control shot (Depo-Provera) also is about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy (average annual failure rate is about 3%)."
Do birth control pills or Depo-Provera cause weight gain?,"'Yes, women have reported ''weight gain'' while taking oral contraceptives and using the Depo-''Provera'' shot.' "
What are the differences and similarities between how birth control pills and Depo-Provera work?,"'Birth control pills and the birth control Depo-Provera shot are both ''hormonal methods of birth control''. This means that they work by changing hormone levels in your body, preventing pregnancy from occurring. The hormones in birth control pills prevent release of an egg, or ''ovulation''.''Birth control pills are available as combination pills, containing the hormones estrogen and progestin, or as mini-pills containing progestin only.' Both typically come in packs of 28 pills, and you take one pill daily. With combination pills, the last 7 pills in the pack do not contain hormones, and while you are taking these non-hormone pills, your menstrual period occurs. The menstrual period also occurs during the last 7 days of the progestin-only pill packs. Some newer types of birth control pills are taken continuously for a few months without the inactive pills, before a menstrual period occurs. The pill also works to make the cervix (opening to the womb or uterus) and the uterus itself unfavorable for a pregnancy to begin. The birth control shot is known as Depo-Provera (and the newer low-dose Depo-SubQ Provera 104). The Depo-Provera shot contains the hormone progestin and prevents pregnancy for three months in a row. Like the hormones in birth control pills, the progestin in the shot make the environment in the uterus unfavorable to begin a pregnancy and may stop ovulation."
What are side effects of the pill and Depo-Provera?,   Nausea Vomiting Mood changes So called “breakthrough” bleeding or spotting at times other than the menstrual period. The side effects of the pill tend to get better after you have been using it a few months. Acne Depression Irregular periods Weakness Fatigue Both methods can cause tenderness or soreness of the breasts. Other side effects of oral contraceptives and the Depo-Provera shot include headaches and mood changes. Both methods can lead to a decreased interest in sex (decreased libido) in some women.
What are the risks of the birth control pill and Depo-Provera?,"'Both the pill and the shot do not offer any protection against sexually-transmitted diseases (''STDs''). Missing pills or taking longer than 12 weeks to get another shot increases the chances of ''becoming pregnant''.''Other health risks of oral contraceptives''Other health risks of the Depo-Provera shot'  Combination birth control pills have been linked to a small increase in the risk of heart attack. However, this is a very rare event in young women. Birth control pills that contain estrogen increase the risk of blood clots, and some types of pills may increase the risk of stroke. Because of these risks, it is recommended that women over age 35 who smoke cigarettes, hookahs, etc. (tobacco) not use birth control pills. Birth control pills appear to increase the risk of cervical cancer, but decrease the risk of ovarian and endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer. Data about their effect on breast cancer risk are not clear. Women with migraine headache also appear to have an increased risk of blood clots when taking the pill, particularly women over age 35. The birth control shot also may reduce bone density, perhaps raising the risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life. Many experts also recommend that women with a history of blood clots or risk factors for cardiovascular disease not use the birth control shot."
What are other birth control options?,"'There are many different kinds and choices of birth control to prevent from ''becoming pregnant'', for example, hormonal, for methods like birth control pills, and the birth control shot. Other ''birth control methods'' include:' Barrier methods like the cervical cap, spermicides, and the diaphragm for women or condoms for men. IUDs (intrauterine devices) Natural family planning (for example, the rhythm method) Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation or vasectomy)"
What is a sentinel node biopsy?,"'A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a few lymph nodes nearest to the tumor are removed and examined for the presence of cancer cells. It is a minimally invasive surgery with a low risk of side effects. Sentinel lymph node biopsy or SLNB helps the doctor know about the stage of the cancer. This helps them plan appropriate treatment for the patient. It also helps the doctor know the patient’s chances of recovery (prognosis).''During a sentinel lymph node biopsy:''If the sentinel lymph node biopsy detects cancer cells, the surgeon removes all local lymph nodes or destroys them with ''radiation therapy'' or does both surgery and ''radiation'' therapy.' A dye or a tracer material is injected into the site of the tumor to help the surgeon locate the sentinel nodes during the procedure. The path from the tumor to the sentinel lymph nodes is mapped using an instrument that detects the tracer. The surgeon removes the sentinel lymph nodes and sends them for lab examination."
What are the complications of sentinel node biopsy?,"'Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure. This crucial procedure usually has minimal risks. Some of the complications of sentinel node biopsy include:' Bleeding Pain Bruising Infections Allergic reactions to the dye used during the procedure Injury Lymphedema (localized swelling, typically in the arms and legs, due to blockage in lymph flow)"
Do uterine fibroids require surgery?,"'Fibroids range in size from small seedlings that are undetectable by the human eye to bulky masses that can enlarge and distort the anatomy of the uterus. Fibroids may need surgery if:''In extreme cases, multiple large fibroids can enlarge the uterus to an extent that it reaches the rib cage and may even add to the body weight.''Pregnancy and fibroids:''Some types of fibroids can cause ''infertility'' or loss of pregnancy. Fibroids may increase the risk of certain complications during pregnancy, such as restricted fetal growth/low birth weight or premature birth.' They are big enough to distort the uterine function. They cause heavy periods. They interfere with pregnancy."
When to see a doctor?,"'The following require medical attention:' Pelvic pain that doesn't go away Overly heavy, prolonged, or painful periods with blood clots Spotting or bleeding between periods Difficulty emptying your bladder Anemia (decreased red blood cells) due to blood loss during periods. Anemia presents with fatigue, pale skin and eyes, shortness of breath, etc."
What are the signs and symptoms of uterine fibroids?,"'Many women may not have any symptoms. In women who have symptoms, the most common signs and symptoms of ''uterine fibroids'' include:' Heavy menstrual bleeding Menstrual periods lasting more than a week Pelvic pressure or pain Difficulty urinating Constipation Back pain"
How are uterine fibroids treated?,"'The treatment options are as follows:''Observation and follow-up'': Many women with ''uterine fibroids'' may not have signs or have mild symptoms that can be managed conservatively to provide symptomatic relief.''Medications'': These include medications that target hormones that regulate the ''menstrual cycle'' and treat symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding or ''pain'"". Medications don't eliminate fibroids but may help shrink them:""'Noninvasive procedures:''Minimally invasive procedures:''Traditional surgical procedures:' Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists: They block the production of estrogen and progesterone. This causes menstruation to stop, putting the patient in a temporary menopausal state. As a result, fibroids shrink, and anemia often improves. Progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD): A progestin-releasing IUD can relieve symptoms such as heavy bleeding caused by fibroids. It provides an additional benefit of contraception but doesn't shrink fibroids or make them disappear. Lysteda and Cyklokapron (Tranexamic acid): These non-hormonal medications are taken to reduce bleeding during periods. Oral contraceptives: These can help control menstrual bleeding but don't shrink the fibroid size. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These can be effective in relieving pain related to fibroids, but they don't reduce menstrual bleeding or shrink fibroids. Nutritional supplements: Vitamins and iron supplements may be advised to correct anemia and improve overall health. Focused ultrasound surgery (FUS): It is a non-invasive treatment option for uterine fibroids that preserves your uterus, requires no incision, and is done on an outpatient basis. It is performed while the person is inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The setup is equipped with a high-energy ultrasound transducer for treatment. The images give the doctor the precise location of the uterine fibroids. When the location of the fibroid is targeted, the ultrasound transducer focuses on sound waves (sonication) into the fibroid that heats up and destroys small areas of fibroid tissue. This is a newer technology, so researchers are learning more about long-term safety and effectiveness. But so far, data collected show that FUS for uterine fibroids is safe and effective. Uterine artery embolization: Embolic agents (small particles) are injected into the arteries supplying the uterus, cutting off blood flow to fibroids, causing them to regress. Radiofrequency ablation: Radiofrequency energy is used to destroy uterine fibroids, and it shrinks the blood vessels that feed them.  Laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy: During myomectomy surgery, the fibroids are removed, leaving the uterus intact. Hysteroscopic myomectomy: In this procedure, the surgeon inserts instruments through the vagina and cervix into the uterus to remove the fibroids. Endometrial ablation: A specialized instrument is inserted into the uterus. Heat, microwave energy, hot water, or electric current is used to destroy the lining of the uterus, resulting in the ending of menstruation or reducing menstrual flow. Abdominal myomectomy: In the case of multiple fibroids or very large or deep fibroids, the surgeon may use an open abdominal surgical technique to remove the fibroids. Hysterectomy: This involves the removal of the uterus. It is a permanent solution for uterine fibroids."
What is shoulder and neck pain?,"'Your neck and shoulders contain muscles, bones, nerves, arteries, and veins, as well as many ligaments and other supporting structures. Many conditions can cause ''pain'' in the neck and shoulder area. Some are life-threatening (such as ''heart attack'' and major ''trauma''), and others are not so dangerous (such as simple ''strains'' or ''contusions'').' "
What causes shoulder and neck pain?,"   The most common cause of shoulder pain and neck pain is injury to the soft tissues, including the muscles, tendons, and ligaments within these structures. This can occur from whiplash or other injury to these areas. Degenerative arthritis of the spine in the neck (cervical spine) can pinch nerves that can cause both neck pain and shoulder pain. Degenerative disc disease in the neck (cervical spondylosis) can cause local neck pain or radiating pain from disc herniation, causing pinching of nerves (cervical radiculopathy). Abnormal conditions involving the spinal cord, heart, lungs, and some abdominal organs also can cause neck and shoulder pain. Here are some examples: Broken collarbone: Falling on your outstretched arm can cause your collarbone to break. This is particularly common when cyclers fall off of their bicycles. Bursitis: A bursa is a sac over the joints to provide a cushion to the joints and muscles. These bursae can become swollen, stiff, and painful after injuries. Heart attacks: Although the problem is the heart, heart attacks can cause shoulder or neck pain, known as ""referred"" pain. Broken shoulder blade: An injury to the shoulder blade usually is associated with relatively forceful trauma. Rotator cuff injuries: The rotator cuff is a group of tendons that support the shoulder. These tendons can be injured during lifting, when playing sports with a lot of throwing, or after repetitive use over a long time. This can lead to pain with motion of the shoulder due to shoulder impingement syndrome and eventually to a chronic loss of range of motion of the shoulder (frozen shoulder). Shoulder or A-C separation: The collarbone (clavicle) and shoulder blade (scapula) are connected by ligaments. With trauma to the shoulder, these ligaments can be stretched or torn. Whiplash injury: Injury to the ligamentous and muscular structures of the neck and shoulder can be caused by sudden acceleration or deceleration, as in a car accident. This can also cause muscle spasms in the neck and shoulder areas. Tendonitis: The tendons connect the muscles to the bones. With strain, the tendons can become swollen and cause pain. This is also referred to as tendinitis. Gallbladder disease: This can cause a pain referred to the right shoulder. Any cause of inflammation under the diaphragm can also cause referred pain in the shoulder."
What are risk factors for shoulder and neck pain?,"'Risk factors for shoulder and neck pain include athletic activity, heavy lifting, throwing, moving luggage or other heavy objects, and ''aging''.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of shoulder and neck pain?,"   Pain: All pain seems sharp, but pain can also be described as dull, burning, crampy, shock-like, or stabbing. Pain can lead to a stiff neck or shoulder and loss of range of motion. Headache may result. The character of each symptom is important to your doctor because the particular features can be clues to the cause of your pain. Weakness: Weakness can be due to severe pain from muscle or bone movement. The nerves that supply the muscles, however, also could be injured. It is important to distinguish true weakness (muscle or nerve damage) from inability or reluctance to move because of pain or inflammation. Numbness: If the nerves are pinched, bruised, or cut, you may not be able to feel things normally. This may cause a burning or tingling sensation, a loss of sensation, or an altered sensation similar to having your arm ""fall asleep."" Coolness: A cool arm or hand suggests that the arteries, veins, or both have been injured or blocked. This may mean that not enough blood is getting into the arm. Color changes: A blue or white tinge to the skin of your arm or shoulder is another sign that the arteries or veins could have been injured. Redness can indicate infection or inflammation. Rashes may be noted as well. Bruising may be evident. Swelling: This may be generalized to the whole arm or may be localized over the involved structures (a fracture area or an inflamed bursa, for example). Muscle spasms or tightness may simulate actual swelling. Dislocation or deformity may cause a swollen appearance or, paradoxically, a sunken area. Deformity: A deformity may be present if you have a fracture or a dislocation. Certain ligament tears can cause an abnormal positioning of the bony structures."
When should I seek medical care for shoulder or neck pain?,"'If pain or other symptoms start to worsen, call your doctor or immediately go to a hospital emergency department.' For milder cases, basic home care measures (see below) are adequate until your doctor can see you. In many cases, simple injuries, such as strains and bruises, heal themselves and do not require an office visit. For persisting pain in the shoulder or neck, an evaluation by a health care professional is appropriate. If you have severe or worsening pain, weakness, numbness, coolness, deformity, or color changes, you should go to a hospital emergency department immediately. If you develop a high fever (temperature < 102.5 F), severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, or sweatiness, or if you develop the sudden onset of numbness or weakness, particularly on one side of the body, call 911 for emergency services to go to the nearest emergency department by ambulance."
What specialists treat shoulder and neck pain?,"'Shoulder and neck pain is treated by primary care physicians, including general practitioners, internists, and family medicine doctors, as well as orthopedists, neurosurgeons, ''rheumatologists'', neurologists, and physiatrists. Ancillary health care professionals who treat shoulder and neck pain include physical therapists and chiropractors.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose shoulder and neck pain?,"'A thorough history and physical examination are usually adequate to establish the diagnosis for most injuries. However, your doctor may do a series of tests, depending on the cause of your injury, the location of your pain, or your other symptoms. The list is extensive and may include ''X-rays'', an ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG''), blood tests, and ''CT scans''.' X-rays: These may be done if you have tenderness to touch along the bony areas of your spine or shoulder, a history of significant trauma, deformity of the area, or your doctor suspects a condition related to your heart or lungs. ECG: An electrocardiogram may be ordered if you also have chest pain, shortness of breath, and risk factors for a heart attack (such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or tobacco use). Blood tests: These may be performed if you also have chest pain, shortness of breath, and risk factors for a heart attack (such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or tobacco use) or if your doctor suspects an underlying illness as the cause of the pain. CT scan: This may be performed when X-rays are difficult to read or suggest a fracture, when more detail is needed, or when other structures are suspected to be the source of the pain (possibly the large artery known as the aorta leading from the heart or the lungs). MRI: An MRI is often not indicated during an initial evaluation but can be helpful in assessing ongoing pain and failure to respond to basic treatment measures."
What are home remedies for shoulder and neck pain?,"'Minor injuries that have only slight pain can be treated at home. If the source of the pain and the cause of the pain are not known, or if symptoms suggest you might have a more serious condition, you should contact your doctor while initiating basic care measures.' Rest: Use the injured area as little as possible for the first two to three days, then slowly begin to exercise the injured area. This speeds recovery. Ice: Place the ice in a plastic bag, wrap the bag with a towel, and then apply to the injured area for 15-20 minutes every hour. Directly applying ice can damage the skin. Elevation: Elevation of the injured area above your heart helps the swelling go down. This reduces your pain. Use pillows to prop yourself up. Pain control: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help control swelling and pain. Heat: Do not apply heat in the first week after an injury because it can increase the swelling in the injured area and worsen your pain."
What are medical treatments for shoulder and neck pain?,"'A treatment plan will be developed after a complete history and physical examination (and any tests, if indicated). Treatment options vary for each condition. Clearly, a simple strain is treated far differently than a heart attack.'   If you have a minor sprain or strain, then you can expect a combination of the following treatments:Pain medications: It may take several days to settle the pain down using acetaminophen (Tylenol) with or without an anti-inflammatory medicine such as ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). Stronger narcotic-containing medicines are usually not necessary, but your doctor may provide these for the first few days.Immobilization: This may be accomplished possibly using a splint, cast, or sling. It is very important to follow your doctor's instructions regarding the use of these devices, particularly when it is advised to discontinue the use and begin moving the area.Instructions: It's best to rest and elevate the injured area. Continued use of the injured area may not necessarily make the injury worse, but it can prolong the symptoms. In most cases, limited use is acceptable within normal ranges of motion and without weight or strain.Hospital stay: If you are more severely injured, you may need to be admitted to the hospital for further testing or may be referred to an orthopedist (bone and joint specialist) for care.

Is follow-up necessary after treatment of shoulder and neck pain?,'Timely follow-up visits to your doctor plus following his or her recommendations will enable you to recover faster. Eventually gradual exercises and/or rehabilitation with physical therapy can be used to help recovery and prevent further injury.' 
How can I prevent shoulder and neck pain?," To prevent injuries, examine your home for potential hazards and correct them to reduce the chance of accidental injury. Proper exercise of the shoulders and neck can reduce the risk of injury. When performing hazardous tasks, have someone present to reduce the likelihood of injury. For example, when climbing a ladder, have someone hold the base of the ladder to keep it from sliding to either side. Know your limitations. Do not perform activities that you do not have the training, skills, tools, or strength to accomplish. Wear seat belts and use other safety equipment to reduce injuries."
What is the prognosis for shoulder and neck pain?,"'Because most neck and shoulder pain is caused by ''sprains'' and strains, you can expect a full recovery or to recover with minor limitations on your activities.''Some conditions require hospitalization, surgical repair, physical therapy, or other rehabilitative measures. The extent of recovery may be complete or limited. Some conditions can be recurrent or persistent; thus, you should have a treatment plan to learn how to deal with and adapt to any limitations.' "
What is shoulder bursitis?,"'A bursa is a tiny fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body. The plural of ''bursa'' is ''bursae''. There are 160 bursae in the body. The major bursae are located adjacent to the tendons near the large joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees.''Bursitis'' is inflammation of a bursa. Injury or inflammation of a bursa around the shoulder joint causes shoulder bursitis.'  "
What causes shoulder bursitis?,"'A bursa can become inflamed from injury, infection (rare in the shoulder), or an underlying rheumatic condition. Examples include infection of the bursa in front of the knee from a knee scraping on asphalt (septic ''prepatellar bursitis''), inflammation of the elbow bursa from ''gout'' crystals (gouty olecranon bursitis), or injury as subtle as lifting a bag of groceries into the car, which could inflame the shoulder bursa and lead to shoulder bursitis.' "
What are risk factors for shoulder bursitis?,"'Injury or strain to the shoulder joint causes shoulder bursitis. Activities that are common risk factors for shoulder bursitis include throwing a ball, lifting objects overhead, and ''trauma'' from a fall onto the shoulder.' "
What are shoulder bursitis symptoms and signs? How is shoulder bursitis diagnosed?,"'Bursitis is typically identified by localized ''pain'' or swelling, tenderness, and ''pain'' with motion of the tissues in the affected area. X-ray testing can sometimes detect calcifications in the bursa when bursitis has been chronic or recurrent. ''MRI'' scanning (''magnetic resonance imaging'') can also define bursitis. Shoulder bursitis is often accompanied by tendinitis of tendons adjacent to the affected bursa in the shoulder. Shoulder bursitis causes focal tenderness of the inflamed tissues. It can also cause a ""pinching"" pain when the elbow is moved away from the body, referred to as an ""impingement"" sign.'  "
What are treatments for shoulder bursitis?,"""Sometimes shoulder bursitis requires aspiration of the bursa fluid. This procedure involves removal of the fluid with a needle and syringe under sterile conditions and can be performed in the doctor's office. Often the fluid is sent to the laboratory for further analysis. Noninfectious shoulder bursitis can also be treated with an injection of cortisone medication into the swollen bursa. This is typically done at the same time as the aspiration procedure. Physical therapy can be used to aid the recovery from bursitis, especially when it is accompanied by a ""'frozen shoulder''.''Infectious (septic) bursitis, which is uncommon in the shoulder, requires even further evaluation and aggressive treatment. The bursal fluid can be examined in the laboratory to identify the microbes causing the infection. Septic bursitis requires antibiotic therapy, sometimes intravenously. Repeated aspiration of the inflamed fluid may be required. Surgical drainage and removal of the infected bursa sac (bursectomy) may also be necessary. Generally, the adjacent joint functions normally after the surgical ''wound'' heals.'  "
Are there home remedies for shoulder bursitis?,"'Bursitis is initially treated with ice compresses, rest, and anti-inflammatory and pain medications.' "
What is the prognosis for shoulder bursitis?,"'The outlook for shoulder bursitis is generally excellent for a full recovery with shoulder bursitis. If the bursitis is accompanied by scarring around the shoulder joint (''adhesive capsulitis'' or ""''frozen shoulder''""), it can require long-term physical therapy.' "
Is it possible to prevent shoulder bursitis?,"'By avoiding overuse of the shoulder by excessive straining the shoulder and gradual ''exercise'' training, shoulder bursitis can be prevented.'  "
What health care specialties treat shoulder bursitis?,"'Specialists that treat shoulder bursitis include general medicine physicians, including general practitioners, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as orthopedic surgeons, ''rheumatologists'', and sports medicine specialists. Often physical therapists and rehabilitation physicians are involved in the care of shoulder bursitis.' "
What are eosinophils?,"'Eosinophils are a particular type of white blood cells, usually representing a small percentage (less than 8% of the total white blood cell population) that are easily stained by eosin and other dyes; they have a characteristic double-lobed nucleus. The number of these cells (eosinophil count) increases in certain illnesses, including ''allergies'', ''asthma'"", Addison's disease, ""'sarcoidosis'', parasite infections, drug reactions, and connective tissue diseases (such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''scleroderma'""). Eosinophilic fasciitis is sometimes referred to as Shulman's syndrome."" "
What is fascia?,"'The fascia is a sheet or band of fibrous connective tissue under the skin that covers a surface of underlying tissues. Fascia surrounds each of the muscles that move the skeleton. When the fascia is inflamed, the condition is referred to as ""fasciitis.""' "
What is eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare disease that leads to inflammation and thickening of the skin and fascia underneath. In patients with eosinophilic fasciitis, the involved fascia is inflamed with the eosinophil type of white blood cells. This leads to symptoms of progressive thickening and often redness, warmth, and hardness of the skin surface.''Occasionally, the onset of eosinophilic fasciitis follows a period of exertional physical activity. Eosinophilic fasciitis is sometimes confused with eosinophilia-''myalgia'' syndrome and ''scleroderma''. Eosinophilic fasciitis sometimes occurs associated with ''cancers'' such as ''leukemia'' and ''lymphoma''.' "
What causes eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Although the cause seems related to an inflammatory response, the agent(s) that trigger the response are not yet identified. In the 1980s, there was a toxic product in some lots of ''L-tryptophan'', an ''over-the-counter'' ''sleep'' aide that was available at the time, which caused illness similar to eosinophilic fasciitis.' "
What are eosinophilic fasciitis symptoms and signs?,"'Eosinophilic fasciitis causes inflammation of the tissues beneath the skin as well as sometimes in the skin. This leads to symptoms of swelling, ''stiffness'', warmth, and ''pain'' of the involved area. Occasionally, there is discoloration of the skin over the tissues affected and the skin can appear thicker than normal. Joint contractures occur in 50%-75% of patients.''The muscle of the involved area can become weakened. Muscle enzyme blood levels can be found to be elevated in the blood, particularly the enzymes aldolase and creatine phosphokinase (CPK).'  "
How do health-care professionals diagnose eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'The diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis is made with a ''skin biopsy'' of a full thickness of involved deep skin tissue. The biopsy site is usually small, and the doctor numbs the area before the tissue is removed for study by a pathologist, dermatologist, or trained technician. In addition, the thickened fascia can be detected by ''MRI''.' "
What is the treatment for eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Treatment of eosinophilic fasciitis is directed at eliminating the tissue inflammation and includes ''aspirin'', other anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), and cortisone. Many patients will improve spontaneously. Others can be afflicted with persistent tissue and ''joint pain'', in addition to thickening of the involved tissues.''For aggressive eosinophilic fasciitis, cortisone medications (such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone'') are sometimes initially administered intravenously. Also considered are immune-suppression medications (such as ''methotrexate'' [''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''], ''cyclophosphamide'' [''Cytoxan''], and ''penicillamine'' [''Depen'', ''Cuprimine'']). More recently, ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''Cellcept'') and ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') are being studied as potential therapies.''Medical research has shown that immune-suppression drugs, such as methotrexate, can reduce both the immune inflammation and the need for continued cortisone medications.' "
What specialists treat eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Eosinophilic fasciitis is treated by pediatricians, internists, dermatologists, and ''rheumatologists''; occasionally, surgeons are consulted for deep biopsies and joint contractures.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'The outlook for eosinophilic fasciitis is generally good, particularly if treated aggressively and early. Along with medications, physical therapy can be required for optimal rehabilitation. Poor function, however, is not uncommon, especially in children. Those with ''arthritis'', atrophy of muscle, scarring limiting joint range of motion (contracture), and shortening of limb length tend to do worse.' "
Is it possible to prevent eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Because we do not yet know the cause of eosinophilic fasciitis, it cannot be prevented.' "
What is sick building syndrome?,"'Sick building syndrome (also termed environmental illness, building-related illness [BRI], or multiple chemical sensitivity [MCS]) is considered by some clinicians to be an illness in some people after they are exposed to as yet undefined chemical, biological, or physical agents that are thought to be found in building(s). The term was first used in 1986 and has been controversial ever since. BRI (building-related illness) is becoming the more accepted term used in medical literature.' "
Why is sick building syndrome controversial?,"'Sick building syndrome is controversial. Although many people and some clinicians believe there is a disease ""syndrome"" related to buildings and their internal environment, especially the indoor air quality, many other clinicians and medical organizations say there is no convincing clinical evidence that such a medical syndrome exists. The controversy exists because a number of people have a constellation of nonspecific symptoms that have no proven etiology (cause), yet believe they occur from sources inside building(s). Medical organizations such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and many experts say without any defined symptoms and no convincing evidence of a given source or cause, no test to diagnose the syndrome, and no treatment for the syndrome, there is no such medical syndrome.' "
What types of specialists treat sick building syndrome?,"""Usually, if there is a problem with a building in which patients are becoming ill, the problems can be first referred to individuals in Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or in some problems like Legionnaires' disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Primary-care physicians and pediatricians usually treat symptoms that are attributed to the air quality in buildings, but other specialists may become involved. For example, allergists, immunologists, specialized building inspectors, and others may be called in to help determine the cause of the problems and ways to solve them."" "
What causes sick building syndrome?,"""As stated above, there is controversy about sick building syndrome and the controversy is demonstrated by the medical literature about its cause(s). Those who believe it is a true disease syndrome have only speculated that the cause(s) are multiple and depend on the patient's medical condition (for example, ""'asthma'', ''COPD'') and how the compounds in the building (''cigarette'' smoke, chemical outgassing from structural components such as formaldehyde, paint odor, and ''radon'', or ''biologics'' such as bacteria and fungi, black ''mold'', or indoor houseplants) interact with the person. Proponents further speculate that patients with the syndrome may be more sensitive to low concentrations of some compounds and may have heightened immune response to such compounds. Further, proponents suggest ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' may play a role in this syndrome.'""Others who say there is no evidence for this syndrome agree that certain chemicals, biologics, and physical agents found in some buildings can cause disease, but once these are identified (for example, lead, Legionnaires' disease, ""'asbestos''), then the disease is identified and is not a new ""syndrome."" The proponents of the ""there is no such thing as sick building syndrome"" say evidence for a new syndrome is simply nonexistent. A few individuals consider ""sick building syndrome"" to be a psychological problem.' "
What are risk factors for sick building syndrome?,"'Individuals who believe sick building syndrome is real consider the following as some of the major risk factors, but individual people may have only a few of these risk factors:''However, proponents of the opposing view suggest these are general risk factors for many already-defined medical problems and offer little to clinicians who treat patients with the nonspecific symptoms (see symptoms section below) others attribute to this disease.' Spending time in a building (such as office workers) that causes some or many of the nonspecific symptoms listed below Heightened sensitivity to environmental antigens Have one or more diagnosed medical problems (for example, asthma) Heightened sensitivity of smell Females are more likely to develop symptoms Gulf War veteran Depression Anxiety"
"What are sick building syndrome 
symptoms and signs?","'Proponents of the sick building syndrome agree that people considered to have the syndrome may exhibit any number of nonspecific symptoms that may be increased when the person is associated with certain buildings. The symptoms are as follows:''There is no pattern or clear set of symptoms that fit criteria for a new syndrome in the opinion of many clinicians and investigators; these symptoms are often part of symptoms of many other diagnosable medical conditions.'   Headache Nausea Diarrhea Hoarseness or cough Bloating Gas Dizziness Fatigue Muscle discomfort (stiffness, pain, cramps, aches) Congestion Sneezing Nosebleeds Itching Skin rash Eye irritation Sore throat Swelling of legs, trunk, and/or ankles Shortness of breath Chest pains Cardiac arrhythmias Mental changes (problems with concentration, memory, moods)"
How is sick building syndrome diagnosed?,"'The vast majority of clinicians, whether they agree or disagree that sick building syndrome exists as a medical entity, agree on one major point; there are no tests that can reliably diagnose the alleged sick building syndrome. However, there are tests for specific causes of illnesses that are related to the local environment. For example, tests for formaldehyde, radon gas, asbestos, lead, and other components such as black mold are available.' "
What is the treatment for sick building syndrome?,"""There are no proven treatments for this proposed disease. However, some doctors report reduction of patient's nonspecific symptoms by prescribing ""'antidepressants'' (for example, ''fluoxetine'' [''Prozac''], ''paroxetine'' [''Paxil'']) or medications for ''anxiety'' or medications to help individuals ''sleep'' better. In addition, symptomatic treatment, while not treating the unknown cause(s), may provide individual symptom reduction or relief (for example, medication for ''nausea'' or ''headaches'').''There may be known conditions in buildings that are related to this proposed syndrome that can be remedied by following building codes and other practices suggested by the EPA and OSHA; some of the major mechanisms are cited in the Prevention section below.' "
What are complications of sick building syndrome?,"'The complications of this alleged syndrome include increasing symptoms, interference of job productivity, job loss, necessity of relocation, extensive and expensive building testing (materials and airflow testing), and many medical tests to try to achieve a definitive diagnosis.' "
What is the prognosis of sick building syndrome?,"'Because there is no known cause(s), no way to perform a definitive diagnosis, and doubt by many professionals that a sick building syndrome even exists, in general, the prognosis is unclear. However, some people who have had their symptoms treated may have a prognosis that ranges from fair to good.' "
Is there a way to prevent sick building syndrome?,"'It is difficult to prevent a syndrome if its cause(s), diagnostic tests, treatments, and its existence is not clear to a large segment of doctors. However, people may be able to prevent some of their nonspecific symptoms by working with their doctors to treat symptoms.''There is still another view of prevention taken by a U.S. government agency, the Environmental Protection Agency. Although the EPA considers sick building syndrome to be a term to serve as an indicator of an unknown illness, it uses the term ""building related illness,"" or BRI, as a term to describe known causes of problems such as toxic gasses and molds, mildew, bacteria, plants, and other known compounds found in buildings (and elsewhere) that can cause complaints, negative health effects, and result in lawsuits. They are related to indoor air quality or ''indoor air pollution''. The EPA cites World Health Organization (WHO) statistics that indicate as many as 30% of all buildings worldwide that are new or refurbished have air-quality problems. In contrast to sick building syndrome, these problems are identifiable and most can be remedied by such methods as using HEPA filters to reduce or eliminate most airborne particles, avoiding building air intakes located near sources of vehicle exhaust fumes or other irritants, and avoiding fungal and bacterial contamination of air conditioning or other air circulating methods. According to the EPA, some people who are termed as having sick building syndrome are actually in a situation where they have a building-related illness that has not been investigated or the source identified. However, that does not make their problem a new syndrome. Appropriate building materials and construction, along with good maintenance techniques can prevent most instance of BRI; some investigators suggest that, in turn, the ""sick building syndrome"" diagnoses will decrease.'

How do I know if I'm too sick to work?,"'Are you having troublesome symptoms like ''runny nose'', ''fever'', ''headache'', ''coughing'', or ''sore throat''? Maybe you have ''back pain'' or a ''sinus infection'"" and are wondering if you're too sick to go to work or school. How can you decide whether you or your child is better off trying to work (or go to school) or taking a sick day?""""First and foremost, consider whether you are putting yourself or others at risk if you go to work. You're putting others at risk if you or your children have a ""'contagious'"" illness (more on that later). You're putting yourself at risk if the symptoms of your condition, or the side effects of medication, could cause you to have an accident on the job, injure others, or produce devastating mistakes in your work product. Putting anyone in harm's way is a clear reason to stay home.""'Obviously going to work when you or your children can make others ill is not a good idea. Regarding ''contagious'' illnesses, many school systems have a ""''fever'' rule."" Any child who is out sick must be ''fever''-free for at least 24 hours before returning to school. This rule is designed to keep those with contagious illnesses away from others, and it is likely a good way to ensure that kids with the ''flu'', ''strep throat'"", or other serious infections don't spread the germs to others. Applying the ""'fever'"" rule will only work in certain situations, however. What about infections that may easily spread to others but don't necessarily cause a fever? Contagious conditions that don't cause fever include""""Instead of just considering fever, it's prudent to consider your symptoms and if you're unsure, err on the side of sparing your coworkers and call in sick or work from home. Remember that some people (who could be your coworkers), such as those undergoing ""'chemotherapy'' for ''cancer'', those who have chronic conditions, and ''pregnant'' women may be particularly vulnerable to complications if they catch your illness.'   the common cold, pinkeye, earache, and gastroenteritis."
What are non-contagious conditions that might mean you can't work?,"'Other kinds of conditions can also keep you home from work. ''Back pain'', recovery from surgery, debilitating ''migraines'', and broken bones may sometimes simply be associated with too much ''pain'' for you to work effectively, or the medications you take to control the ''pain'' could impair your work performance. The nature of your job also dictates what kind of medical conditions must keep you home. A desk worker may be able to work just fine while on crutches, but a lifeguard cannot.'""Putting yourself or your work product at risk is another consideration. Even if your condition isn't contagious, you should think about staying home if the ""'pain'' medications make you too drowsy to work effectively or if your limited mobility will pose a safety risk working with machinery. Or perhaps your lack of concentration could cause you to make a costly and/or damaging mistake for your company.'  "
How do I know when to keep my sick child home from school?,"""Overall, you and your child's symptoms are the biggest clue as to whether you or they should be staying home. The following symptoms are likely to be associated with a contagious illness and are probably a clue that you or they should stay home. These include""'If a person is in significant ''pain'"" and is unable to concentrate or focus, that's another signal that he or she would better off at home. Finally, if you are taking any medications that affect your physical or mental abilities to do your job, a sick day is the best option.""""If you're recovering from an illness and feel it is time to return to work, be sure to be extra vigilant with hygiene when you return to the job. Wash hands frequently, keep hand sanitizer available, and use sanitizing or disinfectant wipes to clean common work areas and shared items such as computer workstations. This is a good idea in any case during ""'flu'"" season, but your coworkers will appreciate it any time you've been out sick."" fever, muscle aches and pains, fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and confusion."
What is sickle cell anemia?,"'Sickle cell anemia (sickle cell disease) is a disorder of the blood caused by an inherited abnormal hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein within the red blood cells). The abnormal hemoglobin causes distorted (sickled appearing under a microscope) red blood cells. The sickled red blood cells are fragile and prone to rupture. When the number of red blood cells decreases from rupture (''hemolysis''), anemia is the result. This condition is referred to as sickle cell anemia. The irregular sickled cells can also block blood vessels causing tissue and organ damage and ''pain''.''Sickle cell anemia is one of the most common inherited blood anemias. The disease primarily affects Africans and African Americans. It is estimated that in the United States, some 90,000 to 100,000 Americans are afflicted with sickle cell anemia. Overall, current estimates are that one in 500 U.S. African American births is affected with sickle cell anemia.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of sickle cell anemia?,"'Virtually all of the major symptoms of sickle cell anemia are the direct result of the abnormally shaped, sickled red blood cells blocking the flow of blood that circulates through the tissues of the body. The tissues with impaired circulation suffer damage from lack of oxygen. Damage to tissues and organs of the body can cause severe disability in patients with sickle cell anemia. The patients endure episodes of intermittent ""crises"" of variable frequency and severity, depending on the degree of organ involvement.''The major features and symptoms of sickle cell anemia include:''Some features of sickle cell anemia that can occur at any age include:''Many features typically occur in certain age groups.''Infants with sickle cell anemia do not develop symptoms in the first few months of life because the hemoglobin produced by the developing fetus (fetal hemoglobin) protects the red blood cells from sickling. This fetal hemoglobin is absent in the red blood cells that are produced after birth so that by 5 months of age, the sickling of the red blood cells is prominent and symptoms begin.''Infants and younger children can suffer signs and symptoms of;''Adolescents (preteens and ''teens'') and young adults more commonly develop:''Symptoms in adult typically are intermittent pain episodes due to injury of bone, muscle, or internal organs.'

Leg ulcers Aseptic necrosis Eye damage"
How do you get sickle cell anemia? Is it inherited (genetic)?,"'Sickling of the red blood cells in patients with sickle cell anemia results in cells of abnormal shape and diminished flexibility. The sickling is promoted by conditions associated with low oxygen levels, increased acidity, or low volume (''dehydration'"") of the blood. These conditions can occur because of injury to the body's tissues, ""'dehydration'', or anesthesia.''Certain organs are predisposed to lower oxygen levels or acidity, such as when blood moves slowly through the spleen, liver, or kidney. In addition, organs with particularly high metabolism rates (such as the brain, muscles, and the placenta in a ''pregnant'' woman with sickle cell anemia) promote sickling by extracting more oxygen from the blood. These conditions make these organs susceptible to injury from sickle cell anemia.' "
What tests diagnose sickle cell anemia?,"'Sickle cell anemia is suggested when the abnormal sickle-shaped cells in the blood are identified under a microscope. Testing is typically performed on a smear of blood using a special low-oxygen preparation. This is referred to as a sickle prep. Other prep tests can also be used to detect the abnormal hemoglobin S, including solubility tests performed on tubes of blood solutions. The disease can be confirmed by specifically quantifying the types of hemoglobin present using a hemoglobin electrophoresis.''Prenatal diagnosis'' (before birth) of sickle cell anemia is possible using ''amniocentesis'' or ''chorionic villus sampling''. The sample obtained is then tested for DNA analysis of the fetal cells.''The hemoglobin electrophoresis test precisely identifies the hemoglobins in the blood by separating them. The separation of the different hemoglobins is possible because of the unique electrical charges they each have on their protein surfaces, causing them each to move characteristically in an electrical field as tested in the laboratory.'  "
What treatments manage symptoms of fatigue and anemia?,"'Fatigue'' is a common symptom in persons with sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia causes a chronic form of anemia, which can lead to fatigue. The sickled red blood cells are prone to breakage (hemolysis) which causes reduced red blood cell life span (the normal life span of a red blood cell is 120 days). These sickled red blood cells are easily detected with a microscope examination of a smear of blood on a glass slide.''Typically, the site of red blood cell production (bone marrow) works overtime to produce these cells rapidly, attempting to compensate for their destruction in the circulation. Occasionally, the bone marrow suddenly stops producing the red blood cells, which causes a very severe form of anemia (aplastic crises). Aplastic crises can be promoted by infections that otherwise would seem less significant, including ''viruses'' of the stomach and bowels and the ''flu'' (''influenza'').''Sickle cell anemia tends to stabilize without specific treatments. The degree of anemia is defined by measurement of the blood hemoglobin level. Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the ''lungs'"" to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Blood hemoglobin levels in persons with sickle cell anemia are generally between 6 to 8 gms/dl (normal levels are above 11 gms/dl). Occasionally, there can be a severe drop in hemoglobin requiring a ""'blood transfusion'' to correct the anemia (such as in patients suffering splenic sequestration). Blood transfusion is usually reserved for those patients with other complications, including ''pneumonia'', lung infarction, ''stroke'', severe leg ulceration, or late ''pregnancy''. (Among the risks of blood transfusion are ''hepatitis'', infection, immune reaction, and injury to body tissues from ''iron overload''.) Transfusions are also given to patients to prepare them for surgical procedures. ''Folic acid'' is given as a supplement. Sometimes a red blood cell exchange is performed. This process removes some of the sickle blood cells and replaces them with normal (non-sickle) blood cells. It is done when the sickle cell crisis is so severe that other forms of treatment are not helping.' "
"What treatments help manage symptoms of pain, arthritis, and dactylitis?","'Pain crises''Pain crises in persons with sickle cell anemia are intermittent painful episodes that are the result of inadequate blood supply to body tissues. The impaired circulation is caused by the blockage of various blood vessels from the sickling of red blood cells. The sickled red blood cells slow or completely impede the normal flow of blood through the tissues. This leads to excruciating pain, often requiring hospitalization and opiate medication for relief. The pain typically is throbbing and can change its location from one body area to another. Bones are frequently affected. Pain in the abdomen with tenderness is common and can mimic ''appendicitis''. ''Fever'' frequently is associated with the pain crises.''A pain crisis can be promoted by preceding dehydration, infection, injury, ''cold'' exposure, emotional ''stress'', or strenuous ''exercise''. As a ''prevention'' measure, persons with sickle cell anemia should avoid extremes of heat and cold.''Pain crises require analgesia for pain and increased fluid intake. Dehydration must be prevented to avoid further injury to the tissues and intravenous fluids can be necessary. Other modalities, such as biofeedback, self-hypnosis, and/or electrical nerve stimulation may be helpful.''Hydroxyurea'' is a medication that is currently being used in adults and children with severe pain from sickle cell anemia. It is also considered for those with recurrent ''strokes'' and frequent transfusions. This drug acts by increasing the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood (this form of hemoglobin is resistant to sickling of the red blood cells). The response to hydroxyurea is variable and unpredictable from patient to patient. Hydroxyurea can be suppressive to the bone marrow.''Dactylitis and arthritis''Swelling and inflammation of the hands and/or feet is often an early sign of sickle cell anemia. The swelling involves entire fingers and/or toes and is called dactylitis. Dactylitis is caused by injury to the bones of the affected digits by repeated episodes of inadequate blood circulation. Dactylitis generally occurs in children with sickle cell anemia from age 6 months to 8 years.''Joint inflammation'' (arthritis) with pain, swelling, tenderness, and limited range of motion can accompany the dactylitis. Sometimes, not only the joints of the hands or feet are affected, but also a knee or an elbow.''The inflammation from dactylitis and arthritis can be reduced by anti-inflammation medications, such as ''ibuprofen'' and ''aspirin''.' "
What is the prognosis for sickle cell anemia? Can it be cured?,"'The life expectancy of persons with sickle cell anemia is reduced. Some patients, however, can remain without symptoms for years, while others do not survive infancy or early childhood. Nevertheless, with optimal management patients can now survive beyond the fourth decade.''Most patients suffer intermittent pain crises, fatigue, bacterial infections, and progressive tissue and organ damage. Impaired growth and development is the result of the physical and emotional ''trauma'' that is endured by children with sickle cell anemia.''Causes of death'' include bacterial infection (the most common cause), ''stroke'' or bleeding into the brain, and kidney, heart, or liver failure. The risk of bacterial infections does diminish after three years of age. Nevertheless, bacterial infections are the most common cause of death at any age. Therefore, any signs of infection in a person with sickle cell anemia must be reviewed with a doctor to prevent damage and save lives.''Interestingly, the sickle cell gene somewhat protects against ''malaria'' infection. This makes those with sickle cell trait (gene carriers) at least partially resistant to ''malaria''. Furthermore, the geographic distribution of the sickle cell gene is similar to that of malaria infection. Sickle cell anemia is a lethal condition that threatens life. However, there may be a selective advantage to being a sickle cell carrier (trait) if the person resides in an area of the world where malaria is very common. The advantage a person with sickle cell trait has over a non-carrier of the gene may explain why sickle cell anemia did not disappear from the world even though it is lethal.''The sickle cell gene is not a ""black gene."" It just happens to disproportionately occur in the black population. When a black person who carries a sickle cell gene has children with a non-black person, the children may inherit the sickle cell gene regardless of race. There are also people of all races who carry the sickle cell gene.''Recent research is examining further ways to promote the development of the fetal hemoglobin that delays the development of sickle cell in the ''newborn''. Bone marrow transplantation is being used for patients with severe sickle cell anemia who have a sibling donor. Future treatments may involve genetic engineering where cures might be achieved.''Finally, ''genetic counseling'' can be helpful for parents and families to prevent sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia is an inherited illness. Both parents must be carriers of the sickle cell gene for a child to be affected with sickle cell anemia. If each parent is a carrier, any child has a one chance in two (50%) of also being a carrier and a one in four (25%) chance of inheriting both genes from the parents and being affected with sickle cell anemia.'

What is laparoscopic adrenalectomy?,"'Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a surgical technique used to remove the adrenal gland without making a big incision. Removing an adrenal gland using a laparoscope is a technically demanding procedure that calls for specialized skills and training.\xa0' Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is done under general anesthesia, and the patient’s vitals are monitored throughout the procedure.  In laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, the patient would be lying on his/her right side.   A small incision is made on the front of the abdomen or in the lower back. Additional small incisions are made through which instruments are inserted to perform the procedure and to hold or manipulate tissue in the abdomen.  A cannula (a narrow tube-like instrument) is placed into the abdominal cavity in the upper abdomen or flank just below the ribs. A laparoscope (a tiny telescope) connected to a special camera is inserted through the cannula. This gives the surgeon a magnified view of the patient’s internal organs on a television screen. Other cannulas are inserted which allow the surgeon to separate the adrenal gland from its attachments.  Once the adrenal gland has been dissected free, it is placed in a small bag and is then removed through one of the incisions. It is almost always necessary to remove the entire adrenal gland to safely remove the tumor. The incisions are stitched, closed and then covered with white surgical tape and a dry gauze dressing.  The operation generally lasts from two to four hours"
What are the advantages of laparoscopic adrenalectomy?,'Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is done on carefully selected patients who are well-suited for the procedure. Below are few common advantages of the procedure:' Less postoperative pain and fewer medications. Shorter hospital stay Quicker return to normal activity Improved cosmetic result Reduced risk of herniation or wound separation. Less incidence of complications

They may also need to take 20-30 mg of hydrocortisone by mouth each day to approximate normal cortisol production.\xa0' Low blood pressure Fatigue  Elevation of serum potassium levels Hormone imbalance Infections Increased stress levels Excessive cortisol levels
What is the outcome of laparoscopic adrenalectomy?,"'People who undergo laparoscopic surgery mostly have a faster recovery than with open surgery.\xa0Patients might be placed on blood pressure medications and other medications to treat the underlying cause of adrenal gland removal.\xa0''The overall outcome of the procedure is good. Depending on the type of adrenalectomy procedure, you can expect to recover in two to six weeks. Most people have minimal complications and see improvements in symptoms immediately after surgery. Patients may be monitored for future occurrences, especially if the tumor was cancerous.' "
What is a pacemaker?,"'A pacemaker is a small device that sends electrical impulses to the heart muscles to maintain a suitable heart rate and rhythm. Pacemakers are used to treat an abnormal heart rate (arrhythmias). A pacemaker may also be used to treat''During an ''arrhythmia'', the heart may not be able to pump blood to the body efficiently, leading to ''fatigue'', ''shortness of breath'', or ''fainting''.''Depending on the condition, the doctor might implant one of the following pacemakers:' Syncope (fainting spells). Congestive heart failure. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (acquired hereditary disease of the heart muscles). Single-chamber pacemaker: It usually carries electrical impulses to the right ventricle of the heart. Dual-chamber pacemaker: It carries electrical impulses to the right ventricle and right atrium of the heart to control the timing of the contractions. Biventricular pacemaker: It is for people with heart failure with abnormal electrical systems. This type of pacemaker stimulates the lower left and right chamber of the heart."
How does a pacemaker work?,"'Pacemakers utilize low-energy electrical pulses to treat abnormal electrical signaling. Pacemakers can''The electrical system of the heart controls the heart rate and rhythm. With each heartbeat, an electrical signal is generated, which spreads from the sinoatrial (SA) to ''AV node'' to the ventricles, causing the heart to contract and pump blood. An electrical signal originates in the SA node present in the ''atrium'', which then spreads in a preplanned fashion thus coordinating the timing of the heart cell activity. As the electrical signal passes from the ''atrium'', the upper chamber of the heart or atria contracts, thus pumping the blood into the lower chamber or ventricles; the ventricles then contract and push the blood to the rest of the body. The combined contraction of atria and ventricles is a heartbeat.' Speed up a slow heart rhythm. Prevent dangerous arrhythmias caused due to long QT syndrome. Control an abnormal or fast heart rhythm. Coordinate electrical signaling between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. Coordinate electrical signaling between the ventricles. Cure atrial fibrillation (ventricles contract normally if the atria shiver instead of beating normally). Monitor and record the heart’s electrical activity and heart rhythm."
What is nutritional yeast?,"'Nutritional yeast'' is deactivated yeast, meaning the yeast cells are killed while being processed and the inactive yeast is the final product. It is generally available in powdered form or as flakes. It has a nutty and cheesy flavor making it a popular vegan cheese (non-dairy cheese) substitute. It is a valuable part of many diets. Nutritional yeast is a great source of\xa0''vitamins'', ''minerals'' ''and complete ''proteins\xa0''like those found in animal products. For this reason, it is ideal for vegans, vegetarians and anyone who wants to cut back on meat consumption. Complete proteins help in tissue repair, nutrient absorption\xa0 and ''prevention'' of muscle loss. It is low in calories and high in ''fiber'', making it ideal to maintain healthy ''digestion'' and a healthy body weight.''The benefits of nutritional yeast outweigh the side effects. Nutritional yeast is safe for most people and negative ''side effects are extremely rare.'' It can cause issues for those who are sensitive to\xa0yeast\xa0products or those who are on certain medications. Therefore, while taking any kind of medication, it is advised to consult with a doctor to ensure there are no negative reactions between the medications and nutritional yeast. In general, the negative side effects of consuming nutritional yeast are not common and rarely occur if consumed in large amounts. If side effects do occur, they are usually not serious and can be resolved.' "
Possible side effects of nutritional yeast ," Digestive problems: Nutritional yeast contains a high amount of fiber. Too much nutritional yeast added too quickly to one’s diet can cause problems with digestion, such as abdominal cramps and diarrhea. A high-fiber diet is good for digestive health. However, the fiber should be added gradually and the amount of yeast should be increased slowly, enabling the body to comfortably adapt to higher fiber consumption. Two tablespoons of nutritional yeast contains approximately  5 grams of dietary fiber, which is about 20 percent of the recommended daily intake. Yeast intolerance and inflammatory bowel disease: Though rare, some people may not be able to digest nutritional yeast. This is usually seen in those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease. Nutritional yeast  can trigger or worsen symptoms associated with IBD. Trigger headaches or migraine attacks: Nutritional yeast may trigger migraine attacks in some individuals with migraine susceptibility because of the presence of tyramine (derived from the amino acid, tyrosine). Facial flushing: Nutritional yeast is an excellent source of niacin (Vitamin B3), which is essential for body functioning. Consuming large amounts of niacin (usually over 500 mg) may cause facial flushing. Consuming such high doses of niacin can usually happen when it is taken as a supplement."
How can nutritional yeast be used?,"'Nutritional yeast should be stored in a cool, dark place to preserve its nutritional value and in an airtight container. If safely stored and kept away from moisture, it can last up to 2 years.''Nutritional yeast may be used in the following ways' Sprinkled over popcorn, salads or pasta similar to cheese Stirred into soups An alternative to cheese flavoring in vegan or vegetarian sauces, such as pasta sauce, salad dressing or dips As a thickener for soups, gravies and sauces It can also be used in pet food to provide extra nutrients because it’s safe for animals to  consume"
Does Orkambi (lumacaftor and ivacaftor) cause side effects?,"'Orkambi (lumacaftor and ivacaftor) is a combination of ''cystic fibrosis'' transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiators used to treat cystic fibrosis.''Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an ''inherited disease'' that affects the secretory glands, including the ''mucus'' and sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis mostly affects the ''lungs'', pancreas, ''liver'', ''intestines'', sinuses, and sex organs. Cystic fibrosis is due to a mutation in the cystic fibrosis gene on chromosome 7.''The cystic fibrosis gene encodes a protein known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The abnormal CFTR protein in patients with cystic fibrosis leads to disruption of chloride channels on the cells which are important for the secretion of water. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by the production of abnormal mucus that is excessively thick and sticky because it lacks water.''The abnormal mucus leads to blockages within the airways of the lungs. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections that can permanently and progressively damage the lungs.''Lumacaftor corrects abnormalities in the CFTR protein and increases the amount of functional CFTR protein in one type of mutation. Ivacaftor increases the action of CFTR protein. The combination of both ''drugs'' increases the quantity, stability, and function of CFTR, reducing the production of abnormal mucous and increasing lung function.\xa0''Common side effects of Orkambi include''Serious side effects of Orkambi include''Drug interactions'' of Orkambi include''ranitidine'', because Orkambi may decrease blood levels and reduce the effect of these drugs that are broken down by the liver.

What is adrenal gland?,"""The adrenal glands are triangular glands located above the kidneys. They provide essential hormones that control the body's fluid and salt regulation. They also produce hormones that control our fear, anger, ""'blood pressure'', muscle development, sexual drive and ''sugar'' metabolism. They secrete the hormone which helps the body deal with the ''stress''. Like the kidneys, at least one adrenal gland is usually required to live a normal life.' "
When is laparoscopic adrenalectomy indicated?,"'The indications for laparoscopic adrenalectomy are as follows:''For the ''malignant'' tumors of the adrenal glands, open adrenalectomy may be preferred. The choice of surgery depends on your healthcare provider.' Hormonally active tumors, including aldosteronomas, pheochromocytomas and cortisol-producing adrenal tumors aldosteronomas,  pheochromocytomas and  cortisol-producing adrenal tumors Nonfunctioning tumors less than 4-6 cm in diameter  Tumors larger than 6 cm should be removed because of an increased incidence of cancer with increasing size."
What is laparoscopic adrenalectomy?,"'Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a surgical technique used to remove the adrenal gland without making a big incision. Removing an adrenal gland using a laparoscope is a technically demanding procedure that calls for specialized skills and training.\xa0' Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is done under general anesthesia, and the patient’s vitals are monitored throughout the procedure. In laparoscopic right adrenalectomy, the patient would be lying on his/her right side.   A small incision is made on the front of the abdomen or in the lower back. Additional small incisions are made through which instruments are inserted to perform the operative procedure and to hold or manipulate tissue in the abdomen.  A cannula (a narrow tube-like instrument) is placed into the abdominal cavity in the upper abdomen or flank just below the ribs. A laparoscope (a tiny telescope) connected to a special camera is inserted through the cannula. This gives the surgeon a magnified view of the patient’s internal organs on a television screen. Other cannulas are inserted which allow your surgeon to delicately separate the adrenal gland from its attachments.  Once the adrenal gland has been dissected free, it is placed in a small bag and is then removed through one of the incisions. It is almost always necessary to remove the entire adrenal gland to safely remove the tumor. The incisions are stitched closed and then covered with white surgical tape and a dry gauze dressing. The operation generally lasts from two to four hours."
What are the advantages of laparoscopic adrenalectomy?,'Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is done on carefully selected patients who are well-suited for the procedure. Below are few common advantages of the procedure:' Less postoperative pain and fewer medications. Shorter hospital stay Quicker return to normal activity Improved cosmetic result Reduced risk of herniation or wound separation. Less incidence of complications
What are the side effects of having your right adrenal gland removed?,'There are not many side effects documented after adrenal gland removal. Rarely few symptoms are noticed which include:''The patient may need to take a synthetic form of aldosterone called ''Florinef'' (''fludrocortisone'') for a few weeks until natural production of aldosterone is recovered through other glands like pituitary glands. They may also need to take 20-30 mg of hydrocortisone in the form of pills by mouth each day to approximate normal cortisol production.\xa0' Low blood pressure Fatigue  Elevation of serum potassium levels Hormone imbalance Infections Increased stress levels Excessive cortisol levels
What is the outcome of laparoscopic adrenalectomy?,"'People who undergo laparoscopic surgery mostly have a faster recovery than with open surgery.\xa0Patients might be placed on blood pressure medications and other medications to treat the underlying cause of adrenal gland removal. The overall outcome of the procedure is good. Depending on the type of adrenalectomy procedure, patients can expect to recover in two to six weeks. Most patients have minimal complications and see improvements in symptoms immediately after surgery. Patients may be monitored for future occurrences, especially if the tumor was cancerous.' "
What is stereotactic radiosurgery?,"'Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a ''radiation'' treatment that uses focused delivery of radiation in high doses to precise locations in the body. It is used to treat certain tumors and other abnormalities of the brain, spine, neck, ''lungs'', ''liver'', etc.''Swedish neurosurgeons first developed SRS in the 1950s to treat small tumors located deep in the brain with minimal damage to the nearby healthy tissue. Now, doctors use it to treat any part of the body where tumors are hard to reach or close to vital organs. SRS may also be called “stereotactic body radiotherapy” when performed on areas other than the brain and spine.' "
How does stereotactic radiosurgery work?,"'SRS is noninvasive and not a surgical operation in the traditional sense. It delivers high doses of radiation precisely targeted at the ''tumor''. It damages the DNA of the tumor cells and stops them from reproducing, which makes the tumors gradually shrink.''While SRS on the brain or spine is usually performed in a single session, treatment of other areas in the body may take three to five sessions.' "
What are the types of stereotactic radiosurgery?,'There are three different techniques of SRS. The radiation is delivered using one of the following:' a gamma knife unit a linear accelerator proton beams
Why is stereotactic radiosurgery performed?,"'SRS is a preferred method of treatment for tumors in hard-to-reach places and for certain rare conditions, because it is a minimally invasive and precisely focused treatment.

What is sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)?,"""Approximately 3,500 infants die suddenly and unexpectedly each year in the United States. Sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) include sudden infant death syndrome (also known as SIDS), accidental suffocation in a sleeping environment, and other deaths from unknown causes. Sudden infant death syndrome (also known as SIDS) is the sudden, unexpected death of an infant younger than 1 year of age. If the child's death remains unexplained after a formal investigation into the circumstances of the death (including performance of a complete ""'autopsy'', examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history), the death is then attributed to SUID or SIDS. Sudden infant death is a tragic event for any parent or ''caregiver''.' Medical professionals suspect SIDS when a previously healthy infant, usually younger than 6 months of age, is found dead following a period of sleep. In most cases, no sign of distress is identifiable. The baby typically feeds normally prior to going to sleep. A caregiver then discovers the infant lifeless, without pulse or respiration. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be initiated at the scene, but evidence shows a lack of beneficial effect from CPR. The cause of death remains unknown despite a careful review of the medical history, scene investigation to exclude sleep-associated factors, and an autopsy.SIDS is rare during the first month of life. Risk peaks in infants 2-4 months of age and then declines.About 90% of SIDS deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age. SIDS is rare during the first month of life. Risk peaks in infants 2-4 months of age and then declines. About 90% of SIDS deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age."
What is the cause of SIDS?,"'The cause (or causes) of SIDS is still unknown. Despite the dramatic decrease in the occurrence of SIDS in the United States and worldwide in recent years, SIDS remains one of the leading ''causes of death'' during infancy beyond the first 30 days following birth. SIDS may be the result of multiple interacting factors.''Even though the specific cause (or causes) of SIDS remains unknown, scientific efforts have eliminated several previously held theories. We now know the following about SIDS:' Infant development: A leading hypothesis is that SIDS may reflect a delay or abnormality in the development of nerve cells within the brain that are critical to normal heart and lung function. Research examinations of the brainstems of infants who died with a diagnosis of SIDS have revealed a developmental delay in the formation and function of several serotonin-binding nerve cell pathways within the brain. These pathways are crucial to regulating breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure responses during awakening from sleep.The hypothesis is that certain infants, for reasons yet to be determined, may experience abnormal or delayed development of specific critical areas of their brain. This could negatively affect the function and connectivity to regions regulating arousal during sleep.Arousal, in this context, refers to an infant's ability to awaken and/or respond to a variety of physiological stimuli. For example, a child sleeping facedown (prone) may move his or her face into such a position so that the nose and mouth are completely obstructed. This may alter the levels of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the infant's blood. Normally, these changes would trigger arousal responses, prompting the infant to move his or her head to the side to relieve this obstruction.Other protective responses to stressful stimuli may be defective in infants who are vulnerable to SIDS. One such reflex is the laryngeal chemoreflex, which arises from nerve cell pathways located in the back of the throat (pharynx) and within the voice box (larynx) and upper airway. This reflex regulates changes in breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure when fluids like saliva or regurgitated stomach contents stimulate portions of the airway. Having saliva in the airway may activate this reflex, triggering swallowing responses that help to keep the airway clear. When an infant is in the facedown position, the rate of swallowing decreases. Protective arousal responses to these laryngeal reflexes also diminishes in active sleep when infants are in the facedown sleep position.

Protective arousal responses to these laryngeal reflexes also diminishes in active sleep when infants are in the facedown sleep position. Rebreathing stresses: When a baby is facedown, air movement around the mouth may be impaired. This can cause the baby to re-breathe carbon dioxide that the baby has just exhaled. Soft bedding and gas-trapping objects, such as blankets, comforters, waterbeds, sofas, chairs, and soft mattresses, as well as stuffed or plush toys are other types of sleep surfaces that may impair normal air movement around the baby's mouth and nose when positioned facedown. Hyperthermia (increased temperature): Overdressing, using excessive coverings, or increasing the air temperature may lead to an increased metabolic rate in these infants and eventual loss of breathing control. However, it is unclear whether the increased temperature is an independent factor or if it is just a reflection of the use of more clothing or blankets that may act as objects obstructing the airway. Apnea is a term that describes the clinical situation in which a person's breathing stops spontaneously. Apnea associated with prematurity and apnea that occurs during infancy are felt to be clinical conditions that are distinct from SIDS. Electronic monitors prescribed by doctors that track heart rate and respiratory activity may manage infants with apnea in some cases. Apnea monitors will not prevent SIDS. SIDS is neither predictable nor preventable. Infants may experience episodes termed brief, resolved unresponsive episodes (BRUE: previously called apparent life-threatening events or ALTE). These are clinical events in which young infants may experience abrupt changes in breathing, color, or muscle tone. Common causes of BRUE include viral respiratory infection (RSV), gastroesophageal reflux disease, or seizure. However, no definite scientific evidence links BRUEs as events that will lead to SIDS. Immunizations and bad parenting do not cause SIDS. SIDS is not contagious or hereditary. SIDS is not anyone's fault."
What are the risk factors for SIDS?,"'Research studies continue to demonstrate a greater risk for SIDS among male infants. SIDS occurs more frequently during winter months than summer months, although this distribution is not as pronounced in recent years as it had been in the past. In the United States, both African-American and Native-American infants have a higher rate of SIDS than do Caucasian, Hispanic, and Asian infants.''Certain infant care practices have an effect on the risk for SIDS. Most notable is the increased risk associated with the placement of infants on their stomachs (prone sleep position) for sleep. The ""Back to Sleep"" (now ""Safe to Sleep"") campaign was launched in the United States in 1994 and embodies a public health effort encouraging families to place infants on their backs (supine sleep position) to sleep. Since the start of this campaign, SIDS rates have dropped 50% in the United States. Medical professionals have observed similar drops worldwide, highlighting the importance of the supine sleep position for infants.''Other factors increasing the risk for SIDS include exposure to ''cigarette'"" smoke, bed-sharing or co-sleeping, over-bundling or the covering of the infant's head by bed covers, loose bedding, or blankets. Recent research studies suggest that ""'breastfeeding'', pacifier use, and room-sharing but not bed-sharing for the first year of life may reduce the risk of SIDS. Additional information regarding infant care practices and SIDS risk is available at https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Preventing-SIDS.aspx' "
How do medical professionals diagnose SIDS?,"'Sudden infant death remains an unpredictable, unpreventable, and largely inexplicable tragedy. The baby is seemingly healthy without any sign of distress or significant illness prior to the incident.'""Sudden, unexpected infant death (SUID) is a general term used for the circumstance of an infant death that occurs suddenly and in an unexpected manner. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that medical professionals must rule out other causes of death, including sleep environment factors. The cause of an infant's death can be determined only through a process of collecting information and conducting, at times, complex forensic tests and procedures. All other recognizable causes of death are investigated prior to making the diagnosis of SIDS.""'Four major avenues of investigation aid in the determination of a SIDS death: postmortem lab tests, autopsy, death-scene investigation, and the review of victim and family case history.'   Death occurs rapidly while the infant is sleeping. Typically, it is a silent event. The baby does not cry. The infant usually appears to be well developed, well nourished, and is generally felt to be in good health prior to death. Minor upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms due to viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are not uncommon in the last two weeks preceding SIDS. Postmortem laboratory tests are done to rule out other causes of death (for example, electrolytes are checked to rule out dehydration and electrolyte imbalance; bacterial and viral cultures are obtained to evaluate whether an infection was present). In SIDS, these laboratory tests are generally not revealing. An autopsy provides clues as to the cause of death. In 15% of sudden, unexpected infant deaths specific abnormalities of the brain or central nervous system, the heart or lungs, or infection may be identified as the cause of death. The autopsy findings in SIDS victims are typically subtle and yield only supportive, rather than conclusive, findings to explain SIDS. A thorough investigation of the death scene consists of interviewing the parents, other caregivers, and family members, collecting items from the death scene, and evaluating that information. A detailed scene investigation may reveal a recognizable and possibly preventable cause of death. Death scene investigations have helped to identify factors in the infant sleep environment that are potentially unsafe. These include soft, padded, or plushy objects that may obstruct an infant's airway, posing a suffocation hazard.A parent or caregiver may be asked these questions:Where did you discover the baby?What position was the baby in?Were there any objects within the sleep location that could have interfered with normal infant breathing?When did you last check the baby? Last fed?How was the baby sleeping?Where there any recent signs of illness?Was the infant taking any medication, either prescription or over the counter? A parent or caregiver may be asked these questions:Where did you discover the baby?What position was the baby in?Were there any objects within the sleep location that could have interfered with normal infant breathing?When did you last check the baby?

You should let your doctor know about any family or infant medical history. Family history to note would include any previous history of unexplained infant death, sudden cardiac death, and metabolic or genetic disorders, for example."
Is it possible to prevent SIDS?,"'There is currently no way to predict which infants are at risk for SIDS. SIDS has links to certain infant-specific and sleep-environment factors. Therefore, observing the following precautions has reduced the risk of SIDS for many infants.'  Sleep position and the local sleep environment: Educate babysitters, day care providers, grandparents, and everyone who cares for your baby about SIDS risk and the importance of observing the latest advice related to safe infant sleep offered in the original ""Back to Sleep"" campaign and updated in the recent ""Safe to Sleep"" initiative. Safe to Sleep (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/SIDS/Pages/sids.aspx) messages highlight the importance of the back sleep position with emphasis on safety surrounding the infant sleep environment and safe sleep conditions:Back to sleep: You should place your baby on his or her back to sleep at night and nap time.You should avoid fluffy, loose bedding in your baby's sleep area.Keep your baby's face clear of coverings.Be careful not to overheat your baby by overdressing or adding unnecessary covers.Don't allow anyone to smoke around your baby.Use a firm mattress in a safety-approved crib with a tight fitting sheet.

Does the supine (back) sleep position cause any problems for infants?,"""Recent studies have evaluated the effect of back sleeping on an infant's motor development. Babies younger than 1 year of age who slept on their backs showed slightly decreased upper trunk strength as reflected in mild delays in their ability to crawl, sit upright unassisted, or pull to stand."" However, it is important to emphasize that face-up sleepers still attained these milestones within the accepted time range for normal development. No significant difference in gross motor development was seen by the time either infant group started to walk. Parents should incorporate a certain amount of tummy time while the infant is awake and observed. This type of play while baby is on his or her tummy is recommended for developmental reasons and may also help to prevent flattening of parts of the skull, called plagiocephaly, from developing or persisting on the back of the head."
What support is available to parents who are coping with an infant loss due to SIDS?,"""Most areas within the United States have access to support services for families following a SIDS death. Each family's ""'grief'' is unique. However, many families that have experienced SIDS have found it helpful to use the counseling resources that may be provided through public health ''nursing'' agencies, local coroner, or medical examiner offices, or information and ''bereavement'"" programs based at many children's hospitals across the country.""'Losing a child is a unique crisis for any family, especially when the child has died suddenly, unexpectedly, and for no apparent reason.''Grieving is a normal process when dealing with the ''loss of a loved one''. Family, friends, neighbors, workplace, or faith communities may all serve as sources of support. It is important to remember that you are not alone.

Safe to Sleep (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/SIDS/Pages/sids.aspx) messages highlight the importance of the back sleep position with emphasis on safety surrounding the infant sleep environment and safe sleep conditions:Back to sleep: You should place your baby on his or her back to sleep at night and nap time.You should avoid fluffy, loose bedding in your baby's sleep area.Keep your baby's face clear of coverings.Be careful not to overheat your baby by overdressing or adding unnecessary covers.Don't allow anyone to smoke around your baby.Use a firm mattress in a safety-approved crib with a tight fitting sheet. Avoid the use of infant positioning devices.Have your baby sleep in your room (room-share) for the first six to 12 months of life.Do not allow your baby to sleep alongside (bed-share with) another person. The risk of unintentional smothering is too great.Keep all ""well-child"" appointments, including immunizations.

Home monitoring: Medical professionals do not recommend the use of home cardiorespiratory monitors for infants perceived to be at risk of SIDS. Doctor-prescribed monitors are available that sound an alarm if the baby's breathing or heartbeat stops.Current studies still echo the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Report on SIDS. To date, no reports scientifically demonstrate the effectiveness of home monitoring for siblings of SIDS victims (babies born after a family has had a child die of SIDS).Currently, certain guidelines exist for use of home cardiorespiratory monitoring:Infants with one or more life-threatening episodes in which the baby turned blue or became limp requiring mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or vigorous stimulation and during hospitalization are identified as having abnormal control of heart or lung function.Symptomatic preterm infants with apnea of prematurity and other complications related to premature birth.Infants with certain diseases or conditions that include central (brain related) breathing irregularitiesIf families have questions related to the use of home monitors, they should seek assistance from their child's primary medical care provider.

Does the supine (back) sleep position cause any problems for infants?,"""Recent studies have evaluated the effect of back sleeping on an infant's motor development. Babies younger than 1 year of age who slept on their backs showed slightly decreased upper trunk strength as reflected in mild delays in their ability to crawl, sit upright unassisted, or pull to stand."" However, it is important to emphasize that face-up sleepers still attained these milestones within the accepted time range for normal development. No significant difference in gross motor development was seen by the time either infant group started to walk. Parents should incorporate a certain amount of tummy time while the infant is awake and observed. This type of play while baby is on his or her tummy is recommended for developmental reasons and may also help to prevent flattening of parts of the skull, called plagiocephaly, from developing or persisting on the back of the head."
What support is available to parents who are coping with an infant loss due to SIDS?,"""Most areas within the United States have access to support services for families following a SIDS death. Each family's ""'grief'' is unique. However, many families that have experienced SIDS have found it helpful to use the counseling resources that may be provided through public health ''nursing'' agencies, local coroner, or medical examiner offices, or information and ''bereavement'"" programs based at many children's hospitals across the country.""'Losing a child is a unique crisis for any family, especially when the child has died suddenly, unexpectedly, and for no apparent reason.''Grieving is a normal process when dealing with the ''loss of a loved one''. Family, friends, neighbors, workplace, or faith communities may all serve as sources of support. It is important to remember that you are not alone. There are formal support groups and counseling programs available to help you cope with your loss.

What is flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to examine the rectum and the lower (sigmoid) colon. The flexible sigmoidoscope is a flexible tube 60 cm long and about the thickness of your little finger.  It is inserted gently into the anus and advanced slowly into the rectum and the lower colon. It is an accurate and simple method of investigating the cause of ''rectal bleeding'', change in bowel habit, and rectal symptoms such as ''pain'' and ''diarrhea''.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy also is a part of colon screening and surveillance for ''colon cancer''. ' "
What is the preparation for flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'In order to obtain accurate results, the rectum and the lower colon must be completely clean of ''stool''. Your doctor will give you detailed instructions on how to cleanse your colon. In general, this requires the use of one or two enemas prior to the procedure and may also call for a ''laxative'' and some dietary modifications. Under special circumstances, such as the presence of significant ''diarrhea'', the preparation may be waived.' "
Do I continue my medications for flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'In general, you can continue to take your regular medicines. You should, however, inform your doctor of all the prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking as well as any ''allergies'' you may have. Certain ''drugs'' increase the risk of bleeding if biopsies are performed; these include ''aspirin'', blood thinners such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), and ''NSAIDs'' such as ''Motrin'' and ''Advil''. Your doctor may ask you to stop these medications for several days before the procedure. You should also alert your doctor if you have an ''artificial heart'' valve, hip or knee prosthesis, or have a disease of the ''heart'' valves such as mitral stenosis, ''aortic stenosis'', or ''mitral regurgitation''. Patients with these conditions may need antibiotics prior to ''colonoscopy'', or dental procedures to prevent infection of the heart valves or the prosthesis.' "
What can I expect during flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy is generally well tolerated and rarely causes any significant ''pain''. There may be a sensation of fullness, ''bloating'', pressure, or cramping during the procedure. In most instances, you will be lying on your left side while the instrument is advanced through the rectum and the colon under direct vision on a TV monitor. As the instrument is withdrawn, a careful examination is made of the lining of the colon. The procedure usually takes only 5 to 15 minutes.'  "
What if something abnormal is found during flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'If the doctor finds an area in the colon that needs further evaluation, a biopsy (small sample of tissue) can be obtained and sent to the pathology department for examination under a microscope. If a polyp is found, the doctor may remove the polyp at the same time. Polyps are small growths on the inner lining of the colon and the rectum. Most polyps are benign (not cancerous), but some polyps are ''precancerous''. Patients with precancerous polyps are usually asked to return for a colonoscopy after a more vigorous colon cleansing. Colonoscopy is a longer version of flexible sigmoidoscopy where the doctor examines the entire length of the colon. For more, please read the Colonoscopy article. The advantage of colonoscopy over flexible sigmoidoscopy is the ability to find and remove polyps in the parts of colon that are beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscope. Removal of all of the precancerous polyps during colonoscopy has been shown to prevent colon ''cancer''.' "
What happens after the flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'After the procedure, the examiner will explain the findings to you. You may have some residual cramping or bloating because of the air that was instilled into your colon during the procedure. This should quickly disappear with the passage of ''gas'' or flatus. It can be expedited by ''walking'"" about in the room. Under most circumstances, you should be able to resume your regular activities upon leaving the doctor's office or the hospital."" "
What are the complications of flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy are generally safe when the procedure is performed by properly trained individuals. Possible but rare complications include a perforation (making a hole in the wall of the colon) and bleeding from the biopsy site. The former may call for surgery.''Although complications following flexible sigmoidoscopy are rare, it is important to recognize the early signs of any possible complication. Contact your physician or the examiner if you notice any of the following: '  severe abdominal pain,  fever and/or chills, and  rectal bleeding of more than a few teaspoons."
Conclusions,"'If you still have any questions about the procedure, reasons for doing it, alternative tests, costs, and insurance coverage, do not hesitate to speak to your doctor or the staff. Most endoscopists are highly trained specialists and welcome your questions regarding the procedure, and their medical credentials and training.' "
Sigmoidoscopy vs. colonoscopy: What’s the difference?,"'Both ''sigmoidoscopy'' and ''colonoscopy'' are nonsurgical procedures that involve use of a tube (endoscope) with a light and camera to examine parts of the ''large intestine'' (colon). \xa0''A sigmoidoscopy is a procedure in which a flexible tube connected to a fiberoptic camera is used to examine the inner lining of the rectum and the lower part of the colon. The difference between a sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy is that a colonoscopy examines the upper part of the colon as well. Colonoscopies are usually preferred over sigmoidoscopies since they allow a doctor to check both the upper and lower parts of the large intestine in one procedure.''In a ''flexible sigmoidoscopy'', the endoscope is a flexible tube, while in a rigid sigmoidoscopy the tube is firm. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is more commonly used as a diagnostic tool because it’s more comfortable for the patient and it is easier to perform procedures such as biopsy and polypectomy (removal of a polyp, or small growth in the lining of the intestine). A rigid sigmoidoscopy is useful for some ''colorectal'' surgical procedures.''A sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy usually take approximately 10-30 minutes to complete, unless there are complications or further investigations with biopsies or polyp removal is necessary.''Both sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy require preparation to clear out the colon. Most sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy preparations involve drinking large amounts of cleansing solutions (such as ''MiraLAX''), along with laxatives, enemas, and possibly several days of a clear ''liquid diet'' prior to the procedure. During the procedure, ''sedatives'' are usually given to relax the patient and reduce ''pain''.' "

Patients with these conditions may need antibiotics prior to colonoscopy, or dental procedures to prevent infection of the heart valves or the prosthesis.''If the procedure is to be complete and accurate, the colon must be completely cleaned, and there are several different colonoscopy preparations. Patients are given detailed instructions about the cleansing preparation. In general, this consists of drinking a large volume of a special cleansing solution or several days of a clear liquid ''diet'' and laxatives or enemas prior to the examination. These instructions should be followed exactly as prescribed or the procedure may be unsatisfactory (visualization of the lining of the colon may be obscured by residual ''stool''), and it may have to be repeated, or a less accurate alternative test must be performed in its place.''Instructions may also be given to avoid certain foods for a couple of days prior to the procedure, such as stringy foods, foods with seeds, or red Jell-O.''Most medications should be continued as usual, but some may interfere with the examination. It is best if the colonoscopist is informed of all current prescription and ''over-the-counter'' medications. Aspirin products, blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), ''arthritis'' medications, ''insulin'"", and iron preparations are examples of medications that may require special instructions. The colonoscopist will also want to be aware of a patient's ""'allergies'' and any other major illnesses. The colonoscopist should be alerted if, in the past, patients have required antibiotics prior to surgical or dental procedures to prevent infections.' "
What happens during that endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures?,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy is generally well tolerated and rarely causes any significant ''pain''.

Removal of all of the precancerous polyps during colonoscopy has been shown to prevent ''colon cancer''.''Prior to colonoscopy, intravenous fluids are started, and the patient is placed on a monitor for continuous monitoring of heart rhythm and ''blood pressure'' as well as oxygen in the blood. Medications (sedatives) usually are given through an intravenous line so the patient becomes sleepy and relaxed, and to reduce pain. If needed, the patient may receive additional doses of medication during the procedure. Colonoscopy often produces a feeling of pressure, cramping, and bloating in the abdomen; however, with the aid of medications, it is generally well-tolerated and infrequently causes severe pain.''Patients will lie on their left side or back as the ''colonoscope'' is slowly advanced. Once the tip of the colon (cecum) or the last portion of the small intestine (terminal ileum) is reached, the colonoscope is slowly withdrawn, and the lining of the colon is carefully examined. Colonoscopy usually takes 15 to 60 minutes. If the entire colon, for some reason, cannot be visualized, the physician may decide to try colonoscopy again at a later date with or without a different bowel preparation or may decide to order an X-ray or CT of the colon.''If an abnormal area needs to be better evaluated, a biopsy forceps can be passed through a channel in the colonoscope and a biopsy (a sample of the tissue) can be obtained. The biopsy is submitted to the pathology laboratory for examination under a microscope by a pathologist. If infection is suspected, a biopsy may be obtained for culturing of bacteria (and occasionally ''viruses'' or fungus) or examination under the microscope for parasites. If colonoscopy is performed because of bleeding, the site of bleeding can be identified, samples of tissue obtained (if necessary), and the bleeding controlled by several means. Should there be polyps, (benign growths that can become cancerous) they almost always can be removed through the colonoscope. Removal of these polyps is an important method of preventing colon and ''rectal cancer'', although the great majority of polyps are benign and do not become cancerous. None of these additional procedures typically produces pain. Biopsies are taken for many reasons and do not necessarily mean that ''cancer'' is suspected.' "
What are the risks of colonoscopy?,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy are generally safe when the procedure is performed by properly trained individuals. Possible but rare complications include a perforation (making a hole in the wall of the colon) and bleeding from the biopsy site. The former may call for surgery.''Although complications following flexible sigmoidoscopy are rare, it is important to recognize the early signs of any possible complication. Contact your physician or the examiner if you notice any of the following:''Complications of colonoscopy are rare and usually minor when performed by physicians who have been specially trained and are experienced in colonoscopy.''Bleeding may occur at the site of biopsy or removal of polyps, but the bleeding usually is minor and self-limited or can be controlled through the colonoscope. It is quite unusual to require transfusions or surgery for post-colonoscopic bleeding. An even less common complication is a perforation or a tear through the colonic wall, but even these perforations may not require surgery.''Other potential complications are reactions to the sedatives used, localized irritation to the vein where medications were injected (leaving a tender lump lasting a day or two), or complications from existing heart or lung disease. The incidence of all of these complications together is less than 1%.''While these complications are rare, it is important for patients to recognize early signs of a complication so that they may return to their physicians or an emergency room. The colonoscopist who performed the colonoscopy should be contacted if a patient notices severe ''abdominal pain'', ''rectal bleeding'' of more than half a cup, or ''fever'' and chills.''Colonoscopy is the best method available to detect, diagnose, and treat abnormalities within the colon. The alternatives to colonoscopy are quite limited. ''Barium enema'' is a less accurate test performed with ''X-rays''. It misses abnormalities more often than colonoscopy, and, if an abnormality is found, a colonoscopy still may be required to biopsy or remove the abnormality. At times, an abnormality or lesion detected with a barium enema is actually stool or residual food in a poorly cleansed colon. Colonoscopy may then be necessary to clarify the nature of the lesion. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a limited examination that uses a shorter colonoscope and examines only the last one-third of the colon.''Patients will be kept in an observation area for an hour or two post-colonoscopy until the effects of medications that have been given wear off. If patients have been given sedatives before or during colonoscopy, they may not drive, even if they feel alert. Should patients have some cramping or bloating, this can be relieved quickly with the passage of ''gas'', and they should be able to eat upon returning home.''After the removal of polyps or certain other manipulations, the ''diet'' or activities of patients may be restricted for a brief period of time.' severe abdominal pain, fever and/or chills, and rectal bleeding of more than a few teaspoons."

What is American Sign Language?,"'American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, complex language that employs signs made with the hands and other movements, including facial expressions and postures of the body.

Others claim that the foundation for ASL existed before FSL was introduced in America in 1817. It was in that year that a French teacher named Laurent Clerc, brought to the United States by Thomas Gallaudet, founded the first school for the deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. Clerc began teaching FSL to Americans, though many of his students were already fluent in their own forms of local, natural sign language. Today's ASL likely contains some of this early American signing. Which language had more to do with the formation of modern ASL is difficult to prove. Modern ASL and FSL share some elements, including a substantial amount of vocabulary. However, they are not mutually comprehensible.""  "
How Does American Sign Language Compare With Spoken Language?,"'In spoken language, the different sounds created by words and tones of voice (intonation) are the most important devices used to communicate. Sign language is based on the idea that sight is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information. Thus, ASL uses hand shape, position, and movement; body movements; gestures; facial expressions; and other visual cues to form its words. Like any other language, fluency in ASL happens only after a long period of study and practice.''Even though ASL is used in America, it is a language completely separate from English. It contains all the fundamental features a language needs to function on its own--it has its own rules for grammar, punctuation, and sentence order. ASL evolves as its users do, and it also allows for regional usage and jargon. Every language expresses its features differently; ASL is no exception. Whereas English speakers often signal a question by using a particular tone of voice, ASL users do so by raising the eyebrows and widening the eyes. Sometimes, ASL users may ask a question by tilting their bodies forward while signaling with their eyes and eyebrows.''Just as with other languages, specific ways of expressing ideas in ASL vary as much as ASL users themselves do. ASL users may choose from synonyms to express common words. ASL also changes regionally, just as certain English words are spoken differently in different parts of the country. Ethnicity, age, and gender are a few more factors that affect ASL usage and contribute to its variety.' "
Why Does American Sign Language Become A First Language For Many Deaf People?,"""Parents are often the source of a child's early acquisition of language. A deaf child who is born to deaf parents who already use ASL will begin to acquire ASL as naturally as a ""'hearing'' child picks up spoken language from hearing parents. However, language is acquired differently by a deaf child with hearing parents who have no prior experience with ASL. Some hearing parents choose to introduce sign language to their deaf children. Hearing parents who choose to learn sign language often learn it along with their child. Nine out of every ten children who are born deaf are born to parents who hear. Other communication models, based in spoken English, exist apart from ASL, including oral, auditory-verbal, and cued speech. As with any language, interaction with other children and adults is also a significant factor in acquisition.' "

Why Emphasize Early Language Learning?","""Parents should introduce deaf children to language as early as possible. The earlier any child is exposed to and begins to acquire language, the better that child's communication skills will become. Research suggests that the first six months are the most crucial to a child's development of language skills. All newborns should be screened for deafness or ""'hearing loss'"" before they leave the hospital or within the first month of life. Very early discovery of a child's ""'hearing loss'"" or deafness provides parents with an opportunity to learn about communication options. Parents can then start their child's language learning process during this important stage of development."" "
What Does Recent Research Say About American Sign Language and Other Sign Languages?,"'Some studies focus on the age of ASL acquisition. Age is a critical issue for people who acquire ASL, whether it is a first or second language. For a person to become fully competent in any language, exposure must begin as early as possible, preferably before school age. Other studies compare the skills of native signers and non-native signers to determine differences in language processing ability. Native signers of ASL consistently display more accomplished sign language ability than non-native signers, again emphasizing the importance of early exposure and acquisition.''Other studies focus on different ASL processing skills.

The virus typically infects the nose and throat. ''Common cold'' usually manifests as a mild to moderate harmless illness. It can affect anyone, although children under age six are more susceptible.''Allergies'' occur when the immune system reacts to foreign substances such as dust, ''pollen'', ''mold'', and certain medications that may be harmless for most people. During an ''allergic reaction'', the immune system releases antibodies (proteins delivering a message to cells to release chemicals) that cause ''allergic'' symptoms.''Flu'' or ''influenza'' is also an infectious viral disease. It is caused by an influenza virus. It can cause a mild to severe disease with the severe form occurring more frequently in infants and small children.\xa0''Anyone can get influenza, but some people are at a high risk of serious complications. These include infants, small children, people aged 65 years and above, people with certain long-term medical conditions (such as ''diabetes'', ''asthma'', or ''heart disease'') and ''pregnant'' women.' heart disease,  diabetes,  chronic respiratory disease and  cancer."
"How to differentiate between the signs and symptoms of COVID-19, allergies, cold and flu?",'Diseases affecting the respiratory system (starting from the nose to the ''lungs'') often manifest with overlapping signs and symptoms. Symptoms of ''COVID-19'' usually occur from 2-14 days after exposure. The symptoms may vary from person to person and may range from mild to severe disease.''COVID-19 symptoms include the following:''Fever''Cough''Congestion''Loss of smell''Runny nose''Itchy'' eyes''Sneezing''Chills''Repeated shaking with chills''Headache' Fever Dry cough Tiredness or fatigue Aches and pains Sore throat Diarrhea Conjunctivitis Headache Loss of taste or smell Skin rash or discoloration of the fingers or toes Breathing difficulty or shortness of breath Chest pain or pressure Loss of speech or movement COVID-19: common Allergies: absent Flu: common Cold: sometimes COVID-19: common Allergies: rare Flu: common Cold: common COVID-19: common Allergies: rare Cold: rare Flu: rare COVID-19: common Allergies: absent Flu: common Cold: sometimes COVID-19: sometimes Allergies: rare Flu: sometimes Cold: common COVID-19: sometimes Allergies: absent Flu: sometimes Cold: absent COVID-19: sometimes Allergies: common Flu: sometimes Cold: common COVID-19: sometimes Allergies: sometimes Flu: sometimes Cold: sometimes COVID-19: sometimes Allergies: common Flu: sometimes Cold: sometimes COVID-19: absent Allergies: common Flu: absent Cold: absent COVID-19: sometimes Allergies: common Flu: sometimes Cold: sometimes COVID-19: sometimes Allergies: rare Flu: sometimes Cold: rare COVID-19: sometimes Allergies: absent Flu: absent Cold: absent COVID-19: sometimes Allergies: rare Flu: sometimes Cold: rare
"Should I visit my doctor if I am not sure whether my symptoms are due to COVID-19, allergies, cold or flu?","'If you are not sure of the cause of your symptoms, call your physician to seek advice over the phone. You must seek immediate medical help if you have any of the serious symptoms such as breathing difficulty or shortness of breath, ''chest pain'', high fever or pressure and loss of speech or movement.\xa0''Always contact your doctor on phone before visiting them or any health facility. If you have mild symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should manage your symptoms at home with the necessary medical guidance from a healthcare provider on the phone.' "
What is a stroke?,"'A ''stroke'' occurs when the blood supply to an area of the brain is cut off. The symptoms depend upon the region of the brain that is affected by the loss of blood supply and can include changes in sensation or motor control.''Symptoms of a ''stroke'' also depend on how much of the brain tissue is deprived of blood supply. For example, someone who had a mild ''stroke'' may experience temporary ''weakness'' of an arm or leg, but those with a more severe ''stroke'' may be permanently paralyzed on one side of their body or be unable to speak. If the blood supply is not quickly restored, either on its own or via medical treatment, the effects may be permanent.''A ''transient ischemic attack'', or ''TIA'', is sometimes referred to as a ""''mini-stroke''."" With a ''TIA'', the ''stroke symptoms'' occur but go away on their own.''Some people fully recover from ''strokes'', but over two-thirds of ''stroke'' survivors are left with some type of disability.'  "
How can you tell if a person is having a stroke?,"'Acting fast is critical if you suspect that someone may be having a ''stroke'"". Immediate treatment of a stroke can minimize long-term effects of the stroke and can even help reduce a person's risk of death from stroke.""'FAST is an acronym that can help you quickly recognize the warning signs and ''symptoms of stroke''. You can even download a ''FAST'' app from the webpage of the American Stroke Association to help you remember these signs.' "
What are the early warning symptoms and signs of a stroke?,"'Use ''FAST'' to remember and recognize the following signs and ''symptoms of stroke'':'   F: Face drooping. Ask the person to smile, and see if one side is drooping. One side of the face may also be numb, and the smile may appear uneven. A: Arm weakness. Ask the person to raise both arms. Is there weakness or numbness on one side? One arm drifting downward is a sign of one-sided arm weakness. S: Speech difficulty. People having a stroke may slur their speech or have trouble speaking at all. Speech may be incomprehensible. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence and look for any speech abnormality. T: Time to call 911! If a person shows any of the symptoms above, even if the symptoms went away, call 911 and get the person to a hospital immediately."
What are other signs and symptoms of stroke in men and women?,"'While these are the hallmark symptoms of stroke, a stroke can cause disruption of any function of the nervous system. Symptoms of stroke typically occur on one side of the body and come on suddenly. With a ''transient ischemic attack'' (sometimes called a ''mini-stroke'' or TIA) the symptoms appear and may go away on their own. In any case, it is essential to get the affected person to a hospital as soon as possible to enable prompt treatment.''Other possible signs and symptoms of stroke include the sudden onset of:'   Weakness or paralysis of any part of the body Numbness or a ""pins and needles"" sensation anywhere in the body Gait disturbances (trouble walking) or loss of balance and coordination Vision changes, blurred vision, or trouble with eyesight in one or both eyes Dizziness Severe headache that usually is unlike headaches in the past Confusion Inability to speak, slurred speech, or inability to understand speech Loss of sensation in any part of the body Memory loss Behavioral changes Muscle stiffness Difficulty swallowing Involuntary eye movements"
"What are the signs and symptoms of a mini-stroke (TIA, transient ischemic attack)?","'The symptoms of a TIA or mini-stroke are the same as those of a stroke as listed above. With a mini-stroke, the symptoms go away on their own. Any symptoms of a stroke can occur during a mini-stroke.'  "
What should I do if someone has symptoms and signs of a stroke?,"'Remember to think and act ''FAST'"" (Face drooping; Arm weakness; Speech difficulty; and Time to call 911!) if you see someone who may be having these symptoms. Don't delay and call 9-1-1 immediately. You may help save a life or reduce the chance of long-term disability."" "
Which specialties of doctors treat strokes?,"'A person who is having a stroke is typically cared for in an emergency department, and initially seen by a specialist in ''emergency medicine''. Doctors typically involved in the care of patients with stroke can include neurologists, endovascular surgical neuroradiology (ESNR) specialists, interventional radiologists (IR), interventional cardiologists (IC), and critical care specialists.' "
What causes kidney diseases?,"'Kidney diseases have various causes. Some of the common causes are as follows:' Diabetes High blood pressure Infections Age above 60 years increases the risk of kidney diseases Family history of kidney diseases Race or ethnicity, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans have a higher likelihood to have kidney diseases. Glomerulonephritis (an inflammatory disease affecting the tiny blood vessels or glomeruli in the kidneys) Hereditary diseases such as polycystic kidney disease (a genetic condition that causes many cysts to grow in the kidneys) Injuries or major blood loss Certain medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  Cancer Kidney stones Enlarged prostate "
Can kidney diseases be prevented?,"'You can often lower your risk of kidney diseases or prevent its progression. Certain ways to prevent kidney diseases are as follows:' Healthy diet: Avoid foods that are rich in fats and salts such as fried or junk foods, including chips, pickles, salted nuts, and frozen or preserved foods. Adequate hydration with water and non-sugary drinks helps flush out the toxins from the kidneys. Timely treatment of urinary tract infections: Many times, urinary infections are neglected. Timely management of infections and urinary tract stones may prevent kidney damage in the long run. Avoid self-medications and supplements: Certain over-the-counter (OTC) supplements and painkillers have caused kidney damage in some people. Never take any medicine without the advice of a healthcare professional. Physical activity: Exercising for at least 30 minutes for five days a week may help in regulating blood sugar and blood pressure and maintaining a healthy weight. This reduces many risk factors contributing to kidney diseases. Avoid alcohol and tobacco: Tobacco and alcohol can damage various organs including the kidneys. Avoiding them helps to lead a healthy life. It is recommended that men should not have more than two drinks per day, and women must restrict to not more than one drink per day. Routine medical checkup: Most signs of kidney diseases appear late or are ignored. Regular health checkups help in the management of risk factors and detecting kidney diseases early."
What happens in joint replacement surgery?,"'Joint replacement surgery involves replacing a destroyed joint with an artificial joint. In knee or ''hip replacement'' surgery, the artificial joint is made out of metal and ''plastic'"".  In the case of joint replacement in the hand, the new joint is most commonly composed of silicone rubber or the patient's own tissues such as a portion oftendon.""'Joint replacement surgery, also known as arthroplasty, is very common. Each year, orthopedic surgeons perform thousands of joint replacement surgeries in the U.S.  (Most of these procedures are performed on the large weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees.) Joint replacement surgery in the hand is typically used in treating severe ''arthritis'' that involves the small joints of the hand.''The hips and knees receive continuous ''stress'' from ''walking'',  ''running'', sporting activity, or injury and are more commonly affected by the wearing of cartilage (''degenerative arthritis'') than the  hand joints.  However, the joints of the hand do experience ''stress'' in everyday use, and because the hand joints are smaller, these stresses are concentrated over a smaller surface area. The high ratio of stress to surface area can cause the smooth joint cartilage to wear over the years.  As the cartilage degenerates, the underlying bone becomes exposed.  When the deteriorated joint moves, bone rubs upon bone causing ''pain'', swelling, limiting motion, and frequently causing a grinding or popping sensation.  Furthermore, forms of arthritis that are caused by inflammation of the tissues lining the joint frequently affect the small joints of the hands and wrists to cause joint destruction.  Examples include ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and  ''psoriatic arthritis''.' "
"What are symptoms and signs of arthritis of the hand and 
wrist?","'The most common symptoms of arthritis of the hands include ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and swelling over the joints. The pain is usually worsened when the joint is moved.  Moreover, motion of the joint is frequently limited due to pain and joint contractures.  Symptoms can lead to difficulty with daily living activities including tying shoes, buttoning buttons, opening jars, or turning a key in a lock.''Physical signs of arthritis of the hand include changes in the appearance of the joints.  The joints most commonly affected by degenerative arthritis are those at the ends of the fingers.  Swelling and ''bumps'', or nodes, can occur at the small joints at the area of the base of the nail.  These bumps are called Heberden nodes and can become extremely painful.  The joint at the base of the thumb can also become swollen with ''bone spurs'' and cause pain and deformity.  The joint destruction also leads to severe pain when pinching the fingers together and gripping forcefully.  Joint motion limitation can also decrease the ability to grip.''Wrist arthritis can cause pain with motion of the wrist or grasping and lifting.  Wrist range of motion is frequently limited by the arthritis.  Patients typically experience relief when the wrist is stabilized by a splint.''Rheumatoid arthritis'' frequently causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the wrists, as well as the small joints in the middle and at the base of the fingers. This disease frequently causes hand deformities.  Tissue lumps called rheumatoid nodules can form over the joints of the hand and wrist.  The joints of the fingers and thumb can become deformed and contracted by the destruction of the supporting ligaments, so that grasping and pinching movements are not possible.' "
How are patients with hand joint abnormalities evaluated?,"'The diagnosis of hand joint problems typically involves evaluating symptoms, physical examination, and the x-ray appearance of the joints.  Blood testing is sometimes also helpful in the assessment process.  Joint replacement surgery becomes a treatment option when significant joint destruction and/or deformity are present.' "
What are the different surgical options?,"'Surgical options include'""The optimal surgical treatment of arthritis of the hand and wrist varies from patient to patient and is based on many factors.  These factors include the patient's age, hand dominance, employment, level of pain, functional goals, and underlying disease."" cleaning of the abnormal cartilage and bone, including removal of bone 
spurs, fusion of the joint, and joint replacement surgery."
When is surgical cleaning of the joint the best alternative?,"'Surgical cleaning of the joint, or salvage procedure, is usually performed in cases of early ""wear and tear"" arthritis where there are painful bone spurs or, in cases of ''rheumatoid arthritis'', where there is a large amount of inflamed tissue.  Removal of bone spurs is especially helpful when the arthritis involves the joints at the ends of the fingers (distal interphalangeal or DIP joints).' "
"What is a joint fusion? When is it the best surgical 
option?","'Fusion of a joint involves removing the joint and surgically ""fusing"" the bone ends so that the two bones effectively become one solid bone.  This procedure terminates all motion at that joint and thus eliminates the pain. The benefit of fusion is pain relief and the downside is elimination of motion at the fused joint, which can hinder function. This surgical option is reserved for patients with advanced arthritis.''Joint fusion is usually the best surgical option in patients who are younger and very active. Younger patients may not be candidates for joint replacement because of the increased stress demand on the joints which accompany higher activity levels.  This increased stress demand can quickly wear out an artificial joint.' "
When is joint replacement surgery the best surgical option?,"'Joint replacement surgery in the hand is an excellent option for treating arthritis of the hand in older, low-activity patients and for those with ''rheumatoid arthritis''. Joint replacement surgery can provide pain relief, increase finger range of motion, and improve hand function.' "
"How do the surgical options vary with the different joints of 
the hands and wrists?","'Hand joint replacement surgery options differ according to the specific joint(s) involved.''1. ''DIP joint (joint closest to the fingertip)'': This joint is not a good candidate for joint replacement.  The bones are very small and do not hold the implant very well. The best treatment option for advanced arthritis at this joint is fusion.  Hand function is only minimally compromised by lack of motion at this joint after a fusion procedure, while pain is relieved.''2. ''PIP joint (second joint from the fingertip)'': Joint replacement is commonly performed in the PIP joint.  Hand function, especially power grasp, can be hindered by fusion of this joint.  The small and ring fingers are the best candidates for joint replacement as they are the most important for power grasp.  The index finger is not a good candidate for a PIP joint replacement, as it must withstand sideways forces which accompany movements such as key turning and fine manipulation of objects.  These forces cause excess stress on the joint implant and can lead to early implant breakage.''There have been numerous false (prosthetic) joints designed for PIP joint replacement, but only one has stood the test of time.  The only nonexperimental PIP joint replacement is the silicone interpositional arthroplasty.  These joints are made of silicone rubber and have a flexible hinge in the middle and stems at the ends which insert into the shaft of the bone, providing stability.  The most frequently used silicone joint implants are termed the Swanson implant and the Sutter implant.''The best results with PIP joint replacement are in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in older, lower-activity patients.''3. ''MCP joint (third joint from the fingertip)'': ''Osteoarthritis'' rarely affects the MCP joints.  The most common need for joint replacement in this joint is destruction from rheumatoid arthritis.  Silicone joint replacement of the MCP joint has been used since the 1960s and has produced excellent long-term results.''4. ''Thumb basal joint (where the thumb meets the wrist)'': This joint is exposed to very high stresses with normal activities.  Forces felt at the tip of the thumb are multiplied 12 times in their effect to the thumb base, thus predisposing this joint to wear.  Arthritis of this joint is very common, especially in women, and frequently requires joint replacement.  Attempts at silicone replacement of this joint have not been as successful as hoped due to implant failure and bone destruction.  Thus, the most common joint replacement procedure for the thumb base is done with natural material.  The procedure is termed the ligament reconstruction-tendon interposition procedure (LRTI).  This procedure uses the patient\'s own tendon to stabilize the thumb and resurface the joint.  LRTI provides stability and pain relief. Long-term results have been excellent.  This has also been called the tendon roll or ""anchovy"" procedure because the tendon used is curled to form the new joint cushion.''5. ''Wrist joint'': Most patients with wrist arthritis are best treated with surgical joint cleaning or fusion and not joint replacement.  Most wrist-joint prostheses on the market are currently investigational and for use in extremely low activity patients with ''osteoarthritis'' or rheumatoid arthritis. ''Summary''''Arthritis of the hand and wrist is a very common and complex problem with many nonsurgical and surgical treatment options.  Deciding which alternative is best can require the skills of the primary doctor, the arthritis specialist (''rheumatologist''), and/or an orthopedic surgeon.' "
Joint Replacement Surgery of the Hand At A Glance," Joint replacement surgery involves replacing a destroyed joint with an artificial joint. This procedure is typically employed in treating severe arthritis involving certain joints. Surgical options for treatment of arthritis of the hand include cleaning of the abnormal cartilage and bone, fusion, and replacement surgery."
What is Behçet's syndrome?,"""Behçet's syndrome is classically characterized as a triad of symptoms that include recurring crops of mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers, ""'canker sores''), genital ulcers, and inflammation of a specialized area around the pupil of the eye termed the uvea. The inflammation of the area of the eye that is around the pupil is called ''uveitis'"". Behçet's syndrome is also sometimes referred to as Behçet's disease.""  "
What causes and contagious of Behçet's syndrome?,"""The cause of Behçet's syndrome is not known. The disease is relatively rare but is more frequent and severe in patients from the Eastern Mediterranean and Asia than those of European descent. Both ""'inherited'"" (genetic) and environmental factors, such as microbial infections, are suspected to be factors that contribute to the development of Behçet's. Behçet's is not known to be ""'contagious''.' "
What are symptoms of Behçet's syndrome?,"""The symptoms of Behçet's syndrome depend on the area of the body affected. Behçet's syndrome can involve inflammation of many areas of the body. These areas include the arteries that supply blood to the body's tissues. Behçet's syndrome can also affect the veins that take the blood back to the lungs to replenish oxygen. Other areas of body that can be affected by the inflammation of Behçet's syndrome include the back of the eyes (retina), brain, joints, skin, and bowels.""'The ''mouth and genital ulcers'"" of Behçet's syndrome are generally painful and tend to recur in crops (many shallow ulcers occur at the same time). They range in size from a few millimeters to 20 millimeters in diameter. The mouth ulcers occur on the gums, tongue, and inner lining of the mouth. The genital ulcers occur on the scrotum and penis of males and vulva of women and can leavescars.""'Inflammation of the eye'', which can involve the front of the eye (uvea) causing ''uveitis'', or the back of the eye (retina) causing retinitis, can lead to ''blindness''. Symptoms of eye inflammation include ''pain'', ''blurred vision'', tearing, redness, and ''pain'"" when looking at bright lights. It is very important for patients with Behçet's syndrome to have this sensitive area monitored by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).""'If the arteries become inflamed (''arteritis'"") from Behçet's syndrome, it can lead to death of the tissues whose oxygen supply depends on these vessels. This could cause a ""'stroke'' if it is affecting the brain vessels, belly pain if affecting the bowel, etc. When veins become inflamed (''phlebitis''), the inflammation can involve large veins that develop ''blood clots'' which can loosen and migrate to cause pulmonary embolisms.''Symptoms of ''inflammation of the brain'' or tissue that covers the brain (meninges) include ''headaches'', ''neck stiffness'', and is often associated with ''fever''. Inflammation of the brain (''encephalitis'') and/or the meninges (meningitis) can cause damage to nervous tissue and lead to ''weakness'' or impaired function of portions of the body. This can result in ''confusion'' and ''coma''. Typically these features occur later in the disease course, years after the diagnosis.''Joint inflammation'' (''arthritis'') can lead to swelling, ''stiffness'"", warmth, pain, and tenderness of joints with Behçet's syndrome. This occurs in about half of patients with Behçet's syndrome at sometime during their lives. Knees, wrists, ankles, and elbows are the most common joints affected. The skin of patients with Behçet's syndrome can develop areas of inflammation that spontaneously appear as raised, tender, reddish nodules (""'erythema nodosum'""), typically on the front of the legs. Some patients with Behçet's syndrome develop a peculiar red or blistery skin reaction in places where they have been pierced by blood-drawing needles (see pathergy test in diagnosis section). Research has found that ""'acne'"" occurs more frequently in patients with Behçet's syndrome that also have arthritis as a manifestation.""'Ulcerations'"" can occur at any location in the stomach, large or small bowel in patients with Behçet's disease.""  "
How is Behçet's syndrome diagnosed?,"""Behçet's syndrome is diagnosed based on the finding of recurrent mouth ulcerations combined with any two of the following: eye inflammation, genital ulcerations, or skin abnormalities mentioned above. ""'A special skin test called a ''pathergy test'"" can also suggest Behçet's syndrome. (The other criteria above are still required for ultimate diagnosis.) This test consists of pricking the skin of the forearm with a sterile needle. The test is called positive and suggests Behçet's syndrome when the puncture causes a sterile red nodule or ""'pustule'' that is greater than two millimeters in diameter at 24 to 48 hours after the test.''Tests such as ''skin biopsy'', ''lumbar puncture'', ''MRI'' scan of the brain, and bowel tests are considered for individual patients based upon symptoms that are present.'  "
What is the treatment of Behçet's syndrome?,"""The treatment of Behçet's syndrome depends on the severity and the location of its manifestations in an individual patient. ""'Steroid (cortisone) gels, pastes (such as Kenolog in Orabase) and creams can be helpful for the mouth and genital ulcers. ''Colchicine'' (''Colcrys'') can also minimize recurrent ulcerations. ''Trental'' (''pentoxifylline'') has also been used in the treatment of oral and genital ulcers. ''Joint inflammation can require nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (such as ''ibuprofen'' and others) or oral steroids. Colchicine and oral and injectable cortisone are used for inflammation involving the joints, eyes, skin, and brain. ''Sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine) has been effective in some patients for arthritis. Bowel disease is treated with oral steroids and sulfasalazine.''Diligent treatment of eye inflammation is essential. Patients with eye symptoms or a history of eye inflammation should be monitored by an ophthalmologist. Resistant eye inflammation can often respond to new biologic medications that block a protein that plays a major role in initiating inflammation, called TNF. These TNF-blocking medications, including ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') and ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), can also be helpful for severe mouth ulcerations.'""Severe disease of the arteries, eyes, and brain can be difficult to treat and require powerful medications that suppress the immune system called immunosuppressive agents. Immunosuppressive agents used for severe Behçet's syndrome include ""'chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), and ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''). ''Cyclosporine'' has been used for resistant disease.''Studies suggest that ''thalidomide'' (''Thalomid'"") may be of benefit for certain patients with Behçet's syndrome in treating and preventing ulcerations of the mouth and genitals. Side effects of thalidomide include promoting abnormal development of fetal growth, nerve injury (neuropathy), and hypersedation. Trials are currently underway evaluating ""'interferon'"" alpha for the treatment of eye disease in patients with Behçet's syndrome.""  "
Introduction to endoscopy,"'The use of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopes has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ''esophagus'', stomach, duodenum, and colon (''large intestine''). The last remaining frontier in the ''intestines'' has been the small intestine. Wireless ''capsule endoscopy'' allows physicians to visualize the inside of the intestines from the esophagus through to the colon, but capsule ''endoscopy'"" has limitations, the most notable of which are the inability to control the capsule's passage and to perform therapeutic interventions, such as biopsy and electrocautery. Although capsule endoscopy is likely to remain an important diagnostic procedure because of its simplicity, the limitations of capsule endoscopy have been overcome by the development of balloon endoscopy, also known as enteroscopy.""  "
What is balloon endoscopy?,'There are two types of balloon endoscopy: single balloon and double balloon. ' 
Single balloon endoscopy,"'For single balloon endoscopy, a 200 cm long flexible, fiberoptic, endoscope (a hose-like tube one centimeter in diameter with a light and a camera on the tip) is fitted with an equally long overtube that slides the full length of the endoscope. On the tip of the overtube is a balloon that can be inflated and deflated. The balloon is blown up to anchor the overtube within the intestine. While the overtube is anchored, the endoscope can be advanced further into the small intestine. By withdrawing the overtube the small intestine can be shortened and straightened to make the passage of the inner endoscope easier. The balloon may then be deflated so that the overtube can be inserted further and the endoscope advanced again. The endoscope itself is a standard endoscope with working channels that allow the intestine to be inflated with air, rinsed with water, or used to guide biopsy or electrocautery instruments to the tip of the endoscope.' "
Double balloon endoscopy,"'For double balloon endoscopy, similar equipment is used, but a second balloon is located on the tip of the endoscope. Both balloons - the one on the overtube and the one on the endoscope - can be alternatively inflated to anchor the overtube or the endoscope to assist with the passage of the endoscope or overtube, respectively.' "
What to expect with balloon endoscopy,"'Balloon endoscopy, like other gastrointestinal endoscopy, requires intravenous sedation. The procedures are long, often requiring 1-3 hours. The most important complications of balloon endoscopy are perforation of the small intestine or bleeding either due to insertion of the endoscope or the use of therapeutic instruments.'  "
What is the future for balloon endoscopy?,"'Balloon endoscopy is revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal diseases. Nevertheless, its use is restricted because of the large expenditure of time that is necessary to perform it. Either newer, faster systems will need to be designed or, perhaps, paramedical personnel will be needed to perform the insertions before balloon endoscopy is as commonly performed as other types of endoscopy. For now, when there is concern about disease in the small intestine, wireless capsule endoscopy often is performed first. Then, if abnormalities are found, or if despite a normal capsule endoscopy there still is a strong suspicion that there may be disease in the small intestine, balloon endoscopy is performed.' "
What are the sinuses and what do they look like (pictures)?,"'Sinuses of the face are ''cavities'' or spaces within the bones that help humidify the air and secrete mucus to help with air filtration. Additionally, they contribute to the strength of the skull and its ability to resist ''trauma''. The sinus ''cavities'' also allow more resonance to be added to the voice.''The sinuses are often referred to as the paranasal sinuses because of their location and connection to the back of the nose. The sinuses develop as air sacs within the bones of the skull, which are named by their location.''While infants do have sinuses, they are very poorly developed. The maxillary sinuses cannot be seen on an X-ray until 1 to 2 years of age and the frontal sinuses are not seen until age 5 or 6.' Frontal sinus: located above the eyes within the frontal bone of the skull Maxillary sinus: located beneath the eyes under the cheekbones within the maxilla bone of the face Ethmoid sinus: located in the ethmoid bone separating the eyes from the nose Sphenoid sinus: located in the sphenoid bone at the base of the skull"
What is a sinus headache?,"'If the linings of the ducts or tubes that connect the sinuses to the back of the nose become inflamed, the sinuses may not be able to drain normally, and pressure may build up within the blocked sinus. There may also be associated swelling and inflammation of the lining of the sinuses, resulting in increased mucus and fluid secretion. This increase in fluid combined with the inability to drain increases pressure within the sinus ''cavity'', causing the ''pain'' of a ''sinus headache''. The term ''sinusitis'' is used to describe inflammation of the sinus.'  "
What causes sinus headaches?,"'While a sinus inflammation (''sinusitis'') may be caused by a viral infection and causes swelling in the nose (inflammation). This inflammation and decreased ability of the sinuses to drain also may be caused by an ''allergic reaction'' such as ''hay fever''. The inflammation causes swelling and increased fluid production. In the sinuses, this decreases the ability of the sinuses to drain. This increased inflammatory fluid production and the decrease in drainage causes the pain and pressure of a sinus ''headache''.''After a period, bacteria and ''viruses'' may travel from the nasal cavities into the stagnant fluid within the sinus ''cavity'' and cause an infection. Most ''sinus infections'' are due to ''viruses''. Viruses are the more likely cause if symptoms have been present for less than a week and are not getting worse. ''Bacterial infections'' typically will follow the initial period of inflammation from a viral infection or other significant sinus blockage. Less commonly, ''fungal infections'' may cause a ''sinus infection'', and even more rarely, tumors can invade the sinus.''The maxillary sinus sits underneath the eye within the cheekbone. The upper ''teeth'' attach to the lower portion of this bone, and dental infections can travel up the root of the tooth and infect the sinus directly.''Because there is almost always nasal inflammation associated with sinus inflammation, the illness is now often referred to as rhinosinusitis.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of sinus headaches vs. other types of headaches?,"   Pain and pressure are the primary symptoms of a sinus headache, usually due to the increased inflammation and decreased drainage from the affected sinus cavity. The pain of a sinus headache is often described as an increasing pressure sensation overlying the sinus that is blocked. This may be the cheek area (maxillary), the forehead (frontal area), or both. The part of the face in the area of the affected sinus can be tender to touch and reddened. Swelling also may occur. The pain can increase with changing head positions or when first getting up out of bed, again because of increased pressure within the sinus cavities."
What are the signs and symptoms of sinus infections and sinusitis?," If there is an infection, fever, chills, feeling poorly, or achy muscles occur. Opaque or greenish-yellow nasal drainage. Postnasal drainage, in which secretions drip down to the back of the throat. This can cause a cough and sometimes people have signs like coughing up yellow sputum. However, they may actually be coughing up the drainage that has dripped down from the sinuses instead of coughing up phlegm from the lungs. Swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands) may occur in the neck if an infection is present, which is no different than the swelling of lymph nodes that accompanies an acute sore throat (pharyngitis) or ear infection (otitis media). If there is no infection, ear drainage may be clear. If the maxillary sinus is inflamed, pain may also be felt in the upper teeth since the sinus is located within the bone that holds those teeth. Pain also may radiate to the temples, back of the neck, or top of the head."
How long does a take for a sinus headache to go away?," Acute sinusitis typically lasts less than eight weeks or occurs no more than three times per year with each episode lasting no longer than 10 days. Medications are generally effective against acute sinusitis. Successful treatment counteracts damage done to the mucous lining of the sinuses and surrounding bone of the skull. Chronic or recurring sinusitis lasts longer than eight weeks or occurs more than four times per year, with symptoms usually lasting more than 20 days."
What tests diagnose the causes of a sinus headache?,"'It is important that the cause of the ''headache'' be diagnosed. Many patients who believe that they have sinus ''headaches'' may instead have ''migraine'' or tension ''headaches''.''The health-care professional will likely begin by taking a history of the symptoms to help come to the diagnosis. Contributing factors in the development of sinusitis and headache may include a recent ''cold'' or ''upper respiratory tract infection'', history of ''smoking'', environmental ''allergies'' to dust or molds, as well as recent airplane travel, ''swimming'' or SCUBA diving, or other activities involving air pressure changes within the facial sinuses.''Physical examination may reveal tenderness to percussion, or tapping, over the affected sinus that reproduces the pain. Examination of the ears may reveal a serous otitis, or fluid levels behind the eardrum in the middle ear, that may suggest drainage problems in the face and sinuses. Examination of the nose may reveal swollen nasal passages and discharge. Evaluation of the mouth and teeth may find a source of infection, and the back of the throat may be examined for signs of postnasal drainage.''Routine ''X-rays'' of the face are not recommended to make the diagnosis of sinusitis or ''sinus infection''. If the doctor considers imaging studies of the sinuses, it is to confirm the diagnosis, and look for fluid collections or thickening of the mucus membranes that line the sinus walls. Limited ''CT scan'' of the sinuses is often recommended. Plain X-rays of the sinuses may sometimes be considered. Blood tests tend not to be helpful in making the diagnosis of the cause of sinus headache.' "
What is the treatment to cure a sinus headache?,"'Usually, a sinus headache can be cured with treatment, which can be two-fold. First, sinus inflammation is treated to help them drain. Once the sinuses are drained and the pressure is relieved, the pain should subside. Next, relief of headache pain and other signs and symptoms.'  "
"What home remedies relieve pain, pressure, and other sinus headache symptoms?",'Natural and home remedies that can be used at home to help decrease ''congestion'' include:' Drink plenty of fluids to help keep the body hydrated. Use a humidifier and a salt-water nasal spray to help with congestion Neti pots are an alternative way to get humidity into the nasal passages and assist with drainage to prevent inflammation and infection. Remember to read the instructions and use distilled or properly boiled water. Deaths have been caused by infections using tap water in the Neti-pot.
What over-the-counter (OTC) medications treat and relieve sinus headache pain and pressure?,"'OTC ''cold'' medications are available to help decrease inflammation within the sinuses and promote drainage. Brand name and generic ''drugs'' may be considered, but many contain pseudoephedrine (''Sudafed''), a medication that is related to adrenaline. People with ''high blood pressure'', ''heart'' conditions, or are ''pregnant'', should consult their doctor or pharmacist to assess their safety before taking these medications.''Some ''decongestant'' nasal sprays, other than salt-water sprays (Ocean Nasal Spray), may be used, but only for a short period because of side effects and complications. For example, Afrin and similar nasal sprays should be used for no more than 3 days in a row; otherwise, rebound inflammation may occur. With rebound inflammation, when the spray medication is stopped, the linings of the nasal passages may swell and potentially cause even more drainage complications.' "
What prescription medications treat a sinus headache pain and pressure?,"'Headaches'' from ''allergies'' can be relieved with a prescription for nasal steroids sprays unless there is a contraindication. This may be helpful along with nasal saline rinses to decrease inflammation within the nasal passages and treat or prevent sinusitis.''If a bacterial infection is suspected, the health-care professional may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection and at the same time make suggestions to treat the underlying inflammation. To establish the diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and the need for antibiotics, your doctor should confirm that symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis have been present for 10 days or are worsening. Symptoms should include pus-like (purulent) nasal drainage, nasal obstruction, facial pain or pressure. If the inflammation does not resolve before the antibiotic course is complete, the bacterial infection may recur.' "
Will surgery cure sinus infections and inflammation?,"'If the sinus headache persists, and repeated courses of treatment fail to relieve the sinusitis, surgery may be an option. Otorhinolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat [ENT] surgeons) may be able to widen the openings that allow the sinuses to drain and decrease the risk of recurrent inflammation that may obstruct the sinuses from draining.' "
What are the complications of a sinus headache? Can you die?,"'Complications of a sinus infection (sinusitis) are rare; however, if left untreated a sinus infection may erode through the bony walls of the sinus and infect adjacent structures in the face. Two potential areas for spread of the infection include:'   The orbit (eye socket), causing pain, swelling, and redness of the eyelid and skin surrounding the orbit. There can also be pain with any eye motion. Decreased vision may develop. The brain, causing symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. The blood vessels that run near the sinuses can develop inflammation and blood may clot (thrombus). Cavernous sinus thrombosis is inflammation and clotting of the cavernous sinus (a collection of small veins located near the sphenoid sinus), that can potentially become infected and form blood clots."
Which type doctors treat sinus headaches?,"'Most primary health-care professionals, including those who practice family medicine, ''pediatrics'', and internal medicine, can care for routine ''sinus infections''. Often patients will seek care at a walk-in clinic or Urgent Care Center. If complications arise, otolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat specialists) are often consulted to discuss the potential need for surgery and drainage of a sinus. On the rare occasion when ''fungal infections'' of the sinus are present, an infectious disease specialist may be consulted.' "
When should you call a doctor for a sinus headache?," Many people correctly self-diagnose sinusitis and treat themselves at home. Drinking plenty of fluids and humidifying the air is often enough to open the nasal passages and allow the sinuses to drain. This home treatment also may loosen secretions that are already present and promote drainage. However, medical care may be needed if a fever is present, if there is swelling that can be felt in the face (perhaps signaling an abscess formation), or if the person exhibits a change in behavior or thinking. Seeking medical care may also be appropriate if the pain does not respond to over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin, and others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or if symptoms last longer than 10 to 14 days."
Can sinus headaches be prevented?,"'Sinus ''headaches'' are due to inflammation of the sinuses and their ability to drain to the back of the nose.' Avoid smoking, secondhand smoke, and other allergens because they may decrease the risk of developing sinusitis and a sinus headache. Smoking reduces the ability of the sinuses to clear mucous and fluid. Avoid colds and other respiratory infections because it may decrease the risk of sinus inflammation, for example, frequent hand washing, and avoiding people who are sick. Flying is not recommended if you have a cold, sinus infection, or an upper respiratory infection because of the pressure changes in the face that occur with flying. Maintaining adequate hydration and breathing humidified air at home and work will allow the normal mucus that is produced in the sinuses to drain more easily."
What is the prognosis for a sinus headache?,"'Sinus ''headaches'' are short-lived temporary problems associated with colds or ''hay fever''. They recover quickly, once the underlying condition resolves.''Certain people develop chronic sinus inflammation and more long-standing symptoms associated with their sinusitis. Once the underlying condition is identified, preventive measures may be available and future recurrences of the sinus headache may be minimized. If the headache symptoms are not associated with inflammation of the sinuses, the underlying cause (such as a ''migraine headache'') needs to be adequately addressed to relieve symptoms.' "
Sinus Infection vs. Allergies: What's the difference?,"'Both ''sinus infections'' and ''allergies'' (''allergic rhinitis'') cause symptoms such as runny or stuffy nose and ''fatigue''.''Sinus infection'' (known as ''sinusitis'') is inflammation of the sinuses, caused by infection from bacteria, ''viruses'', and/or fungi (molds). A sinus infection that lasts three to eight weeks is considered acute. ''Sinus infections'' lasting longer than eight weeks are considered chronic. A sinus infection is often ''contagious'' and may be mistaken for the ''common cold''. When ''sinus infections'' are caused by bacteria, an antibiotic treatment may be prescribed.''Signs and ''symptoms of sinus infection'' include runny or stuffy nose, greenish nasal discharge, ''cough'', ''postnasal drip'', tenderness of the face under the eyes or at the ''bridge'' of the nose, ''sinus headache'', ''fever'', ''tooth pain'', ''fatigue'', and ''bad breath''. Home remedies for sinus infections are aimed at reliving symptoms and include staying hydrated, using a steam vaporizer, taking ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) sinus or ''pain'' medications, and ''nasal irrigation'' with devices such as a ''Neti pot''.''Allergic'' ''rhinitis'' occurs when certain ''allergies'' cause nasal symptoms. When a person with ''allergies'' breathes in an ''allergen'', such as ''pollen'', dust, or animal dander, symptoms such as runny or stuffy nose, ''itching'', ''sneezing'', and ''fatigue'' occur. Allergic rhinitis that is a result of allergic reactions to plant pollens is commonly called ''hay fever'' or seasonal allergies. Limiting exposure to ''allergy'' triggers can help reduce ''allergy symptoms''.' "
What causes sinus infections vs. allergies?,"'Sinus infections or ''sinusitis'' may be caused by anything that interferes with airflow into the sinuses and the drainage of ''mucus'' out of the sinuses. The sinus openings (ostea) may be blocked by swelling of the tissue lining and adjacent nasal passage tissue, for example with''Dehydration'', disease, drying medications, and lack of sufficient humidity can cause sinusitis or sinus infection.The drainage of mucous from the sinuses can also be impaired by thickening of the mucous secretions, by decrease in hydration (water content) of the mucous brought on by disease (for example, ''cystic fibrosis''), drying medications (''antihistamines''), and lack of sufficient humidity in the air. The epithelial cells have small hair-like fibers, called cilia, which move back and forth to help the mucus move out of the sinuses. These small cilia may be damaged by many irritants, especially smoke. This can prevent them from assisting the mucus in draining from the sinuses, and thus results in sinus infections or sinusitis.''Stagnated mucus provides an environment for bacteria, viruses and in some circumstances, (for example, ''AIDS'' or immunodepressed people) fungus, to grow within the sinus ''cavities''. In addition, the microbes themselves can initiate and exacerbate sinus blockage. The most commonly infected sinuses are the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.''Rarely, immunodepressed or victims of multiple traumas in disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, or tornadoes may breathe in fungi from the soil or water. Eventually, in a few days to over a week, the fungi can grow and cut off blood supply to almost any type of tissue, especially in the nose and eyes. These infections, although rare, are serious and can be deadly and require immediate medical and surgical care. Although the fungal infection may resemble common bacterial sinusitis initially, it is a disease termed ''zygomycosis'' or ''mucormycosis''.''Because allergic rhinitis is frequently caused by pollen, symptoms occur when pollen is in the air. Trees primarily pollinate in the spring, while grasses pollinate in the spring and summer. Weeds usually pollinate in the late summer and fall. Of ''allergy'' sufferers in the United States, many are allergic to ragweed, about half are allergic to grasses, and fewer are allergic to trees. Of course, many people are allergic to other substances such as ''mold'' spores, animal dander protein, and dust mites, to name a few.''An ''allergic reaction'' occurs when the immune system attacks a usually harmless substance called an allergen (as outlined above) that gains access to the body. The immune system calls upon a protective substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to fight these invading allergic substances or allergens. Even though everyone has some IgE, an allergic person has an unusually large amount of IgE. This army of IgE antibodies attacks and engages the invading army of allergic substances of allergens.''Specialized cells called mast cells also participate in the allergic reaction. Mast cells release a variety of chemicals into the tissues and blood, one of which is known as histamine. These chemicals frequently cause allergic reactions. These chemicals are very irritating and cause ''itching'', swelling, and fluid leaking from cells. Through various mechanisms, these allergic chemicals can cause ''muscle spasm'' and can lead to lung and throat tightening as is found in ''asthma'' and ''loss of voice'' (''laryngitis'').' common colds, allergies, and tissue irritants such as OTC nasal sprays, cocaine, and cigarette smoke. Other causes of sinus infections or sinusitis Tumors or growths also can block the sinuses if they are near the sinus openings."
What are the symptoms and signs of sinus infections and allergies?,"'There are many signs and symptoms of sinusitis and sinus infections. The following is a summary of predominant ones (18 total) that may occur. Most patients have several signs and symptoms at the same time. Others may have some symptoms that are intermittent; most do not have all symptoms at once. The signs and symptoms of a sinus infection or sinusitis include the following:''Allergic rhinitis is the correct term used to describe the allergic inflammation of the nasal passages. Rhinitis means ""inflammation of the nose"" and is a derivative of rhino, meaning nose. Allergic rhinitis that occurs during a specific season is called ""seasonal allergic rhinitis."" When it occurs throughout the year, it is called ""perennial allergic rhinitis."" Rhinosinusitis is the medical term that refers to inflammation of the nasal lining as well as the lining tissues of the sinuses. This term is sometimes used because the two conditions frequently occur together.''Symptoms of allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, frequently include''Postnasal dripping of clear mucus frequently causes a cough. Loss of the sense of smell is common, and loss of taste sense occurs occasionally. Nose bleeding may occur if the condition is severe. Eye itching, redness, and excess tears in the eyes frequently accompany the nasal symptoms. The eye symptoms are referred to as ""''allergic conjunctivitis''"" (inflammation of the whites of the eyes). These allergic symptoms often interfere with one\'s quality of life and overall health.''Many people with allergies have difficulty with social and physical activities. For example, concentration is often difficult while experiencing allergic rhinitis symptoms.' Headache due to pressure in partially or completely blocked sinuses. The pain may increase when the person bends down. Facial tenderness and/or swelling when facial areas over sinus areas are touched. Pressure or pain due to mucus pressing on sinus tissue or inflammation of sinuses. Fever due to inflammation of sinus tissues and infection. A cloudy, discolored nasal drainage is often seen in bacterial sinus infections. Congestion is a feeling of nasal stuffiness, and occurs with both infectious and non-infectious sinusitis. Post nasal drip is mucus overproduction from sinusitis that flows to the throat and irritates throat tissue. Sore throat is inflammation of throat tissue by post nasal drip. Cough is a response to post nasal drip and body's attempt to clear out throat tissue irritants. Tooth pain caused by pressure on surrounding nerves and tissues Ear pain caused by pressure on surrounding nerves and tissues Eye pain caused by pressure on surrounding nerves and tissues Fatigue due to fever, immune response and/or coughing Bad breath usually is due to bacterial infections Itching/sneezing - In noninfectious sinusitis, other associated allergy symptoms of itching eyes and sneezing may be common, but may include some of the symptoms listed above for infectious sinusitis. Nasal drainage usually is clear or whitish-colored in people with noninfectious sinusitis. Ulceration can occur with rare fulminant fungal infections with sharply defined edges and a black, necrotic center in the nasal area. Some fungal infections cause dark, black-appearing exudates. This requires immediate medical evaluation. Multiple chronic (over one to three months) symptoms usually are a sign of subacute or chronic sinusitis nasal congestion, a runny nose with clear mucus, sneezing, nose, eye itching, and excess tear production in the eyes."
What is the treatment for sinus infections and allergies?,"'Viral sinusitis''Antibiotics are not necessary for sinusitis caused by a virus. Frequently recommended treatments include pain and fever medications, for example:''Bacterial sinusitis''Bacterial infection of the sinuses is suspected when facial pain, nasal discharge resembling pus, and other symptoms last longer than a week, and are not responding to over-the-counter (OTC) nasal medications.''Acute sinus bacterial infection usually is treated with antibiotics aimed at treating the most common bacteria known to cause sinus infection. It is unusual to get a reliable culture without aspirating the sinuses.''The five most common bacteria causing sinus infections are:''Antibiotic treatment for sinus infections must be able to kill these five types of bacteria.''Amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'') is acceptable for uncomplicated acute sinus infections; however, many doctors prescribe\xa0''amoxicillin''-clavulanate (''Augmentin'') as the first-line antibiotic to treat\xa0 a possible bacterial infection of the sinuses. Amoxicillin usually is effective against most of the ''strains'' of bacteria.''Penicillin'' allergies and treatment for sinusitis''Other antibiotics may be used as a\xa0 first choice if you are allergic to penicillin, for example,'""If you don't improve after five days of taking the antibiotic, contact your doctor because he may want to switch antibiotics to one of the five listed above or amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin).""'Generally, an effective antibiotic needs to be continuously for a minimum of 10-14 days. However, it is not unusual to treat sinus infections for 14-21 days.''Some antibiotics now are thought to reduce inflammation, independent of the anitbacterial activity.''Avoidance of identified allergens is the most helpful factor in controlling allergy symptoms. Attempts to control the environment and avoidance measures often significantly aid in resolving symptoms. However, allergy avoidance is often not easy. A thorough discussion with your physician is needed, and control measures may be required daily.''If avoidance is not possible or does not relieve symptoms, additional treatment is needed. Many patients respond to medications that combat the effects of histamine, known as antihistamines. Antihistamines do not stop the formation of histamine, nor do they stop the conflict between the IgE and antigen. Therefore, antihistamines do not stop the allergic reaction but rather protect tissues from the effects of the allergic response.''The first-generation antihistamines, such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), brompheniramine (Dimetapp and others), ''clemastine'' fumarate (''Tavist'', Allerhist), and dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral) frequently cause mouth dryness and sleepiness as side effects.''Newer, so-called ""non-sedating"" or second-generation antihistamines are also available. These include ''loratadine'' (''Claritin''), ''fexofenadine'' (''Allegra''), ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec''), and ''azelastine'' (''Astelin'' Nasal Spray). In general, this group of antihistamines is slightly more expensive, has a slower onset of action, is longer acting, and induces less sleepiness. Many of these medications are available over the counter.''Discuss with a physician other ''antihistamine'' side effects that occasionally occur (for example, urine retention in males, fast ''heart'' rate, and others). Always discuss the potential side effects of any medication with a physician and/or pharmacist.''Decongestants help control allergy symptoms but not their causes. Decongestants shrink the swollen membranes in the nose and make it easier to breathe. Decongestants can be taken orally or by nasal spray. ''Decongestant'' nasal sprays should not be used for more than five days without a doctor\'s advice, and if so, usually only when accompanied by a nasal steroid. Decongestant nasal sprays often cause a so-called ""rebound effect"" if taken for too long. A rebound effect is the worsening of symptoms when a drug is discontinued. This is a result of a tissue dependence on the medication.''Some people with allergies need specialized prescription medications such as ''corticosteroids'', ''cromolyn'', and ipratropium (''Atrovent'') nasal sprays. These nasal sprays do not cause the rebound effect noticed with decongestant nasal sprays. Cortisone nasal sprays are very effective in reducing the inflammation that causes swelling, sneezing, and a runny nose. Cortisone can also decrease the formation of many chemicals involved in the allergic response. Many cortisone nasal sprays are on the market through prescription only. Intranasal steroids are typically the first-line medications for patients suffering from persistent allergies. Fluticasone (''Flonase'') is one medication available over the counter.''Cromolyn is also an anti-inflammatory medication available over the counter. Although cromolyn is not as potent as cortisone, it is very safe. Cromolyn must be used well in advance of anticipated allergy symptoms to be useful. Ipratropium (Atrovent) nasal spray is available for drying a wet runny nose. It will not prevent allergic reactions. This is an ''atropine'' derivative and although usually very safe, a person sensitive to atropine should be cautious when taking this drug.''Montelukast'' (''Singulair'') is an inhibitor of leukotriene action, another chemical involved in the allergic reaction. This medication is used for therapy of ''asthma'' and has also been approved for treatment of allergic rhinitis, but it is not a first-line therapy. It has been shown to be most effective in those for whom significant congestion is a primary complaint. It may also be used in some cases together with antihistamines.''If antihistamines and nasal sprays are not effective or not tolerated by the patient, other types of therapy are available. ''Allergy desensitization'' or immunotherapy may be needed. ''Allergy immunotherapy'' stimulates the immune system with gradually increasing doses of the substances to which a person is allergic. Because the patient is being exposed to the allergy-inducing substance, an allergic reaction can occur and this treatment should be supervised by a physician. Although the exact way allergy desensitization works is not completely known, allergy injections appear to modify or stop the allergic reaction by reducing the strength of the IgE and its effect on the mast cells. This form of treatment is very effective for allergies to pollen, mites, cats, and especially stinging insects (for example, bees). Allergy immunotherapy usually requires a series of injections (''allergy shots'') and takes three months to one year to become effective. The required length of treatment may vary, but three to five years is a typical course. Frequent office visits are necessary.''The duration of the effect of allergy immunotherapy should last many years, if not a lifetime. Although rare, serious allergy reactions can occur while receiving allergy injections. One cannot predict who will have a severe reaction. Even after years of receiving allergy shots, a patient can experience a reaction.' acetaminophen [Tylenol]) Decongestants and mucolytics disolves are medications that dissolve or breakdown mucous, for example, guaifenesin. Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pyogenes cefaclor (Ceclor) loracarbef (Lorabid) clarithromycin (Biaxin) azithromycin (Zithromax) sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol) trimethoprim (Bactrim, Septra) ciprofloxacin (Cipro) "
What is a cold? What is a sinus infection (sinusitis)?,"'A ''cold'' is a common viral infection of the nose and throat that causes inflammation, ''runny nose'', ''sneezing'', and a ''sore throat''. Some people also develop a ''fever''. ''Cold'' symptoms typically last about 7-11 days. Rhinoviruses are the most common of about 200 types of cold ''viruses''.''In contrast, although ''viruses'' cause most ''sinus infections'', a few (5%-10%) are complicated by bacterial or rarely ''fungal infections''. Infection of the paranasal sinuses and the nasal mucosa causes facial ''pain'' about 10 days after the onset of upper respiratory symptoms (similar to cold symptoms) and may last about 2-12 weeks (acute lasts about 2-4 weeks while subacute lasts about 4-12 weeks), with chronic ''sinusitis'' lasting 12 weeks or longer. Thus, the duration of a ''sinus infection'' is much longer than a cold.''Other terms for ''sinus infection'' are ''sinusitis'' and ''rhinosinusitis''.' "
What are the causes and risk factors for colds and sinus infections?,"'Viral infections are the most common cause for both colds and ''sinus infections''. Risk factors that can increase the chances of ''sinus infections'' include the ''common cold'', ''allergies'', ''allergic rhinitis'', ''nasal polyps'', or a ''deviated septum''; these may cause sinus blockage (inability to drain fluids from sinuses due to swollen sinuses and/or blockage with ''mucus'' and cell debris).' "
Are colds and sinus infections contagious?,"'Colds are very ''contagious'' and spread by direct contact and/or infected droplets spewed when ''coughing'' or ''sneezing''. A sinus infection caused by a virus is considered ''contagious'', but most researchers do not consider bacterial ''sinus infections'' contagious because they usually do not spread to other individuals.' "
What are the incubation periods for colds and sinus infections?,"'The incubation period for colds ranges from about 24-72 hours, while the incubation period for ''sinus infections'' is about 7-11 days after ''cold-like symptoms'' develop.' "
What are the contagious periods for colds and sinus infections?,'Sinus infections'' (note that only viral-caused sinus infections are contagious) shed contagious viruses for about a week before signs and symptoms of a sinus infection develop and may remain mildly contagious for weeks. Colds are highly contagious. Individuals become contagious about a day before symptoms develop and remain contagious for about 5-7 more days.' 
How do signs and symptoms of a cold differ from those of a sinus infection?,"'In the first few days of both diseases, symptoms and signs may be essentially the same and can include some or most of the following:''For colds, symptoms maximize in about 2-3 days and usually resolve in 7-11 days. For sinus infections, however, symptoms do not resolve after 7-11 days and additional symptoms occur, such as:'  Nasal irritation or dryness Sore throat Stuffy nose Nasal discharge/congestion Sneezing Cough Other less frequent symptoms likedecreased sense of smell and taste,watery eyes,hoarseness,vomiting after coughing,facial and ear pressure,irritability, andlow-grade fever. decreased sense of smell and taste, watery eyes, hoarseness, vomiting after coughing, facial and ear pressure, irritability, and low-grade fever. Sinus pressure behind the eyes or cheeks (sinus pain or facial pain) Facial pain when pressure is applied to the frontal sinus Thick green or yellow mucus production A blocked nose (sinus drainage area and nasal passages are clogged with mucus and cell debris) Redness of nose, cheeks, and/or eyelids Persistent coughing Bad breath Fatigue"
What tests do doctors use to tell a cold from a sinus infection?,"'Because the ''common cold'' is self-limiting and so many viral types can cause colds, doctors seldom use any tests to diagnose the disease. However, doctors may differentiate between the ''common cold'' and sinus infections by the patient history (duration of symptoms less than 10-14 days is unlikely a sinus infection). Sinus ''X-rays'' and/or CT of the sinuses may be useful to help diagnose sinus blockage, and bacterial testing may reveal a bacterial cause (rare) or a bacterial coinfection of the sinus infection.' "
What are medications and treatments for colds and sinus infections?,"'Treatment for colds is focused on relief of symptoms and preventing spread. Treatments include rest, hydration fluids, ''antihistamines'' like ''Benadryl'' or ''Claritin'', nasal decongestants like phenylephrine, anticholinergics like ''Atrovent'', ''NSAIDs'' like ''Aleve'' and ''Tylenol'', ''Robitussin'', possibly ''vitamin C'', and zinc (decreases symptoms in adults). Antibiotics are not necessary unless bacterial coinfection develops. These medications may also treat ''sinus infection symptoms''. However, in addition, people may use topical intranasal steroids, nasal sinus irrigation, mucus thinners, and antibiotics. Some individuals may require sinus puncture or surgery to remove thick secretions, obtain bacterial cultures, and provide surgical drainage and/or to remove obstructions to sinus drainage.' "
How does the prognosis and duration of a cold differ from that of a sinus infection?,"'The prognosis is usually excellent for self-limiting colds although they often may reoccur. Their duration is about 7-11 days. The prognosis of sinus infections may range from good to fair depending on how the infection progresses and/or responds to treatments. Although some acute sinus infections can even be self-limiting (about 40%), their duration is about 2-4 weeks, while subacute infections last about 4-12 weeks and chronic sinus infections last 12 weeks or more.' "
Is it possible to prevent colds and sinus infections?,"'Because both colds and many sinus infections start with a viral infection, avoiding close contact with individuals who are infected may reduce the risk of infections. Unfortunately, there are no ''vaccines'' against colds or sinus infections. A good ''diet'', ''exercise'', enough ''sleep'', good hand washing hygiene, and reducing ''stress'' are ways to help your immune system function well and decrease the risk of viral infections. Avoid ''smoking'', nasal irritants, and ''alcohol'' consumption. If you have a partial blockage of sinus drainage (for example, polyps or ''deviated septum''), consider having a doctor treat it.' "
What is endoscopic sinus surgery? Is it painful?,"'Traditional sinus surgery involves the precise removal of diseased and/or obstructing sinus tissue (nasal obstruction removal) with improvement in the natural drainage channels by the creation of a pathway for infected material to drain from the sinus ''cavities''. In most situations, the surgeon will employ endoscopic techniques that allow better and more precise visualization without the need for external incisions. As a result, there is less swelling, bleeding, and discomfort, and a faster recovery from sinus surgery. However, you should expect some nasal and sinus pressure and pain for several days after surgery. Endoscopic sinus surgery may have additional terms such as ""functional"" and ""bilateral"" attached -- functional means the surgery aims to return sinuses to normal while bilateral means that both right and left sinuses are involved.  ''Sinus surgery, unlike other types of surgery where a diseased part or organ is removed, involves the re-routing of existing sinus pathways in addition to removal of diseased tissue. ''It cannot be emphasized more strongly that post-operative care is as equally important as the surgery itself.'' One of the most common causes of failure of this procedure is poor post-operative care and follow-up. The doctor can only do so much. It is up to the patient to share in the responsibility of caring for this chronic illness. The following instructions are designed to help patients recover from sinus surgery as easily as possible and to prevent complications. It is very important that patients read these instructions or those provided by their surgeon and follow them carefully.''This information is provided to help people prepare for sinus surgery and to help them understand more clearly the associated beliefs, risks, and complications of sinus surgery. However, ask your doctor if you have questions to help you better understand the procedure.'  "
What do the sinuses look like (pictures)?, 
"What are the risks, side effects, and complications of sinus surgery?","""The following complications and risks of sinus surgery have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is here for patient information only - not to make patients overly concerned - but to make them aware and more knowledgeable concerning potential aspects of sinus surgery. The surgeon will review the risks and benefits of the surgery when obtaining consent for the operation and will be able to discuss the chance of these complications with respect to an individual's potential risks of surgery at that time."" Failure to resolve the sinus infections or recurrence of sinus problems and/or polyps. Bleeding. In very rare situations, a need for blood products or a blood transfusion may be required. Patients have the right, should they choose, to have autologous (using their own stored blood) or designated donor blood prepared in advance in case an emergency transfusion is necessary. Patients are encouraged to consult with their doctor regarding these issues if they are interested. 
	Chronic nasal drainage with excessive dryness or crusting of the nose (empty 
	nose syndrome). Need for further and more aggressive surgery. Need for allergy evaluation, treatments, or environmental controls. Surgery is not a cure for or a substitute for good allergy control or treatment. Failure to improve or resolve concurrent respiratory illness such as, but not limited to, asthma, bronchitis, or cough. Failure to resolve associated ""sinus or nasal"" headaches. The exact cause of headaches can be difficult to determine and may have many different causes that are not sinus-related. The patient or physician may require consultation with another specialist such as a neurologist. Damage to the eye and its associated structures. 
	Damage to the skull base with resultant meningitis, brain abscess, or 
	leakage of spinal fluid Secondary atrophic rhinitis Permanent numbness of the upper teeth, palate, or face. Nasal obstruction due to failure to control infection or polyps. Prolonged pain, impaired healing, and the need for hospitalization. Failure to restore or worsening of the sense of smell or taste."
What is empty nose syndrome?,"'Empty nose syndrome is a condition that may occur after facial ''trauma'' and/or sinus surgery (for example, ''septoplasty'', turbinate reduction or removal) that results in a sensation of being unable to breathe and/or having nasal blockage. The nose appears dry and crusty but drains constantly. The upper nasal mucosa swells and produces ''mucus'', but the turbinates function poorly to warm and humidify the air, if at all, resulting in a dry lower nose that drips constantly from the swollen upper nasal mucosa, often into the throat.' "
How do you prepare for sinus surgery? What happens before surgery?,"""In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either the hospital or a surgical center (surgicenter). In both facilities, quality care can be provided without the inconvenience of an overnight stay. An anesthesiologist will review the patient's medical history before surgery, and will monitor anesthesia of the patient throughout the procedure. If the doctor has ordered pre-operative laboratory studies, the patient should arrange to have these done several days in advance, and bring all lab results to the hospital the day of surgery for review.""'Arrange for someone to spend the first night after surgery with the patient, if possible in case the patient needs to remain overnight.''After surgery, the doctor will usually advise the patient to start using saline irrigation. There are many different ways to irrigate the sinuses; depending on the surgery that was performed, the surgeon will advise the patient on the best method for this to be done.''In general, patients that have sinus surgery should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days prior to the date of surgery. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''Advil'') should not be taken within 7 days of the date of surgery. Many ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or Advil-like ''drugs''. Therefore, it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question, call the doctors that prescribed the medications (surgeon, primary care physician, cardiologist or other specialists) or consult your pharmacist. Depending on the planned surgery, the surgeon may have the patient refrain from such medications for a longer period. ''Acetaminophen'' (Tylenol) is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Usually the surgeon will give prescriptions for post-surgery pain medications at the preoperative visit. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of surgery.''In most pre-operative preparations, patients must not eat or drink anything 8 hours prior to the time of surgery; the surgeon or hospital/surgical center will let the patient know the specific details regarding what time to stop eating and drinking. This includes even water, candy, or chewing gum. ''Smokers'' should make every effort to stop ''smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes as much in advance of surgery as possible. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding.''If a person is sick or has a fever the day before surgery, they should inform the surgeon. If a patient wakes up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. The surgeon and the anesthesiologist will decide if it is safe to proceed with surgery.' "
What happens on the day of sinus surgery?," It is important that patients know precisely what time they are to check-in with the surgical facility, and that they allow sufficient preparation time. Bring all papers and forms, including any preoperative orders and history sheets. Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes that do not have to be pulled over their head. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home, including earrings, watches, rings, etc. Remove all make-up with a cleansing cream. Patients should thoroughly wash their face with soap and water. Do not apply make-up or cream to the face. If possible, avoid using hair clips or other materials to hold up hair. Do not take any medication unless instructed by the doctor or the anesthesiologist. Usually, in the pre-operative holding room, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) and the patient may be given a medication to help them relax."
What happens during the sinus surgery procedure?,"'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a ''gas'' and an intravenous medication to put the patient to ''sleep'' and to maintain anesthesia at a safe and comfortable level. During the procedure, the patient will be continuously monitored. The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room. The whole procedure usually takes several hours. The surgeon will come to the waiting room to talk with any family or friends once the patient is safely in the recovery room.' "
What happens after sinus surgery (pictures)?,"""After surgery, the patient will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor the patient's vital signs. Usually, patients will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once they have fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. Patients will need a friend or family member to pick them up from the surgical facility. Someone (a responsible adult) should spend the first night after surgery with the patient in case any post-surgical problems develop.""'On arrival at home from the surgical facility, the patient should go to bed and rest with their head elevated on two to three pillows. By keeping the head elevated above the ''heart'', ''edema'' and swelling from the sinus surgery can be minimized. Patients may get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom but should avoid straining with bowel movements because this may cause some surgical site bleeding. If the person is constipated, they should take a ''stool softener'' or a gentle ''laxative''.''Some patients may have noticeable swelling of the nose, upper lip, cheeks, or around the eyes for several days after surgery. This swelling is normal and will gradually go away. People can help reduce it by putting an ice pack on the face, ''bridge'' of the nose, and eyes as much as tolerated. This will also help with postoperative edema and pain. Some patients have found frozen vegetables in packages (for example ''bags'' of frozen peas) to be a convenient ice pack which nicely conforms to the face. The frozen material should be separated from the skin by a towel or similar barrier to avoid any skin damage. Many clinicians suggest periods of 15 minutes of such ice-pack treatment followed by 15 minutes of removal to not damage the skin.''Moderate bleeding from the nose is normal and will gradually decrease. The gauze dressing (""mustache dressing"") will collect blood and should be changed as needed. It is not unusual to change these dressings every hour during the first 24 hours after surgery. It is recommended to purchase gauze pads prior to surgery so that the patient will have enough for dressing changes. After a few days the patient will probably not need to use the dressing any longer. Do not take aspirin, aspirin-containing medications, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen''/Advil, ''Naprosyn'', and others) for as long as the surgeon has instructed following surgery, because such medications may increase bleeding and slow clotting at the surgical site.''It is best to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated once the patient has recovered fully from the anesthetic. Avoid hot liquids for several days. Even though people may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to go slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, patients may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery. If ''vomiting'' persists, please contact the surgeon; the doctor may prescribe medication to reduce or eliminate vomiting. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''Patients may be prescribed antibiotics after surgery and should finish all the pills that have been ordered. Some form of a narcotic may also be prescribed and is to be taken as needed for pain. If the patient requires narcotics, they should not drive and should consider having a responsible person stay with them. In some situations, the doctor may give steroids to be taken either before and or after surgery. Take this medication as prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. The steroids are instrumental in facilitating proper healing. If patients have any questions or they feel that they are developing a reaction to any of these medications, he or she should consult their doctor immediately. Patients should not take any other medication, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless they have discussed it with the doctor.' "
How long does it take to recovery from sinus surgery?,"'How long it takes for recovery depends on the extent of the surgery. Recovery may take a few days. It may take up to 3 to 5 days to feel completely back to normal. Patients should refrain from activities that increase heart rate or ''blood pressure'' such as ''running'', exercising, ''weight lifting'', or other similar activities. It is imperative to obtain guidance from the surgeon as to when they may resume all normal activities. Until this time, patients should rest and limit physical exertion to improve recovery.'  "
What are the general instructions and follow-up care after sinus surgery?,"""In many cases, packs or nasal packing is placed in the nose to control postoperative bleeding. The surgeon will tell the patient when to return to the office to have these packs removed. Patients may need to call the office to schedule this postoperative appointment. Please arrange for someone to drive the patient to and from the office for this first visit in case any complications (for example, additional bleeding) develop. Patients should eat a light meal before coming and avoid taking excessive pain medications. In addition, most patients will also have several subsequent office visits scheduled to assess healing, remove crusts, and insure a speedy recovery. These visits are very important as the surgeon may use the endoscope (camera to look in the nose) to clean up the sinuses and perform further debridement if necessary. This post-operative surveillance by the surgeon is very crucial in the individual's long-term success with the surgery.""""After the packing has been removed, individuals may breathe through their nose, but should not blow or sneeze through it for 7 to 10 days to reduce the chance of bleeding. If a person must sneeze, they should try to sneeze through an open mouth. Many surgeons tell patients to expect some light blood-tinged drainage from the nose for several days. If bleeding becomes excessive, apply an ice pack (described previously) and rest quietly with head elevated while applying mild to moderate pressure to the nose. If bleeding continues, call the doctor's office.""'One of the most important things patients can do after surgery (post-op care) is nasal irrigation. Immediately after the nasal packs are removed patients should use a saline nasal spray such as ""Ocean Spray"" several times per day to prevent crusting and nasal dryness from forming in the nose. The surgeon will tell patients when to discontinue the nasal spray and will let them know the best way to irrigate the sinuses.''Patients should go back to work or school only when the doctor says you can and should plan on resting for several days following surgery. Avoid excessive talking, smiling, hard chewing, strenuous activities, and lifting heavy objects, bumping the nose, and bending over. Try not to rest ''eyeglasses'' on the bridge of the nose until soreness and swelling subside. People may wear ''contact lenses'' once eye swelling and any eye irritation has resolved. Alcohol and tobacco should be avoided because they may prolong swelling and healing. Smoke, dust, and fumes may irritate the nose and cause an infection. In general, people may use usual make-up any time after surgery, as long as the structures (for example, eyelids) with make-up are relatively normal and are not irritated by the application of make-up. Be gentle while brushing the upper ''teeth''. They will often be tender for several weeks, and some people may have some numbness of the teeth and palate for several months.''Patients should plan to remain in the general area where the surgery was performed for 3 weeks to allow for postoperative care and in case bleeding occurs, the patient can be seen by the surgeon that did the procedure and who should best be able to treat the patient.' "
What natural home remedies should you use after sinus surgery?,"'It is important for all patients with chronic sinus disease to understand that they have a chronic illness. Successful sinus surgery will only help control the complications and discomfort of chronic sinus disease. The following three areas of prevention should always be remembered:' Maximize 
	moisture. Patients should always remember to maximize moisture in their nose. Keeping sinuses moist makes mucus thinner, allowing the sinuses to drain better. This drainage in turn helps prevent infection. Use a humidifier, drink plenty of water, avoid drying substances such as alcohol and caffeine, try to avoid smoke, which dries out sinus linings, and use plenty of saline irrigation. Avoid 
	allergy particles (allergens). People may want to wear a mask when they clean or are exposed to dust. Sit in the non-smoking sections of restaurants. Avoid exposure to pollens during peak season and keep an air-conditioner on during allergy season. Prevent 
	colds. Avoid exposure to colds and flu whenever possible; obtain a yearly flu vaccination."
When should you call your surgeon for complications following endoscopic sinus surgery?," A sudden increase in the amount of bleeding from the nose unrelieved by pressure, ice, and head elevation. A fever greater than 101.5 F (38.6 C) that persists despite increasing the amount of fluid intake and acetaminophen (Tylenol) use. Persistent sharp pain or headache that is not relieved by the prescribed pain medication. Increased swelling or redness of the nose or eyes. Drainage of a thin, clear fluid in large quantities from usually only one side of the nose. This would be different from the clear, thicker mucus drainage normally produced by the nose."
What are the sinuses? How many do we have?,"'A sinus is a hollow, air-filled ''cavity''. For the purposes of this article, a sinus will refer to those hollow ''cavities'' that are in the skull and connected to the nasal ''airway'' by a narrow hole in the bone (ostium). Normally all sinuses are open to the nasal airway through an ostium. Humans have four pair of these cavities each referred to as the:''The four pair of sinuses are often described as a unit and termed the ""paranasal sinuses."" The cells of the inner lining of each sinus are ''mucus''-secreting cells, epithelial cells and some cells that are part of the immune system (macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils).''Functions of the sinuses include humidifying and warming inspired air, insulation of surrounding structures (eyes, nerves), increasing voice resonance, and as buffers against facial ''trauma''. The sinuses decrease the weight of the skull. If the inflammation hinders the clearance of mucous or blocks the natural ostium, the inflammation may progress into a bacterial infection.' frontal sinus (in forehead), maxillary sinus (behind cheeks), ethmoid sinuses (between the eyes), and sphenoid sinus (deep behind the ethmoids)."
18 signs and symptoms of sinus infection or sinusitis,"'There are many signs and symptoms of sinusitis and sinus infections. The following is a summary of predominant ones (18 total) that may occur. Most patients have several signs and symptoms at the same time. Others may have some symptoms that are intermittent; most do not have all symptoms at once. The signs and symptoms of a sinus infection or sinusitis include the following:''Further information on chronic and acute ''sinus infection symptoms'', please visit ''eMedicineHealth.com sinus infection.'   Headache due to pressure in partially or completely blocked sinuses. The pain may increase when the person bends down. Facial tenderness and/or swelling when facial areas over sinus areas are touched. Pressure or pain due to mucus pressing on sinus tissue or inflammation of sinuses. Fever due to inflammation of sinus tissues and infection. A cloudy, discolored nasal drainage is often seen in bacterial sinus infections. Congestion is a feeling of nasal stuffiness, and occurs with both infectious and non-infectious sinusitis. Post nasal drip is mucus overproduction from sinusitis that flows to the throat and irritates throat tissue. Sore throat is inflammation of throat tissue by post nasal drip. Cough is a response to post nasal drip and body's attempt to clear out throat tissue irritants. Tooth pain caused by pressure on surrounding nerves and tissues Ear pain caused by pressure on surrounding nerves and tissues Eye pain caused by pressure on surrounding nerves and tissues Fatigue due to fever, immune response and/or coughing Bad breath usually is due to bacterial infections Itching/sneezing - In noninfectious sinusitis, other associated allergy symptoms of itching eyes and sneezing may be common, but may include some of the symptoms listed above for infectious sinusitis. Nasal drainage usually is clear or whitish-colored in people with noninfectious sinusitis. Ulceration can occur with rare fulminant fungal infections with sharply defined edges and a black, necrotic center in the nasal area. Some fungal infections cause dark, black-appearing exudates. This requires immediate medical evaluation. Multiple chronic (over one to three months) symptoms usually are a sign of subacute or chronic sinusitis"
What is a sinus infection or sinusitis?,"'Inflammation of the air cavities within the passages of the nose (paranasal sinuses) is referred to as sinusitis. Sinusitis can be caused by infection (sinus infection), but also can be caused by ''allergy'' and chemical irritation of the sinuses. A sinus infection (infectious sinusitis) occurs when a virus, bacterium, or a fungus grows within a sinus.''Sinusitis is one of the more common conditions that can afflict people throughout their lives. Sinusitis commonly occurs when environmental pollens irritate the nasal passages, such as with ''hay fever''. Sinusitis can also result from irritants, such as chemicals or the use and/or abuse of over-the-counter (OTC) nasal sprays, and illegal substances that may be snorted or inhaled through the nose. About 30 million adults have ""sinusitis."" Colds differ from sinusitis and are only caused by ''viruses'' and last about seven to 10 days while sinusitis may have many different causes (infectious and non-infectious), and usually last longer with more pronounced and variable symptoms.' "
What causes sinus infections or sinusitis?,"'Sinus infections or sinusitis may be caused by anything that interferes with airflow into the sinuses and the drainage of mucus out of the sinuses. The sinus openings (ostea) may be blocked by swelling of the tissue lining and adjacent nasal passage tissue, for example with''Tumors or growths also can block the sinuses if they are near the sinus openings.''Dehydration'', disease, drying medications, and lack of sufficient humidity can cause sinusitis or sinus infection.The drainage of mucous from the sinuses can also be impaired by thickening of the mucous secretions, by decrease in hydration (water content) of the mucous brought on by disease (for example, ''cystic fibrosis''), drying medications (''antihistamines''), and lack of sufficient humidity in the air. The epithelial cells have small hair-like fibers, called cilia, which move back and forth to help the mucus move out of the sinuses. These small cilia may be damaged by many irritants, especially smoke. This can prevent them from assisting the mucus in draining from the sinuses, and thus results in sinus infections or sinusitis.''Stagnated mucus provides an environment for bacteria, viruses and in some circumstances, (for example, ''AIDS'' or immunodepressed people) fungus, to grow within the sinus cavities. In addition, the microbes themselves can initiate and exacerbate sinus blockage. The most commonly infected sinuses are the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.''Rarely, immunodepressed or victims of multiple traumas in disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, or tornadoes may breathe in fungi from the soil or water. Eventually, in a few days to over a week, the fungi can grow and cut off blood supply to almost any type of tissue, especially in the nose and eyes. These infections, although rare, are serious and can be deadly and require immediate medical and surgical care. Although the fungal infection may resemble common bacterial sinusitis initially, it is a disease termed zygomycosis or ''mucormycosis''.'   common colds, allergies, and tissue irritants such as OTC nasal sprays, cocaine, and cigarette smoke."
What are the types of sinusitis and sinus infections?,"'Sinusitis may be classified in several ways, based on its duration (acute, subacute, or chronic) and the type of inflammation (either infectious or noninfectious). The term rhinosinusitis is used to imply that both the nose and sinuses are involved an is becoming the preferred term over sinusitis.''There is no medical consensus on the above time periods.' Acute sinus infection (acute sinusitis or acute bacterial rhinosinusitis) usually lasts less than 3-5 days. Subacute sinus infection lasts one to three months. Chronic sinus infection greater than three months. Chronic sinusitis may be further sub-classified into chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps, or allergic fungal sinusitis. Recurrent sinusitis has several sinusitis attacks every year. Infected sinusitis usually is caused by uncomplicated virus infection. Less frequently, bacterial growth causes sinus infection and fungal sinus infection is very infrequent. Subacute and chronic forms of sinus infection usually are the result of incomplete treatment of an acute sinus infection. Noninfectious sinusitis is caused by irritants and allergic conditions and follows the same general time line for acute, subacute and chronic as infectious sinusitis."
What tests diagnose the cause of sinus infections and sinusitis?,"'Sinus infection is most often diagnosed based on the history and examination of a doctor. Because plain X-ray studies of the sinuses may be misleading and procedures such as CT and ''MRI'"" scans, which are much more sensitive in their ability to diagnose sinus infection, are so expensive and not available in most doctors' offices, most sinus infections are initially diagnosed and treated based on clinical findings on examination. These physical findings may include:""'Occasionally, nasal secretions are examined for secreted cells that may help differentiate between infectious and allergic sinusitis. Infectious sinusitis may show specialized cells of infection (polymorphonuclear cells) while allergic sinusitis may show specialized white blood cells of ''allergy'' (eosinophils). Physicians prescribe antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections; many physicians then treat the symptoms.''If sinus infection fails to respond to the initial treatment prescribed, then more in-depth studies such as CT or MRI scans may be performed. ''Ultrasound'' has been used to diagnose sinus infections in ''pregnant'' women, but is not as accurate as CT or MRI. Rhinoscopy or ''endoscopy'', a procedure for directly looking in the back of the nasal passages with a small flexible fiberoptic tube, may be used to directly look at the sinus openings and check for blockage of these openings by either swelling or growths.''It may sometimes be necessary to perform a needle aspiration (needle puncture) of a sinus to get infected material to culture to determine what microbe is actually causing the sinus infection. Cultures of the nasal passages are rarely helpful in determining what bacteria or fungus is causing a sinus infection since the nasal passages are often normally colonized by non-infecting bacteria. The needle puncture procedure is usually done by an otolaryngologist when treatments have failed to alleviate the disease. The procedure requires local anesthesia to minimize any discomfort; some patients require general anesthesia. The sinus is aspirated, the contents sent for culture and staining, and the sinus may be flushed with a saline solution. This is technically the most accurate way to diagnose infectious sinusitis.''In addition, both rigid and flexible endoscopy has been used to obtain diagnostic material from sinuses. These procedures are usually done by an otolaryngologist under topical and local anesthesia. Occasionally, there may be a need to sedate the patient. Some investigators suggest that endoscopy specimens are comparable to those obtained by needle puncture.''Fungal infections are usually diagnosed by such biopsy procedures and tissue removed by a surgeon, or by fungal culture and microscopic identification by a microbiologist or pathologist trained to identify fungi. Allergic fungal sinusitis (emphasis on allergic) is an inflammatory response to fungal elements in the sinus ''cavity'' and is suspected based on certain CT imaging characteristics as well as the history and physical exam.' redness and swelling of the nasal passages, purulent (pus like) drainage from the nasal passages (the symptom most likely to clinically diagnose a sinus infection), tenderness to percussion (tapping) over the cheeks or forehead region of the sinuses, and swelling about the eyes and cheeks."
Which types of doctors treat sinusitis and sinus infections?,"'Many sinus infections can be treated by your primary care physician or an Internal Medicine doctor. However, it is not unusual to consult an ENT (Eye, Ears, Nose, and Throat) specialist, Infectious disease specialist, Allergist or Immunologist. With some complex sinus infections, a surgeon who specializes in ''sinus surgery'' may be necessary to consult.' "
What antibiotics and drugs treat and cure sinus infections and sinusitis (list)?,"'Antibiotics are not necessary for sinusitis caused by a virus. Frequently recommended treatments include pain and fever medications, for example:''Bacterial infection of the sinuses is suspected when facial pain, nasal discharge resembling pus, and other symptoms last longer than a week, and are not responding to over-the-counter (OTC) nasal medications.''Acute sinus bacterial infection usually is treated with antibiotics aimed at treating the most common bacteria known to cause sinus infection. It is unusual to get a reliable culture without aspirating the sinuses.''The five most common bacteria causing sinus infections are:''Antibiotic treatment for sinus infections must be able to kill these five types of bacteria.''Amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'') is acceptable for uncomplicated acute sinus infections; however, many doctors prescribe\xa0''amoxicillin''-clavulanate (''Augmentin'') as the first-line antibiotic to treat\xa0 a possible bacterial infection of the sinuses.

What decongestants and nasal sprays soothe or cure sinus infections or sinusitis?,"'Taking decongestants (pseudoephedrine) and mucolytics (guaifenesin) orally may be helpful in assisting drainage of sinus infection.''The treatment of chronic forms of sinus infection requires longer courses of medications, such as Augmentin, and may require a sinus drainage procedure. This drainage typically requires a surgical operation to open the blocked sinus under general anesthesia. In general, antihistamines should be avoided unless it is felt that the sinusitis sinus infection is due to ''allergy'', such as from pollens, dander, or other environmental causes.''It is likely that the use of a topical nasal steroid spray will help reduce swelling in the allergic individual without the drying that is caused by using antihistamines although both are occasionally used.Oral steroids may be prescribed to reduce acute inflammation and to help with chronic inflammation in cases with or without polyps and in allergic fungal sinusitis.''In many people, allergic sinusitis develops first, and later, bacterial infection occurs. For these individuals, early treatment of allergic sinusitis may prevent development of secondary bacterial sinusitis.''In rare instances or in natural disasters, fungal infections (termed zygomycosis or mucormycosis) may develop in debilitated people. Death rates of 50%-85% have been reported for patients with these sinus infections. Treatment relies on early diagnosis followed by immediate surgical debridement, antifungal ''drugs'', (mainly Amphotericin B) and stabilizing any underlying health problem such as ''diabetes''.' "
What home remedies help soothe sinus infection or sinusitis symptoms?,"'Sinus infections caused by viruses can use home (over-the-counter, OTC) treatments such as pain and fever medications (acetaminophen [Tylenol]), decongestants, and mucolytics. In addition, some health care professionals suggest nasal irrigation or a sinus rinse solution to help relieve symptoms of sinus infections, even chronic sinusitis symptoms. This irrigation is accomplished with a ""Neti-Pot"" or a sinus rinse kit (sometimes termed a nasal bidet). The last reference of this article shows a video of a sinus rinse procedure. In 2012, the FDA issued a warning about the use of Neti-Pots. The FDA cautions people not to use untreated tap water for rinsing, as contaminated tap water rinses lead to two deaths.''Bacterial and fungal sinus infections usually require antibiotic or antifungal therapy so home treatments without them are often not successful. However, some authors suggest home treatments may reduce symptoms after medical therapy has begun; some health-care professionals recommend nasal irrigation after sinus surgery.'  "
What are complications of sinus infection or sinusitis?,"'While serious complications do not occur frequently, it is possible for sinus infection to cause a direct extension of infection into the brain through a sinus wall, creating a life-threatening emergency (for example, meningitis or brain abscess). In addition, other adjacent structures can become infected and develop problems, such as osteomyelitis of bones in the skull and infection around the eye (orbital cellulitis). Rarely, these infections (mainly bacterial and fungal organisms) may cause death. The most susceptible individuals to complications are patients with suppressed immune systems, ''diabetes'', and relatively rarely from multiple trauma injuries that may occur in natural disasters.'  "
Can sinus infections or sinusitis be prevented?,"'Currently, there are no ''vaccines'' designed specifically against infectious sinusitis or sinus infections. However, there are ''vaccines'' against viruses (''influenza'') and bacteria (pneumococci) that may cause some infectious sinusitis. Vaccination against pathogens known to cause infectious sinusitis may indirectly reduce or prevent the chance of getting the disease; however, no specific studies support this assumption. Fungal vaccines against sinusitis are not available, currently.''If you are prone to recurrent bouts of a ""yearly sinus infection"" it may be important to consider allergy testing to see if this is the underlying cause of the recurring problem. Treatment of the allergy may prevent secondary bacterial sinus infections.

Noninfectious sinusitis is caused by irritants and allergic conditions and follows the same general time line for acute, subacute and chronic as infectious sinusitis."
What tests diagnose the cause of sinus infections and sinusitis?,"'Sinus infection is most often diagnosed based on the history and examination of a doctor. Because plain X-ray studies of the sinuses may be misleading and procedures such as CT and ''MRI'"" scans, which are much more sensitive in their ability to diagnose sinus infection, are so expensive and not available in most doctors' offices, most sinus infections are initially diagnosed and treated based on clinical findings on examination. These physical findings may include:""'Occasionally, nasal secretions are examined for secreted cells that may help differentiate between infectious and allergic sinusitis. Infectious sinusitis may show specialized cells of infection (polymorphonuclear cells) while allergic sinusitis may show specialized white blood cells of ''allergy'' (eosinophils). Physicians prescribe antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections; many physicians then treat the symptoms.''If sinus infection fails to respond to the initial treatment prescribed, then more in-depth studies such as CT or MRI scans may be performed. ''Ultrasound'' has been used to diagnose sinus infections in ''pregnant'' women, but is not as accurate as CT or MRI. Rhinoscopy or ''endoscopy'', a procedure for directly looking in the back of the nasal passages with a small flexible fiberoptic tube, may be used to directly look at the sinus openings and check for blockage of these openings by either swelling or growths.''It may sometimes be necessary to perform a needle aspiration (needle puncture) of a sinus to get infected material to culture to determine what microbe is actually causing the sinus infection. Cultures of the nasal passages are rarely helpful in determining what bacteria or fungus is causing a sinus infection since the nasal passages are often normally colonized by non-infecting bacteria. The needle puncture procedure is usually done by an otolaryngologist when treatments have failed to alleviate the disease. The procedure requires local anesthesia to minimize any discomfort; some patients require general anesthesia. The sinus is aspirated, the contents sent for culture and staining, and the sinus may be flushed with a saline solution. This is technically the most accurate way to diagnose infectious sinusitis.''In addition, both rigid and flexible endoscopy has been used to obtain diagnostic material from sinuses. These procedures are usually done by an otolaryngologist under topical and local anesthesia. Occasionally, there may be a need to sedate the patient. Some investigators suggest that endoscopy specimens are comparable to those obtained by needle puncture.''Fungal infections are usually diagnosed by such biopsy procedures and tissue removed by a surgeon, or by fungal culture and microscopic identification by a microbiologist or pathologist trained to identify fungi. Allergic fungal sinusitis (emphasis on allergic) is an inflammatory response to fungal elements in the sinus ''cavity'' and is suspected based on certain CT imaging characteristics as well as the history and physical exam.' redness and swelling of the nasal passages, purulent (pus like) drainage from the nasal passages (the symptom most likely to clinically diagnose a sinus infection), tenderness to percussion (tapping) over the cheeks or forehead region of the sinuses, and swelling about the eyes and cheeks."
Which types of doctors treat sinusitis and sinus infections?,"'Many sinus infections can be treated by your primary care physician or an Internal Medicine doctor. However, it is not unusual to consult an ENT (Eye, Ears, Nose, and Throat) specialist, Infectious disease specialist, Allergist or Immunologist. With some complex sinus infections, a surgeon who specializes in ''sinus surgery'' may be necessary to consult.' "
What antibiotics and drugs treat and cure sinus infections and sinusitis (list)?,"'Antibiotics are not necessary for sinusitis caused by a virus. Frequently recommended treatments include pain and fever medications, for example:''Bacterial infection of the sinuses is suspected when facial pain, nasal discharge resembling pus, and other symptoms last longer than a week, and are not responding to over-the-counter (OTC) nasal medications.''Acute sinus bacterial infection usually is treated with antibiotics aimed at treating the most common bacteria known to cause sinus infection. It is unusual to get a reliable culture without aspirating the sinuses.''The five most common bacteria causing sinus infections are:''Antibiotic treatment for sinus infections must be able to kill these five types of bacteria.''Amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'') is acceptable for uncomplicated acute sinus infections; however, many doctors prescribe\xa0''amoxicillin''-clavulanate (''Augmentin'') as the first-line antibiotic to treat\xa0 a possible bacterial infection of the sinuses. Amoxicillin usually is effective against most of the ''strains'' of bacteria.''Other antibiotics may be used as a\xa0 first choice if you are allergic to ''penicillin'', for example,'""If you don't improve after five days of taking the antibiotic, contact your doctor because he may want to switch antibiotics to one of the five listed above or amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin).""'Generally, an effective antibiotic needs to be continuously for a minimum of 10-14 days. However, it is not unusual to treat sinus infections for 14-21 days.''Some antibiotics now are thought to reduce inflammation, independent of the anitbacterial activity.'   acetaminophen [Tylenol]) Decongestants and mucolytics disolves are medications that dissolve or breakdown mucous, for example, guaifenesin. Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pyogenes cefaclor (Ceclor) loracarbef (Lorabid) clarithromycin (Biaxin) azithromycin (Zithromax) sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol) trimethoprim (Bactrim, Septra) ciprofloxacin (Cipro) "
What decongestants and nasal sprays soothe or cure sinus infections or sinusitis?,"'Taking decongestants (pseudoephedrine) and mucolytics (guaifenesin) orally may be helpful in assisting drainage of sinus infection.''The treatment of chronic forms of sinus infection requires longer courses of medications, such as Augmentin, and may require a sinus drainage procedure. This drainage typically requires a surgical operation to open the blocked sinus under general anesthesia. In general, antihistamines should be avoided unless it is felt that the sinusitis sinus infection is due to ''allergy'', such as from pollens, dander, or other environmental causes.''It is likely that the use of a topical nasal steroid spray will help reduce swelling in the allergic individual without the drying that is caused by using antihistamines although both are occasionally used.Oral steroids may be prescribed to reduce acute inflammation and to help with chronic inflammation in cases with or without polyps and in allergic fungal sinusitis.''In many people, allergic sinusitis develops first, and later, bacterial infection occurs. For these individuals, early treatment of allergic sinusitis may prevent development of secondary bacterial sinusitis.''In rare instances or in natural disasters, fungal infections (termed zygomycosis or mucormycosis) may develop in debilitated people. Death rates of 50%-85% have been reported for patients with these sinus infections. Treatment relies on early diagnosis followed by immediate surgical debridement, antifungal ''drugs'', (mainly Amphotericin B) and stabilizing any underlying health problem such as ''diabetes''.' "
What home remedies help soothe sinus infection or sinusitis symptoms?,"'Sinus infections caused by viruses can use home (over-the-counter, OTC) treatments such as pain and fever medications (acetaminophen [Tylenol]), decongestants, and mucolytics. In addition, some health care professionals suggest nasal irrigation or a sinus rinse solution to help relieve symptoms of sinus infections, even chronic sinusitis symptoms. This irrigation is accomplished with a ""Neti-Pot"" or a sinus rinse kit (sometimes termed a nasal bidet). The last reference of this article shows a video of a sinus rinse procedure. In 2012, the FDA issued a warning about the use of Neti-Pots. The FDA cautions people not to use untreated tap water for rinsing, as contaminated tap water rinses lead to two deaths.''Bacterial and fungal sinus infections usually require antibiotic or antifungal therapy so home treatments without them are often not successful. However, some authors suggest home treatments may reduce symptoms after medical therapy has begun; some health-care professionals recommend nasal irrigation after sinus surgery.'  "
What are complications of sinus infection or sinusitis?,"'While serious complications do not occur frequently, it is possible for sinus infection to cause a direct extension of infection into the brain through a sinus wall, creating a life-threatening emergency (for example, meningitis or brain abscess). In addition, other adjacent structures can become infected and develop problems, such as osteomyelitis of bones in the skull and infection around the eye (orbital cellulitis). Rarely, these infections (mainly bacterial and fungal organisms) may cause death. The most susceptible individuals to complications are patients with suppressed immune systems, ''diabetes'', and relatively rarely from multiple trauma injuries that may occur in natural disasters.'  "
Can sinus infections or sinusitis be prevented?,"'Currently, there are no ''vaccines'' designed specifically against infectious sinusitis or sinus infections. However, there are ''vaccines'' against viruses (''influenza'') and bacteria (pneumococci) that may cause some infectious sinusitis. Vaccination against pathogens known to cause infectious sinusitis may indirectly reduce or prevent the chance of getting the disease; however, no specific studies support this assumption. Fungal vaccines against sinusitis are not available, currently.''If you are prone to recurrent bouts of a ""yearly sinus infection"" it may be important to consider allergy testing to see if this is the underlying cause of the recurring problem. Treatment of the allergy may prevent secondary bacterial sinus infections. In addition, sinus infections may be due to other problems such as nasal polyps, tumors or diseases that obstruct normal mucus flow. Treatment of these underlying causes may prevent recurrent sinus infections.' "
What are the early signs of lung cancer?,"'Lung cancer'' is the third most common ''cancer'' in the United States. It may not show its signs and symptoms in its early stages. Signs and symptoms typically appear in the advanced stage of the disease.''When people experience signs and ''symptoms of lung cancer'', the early ones may include any of the following:''When ''lung cancer'' progresses to the later stages, other signs and symptoms develop like:' A new cough that persists for several weeks and goes on worsening Hemoptysis (coughing up blood or specs of blood) Persistent shortness of breath Chest pain Hoarseness of voice Recurrent chest infections (such as pneumonia) Unintended weight loss Loss of appetite Fatigue Bone pain Dizziness Headache"
Is there any screening test for lung cancer?,'Screening test for a particular disease means testing when there are no complaints or history of that disease.''People with an increased risk of lung ''cancer'' may ask their doctor if they can go for annual lung ''cancer screening''. The screening test typically includes a low dose computed tomography (CT) scan.''Doctors can offer lung ''cancer'' screening test to you if:''Ask your doctor whether you are at a high risk of getting cancer. Your doctor can work with you to decide if a screening test is right for you.' You are a chronic smoker or have smoked heavily in the past You are between 55 and 80 years of age You have quit smoking in the past 15 years You have a family history of cancers
What puts you at an increased risk for lung cancer?,"'The things that put you at risk for lung cancer are known as risk factors. You can reduce your risk for lung cancer by making lifestyle changes (such as quitting ''smoking''). However, you cannot do much if you have a family history of lung cancer.''The most common risk factors for lung cancer include:''Other risk factors include:' Smoking: Higher the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and the number of years you have smoked, the higher is the risk of lung cancer. Second-hand smoking: Exposure to second-hand smoking increases your risk of getting lung cancer by 20-30%. Previous radiation therapy Exposure to radon gas Exposure to asbestos and other carcinogens (such as arsenic, chromium, and nickel) Family history of lung cancer"
What tests are used to diagnose lung cancer?,"'If your doctor suspects that you may have lung cancer, they can order a variety of tests to look for the cancerous changes and to rule out other conditions.''The various tests that help diagnose cancer are:' Imaging tests: Imaging tests, such as x-rays of your chest, can show an abnormal mass suspicious of lung cancer. Other ones like computed tomography (CT) scans may show much smaller masses that the X-rays might have failed to show. Sputum cytology: Your doctor may order a sputum test in which your sputum will be examined under a microscope to look for the presence of cancerous cells. Biopsy: This is a minor surgical procedure in which a sample of abnormal cells is removed. This can be done in any of the various ways:Bronchoscopy (a long lighted tube is passed down your throat and into your lungs)Mediastinoscopy (an incision is made at the base of your neck and surgical tools are inserted to take tissue samples from lymph nodes)Needle biopsy (use of X-ray or CT images to guide a needle through your chest wall and into the lung tissue to collect tissue samples) Bronchoscopy (a long lighted tube is passed down your throat and into your lungs) Mediastinoscopy (an incision is made at the base of your neck and surgical tools are inserted to take tissue samples from lymph nodes) Needle biopsy (use of X-ray or CT images to guide a needle through your chest wall and into the lung tissue to collect tissue samples)"
How can you prevent lung cancer?,"'There is no sure way that you can use to prevent lung cancer. However, you can help lower your risk if you:''Other changes like eating plenty of fruits and vegetables daily and staying physically active most days of the week will help you remain healthy for the longer term. This may help you stay protected not only from lung cancer but also from all other types of cancer.' Quit smoking Avoid second-hand smoke Test your home for radon Protect yourself from exposure to toxic chemicals at work"
What is roseola? Is roseola contagious?,"   Roseola is a mild contagious illness caused by either one of two viruses. Characteristically, roseola has a sudden onset and relatively short duration. Roseola is most common in children 6-24 months of age, with the average age of 9 months. Less frequently, older children, teens, and (rarely) adults may be infected."
What virus causes roseola?,'Roseola is primarily caused by a virus called human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and less frequently by human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7).' 
What are the risk factors for roseola?,"'Many studies have shown that the large majority of those infected with the HHV-6 or HHV-7 virus have no obvious symptoms. Their immune system clears the virus prior to the development of any symptoms. For those individuals who do develop an overt infection, the vast majority sustain no side effects. The rare individual with a compromised immune system may be at risk for a more complicated course of disease. This would include ''newborn'' infants (first six to eight weeks of life), individuals receiving ''chemotherapy'', or those with illness that impacts the immune system (such as ''HIV''-''AIDS'').' "
How does roseola spread? What is the incubation period for roseola?," Roseola is spread from person to person, typically by transfer of oral secretions. The incubation period between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms is nine to 10 days. Humans are the only natural hosts for HHV-6 and HHV-7. Unlike some other viral infections, roseola occurs throughout the year without seasonal variation."
What are roseola symptoms and signs?,"'The signs and symptoms of HHV-6 (or HHV-7) infection vary depending upon the age of the patient.'   Infants and toddlers routinely develop sudden symptoms with an abrupt onset of a high fever (103-104 degrees) that lasts for 3-5 days. The child may also develop irritability, swollen glands in the front or back of the neck, runny nose, puffy eyelids, and mild diarrhea. Within 12-24 hours of the fever breaking, a rash rapidly appears. Older children who develop HHV-6 (or HHV-7) infection are more likely to have an illness characterized by several days of high fever and possibly a runny nose and/or diarrhea. Older children less commonly develop a rash as the fever abates."
What specialties of doctors treat roseola?,'Pediatricians and family practitioners are capable of diagnosing and managing a child with roseola. Specialists (infectious disease experts) are rarely needed to assist in the care of this generally benign disease.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose roseola?,"'The characteristic clinical pattern of sudden onset of high fever and development of the typical rash at the time of fever resolution generally enables a rapid diagnosis without any laboratory studies. For unusual presentations, patients with complications or those with immune deficiency states, several forms of blood tests can assist in establishing the diagnosis.' "
How high can the fever go with roseola?,"'The fever can be quite high. The fever averages 103.5 F (39.7 C), but it can go up as high as 106 F (41.2 C).' "
What are home remedies for roseola?,"'Since roseola patients experience a moderate fever, medications to lower fever (antipyretics) are helpful in lowering fever and lessening any associated discomfort (such as ''headache''). Such medications include ''acetaminophen'' and/or ''ibuprofen''. A cool bath (approximate water temperature of 85 degrees) may also be therapeutic. No therapy is necessary regarding the rash of roseola since it does not cause symptoms, it is short-lived, and it resolves spontaneously.' "
What is the treatment for the fever of roseola?,"'If the fever is not causing the child to be uncomfortable, the fever need not be treated. It is not necessary to awaken the child to treat a fever unless instructed to do so by a health care professional.''If someone wants to treat the fever, acetaminophen (''Tylenol'' and others) can be used. The dosage interval is every 4 hours. Ibuprofen (''Advil'', ''Motrin'"", and others) may be used in lieu of acetaminophen on an every 6-hour basis. Both families of medication are equally effective in lowering a child's fever. There is no medical benefit alternating acetaminophen with ibuprofen. ""'Aspirin'' should never be used for fever in children or adolescents.''A child with a fever should be kept comfortable and not be overdressed. Overdressing can cause the temperature to go higher. Bathing with tepid water (85 F or 29.5 C) may help bring down a fever by 1 to 1.5 degrees. If a child develops shivering during the bath, the temperature of the bath water should be raised. Never sponge a child (or an adult) with ''alcohol''; the alcohol fumes may be inhaled, causing many problems.' "
"What should 
one do if his or her child with roseola has a seizure?","""The hardest thing to do is to keep calm while helping the child to the floor and loosening any clothing around the neck. Remove any sharp objects that could cause injury, and turn the child on one side so saliva can flow from the mouth. Putting a cushion or a folded coat under the head for a pillow is fine, but do not put anything in the child's mouth. The best thing is just to wait it out. Most ""'febrile seizures'"" (whether associated with roseola or other viruses) last less than 5 minutes. Do not leave the child unattended while calling the paramedics of the doctor's office. Children are often drowsy and ""'sleep'' after a ''seizure''. That is normal. After the ''seizure'"", contact the child's health care professional to determine if the child should be immediately examined.""  "
Can the fever cause a seizure?,'Yes. The sudden and rapid rise in temperature elevation may trigger a seizure (a ''convulsion''). Febrile ''seizures'' (convulsions due to fever) are common (3%) in children between 18 months to 3 years of age. They occur in 5%-35% of children with roseola.' 
Is a seizure due to fever dangerous?,"'The seizure may look very frightening, but it is usually quite harmless (benign). Febrile ''seizures'' are ''not'' associated with long-term nervous-system side effects or ''brain damage''. Anticonvulsant medications are very rarely prescribed for the treatment or ''prevention'' of febrile seizures.' "
Is there a rash with roseola?,"'Yes, but not in the beginning. When the fever disappears, a rash appears. The rash is mainly located on the neck and torso (the abdomen, trunk, and back), but it can also be on the arms and legs (extremities).''The rash may appear as separate little raised (""goose bump"" size) dots (''papules'') or as a flat (macular) rash. The skin is often mildly red in color and temporarily blanches with pressure. The rash is not ''itchy'' or painful. It is not contagious. The rash lasts one to two days and does not return.'  "
What is most remarkable characteristic of roseola?,'What is most striking is that the child seems so well despite having a high fever.' 
How long does roseola last?,'The fever of roseola lasts 3-5 days followed by a rash lasting about one to two days that resolves without treatment. Immunity to HHV-6 seems to be lifelong.' 
Are there any complications of roseola?,'Complications are rare with roseola except in children with suppressed immune systems. Individuals with healthy immune systems generally develop lifelong immunity to HHV-6 (or HHV-7).' 
"Should 
a child with roseola see a doctor?","'Yes, an evaluation by a health care professional is a good idea. A child with a fever ''and'' a rash should ''not'' go back to child care until they are medically evaluated.'  "
When can the child return to child care?,'A child with just the rash of roseola and no fever for 24 hours can usually return to child care.' 
Is there a vaccine for roseola?,"'At this time, there is no ''vaccine'' for roseola. Due to its generally benign nature and rare rate of complications, many researchers doubt that the high financial cost to develop such a new vaccine would be worthwhile.' "
Is it possible to prevent roseola?,"'The primary mechanism for HHV-6 or HHV-7 transmission is via human-to-human respiratory droplet secretions. Therefore, basic hand-washing and avoidance of acutely ill individuals (such as those with fever) is the best way to avoid contracting the illness. Day care centers and preschools should follow routine principles of hygiene and decontamination of toys and articles shared by their children.' "
What is the prognosis for a child with roseola?,"'With the exception of immune-compromised patients, the prognosis for a child with roseola is excellent and no long-term side effects should occur.' "
Are there other names for roseola?,"'Roseola is referred to by a number of other names. It was formally called roseola infantum or roseola infantilis. Because the rash appears so suddenly (right after the fever dramatically departs), the disease is commonly called exanthem subitum.''To distinguish roseola from other childhood diseases featuring skin ''rashes'', it was once dubbed ""sixth disease"" (because it was the sixth disease young children typically developed, and it lasted about 6 days). But that name has largely been forgotten.' "
What is Sjögren's syndrome?,"""Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by dryness of the mouth and eyes. Autoimmune diseases feature the abnormal production of extra antibodies in the blood that are directed against various tissues of the body. The misdirected immune system in autoimmunity tends to lead to inflammation of tissues. This particular autoimmune illness features inflammation and dysfunction in glands of the body that are responsible for producing tears and saliva. Inflammation of the glands that produce tears (lacrimal glands) leads to decreased water production for tears and ""'dry eyes''. Inflammation of the glands that produce the saliva in the mouth (salivary glands, including the parotid glands) leads to decreased saliva production and ''dry mouth'' and dry lips.'""Sjögren's syndrome with gland inflammation (resulting in ""'dry eyes'' and mouth, etc.) that is not associated with another ''connective tissue disease'"" is referred to as primary Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's syndrome that is also associated with a connective tissue disease, such as ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', or ''scleroderma'"", is referred to as secondary Sjögren's syndrome. Dryness of eyes and mouth, in patients with or without Sjögren's syndrome, is sometimes referred to as sicca syndrome.""  "
What causes Sjögren's syndrome?,"""While the exact cause of Sjögren's syndrome is not known, there is growing scientific support for genetic (""'inherited'"") factors. The genetic background of Sjögren's syndrome patients is an active area of research. The illness is sometimes found in other family members. It is also found more commonly in families that have members with other autoimmune illnesses, such as ""'systemic lupus erythematosus'', autoimmune ''thyroid disease'', type I ''diabetes'"", etc. Most patients with Sjögren's syndrome are female."" "
What are risk factors for developing Sjögren's syndrome?,"""The main risk factor for the development of Sjögren's syndrome is being a member of a family that is already characterized as having autoimmune illnesses. This does not mean that it is predictable that a member of a family with known autoimmunity will develop the disease, only that is more likely than if there were no family members with known autoimmunity. Accordingly, it is likely that certain genes that are inherited from ancestors can predispose one to the development of Sjögren's syndrome. It should also be noted that Sjögren's syndrome can also be sporadic and occur in a person from a family with no known autoimmunity."" "
What are Sjögren's syndrome symptoms and signs?,"""Symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome can involve the glands, as above, but there are also possible effects of the illness involving other organs of the body (extraglandular manifestations).""'When the tear gland (lacrimal gland) is inflamed from Sjögren\'s, the resulting eye dryness can progressively lead to symptoms such as eye irritation, decreased tear production, a ""gritty"" sensation, eye infection, and serious ''abrasion'' of the dome of the eye (''cornea''). Dry eyes can lead to infections of the eyes and inflammation of the eyelids (''blepharitis''). The condition of having dry eyes is medically referred to as xerophthalmia. When the eyes become inflamed from dryness, it is referred to as keratoconjunctivitis sicca.''Inflammation of the salivary glands can lead to the following symptoms and signs:''Dry lips often accompany the mouth dryness. ''Dry mouth'' is a condition medically referred to as ''xerostomia''.'""Other glands that can become inflamed, though less commonly, in Sjögren's syndrome include those of the lining of the breathing passages (leading to lung infections) and the vagina (sometimes causing a woman ""'pain'' during intercourse or recurrent vaginal infections).'""Extraglandular (outside of the glands) problems in Sjögren's syndrome include ""'fatigue'', ''joint pain'' or inflammation (''arthritis''), '""Raynaud's""' phenomenon, lung inflammation, ''lymph node'' enlargement, and kidney, nerve, joint ''pain'', and muscle disease with ''muscle pain'' and ''weakness'"". A rare serious complication of Sjögren's syndrome is inflammation of the blood vessels (""'vasculitis''), which can damage the tissues of the body that are supplied by these vessels.'""A common disease that is occasionally associated with Sjögren's syndrome is autoimmune ""'thyroiditis'"" (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), which can lead to abnormal ""'thyroid hormone'' levels detected by ''thyroid blood tests''. ''Heartburn'' and ''difficulty swallowing'' can result from ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'""), another common condition associated with Sjögren's syndrome. A rare and serious disease that is uncommonly associated with Sjögren's syndrome is ""'primary biliary cirrhosis'', an autoimmune disorder of the ''liver'"" that leads to scarring of the liver tissue. A small percentage of patients with Sjögren's syndrome develop ""'cancer'' of the lymph glands (''lymphoma''). This usually develops only after many years with the illness. Unusual lymph node swelling should be reported to the physician.'   mouth dryness, swallowing difficulties, dental decay, cavities, gum disease, mouth sores and swelling, hoarseness or impaired voice, abnormality of taste or loss of taste, dry cough, and stones and/or infection of the parotid gland inside of the cheeks."
How do health care professionals diagnose Sjögren's syndrome?,"""The diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome involves noting criterion such as dryness of the eyes and mouth. Significant dryness of the eyes can be determined in the doctor's office by testing the eye's ability to wet a small testing paper strip placed under the ""'eyelid'"" (Schirmer's test using Schirmer tear test strips). More sophisticated testing can be done by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).""""Sjögren's syndrome salivary glands can become larger and harden or become tender. Salivary-gland inflammation can be detected by radiologic nuclear medicine salivary scans. Also, the diminished ability of the salivary glands to produce saliva can be measured with salivary flow testing. The diagnosis is strongly supported by abnormal findings of a biopsy of salivary-gland tissue.""""The glands of the lower lip are occasionally used for a biopsy sample of the salivary-gland tissue in the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome. The lower lip salivary-gland biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia with the surgeon making a tiny incision on the inner part of the lower lip to expose and remove a sample of the tiny salivary glands within.""""Patients with Sjögren's syndrome typically produce a variety of extra antibodies against body tissues (autoantibodies). These can be detected through blood testing and include antinuclear antibodies (ANA), which are present in nearly all patients. Typical antibodies that are found in most, but not all patients, are SS-A and SS-B antibodies (Sjögren's syndrome A and B antibodies, also known as anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies), ""'rheumatoid factor'', thyroid antibodies, and others. Low red blood count (''anemia'') and abnormal blood levels of markers of inflammation (''sedimentation rate'', ''C-reactive protein'') are seen.' "
What is the treatment for Sjögren's syndrome? Will changes to one's diet improve Sjögren's syndrome symptoms and signs?,"""The treatment of patients with Sjögren's syndrome is directed toward the particular areas of the body that are involved and ""'prevention'"" of complications such as infection. There is no cure for Sjögren's syndrome.""'Dryness of the eyes can be helped by artificial tears, using eye-lubricant ointments at night, and minimizing the use of hair dryers. When dryness becomes more significant, the ophthalmologist can plug the tear duct closed so that tears cover the eye longer. ''Cyclosporine'' eyedrops (''Restasis'') are approved medicated eyedrops that can reduce the inflammation of the tear glands, thereby improving their function. Signs of eye infection (''conjunctivitis''), such as pus or excessive redness or pain, should be evaluated by the doctor. Dietary addition of ''flaxseed'' oil may also benefit eye dryness. ''Vitamin D'' supplementation may be beneficial, especially in those who have insufficient ''vitamin D'' blood levels.''The ''dry mouth'' can be helped by drinking plenty of fluids, humidifying air, and good dental care to avoid dental decay. The glands can be stimulated to produce saliva by sucking on sugarless lemon drops or ''glycerin'' swabs. Additional treatments for the symptom of dry mouth are prescription medications that are saliva ''stimulants'', such as ''pilocarpine'' (''Salagen'') and ''cevimeline'' (''Evoxac''). These medications should be avoided by people with certain ''heart'' diseases, ''asthma'', or ''glaucoma''. Artificial saliva preparations can ease many of the problems associated with dry mouth. Many of these types of agents are available as ''over-the-counter products'', including ''toothpaste'', gum, and mouthwash (Biotene). ''Numoisyn'' Liquid and lozenges are also available for the treatment of dry mouth. ''Vitamin E'' oil has been used with some success. Infections of the mouth and ''teeth'' should be addressed as early as possible in order to avoid more severe complications. Diligent dental care is very important. Moist, warm compresses can be massaged onto the parotid glands to help relieve swelling and pain.''Saltwater (saline) nasal sprays can help dryness in the passages of the nose. A woman should consider vaginal lubricant for sexual intercourse if ''vaginal dryness'' is a problem.''Hydroxychloroquine'"" (Plaquenil) has been helpful for some manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome, particularly ""'fatigue'', and muscle and ''joint pains'"". Serious complications of Sjögren's syndrome, such as ""'vasculitis'', can require immune-suppression medications, including cortisone (''prednisone'' and others) and/or ''azathioprine'' (Imuran) or ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan'').'""Infections, which can complicate Sjögren's syndrome, are addressed with appropriate antibiotics. ""'Cancer'' of the ''lymph nodes'"" (lymphoma), a rare complication of Sjögren's syndrome, is treated independently.""  "
What are complications of Sjögren's syndrome?,"""It is not uncommon for people with Sjögren's syndrome to have complications of infections. Infections that are common in these patients include dental infections, eye infections, ""'sinusitis'', ''bronchitis'', and ''vaginitis''. Close monitoring and early treatment of these infections are keys to optimal outcomes.'""Some people with Sjögren's syndrome can develop inflammation of the parotid gland in the cheeks. This can lead to dryness of the ducts that drain the gland and stones can form that block these drainage tubes. This can be serious and require aggressive antibiotics and surgery.""""A small percentage of patients with Sjögren's syndrome develop ""'cancer'' of the lymph glands (lymphoma). This usually develops only after many years with the illness.

Is it possible to prevent Sjögren's syndrome?,"""Because Sjögren's syndrome is felt to be inherited, there is no particular way to prevent developing the disease. However, preventing complications of Sjögren's syndrome, such as infection, eye irritation, etc., can be achieved using the methods described above."" "
What is the prognosis for patients with Sjögren's syndrome?,"""With proper attention to eye and oral care, the outlook for patients with Sjögren's syndrome is generally excellent. Eye dryness can lead to serious injury to the eye, particularly the cornea, and this should be avoided by consultation with an eye specialist. Mouth dryness can lead to dental decay and parotid gland infection and parotid stones.

What types of doctors treat Sjögren's syndrome?,"""Doctors that treat Sjögren's syndrome include general medicine physicians including general practitioners, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as specialists including ""'rheumatologists'', ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists (ENT physicians).' "
Conclusion,"'Sjögren syndrome is an area of active immunology research. Many new treatments will be available in the near future. Research has suggested that ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') may be beneficial for many features of Sjögren syndrome.''Sjögren syndrome is named after a Swedish ophthalmologist, Henrik Sjögren. In the early 1900s, Sjögren called the syndrome ""keratoconjunctivitis sicca."" The name sicca syndrome is technically now used only to describe the combination of dryness of the mouth and eyes, regardless of cause. The term ''sicca'' refers to the dryness of the eyes and mouth.' "
What is the anatomy of the skin?,"'The skin is the largest organ in the body that covers the entire external surface. It protects the internal organs from germs and thus helps prevent infections.''The skin is made up of three main layers (from top to bottom)''Epidermis'':''Dermis:''Hypodermis:''All these three major layers vary significantly in their anatomy and function.''The epidermis is divided into five layers (from top to bottom)''The thickness of the skin varies in different parts of the body. Skin layers are not present in some regions of the body and in other regions, the skin is thicker than it is in the rest of the body. For example, the skin on the palms and soles is the thickest while the eyelids have the thinnest skin.' The outer or top layer of the skin. The majority is composed of keratinocytes; the cells that take part in the skin renewal process. Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells. Melanin gives the skin its color, which varies from person to person. The more the melanin content, the darker the skin color. The middle layer of the skin. Made up of elastin/collagen (a type of connective tissue); this gives the skin its flexibility and strength. Houses the sweat glands, oil glands (sebaceous glands), hair follicles, muscles, nerve endings, blood vessels and dendritic cells. The bottom or deepest layer of the skin. Contains mainly fat and other structures like hair follicles, nerve endings and blood vessels (present in small numbers). Stratum corneum The skin is made up of several layers and each one serves different functions.  Stratum lucidum Stratum granulosum Stratum spinosum Stratum basale"
What is the function of the skin?,"'The skin’s functions are' Protecting from water, microorganisms, mechanical and chemical trauma and damage from UV light Serving as the first site of immunological defense  Regulating the temperature and water loss (through sweat) Producing vitamin D from exposure to sunlight Secreting oil (by sebaceous glands) that keeps the skin moist and soft and protects it against foreign substances Helping the body sense touch, heat, cold and pain Insulating the body from external heat and cold"
What are the different skin conditions?," Rash: General term for areas of irritation or altered skin texture. Acne: A skin condition that occurs due to plugged skin pores, causing eruptions called comedones. Dermatitis: Inflammation of the skin usually due to an allergy or infection. Eczema: Skin inflammation (dermatitis) accompanied by itching. Psoriasis: Itchy, silver or reddish scaly plaques. Dandruff: A scaly condition of the scalp caused by a yeast-like organism. Hives: Raised, red and itchy patches on the skin that arise suddenly. Hives usually result from an allergic reaction. Blister: Watery, clear and fluid-filled area on the skin. Tinea versicolor: Fungal skin infection characterized by pale areas of low pigmentation on the skin. Ringworm: A fungal skin infection (also called tinea) characterized by small, ring-like rashes. Vitiligo: Loss of skin color from certain regions that looks like white patchy areas on the skin. Melasma: Darkening of facial skin, particularly around the cheeks. Scabies: An intensely itchy and contagious rash in the webs of fingers, wrists, elbows and buttocks. Cellulitis: Redness and warmth of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. Skin abscess (boil or furuncle): A collection of pus under the skin caused by an infection. Rosacea: A chronic skin condition that features a red rash with tiny pimples on the face, particularly on the cheeks and nose. Warts: A small, cauliflower-like growth on the skin caused by a virus. Herpes rash: Periodic blisters or skin irritation around the lips or the genitals caused by the herpes viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2). Shingles (herpes zoster): This is a viral infection that causes a painful rash on one side of the body. Viral exanthem: Rash or eruption due to a virus. It occurs most commonly in children. Melanoma: Skin cancer that develops from the overgrowth of melanocytes. Basal cell carcinoma: The most common type of skin cancer. It is less dangerous than melanoma because it grows and spreads more slowly. Seborrheic keratosis: A benign and often itchy epidermal growth that resembles a brown wart. Actinic keratosis: A crusty or scaly bump that forms on sun-exposed skin, particularly on fair-skinned elderly people. It can sometimes progress to cancer. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: The second-most common form of skin cancer that usually develops on sun-exposed areas."
What is a skin biopsy?,'A skin biopsy is the removal of a piece of skin for the purpose of further examination in the laboratory using a microscope. Skin biopsies are performed to diagnose a number of conditions. Biopsies are not meant to actually treat a skin condition.' 
Why is a skin biopsy performed?,"'Skin biopsy is most frequently done to diagnose a skin growth such as a mole, or a skin condition such as a ''rash''. A skin biopsy can also be used to diagnose a ''cancer of the skin''. A skin biopsy may be indicated when a mole or other marking on the skin has changed in its shape, color, or size.'  "
What methods are used to obtain a skin biopsy?,'Different techniques are used in different situations. Typically the biopsies are obtained after using local anesthetics to numb the area to be biopsied.' A shave biopsy takes a thin slice off the top of the skin to be examined under the microscope. A punch biopsy takes a core (a small cylindrical fragment of tissue from the area of interest) and can be used to diagnose rashes and other conditions. Excisions are usually larger and deeper and are used to completely remove an abnormal area of skin such as a skin cancer. These are not technically biopsies since the goal of this procedure is to remove the whole lesion rather than to remove a small portion to make a diagnosis.
What happens to the skin sample after the biopsy is removed?,"'After the biopsy, the skin sample is fixed in special solution, and thin sections of the tissue are cut and placed on microscope slides. The slides are stained for examination by a doctor (usually a dermatologist or pathologist). Sometimes specialized stains are used to examine for antibodies, immune proteins, and other markers of certain diseases. Initial routine biopsy results can be obtained in 48 hours or less, while specialized staining techniques can require a longer time until final results are available.' "
What is skin cancer?,"'Most skin ''cancers'' are locally destructive cancerous (''malignant'') growth of the skin. They originate from the cells of the ''epidermis'', the superficial layer of the skin. Unlike cutaneous ''malignant melanoma'', the vast majority of these sorts of skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body (''metastasize'') and become life-threatening.''There are three major types of ''skin cancer'': (1) ''basal cell carcinoma'' (the most common), (2) ''squamous cell carcinoma'' (the second most common), which originate from skin cells, and (3) ''melanoma'', which originates from the pigment-producing skin cells (melanocytes) but is less common, though more dangerous, than the first two varieties. Other rare forms of ''skin cancer'' include ''lymphomas'', Merkel cell cancers, and cancers of other tissue in the skin, including sarcomas as well as hair and sweat gland tumors. In this article, we will only be reviewing the most common forms of cancers, basal cell ''carcinoma'' and squamous cell carcinoma.'  "
What are the risk factors for skin cancer?,"'The most common risk factors for ''skin cancer'' are as follows.' Ultraviolet light exposure, either from the sun or from tanning beds. Fair-skinned individuals, with hazel or blue eyes, and people with blond or red hair are particularly vulnerable. The problem is worse in areas of high elevation or near the equator where sunlight exposure is more intense. A chronically suppressed immune system (immunosuppression) from underlying diseases such as HIV/AIDS infection or cancer, or from some medications such as prednisone or chemotherapy Exposure to ionizing radiation (X-rays) or chemicals known to predispose to cancer such as arsenic Certain types of sexually acquired wart virus infections People who have a history of one skin cancer have a 20% chance of developing second skin cancer in the next two years. Elderly patients have more skin cancers."
Is skin cancer hereditary?,"'Since most skin cancers are caused by ultraviolet light exposure, skin cancers are generally not considered to be ''inherited''. But the fact that skin cancer is much more common among poorly pigmented individuals and that skin color is inherited does support the proposition that genetics is very important. There are some very rare genetic syndromes that result in an increased number of skin cancers in those affected.' "
What causes skin cancer?,"'Except in rare instances, most skin cancers arise from DNA mutations induced by ultraviolet light affecting cells of the epidermis. Many of these early cancers seem to be controlled by natural immune surveillance, which when compromised, may permit the development of masses of malignant cells that begin to grow into tumors.' "
What are the different types of skin cancer?,"'There are several different types of skin cancers:' Basal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer in humans. Over 1 million new cases of basal cell carcinoma are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. There are several different types of basal cell carcinoma, including the superficial type, the least worrisome variety; the nodular type, the most common; and the morpheaform, the most challenging to treat because the tumors often grow into the surrounding tissue (infiltrate) without a well-defined border. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for about 20% of all skin cancers but is more common in immunosuppressed people. In most instances, its biologic behavior is much like basal cell carcinoma with a small but significant chance of distant spread. Less common skin cancers include melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, cutaneous lymphoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma."
What are the signs and symptoms of skin cancer?,"'Most basal cell carcinomas have few if any symptoms. Squamous cell carcinomas may be painful. Both forms of skin cancer may appear as a sore that bleeds, oozes, crusts, or otherwise will not heal. They begin as a slowly growing bump on the skin that may bleed after minor ''trauma''. Both kinds of skin cancers may have raised edges and central ulceration.''Signs and symptoms of basal cell carcinomas include:''Signs and symptoms of squamous cell carcinomas include:''Actinic keratoses'' (AK), also called solar keratoses, are scaly, crusty lesions caused by damage from ultraviolet light, often in the facial area, ''scalp'', and backs of the hands. These are considered precancers because if untreated, up to 10% of actinic keratoses may develop into squamous cell carcinomas.'   Appearance of a shiny pink, red, pearly, or translucent bump Pink skin growths or lesions with raised borders that are crusted in the center A raised reddish patch of skin that may crust or itch, but is usually not painful A white, yellow, or waxy area with a poorly defined border that may resemble a scar Persistent, scaly red patches with irregular borders that may bleed easily Open sore that does not go away for weeks A raised growth with a rough surface that is indented in the middle A wart-like growth"
When is a mole dangerous or high risk for becoming a skin cancer?,"'Moles'' are almost always harmless and only very rarely turn into skin cancer. If a mole becomes cancerous, it would be a melanoma. There is a ''precancerous'' stage, called a ''dysplastic nevus'', which is somewhat more irregular than a normal mole. An early sign of melanoma is noticing a difference in a mole: asymmetry, irregular border, color changes, increasing diameter, or other evolving changes may signify a mole is a melanoma. ''Moles'' never become squamous cell carcinomas or basal cell carcinomas.' "
What are the most common sites where skin cancer develops?,"'Skin cancers typically arise in areas of the skin exposed to the sun repeatedly over many years such as on the face and nose, ears, back of the neck, and the bald area of the scalp. Less commonly, these tumors may appear at sites with only limited sun exposure such as the back, chest, or the extremities. However, skin cancer may occur anywhere on the skin.' "
How do physicians diagnose skin cancer?,"'A skin examination by a dermatologist is the way to get a definitive diagnosis of skin cancer. In many cases, the appearance alone is sufficient to make the diagnosis.''A ''skin biopsy'' is usually used to confirm a suspicion of skin cancer. This is performed by numbing the area under the ''tumor'' with a local anesthetic such as ''lidocaine''. A small portion of the tumor is sliced away and sent for examination by a pathologist, who looks at the tissue under a microscope and renders a diagnosis based on the characteristics of the tumor.'  "
What is the staging for skin cancer?,"'There is no specific staging system for basal cell carcinoma. If the tumor is wider than 2 cm (about ¾ inch diameter), it is probably a more serious tumor. Basal cell carcinomas of the ears, nose, and ''eyelid'' may also be of more concern, regardless of the size.''There is a staging system for squamous cell carcinoma. Large tumors that are thicker than 2 mm, invade the nerve structures of the skin, occur on the ear, and have certain worrisome characteristics under the microscope are of more concern. If the tumor metastasizes to a site at some distance from the ''primary tumor'', the cancer is likely to be a dangerous tumor.' "
What is the treatment for skin cancer?,"'There are several effective means of treating skin cancer. The choice of therapy depends on the location and size of the tumor, the microscopic characteristics of the cancer, and the general health of the patient.' 

Read Doctor's View
  Topical medications: In the case of superficial basal cell carcinomas, some creams, gels, and solutions can be used, including imiquimod (Aldara), which works by stimulating the body's immune system causing it to produce interferon which attacks the cancer, and fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapy drug. Some patients do not experience any side effects of these topical treatments, but others may have redness, inflammation, and irritation. A drawback of topical medications is that there is no tissue available to examine to determine if a tumor is removed completely. Destruction by electrodessication and curettage (EDC): The tumor area is numbed with a local anesthetic and is repeatedly scraped with a sharp instrument (curette), and the edge is then cauterized with an electric needle. The advantage of this method is that it is fast, easy, and relatively inexpensive. The disadvantages are that the scar is often somewhat unsightly, and the recurrence rate is as high as 15%. Surgical excision: The area around the tumor is numbed with a local anesthetic. A football-shaped portion of tissue including the tumor is then removed and then the wound edges are closed with sutures. For very big tumors, skin grafts or flaps are needed to close the defect. The advantages of this form of treatment are that there is a greater than 90% cure rate, the surgical specimen can be examined to be sure that the whole tumor is successfully removed, and the scar produced is usually more cosmetically acceptable than that of the EDC procedure. It is a more complicated procedure and is more expensive than EDC. Mohs micrographic surgery: The site is locally anesthetized and the surgeon removes the visible tumor with a small margin of normal tissue. The tissue is immediately evaluated under a microscope and areas that demonstrate residual microscopic tumor involvement are re-excised and the margins are re-examined. This cycle continues until no further tumor is seen. This more complicated and expensive option is the treatment of choice for tumors where normal tissue preservation is vital, where the tumor margins are poorly defined, in tumors that have been previously treated and have recurred, and in certain high-risk tumors. Radiation therapy: Ten to fifteen treatment sessions deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor and a small surrounding skin area. This form of treatment is useful in those who are not candidates for any surgical procedure. The advantage of radiation therapy is that there is no cutting involved. The disadvantages of this expensive alternative are that the treated area cannot be tested to be sure the whole tumor is gone and radiation scars look worse over time. It is, for this reason, it is usually reserved for elderly patients. Other types of treatments for skin cancers include cryosurgery where tissue is destroyed by freezing, photodynamic therapy (PDT) in which medication and blue light are used to destroy the cancerous tissue, laser surgery to vaporize (ablate) the skin's top layer and destroy lesions, and oral medications vismodegib (Erivedge) and sonidegib (Odomzo)."
What kinds of doctors treat skin cancer?,"'The main type of doctor who will treat skin cancer is a dermatologist. Your primary care physician or internist may first notice a sign of skin cancer but will refer you to a dermatologist for further testing and treatment. You may also see an oncologist, which is a cancer specialist.''If you have surgical removal of a tumor, depending on how much skin is removed, you may see ''plastic'' or reconstructive surgeon after the tumor removal to help restore the appearance of the skin, especially on the face.' "
What is the prognosis and survival rate for skin cancer?,"'The prognosis for ''nonmelanoma skin cancer'' is generally excellent. Both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are highly curable. There are virtually no deaths from basal cell carcinoma and only rare deaths with squamous cell carcinoma skin cancers, mostly in immunosuppressed individuals. Depending on the method of treatment and the location and type of skin cancer, the likelihood of a recurrence of a previously treated skin cancer is as low as 1% to 2% for ''Mohs surgery'' and up to 10% to 15% for destruction by electrodesiccation and curettage.''Early detection of skin cancers can lead to better outcomes. Know your skin and if you have any moles or spots that are suspect, see a dermatologist for a skin ''cancer screening''. Awareness is key in identifying and treating skin cancers early.' "
Is it possible to prevent skin cancer?,"'Many skin cancers can be prevented by avoiding triggers that cause tumors to develop. ''Prevention'' strategies include protection from the sun by the use of sunscreens, protective clothing, and avoidance of the sun during the peak hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Parents should ensure children are protected from the sun. Do not use tanning beds, which are a major cause of excess ultraviolet light exposure and a significant risk factor for skin cancer. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) has noted a dramatic rise in the numbers and cost of skin cancer. Furthermore, there has been an increase in the total number of skin cancers and that new breakthrough treatments for melanoma, although expensive, comprise only a small portion of the total cost of skin cancer treatment. Most skin cancers are treated cost efficiently by dermatologists in an office setting.' "
Sunscreen use and vitamin D,"'A major source of ''vitamin D'"" comes from sunlight exposure, which leads to the production of the vitamin in the skin. Some argue sunscreens block out so much of the sun's rays that inadequate ""'vitamin D'' synthesis results. In fact, very few people actually apply ''sunscreen'' to every inch of their exposed skin, so ''vitamin D'' synthesis does occur. There is no reason not to use sunscreens because of a fear of low vitamin D. If there is a concern, vitamin D can be obtained by eating leafy vegetables or taking an oral multivitamin supplement.' "
Are skin rashes contagious?,"'There are ''contagious'' and noncontagious skin ''rashes''. To make this broad topic more manageable, the following is a list of general categories of ''rashes'' that are considered noncontagious:''Since the real question to be answered is what rashes are ''contagious'', the remainder of this short article will address most of those rashes that are considered contagious; not all experts agree on these designations, so readers concerned about a ''rash'' are urged to discuss their individual condition with their physician.''Rashes that are considered by many physicians to be contagious are as follows:''This list is not exhaustive but covers many of the rashes that people may encounter. The definition of ''contagious'' depends on whether the ''rash'' itself can be spread or the infection that causes the rash can be spread, so some experts may not agree with the designations above. For example, in some cases, the rash is contagious in that someone can get the rash from another person with the rash. In other cases, a person with a rash may be at risk of spreading the infection that caused the rash (which may not necessarily cause a rash in the person who gets infected).'  Seborrheic dermatitis Atopic dermatitis Contact dermatitis Stasis dermatitis Psoriasis Nummular eczema Drug eruptions Hives Heat rash (miliaria) Diaper rash Molluscum contagiosum (viral) Impetigo (bacterial) Herpes (herpes simplex, types 1 and 2 viruses) Rash caused by Neisseria meningitides (N. meningitides) (bacterial) Rash and blisters that accompany shingles (herpes zoster virus) Ringworm (fungal) infections (tinea) Scabies (itch mite) Chickenpox (viral) Measles and rubella (viral) Erythema infectiosum (viral) Pityriasis rosea (viral) Cellulitis and erysipelas (bacterial) Lymphangitis (bacterial) Folliculitis (bacterial)"
How will I know if I have a contagious rash?,"'Often, rashes appear in children and adults. Even though some of the ""contagious"" rashes have fairly typical presentations (for example, ''shingles'' has a reddish rash, usually with ''blisters'"", develops on one side of the body along the area supplied by one nerve) but not always. Consequently, if you have had contact with a person who has a known contagious disease that forms a rash, you should contact a physician. Similarly, if you're concerned about a rash that has developed, a physician and/or dermatologist can help diagnose your skin condition. A conservative way to approach rashes is to consider all of them contagious until proven otherwise."" "
How do contagious rashes spread?,"'Most contagious rashes spread from person to person by direct contact. Many of the rashes are ''itchy'' and spread when an infected individual scratches the rash and then touches or scratches another individual who is not yet infected. However, some rashes can easily spread by indirect contact; for example, ''ringworm'' can be easily spread from the locker room floor to another individual by simply ''walking'' on the contaminated floor.' "
How will I know when I am cured of a contagious rash?,"'The possible cure of the contagious rash depends on the underlying cause of the rash. For example, once an individual has been appropriately treated with antibiotics for ''N. meningitidis'' infection, the rash and the patient usually become noncontagious after about 24-48 hours and the rash slowly disappears. To help determine the underlying cause and cure for your rash, speak with a physician.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about a rash?,"'In most cases, if an individual has a noncontagious rash or a noncontagious cause of the rash, there is no need to contact a medical ''caregiver'' emergently unless the rash or and/or underlying cause is rapidly spreading.''If you suspect you have been exposed to a contagious rash, contact your physician early to get appropriate advice and treatment. However, if you know you have been exposed to the rash caused by ''N. meningitidis'', you should contact a medical ''caregiver'' emergently. If you have a rash that is shedding or sloughing off patches or large areas of skin, this is considered a medical emergency and the person should be seen quickly in an emergency department.' "
When should you see a doctor for your rash?,"'Although not all rashes are serious, some warrant a visit to the doctor. Such instances include:' The rash is all over your body You have a fever with the rash The rash is sudden and spreads rapidly The rash begins to blister The rash is painful The rash begins to ooze out yellow or green fluid (pus) (The rash may be infectious) You experience difficulty in breathing"
What is a skin tag?,"'Skin tags are common, acquired benign skin-colored growths that resemble a small, soft balloon suspended on a slender stalk. Skin tags are harmless growths that can vary in number from one to hundreds. Males and females are equally prone to developing skin tags. ''Obesity'' seems to be associated with skin tag development. Although some skin tags may fall off spontaneously, most persist once formed. The medical name for skin tag is ''acrochordon''. Some people call them ""skin tabs.""''Early on, skin tags may be as small as a flattened pinhead-sized bump. While most tags typically are small (2 mm-5 mm in diameter) at approximately one-third to one-half the size of a pencil eraser, some skin tags may become as large as a big grape (1 cm in diameter) or a fig (5 cm in diameter).' "
Is there another medical name for a skin tag?,"'Medical terms your physician or dermatologist may use to describe a skin tag include fibroepithelial polyp, acrochordon, cutaneous papilloma, and soft fibroma. All of these terms describe skin tags and are benign (noncancerous), painless skin growths. Some people refer to these as ""skin tabs"" or ''warts''.' "
What causes skin tags?,'The precise cause of skin tags is unknown.' 
Where do skin tags occur?,"'Skin tags can occur almost anywhere on the body covered by skin. However, the two most common areas for skin tags are the neck and armpits. Other common body areas for the development of skin tags include the eyelids, upper chest (particularly under the female breasts), buttock folds, and groin folds. Tags are typically thought to occur where skin rubs against itself or clothing. ''Babies'' who are plump may also develop skin tags in areas where skin rubs against skin, like the sides of the neck. Younger children may develop tags at the upper ''eyelid'' areas, often in areas where they may rub their eyes. Older children and preteens may develop tags in the underarm area from friction and repetitive skin rubbing from sports.''Skin tags typically occur in the following characteristic locations:'   Base of the neck Underarms Eyelids Groin folds Buttock folds Under the breasts"
Who tends to get skin tags?,"'More than half if not all of the general population has been reported to have skin tags at some time in their lives. Although tags are generally acquired (not present at birth) and may occur in anyone, more often they arise in adulthood. They are much more common in middle age, and they tend to increase in prevalence up to age 60. Children and toddlers may also develop skin tags, particularly in the underarm and neck areas. Skin tags are more common in ''overweight'' people.''Hormone elevations, such as those seen during ''pregnancy'', may cause an increase in the formation of skin tags, as skin tags are more frequent in ''pregnant'' women. Tags are essentially harmless and do not have to be treated unless they are bothersome. Skin tags that are bothersome may be easily removed during or after pregnancy, typically by a dermatologist.''Although skin tags are generally not associated with any other diseases, there seems to be a group of obese individuals who, along with many skin tags, develop a condition called ''acanthosis nigricans'' on the skin of their neck and armpits and are predisposed to have high blood ''fats'' and ''sugar''.''Certain structures resemble skin tags but are not. Accessory tragus and an accessory digit occasionally can be confused with skin tags. Pathological examination with a biopsy of the tissue will help distinguish skin tags if there is any question as to the diagnosis.' "
Will removing a skin tag cause more to grow?,"'There is no evidence that removing a skin tag will cause more tags to grow. There is no expectation of causing skin tags to ""seed"" or spread by removing them. In reality, some people are simply more prone to developing skin tags and may have new growths periodically. Some individuals request periodic removal of tags at annual or even quarterly intervals.' "
Is a skin tag a tumor?,"'Skin tags are a type of harmless skin growth or benign ''tumor''. Tags are generally not cancerous (''malignant'"") and don't become cancerous if left untreated.""'There are extremely rare instances where a skin tag may become ''precancerous'' or cancerous. Skin tag-like ''bumps'' that bleed, grow, or display multiple colors like pink, brown, red, or black can require a biopsy to exclude other causes, including ''skin cancer''.' "
Are skin tags contagious?,'No. There is no evidence to suggest that common skin tags are ''contagious''.' 
What else could it be?,"'While classic skin tags are typically very characteristic in appearance and occur in specific locations such as the underarms, necks, under breasts, eyelids and groin folds, there are tags that may occur in less obvious locations.''Other skin growths that may look similar to a skin tag but are not tags include ''moles'' (dermal ''nevus''), nerve and ''fiber''-type ''moles'' (neurofibromas), ''warts'', and ""barnacles"" or the so-called ""Rice Krispies"" (seborrheic keratoses).''Warts tend to have a ""warty"" irregular surface whereas skin tags are usually smooth. Warts tend to be flat whereas tags are more like bumps hanging from thin stalk. While warts are almost entirely caused by human papilloma virus (''HPV''), tags are rarely associated with ''HPV''.''Groin and genital skin lesions resembling skin tags may actually be ''genital warts'' or condyloma. A biopsy would help diagnose which of these growths are not skin tags. Very rarely, a ''basal cell carcinoma'', ''squamous cell carcinoma'', or ''malignant melanoma'' may mimic a skin tag, but this is very uncommon.' "
Skin tag vs. wart,"'While warts are caused by a virus called ''human papillomavirus'' (HPV) and are known to be very contagious, skin tags are not thought to be caused by HPV.' "
What does a skin tag look like under a microscope?,"'Laboratory preparation of the tissue is required before looking at the skin tag under the microscope. The skin is stained with a stain called hematoxylin and eosin (""H&E""). Under the microscope, there is a colored spherical tissue attached to a small stalk. The purple outer layer (''epidermis'') overlies a pink core (dermis).''The outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) shows overgrowth of normal skin (hyperplasia), and it encloses an underlying layer of skin (the dermis) in which the normally present collagen fibers appear abnormally loose and swollen. Usually there are no hairs, moles, or other skin structures present in skin tags.''While the majority of skin tags are simply destroyed, sometimes tissue is sent for microscopic exam by a health care specialist known as a pathologist, who will determine the exact diagnosis and determine whether an abnormality such as ''skin cancer'' is present. Irregular skin growths that are larger, bleed, or have an unusual presentation may require pathology examination to make sure there are no irregular cells or ''skin cancers''.''Some common ''skin conditions'' that can mimic skin tags include seborrheic keratoses, moles, warts, ''cysts'', milia, neurofibromas, and nevus lipomatosus. Rarely, skin ''cancers'' like ''basal cell carcinoma'', ''squamous cell carcinoma'', and malignant ''melanoma'' may mimic skin tags.' "
What signs and symptoms do skin tags cause?,"'Except for the cosmetic appearance, skin tags generally cause no physical ''pain'' or discomfort. These tiny skin growths generally cause symptoms when they are repeatedly irritated (for example, by the collar or in the groin). Cosmetic reasons are the most common reason for skin tag removal. The following symptoms and signs may necessitate skin tag removal:''Sometimes, they may become snagged by clothing, jewelry, pets, or seat belts, causing ''pain'' or discomfort. Overall, these are very benign growths that have no ''cancer'' (malignant) potential.''Occasionally, a tag may spontaneously fall off without any pain or discomfort. This may occur after the tag has twisted on itself at the stalk base, interrupting the blood flow to the tag.'   it has become irritated and red from bleeding (hemorrhage) or black from twisting, and death of the skin tissue (necrosis)."
Does medical insurance cover skin tag removal?,"'Many if not all insurance carriers classify skin tags as cosmetic and therefore a self-pay treatment. In uncommon instances, documented medical necessity of suspicious growths or highly symptomatic growths may support payment for medical treatment of skin tags.' "
Do any creams remove skin tags?,"'There are no currently medically approved creams for the removal of skin tags. Skin tags are typically removed by physical methods like cutting off or tying off with dental floss. It is not advisable to use unapproved products like Dermasil, wart removers, ''tea tree oil'', nail polish, ''toothpaste'', or hair-removal creams like Neet or Nair. Trial uses of unapproved creams may cause irritation and possible secondary complications.'  "
Should I worry about cutting my skin tag by shaving?,"'No. Skin tags are frequently and inadvertently shaved off while removing hair from the armpit either with a razor or by waxing. There is typically no harm done when small skin tags are removed by shaving.''Sometimes, even a small skin tag base may bleed for a while and require constant applied pressure for 10-15 minutes to stop bleeding. ''Skin infection'' is a rare possible complication of accidentally shaving off skin tags.' "
Do skin tags need to be sent for biopsy?,"'Most typical small skin tags may be removed without sending tissue for microscopic examination or biopsy.''However, there are some larger or atypical growths that may be removed and sent to a pathologist for examination under a microscope to make sure that the tissue is really a skin tag and nothing more. Additionally, skin bumps that have bled or rapidly changed may also need pathologic examination.''Some common skin tag look-alikes include benign lesions such as seborrheic keratoses, common moles, warts, neurofibromas, and a fatty mole called nevus lipomatosus. While extremely rare, there are a few reports of skin cancers found in skin tags. Skin cancers like basal cell ''carcinoma'', squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant ''melanoma'' may rarely mimic skin tags, as described above.' "
Are there vaginal skin tags?,"'While typical skin tags are not usually seen in the vagina or in other moist, mucosal surfaces, there are other types of benign polyps that occur in these areas. Irritation polyps or soft fibromas may occur on vaginal areas, mouth, and anal skin. Skin tags most commonly occur on ''dry skin'' like the neck, armpits, and groin folds. ''Genital warts'', which are growths caused by a sexually transmitted virus HPV, need to be considered in the possible diagnosis for growths in genital areas.''Skin tags may infrequently occur at the external genitalia like the labia majora and labia minora. Again, sexually transmitted viral conditions like genital warts may need to be ruled out by tissue biopsy of growths in this area.' "
Can you get skin tags on the penis and scrotum?,"'Skin tags may occur at unusual sites like the penis, scrotum, and opening of the penis tip. Sexually transmitted viral conditions (HPV) like genital warts in the genital area can require a tissue biopsy for diagnosis.' "
What happens when a skin tag suddenly turns purple or black?,"""A thrombosed or clotted skin tag may suddenly change colors, becoming purple, black, and irritated when its blood supply is inadequate. Thrombosed skin tags typically may fall off on their own in 3 to 10 days and don't require additional treatment.""""Skin tags that have changed color or bleed may require your doctor's evaluation and reassurance. Rarely, thrombosed skin tags may be a sign of another condition and need to be biopsied.""  "
What is the prognosis for skin tags?,"'The long-term results after destruction of the individual skin tag are excellent. However, it should be understood that this does not prevent the development of new skin tags.' "
Is it possible to prevent skin tags?,'No. It is not possible to prevent skin tags.' 
What's the difference between skin tags and moles?,"'Skin tags'' and ''moles'' are both types of skin growths. A ''skin tag'' is a small, soft balloon-shaped benign skin growth connected to the skin by a thin stalk. Skin tags are extremely common and harmless. They tend to occur in areas where the skin folds, such as the eyelids, armpits, neck, groin, buttock folds, and under the breasts. The cause of skin tags is unknown but ''obese'', middle-aged adults develop skin tags more often than other people. Removal of skin tags may involve freezing, strangulation by tying them off, snipping, and burning.''A mole is a skin growth that develops from clusters of pigment cells (melanocytes). ''Moles'' are typically found on areas of the skin exposed to the sun. A common mole is usually smaller than 1/4-inch-wide, is round or oval, has a smooth surface, a distinct edge, is often dome-shaped, and has an even color of pink, tan, or brown. Common moles are not cancerous, but in rare cases they can turn into ''melanoma'', the most serious type of ''skin cancer''. Because common moles rarely turn into ''melanoma'', they do not usually need to be removed.''If you notice any changes in color, size, texture, or height of a mole, or if the skin on the mole becomes dry or scaly, or the mole feels lumpy, starts to ''itch'', bleed, or ooze, see a doctor.' "
What causes skin tags and moles?,"'The medical term for ''skin tag'' is ''acrochordon''. Other synonyms that have sometimes been used to refer to skin tags include soft ''warts'', soft fibromas, fibroepithelial polyps (FEP), fibroma pendulans, and pedunculated fibroma. Skin tags can occur in anyone but tend to increase in frequency as we age. They are also more common in obese persons, possibly due to increased irritation and rubbing of skin folds. Hormonal factors or ''aging'' processes may also play a role in the development of skin tags.''The genes we inherit from our parents, along with our amount of sun exposure (especially during childhood) are major factors in determining mole numbers. Skin with more sun exposure tends to have more moles. However, moles may also occur in sun-protected areas.''Moles and ''freckles'' (medically termed ''ephelides'') are darker than the surrounding skin. Moles may be raised or completely flat while ''freckles'' are always flat. Freckles and ""sun spots"" (medically termed ''lentigines'') are due to an increase in the amount of dark pigment called ''melanin''. Moles are more common in people prone to freckles. Freckles are flat spots that are tan, slightly reddish, or light-brown and typically appear during the sunny months. They frequently appear on people with light complexions. Many people with blond or red hair and green or blue eyes are more prone to these types of skin spots. Sun avoidance and ''sun protection'', including the regular use of ''sunscreen'' may help to suppress the appearance of some types of moles and freckles.''Moles occur in all races (Caucasian, Asian, African, and Indian) and skin colors. Even animals have moles.''Moles may be present at birth or gradually appear later in the ''newborn'' period. Many children continue to develop moles through the teenage years and into young adulthood. Moles tend to grow very slightly in proportion to normal body growth. Congenital moles are those present at birth and so must have been present during ''fetal development''. Other moles may arise later due to factors that are not genetic but environmental, such as sun exposure.''While many moles arise in the first years of life, the total number of moles typically peaks in the second or third decade of life to an average of 35. Most people do not develop new regular moles after the age of 30. Adults often develop non-mole growths like freckles, ''lentigines'', ""''liver spots'',"" and seborrheic keratoses in later adulthood.''New moles appearing after age 35 may require close observation, medical evaluation, and possible biopsy. A brand-new mole in an adult may be a sign of an evolving abnormal mole or early melanoma. It is important to have any new or changing mole evaluated by a dermatologist.' "
What are the symptoms of skin tags vs. moles?,"'Most skin tags are asymptomatic, meaning that they cause no symptoms. They are almost universally benign; reports of malignancies arising in skin tags are extremely rare. Skin tags can become irritated and inflamed, especially when located in skin folds or in areas where clothing rubs against them.''Skin tags are most commonly found in or near the armpits (axillae) and on the neck, but they occur commonly in all skin folds (such as the groin) and on the back and abdomen.''The medical term for mole is melanocytic ''nevus''. Moles may be tan, brown, black, reddish brown, red, purple, or skin-colored and perfectly flat or raised. Most moles are smaller than a pencil eraser (about 1/2 inch).''Certain moles become darker and more apparent with sun exposure and ''pregnancy''. Moles can occur anywhere on the skin, including the ''scalp'', ears, eyelids, lips, palms, soles, genitals, and anal area.''A melanocytic nevus (plural ''nevi'') is composed of masses of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin. However, there are a variety of other skin lesions that are also mole-like. These include''In this article, the term moles will be synonymous with melanocytic nevus.' seborrheic keratoses, skin tags, dermatofibromas, lentigines, and freckles."
What is the treatment for skin tags vs. moles?,"""Most doctors recommend removal of skin tags only when they are irritated or a source of discomfort, or if they constitute a cosmetic problem. Skin tags can be easily removed in the doctor's office by tying or cutting them after injecting a small amount of a local anesthetic. Freezing, a technique sometimes used to remove ""'warts'' or other benign lesions of the skin, is also sometimes performed for the removal of skin tags.''If you are unsure about any changes in your skin or growths arising on the skin, always check with your doctor. He or she can identify skin tags and other ''skin conditions'' and can help you decide whether skin abnormalities should be removed.''Surgical removal treats true moles. Fairly minor in-office procedures (involving the surgical excision of the entire lesion) can easily remove them.''Regular moles do not necessarily need to be treated. A health care professional should surgically remove changing or medically suspicious moles in their entirety and sent to a lab for special tissue examination called pathology.''Although some countries and medical centers use lasers to remove some types of moles, laser treatments are not recommended for moles. Irregular moles need to be surgically removed and the tissue sent for testing. While sun spots or lentigines may respond to bleaching or fading creams, freezing with liquid nitrogen, laser, intense pulsed light, and chemical peels, true melanocytic nevi should not be treated by these methods.''Plastic'' surgeons may have specialized training in cosmetic skin-growth removal. Regardless of what type of doctor removes a mole, it is important to keep in mind that all mole removals will leave some type of ''scar''.''Most people report no or minimal discomfort after mole-removal surgery and require no ''pain'' medication. Non-''aspirin'' ''over-the-counter'' ''pain'' relievers are recommended if necessary for pain.' "
What is a skin test?,"'A skin test is a test done on the skin to identify if a substance (an ''allergen'') is potentially triggering an ''allergic reaction''. Environmental allergens (aeroallergens), including furry animals, dust mites, tree ''pollen'', grass pollen, weed pollen, and molds can cause ''allergic'' eye symptoms, nasal symptoms, and ''asthma symptoms''. Allergens that can trigger allergic reactions involving the skin, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, and ''cardiovascular system'' include foods, medications, latex, and insect venoms.' "
How is an allergy skin test done?,"'Allergy'' skin testing is noninvasive and generally very well tolerated, even by small children. A small amount of the suspected ''allergy''-provoking substance (the allergen) is placed on the skin. The skin is then gently punctured through the small drop with a special sterile puncture device. An ''allergy'' skin test is also called a prick/puncture test. The older terminology was ""scratch test."" With venoms, certain medications, such as ''penicillin'', and in certain cases with aeroallergens, a second step of testing involves injecting a small amount of the allergen into the skin with a small needle. This is called an intradermal or an intracutaneous test. This type of testing should never be performed for foods.' "
What is a positive skin test result?,"'A positive skin test involves the formation of a bump (wheal) and redness (flare). In addition to the allergens in question, skin testing is also performed with a positive control (histamine) that should always cause a skin reaction, and a negative control, (saline), that should not cause a reaction. A test is positive if the allergen causes a wheal 3 mm greater than the negative control, and if the skin has a response to the histamine, as well. It is important to know that individuals cannot undergo skin testing if they are using ''antihistamines'', since this blocks the histamine-mediated reaction.''For example, if a specific ''food allergy'"" is suspected, a skin test uses a dilute extract of the suspected food. A small drop of this particular liquid extract is placed on the skin of the forearm or back. This underlying skin is gently punctured through the small drop with a special puncture device. The test is positive if there is a wheal and flare response described above. A positive test raises the possibility of a true allergy but is not diagnostic or confirmatory for having a true allergy. If there is no reaction with a wheal and flare, the test is read as negative and being allergic is very unlikely. If the skin test is positive, it implies that the patient has a type of antibody (IgE) on specialized cells in the skin that release histamine to cause symptoms of an allergic reaction. These cells are called mast cells and the IgE antibody bound to them is specific to the food being tested, like a puzzle piece. It is important to note that a positive skin test does not automatically mean a person is allergic to a food, medication, or aeroallergen. The skin test is one component of the information an allergist uses to make an accurate diagnosis, but the most important information comes from the patient's reported symptoms."" "
What are the advantages of skin tests?,"'Skin tests are rapid, simple, and relatively safe. They can be very helpful in specifically identifying causes of ''allergies''.' "
Is there danger to a skin test?,"'In very rare cases, patients may have a ''severe allergic reaction'' involving multiple body systems to skin testing. For this reason, skin testing should be completed by an experienced allergist who is well prepared to diagnose and treat a severe allergic reaction. Although both are safe, intradermal or intracutaneous skin testing is more likely to cause a severe allergic reaction compared to prick/puncture testing.' "
What is done if a skin test can't be done?,"'For these patients, a doctor may use special blood tests, such as the RAST and the ''ELISA''. These tests measure the presence of specific types of IgE in the blood.''These tests may cost more than skin tests, and results are not available immediately. As with skin testing, positive RAST and ''ELISA tests'' do not by themselves necessarily make the final diagnosis.' "
Introduction,"'Laser resurfacing is a treatment to reduce facial ''wrinkles'' and skin irregularities, such as blemishes or ''acne'' ''scars''.''The technique directs short, concentrated pulsating beams of light at irregular skin, precisely removing skin  layer by layer. This popular procedure is also called lasabrasion, laser peel, or laser vaporization.' "
Who Is a Good Candidate For Laser Resurfacing?,"'If you have fine lines or ''wrinkles'' around your eyes or mouth or on your forehead, shallow scars from ''acne'', or non-responsive skin after a ''facelift'', then you may be a good candidate for laser skin resurfacing.''If you have active ''acne'' or if you have very dark skin, you may not be a candidate. This technique is also not recommended for ''stretch marks''. You should discuss whether laser resurfacing is right for you by consulting with the doctor before having the procedure done.' "
How Does Laser Skin Resurfacing Work?,'The two types of lasers most commonly used in laser resurfacing are carbon dioxide (CO2) and erbium. Each laser vaporizes skin cells damaged at the surface-level.' 
CO2 Laser Resurfacing,"'This method has been used for years to treat different skin issues, including ''wrinkles'', scars, ''warts'', enlarged oil glands on the nose, and other conditions.''The newest version of CO2 laser resurfacing uses very short pulsed light energy (known as ultrapulse) or continuous light beams that are delivered in a scanning pattern to remove thin layers of skin with minimal heat damage. Recovery takes up to two weeks.' "
Erbium Laser Resurfacing,"'Erbium laser resurfacing is designed to remove surface-level and moderately deep lines and wrinkles on the face, hands, neck, or chest. One of the benefits of erbium laser resurfacing is minimal burning of surrounding tissue. This laser causes fewer side effects -- such as swelling, ''bruising'', and redness -- so your recovery time should be faster than with CO2 laser resurfacing. In some cases, recovery may only take one week Ask your doctor how long recovery is likely to take for you.''If you have a darker skin tone, erbium laser resurfacing may work better for you.' "
Preparing for Laser Resurfacing,"'Start by consulting a ''plastic surgeon'"" or dermatologist to find out if you're a good candidate. Be sure to choose a doctor who has documented training and experience in laser skin resurfacing. The doctor will determine which laser treatment is best for you after considering your medical history, current health, and desired results.""'Tell the doctor if you get ''cold sores'' or ''fever blisters'' around your mouth. Laser skin resurfacing can trigger breakouts in people who are at risk.''If you decide to go ahead with laser skin resurfacing, your doctor will ask you to avoid taking any medications or ''supplements'' that can affect clotting -- such as ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'', or ''vitamin E'' -- for 10 days before surgery.''If you smoke, you should stop for two weeks before and after the procedure. ''Smoking'' can prolong healing.''Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic beforehand to prevent ''bacterial infections'' and also an antiviral medication if you are prone to ''cold sores'' or ''fever blisters''.' "
What to Expect,"'Generally, laser resurfacing is an outpatient procedure, meaning there is no overnight stay.''The doctor may treat individual wrinkles around your eyes, mouth, or forehead or treat your entire face. For small areas, the doctor will numb the areas to be treated with a local anesthetic. The doctor may also sedate you. You may get general anesthesia if your whole face is being treated.''If the doctor is just treating parts of your face, the procedure will take about 30 to 45 minutes. A full-face treatment takes up to two hours.'""Following the laser procedure, the doctor will bandage the treated area. Starting 24 hours after treatment, you will need to clean the treated area four to five times a day. Then you'll need to apply an ointment, such as petroleum jelly, to prevent scabs from forming. This ""'wound care'' is intended to prevent any scab formation. In general, the areas heal in 10 to 21 days, depending on the condition that was treated.'""It's normal to have swelling after laser skin resurfacing. Your doctor may prescribe steroids to manage swelling around your eyes. Sleeping on an extra pillow at night can help ease swelling. Putting an ice pack on the treated area also helps in the first 24 to 48 hours after laser resurfacing.""'You may feel ''itching'' or stinging for 12 to 72 hours after the procedure. Five to seven days after laser resurfacing, your skin will become dry and peel.''Once the skin heals, you can wear oil-free ''makeup'' to minimize redness, which usually fades in two to three months.''You will probably notice that your skin is lighter for a while after surgery. It is particularly important that you use a ""broad-spectrum"" ''sunscreen'', which screens ultraviolet B and ultraviolet A rays, to protect your skin during that time. When selecting a sunscreen, look for one specially formulated for use on the face. It should have a ''sun protection'' factor (''SPF'') of 50 or higher.''It is also important to keep your new skin well moisturized. If you use ''Retin A'' or glycolic acid products, you should be able to start using them again about six weeks after the procedure or when the doctor says you can.''Once the treated areas have healed, you can wear makeup to hide the pink to red color that is typically seen after laser skin resurfacing. Green-based make-ups are particularly suitable for this camouflage since they neutralize the red color. Oil-free make-ups are recommended after laser resurfacing. The redness in the laser treated sites generally fades in two to three months. But it may take as long as six months for the redness to completely disappear. Redness generally lasts longer in people with fair skin.''People with darker skin tones are more likely to get darker pigmentation. This may be minimized by using  a bleaching agent before and after laser skin resurfacing.' "
Complications of Laser Skin Resurfacing,"'Although skin resurfacing cannot produce perfect skin, it can improve the appearance of your skin. Potential risks of the procedure include:''Milia, which are small white ''bumps'', may appear in the laser-treated areas during healing. Your doctor can treat those.' Burns or other injuries from the laser's heat Scarring Changes in the skin's pigmentation, including areas of darker or lighter skin Reactivating herpes cold sores Bacterial infection"
Cost of Laser Skin Resurfacing,"'In 2011, the national average cost for laser skin resurfacing was about $2,300, according to the American Society of ''Plastic'' Surgeons. However, costs vary widely depending on where the procedure is being done.''Because laser skin resurfacing is considered a cosmetic procedure, most medical insurance companies will not cover it. There may be an exception if you get the procedure to modify scars or remove ''precancerous'' growths on your skin.''Talk with your doctor and your insurance company before the procedure about what the costs will be and what, if anything, insurance will pay for. Most doctors offer financing options.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Facts you should know about lupus," Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease. SLE is characterized by the production of unusual antibodies in the blood. The cause(s) of systemic lupus erythematosus is (are) unknown, however, heredity, viruses, ultraviolet light, and drugs all may play some role. Lupus symptoms and signs includebutterfly-shaped rash on the face,appetite loss,joint pain,hair loss,fever,fatigue,photosensitivity,Raynaud's phenomenon,pleuritis, andpericarditis. butterfly-shaped rash on the face, appetite loss, joint pain, hair loss, fever, fatigue, photosensitivity, Raynaud's phenomenon, pleuritis, and pericarditis. Up to 10% of people with lupus isolated to the skin will develop the systemic form of lupus (SLE). Eleven criteria help health care professionals to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus is directed toward decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity with anti-inflammatory medications for those with mild symptoms and corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy) for those with more severe lupus. People with systemic lupus erythematosus can prevent ""flares"" of disease by avoiding sun exposure, not abruptly discontinuing medications, and monitoring their condition with their doctor."
What is systemic lupus erythematosus? What are the different types of lupus?,"""Lupus is an autoimmune disease characterized by acute and chronic inflammation of various tissues of the body. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. The immune system is a complex system within the body that is designed to fight infectious agents, such as bacteria and other foreign microbes. One of the ways that the immune system fights infections is by producing antibodies that bind to the microbes. People with lupus produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body rather than foreign infectious agents. These antibodies are referred to as autoantibodies.""'Because the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can affect tissues anywhere in the body, lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas. Sometimes lupus can cause disease of the skin, ''heart'', ''lungs'', kidneys, joints, and/or nervous system. When only the skin is involved by ''rash'', the condition is called lupus ''dermatitis'' or cutaneous lupus erythematosus. A form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that can be isolated to the skin, without internal disease, is called discoid lupus erythematosus. When internal organs are involved, the condition is referred to as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).''Both discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus are more common in women than men (about eight times more common). The disease can affect all ages but most commonly begins from 20-45 years of age. Statistics demonstrate that lupus is somewhat more frequent in African Americans and people of Chinese and Japanese descent.' "
What are risk factors and causes of lupus? Is lupus hereditary? Is lupus contagious?,"'The precise reason for the abnormal autoimmunity that causes lupus is not known. ''Inherited'' genes, viruses, ultraviolet light, and certain medications may all play some role.''Lupus is not caused by an infectious microorganism and is not ''contagious'' from one person to another.''Genetic factors increase the tendency of developing autoimmune diseases, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and autoimmune ''thyroid disorders'' are more common among relatives of people with lupus than the general population. Moreover, it is possible to have more than one autoimmune disease in the same individual. Therefore, ""overlap"" syndromes of lupus and ''rheumatoid arthritis'', or lupus and ''scleroderma'', etc., can occur.''Some scientists believe that the immune system in lupus is more easily stimulated by external factors like viruses or ultraviolet light. Sometimes, ''symptoms of lupus'' can be precipitated or aggravated by only a brief period of sun exposure.''It also is known that some women with systemic lupus erythematosus can experience worsening of their symptoms prior to their menstrual periods. This phenomenon, together with the female predominance of systemic lupus erythematosus, suggests that female hormones play an important role in the expression of SLE. This hormonal relationship is an active area of ongoing study by scientists.''Research has demonstrated evidence that a key enzyme\'s failure to dispose of dying cells may contribute the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. The enzyme, DNase1, normally eliminates what is called ""garbage DNA"" and other cellular debris by chopping them into tiny fragments for easier disposal. Researchers turned off the DNase1 gene in mice. The mice appeared healthy at birth, but after six to eight months, the majority of mice without DNase1 showed signs of systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, a genetic mutation in a gene that could disrupt the body\'s cellular waste disposal may be involved in the initiation of systemic lupus erythematosus.' "
What is drug-induced lupus?,"'Dozens of medications have been reported to trigger SLE. However, more than 90% of cases of ""drug-induced lupus"" occurs as a side effect of one of the following six drugs: ''hydralazine'' (''Apresoline'') is used for ''high blood pressure''; ''quinidine'' (''Quinidine Gluconate'', ''Quinidine Sulfate'') and ''procainamide'' (Pronestyl; Procan-SR; Procanbid) are used for ''abnormal heart rhythms''; ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin'') is used for ''epilepsy''; ''isoniazid'' (Nydrazid, Laniazid) is used for ''tuberculosis''; and d-''penicillamine'' (used for ''rheumatoid arthritis'  "
What are lupus symptoms and signs?,"'People with SLE can develop different combinations of symptoms and organ involvement.''Common lupus complaints and symptoms and signs include''Complications of organ involvement can lead to further symptoms that depend on the organ affected and severity of the disease.''SLE-associated skin manifestations can sometimes lead to scarring. In discoid lupus, only the skin is typically involved. The skin rash in discoid lupus often is found on the face and ''scalp''. It usually is red and may have raised borders. Discoid lupus ''rashes'' are usually painless and do not ''itch'', but scarring can cause permanent ''hair loss'' (alopecia). Over time, 5%-10% of those with discoid lupus may develop SLE.''Over half of the people with SLE develop a characteristic red, flat facial rash over the ''bridge'' of their nose. Because of its shape, it is frequently referred to as the ""butterfly rash"" of SLE. The rash is painless and does not ''itch''. The facial rash, along with inflammation in other organs, can be precipitated or worsened by exposure to sunlight, a condition called photosensitivity. This photosensitivity can be accompanied by worsening of inflammation throughout the body, called a ""flare"" of the disease.''Typically, with treatment, this rash can heal without permanent scarring.''Most SLE patients will develop arthritis during the course of their illness. Arthritis from SLE commonly involves swelling, ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and even deformity of the small joints of the hands, wrists, and ''feet''. Sometimes, the arthritis of SLE can mimic that of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (another autoimmune disease).''More serious organ involvement with inflammation occurs in the brain, ''liver'', and kidneys. White blood cells can be decreased in SLE (referred to as leukopenia or leucopenia). Also, low blood-clotting factors called platelets (''thrombocytopenia'') can be caused by lupus. Leukopenia can increase the risk of infection, and ''thrombocytopenia'' can increase the risk of bleeding. Low red blood cell counts (hemolytic\xa0''anemia'') can occur.''Inflammation of muscles (''myositis'') can cause ''muscle pain'' and ''weakness''. This can lead to elevations of muscle enzyme levels in the blood.''Inflammation of blood vessels (''vasculitis'') that supply oxygen to tissues can cause isolated injury to a nerve, the skin, or an internal organ. The blood vessels are composed of arteries that pass oxygen-rich blood to the tissues of the body and veins that return oxygen-depleted blood from the tissues to the lungs. ''Vasculitis'' is characterized by inflammation with damage to the walls of various blood vessels. The damage blocks the circulation of blood through the vessels and can cause injury to the tissues that are supplied with oxygen by these vessels.''Inflammation of the lining of the lungs (pleuritis) with pain aggravated by deep ''breathing'' (''pleurisy'') and of the heart (pericarditis) can cause sharp ''chest pain''. The chest pain is aggravated by ''coughing'', deep breathing, and certain changes in body position. The heart muscle itself rarely can become inflamed (''carditis''). It has also been shown that young women with SLE have a significantly increased risk of ''heart attacks'' due to ''coronary artery disease''.''Kidney inflammation in SLE (lupus nephritis) can cause leakage of protein into the urine, fluid retention, ''high blood pressure'', and even ''kidney failure''. This can lead to further ''fatigue'' and swelling (''edema'') of the legs and feet. With ''kidney failure'', machines are needed to cleanse the blood of accumulated waste products in a process called ''dialysis''.''Involvement of the brain can cause personality changes, thought disorders (psychosis), ''seizures'', and even ''coma''. Lupus of the nervous system (neurologic lupus) can lead to damage to nerves cause numbness, tingling, and weakness of the involved body parts or extremities. Brain involvement is referred to as lupus cerebritis.''Many people with SLE experience ''hair loss'' (alopecia). Often, this occurs simultaneously with an increase in the activity of their disease. The hair loss can be patchy or diffuse and appear to be more like hair thinning.''Some people with SLE have '""Raynaud's"""" phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon causes the blood vessels of the hands and feet to spasm, especially upon exposure to cold. The blood supply to the fingers and/or toes then becomes compromised, causing blanching, whitish and/or bluish discoloration, and pain and numbness in the exposed fingers and toes.""'Other diseases and conditions that can accompany lupus include ''fibromyalgia'', coronary ''heart disease'', nonbacterial ''valvular heart disease'', ''pancreatitis'', ''esophagus'' disease with ''difficulty swallowing'' (''dysphagia''), ''swollen lymph nodes'' (''lymphadenopathy''), ''liver disease'' (lupoid ''hepatitis''), infections, and a tendency to spontaneous blood clotting and thrombosis.'   fatigue or feeling tired, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, joint pain, muscle aches, hair loss (alopecia), arthritis, ulcers of the mouth and nose, facial rash (""butterfly rash""), unusual sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity), chest pain caused by inflammation of the lining that surrounds the lungs (pleuritis) and the heart (pericarditis), and poor circulation to the fingers and toes with cold exposure (Raynaud's phenomenon)."
How do health care professionals diagnose lupus?,"'Since SLE patients can have a wide variety of symptoms and different combinations of organ involvement, no single blood test establishes the diagnosis of systemic lupus. To help doctors improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of SLE, 11 criteria were established by the American Rheumatism Association. These 11 criteria are closely related to the symptoms discussed above. Some people suspected of having SLE may never develop enough criteria for a definite diagnosis. Other people accumulate enough criteria only after months or years of observation. When a person has four or more of these criteria, the diagnosis of SLE is strongly suggested. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of SLE may be made in some settings in people with only a few of these classical criteria, and treatment may sometimes be instituted at this stage. Of these people with minimal criteria, some may later develop other criteria, but many never do.''The following are 11 criteria used for diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus:''In addition to the 11 criteria, other tests can be helpful in evaluating people with SLE to determine the severity of organ involvement. These include routine testing of the blood to detect inflammation (for example, the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'', or ESR, and the ''C-reactive protein'', or CRP), blood-chemistry testing, direct analysis of internal body fluids, and tissue biopsies. Abnormalities in body fluids (joint or cerebrospinal fluid) and tissue samples (kidney biopsy, ''skin biopsy'', and nerve biopsy) can further support the diagnosis of SLE. The appropriate testing procedures are selected for the patient individually by the doctor.' Malar rash (over the cheeks of the face) Discoid skin rash (patchy redness with hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation that can cause scarring) Photosensitivity (skin rash in reaction to sunlight [ultraviolet light] exposure) Mucous membrane ulcers (spontaneous sores or ulcers of the lining of the mouth, nose, or throat) Arthritis (two or more swollen, tender joints of the extremities) Pleuritis or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining tissue around the heart or lungs, usually associated with chest pain upon breathing or changes of body position) Kidney abnormalities (abnormal amounts of urine protein or clumps of cellular elements called casts detectable with a standard urinalysis)Note: Ultimately, in patients with kidney disease from systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus nephritis), a kidney biopsy may be necessary to both define the cause of the kidney disease as being lupus-related as well as to determine the stage of the kidney disease in order to optimally guide treatments. Kidney biopsies are often performed by fine-needle aspiration of the kidney under radiology guidance, but in certain circumstances, a kidney biopsy can be done during an open abdominal operation. Brain irritation (manifested by seizures [convulsions] and/or psychosis, referred to as ""lupus cerebritis"") Blood-count abnormalities: low white blood count (WBC) or red blood count (RBC), or platelet count on routine complete blood count testing; leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Each of these are detectable with standard complete blood count testing (CBC). Immunologic disorder (abnormal immune tests include anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) or anti-Sm [anti-Smith] antibodies, falsely positive blood test for syphilis, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, or positive LE prep test) Antinuclear antibody (positive ANA antibody testing [antinuclear antibodies in the blood])"
What specialties of health care professionals treat lupus?,"'Lupus is treated by internal medicine subspecialists called ''rheumatologists'"". Depending on whether or not specific organs are targeted, other health specialists who can be involved in the care of patients with lupus include dermatologists, nephrologists, hematologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, and neurologists. It's not uncommon that a team of such physicians is coordinated by the treating ""'rheumatologist'' together with the primary care doctor.' "
What is the treatment for lupus? Is there a cure for lupus?,"""There is no permanent cure for SLE. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and protect organs by decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity in the body. The precise treatment is decided on an individual basis. Many people with mild symptoms may need no treatment or only intermittent courses of anti-inflammatory medications. Those with more serious illness involving damage to internal organ(s) may require high doses of corticosteroids in combination with other medications that suppress the body's immune system.""'People with SLE need more rest during periods of active disease. Researchers have reported that poor ''sleep'' quality was a significant factor in developing fatigue in people with SLE. These reports emphasize the importance for people and physicians to address ''sleep'' quality and the effect of underlying ''depression'', lack of ''exercise'', and self-care coping strategies on overall health. During these periods, carefully prescribed ''exercise'' is still important to maintain muscle tone and range of motion in the joints.''To protect from sun sensitivity, sunscreens, sun avoidance, and ''sun protection'' clothing are used. Certain types of lupus rash can respond to topical cortisone medications.''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') are helpful in reducing inflammation and pain in muscles, joints, and other tissues. Examples of NSAIDs include ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), and ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''). Since the individual response to NSAIDs varies, it is common for a doctor to try different NSAIDs to find the most effective one with the fewest side effects. The most common side effects are stomach upset, ''abdominal pain'', ulcers, and even ulcer bleeding. NSAIDs are usually taken with food to reduce side effects. Sometimes, medications that prevent ulcers while taking NSAIDs, such as ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec''), are given simultaneously.''Corticosteroids are more potent than NSAIDs in reducing inflammation and restoring function when the disease is active. Corticosteroids are particularly helpful when internal organs are affected. Corticosteroids can be given by mouth, injected directly into the joints and other tissues, or administered intravenously. Unfortunately, corticosteroids have serious side effects when given in high doses over prolonged periods, and the doctor will try to monitor the activity of the disease in order to use the lowest doses that are safe. Side effects of corticosteroids include ''weight gain'', thinning of the bones and skin, infection, ''diabetes'', facial puffiness, ''cataracts'', and death (necrosis) of the tissues in large joints.''Hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil) is an antimalarial medication found to be particularly effective for SLE patients with fatigue, skin involvement, and joint disease. Consistently taking Plaquenil can prevent flare-ups of lupus. Side effects are uncommon but include ''diarrhea'', ''upset stomach'', and eye-pigment changes. Eye-pigment changes are rare but require monitoring by an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) during treatment with Plaquenil. Researchers have found that Plaquenil significantly decreased the frequency of abnormal ''blood clots'' in people with systemic lupus. Moreover, the effect seemed independent of immune suppression, implying that Plaquenil can directly act to prevent the blood clots. This fascinating study highlights an important reason for people and doctors to consider Plaquenil for long-term use, especially for those SLE people who are at some risk for blood clots in veins and arteries, such as those with phospholipid antibodies (cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and false-positive ''venereal disease'' research laboratory test). This means not only that Plaquenil reduces the chance for re-flares of SLE, but it can also be beneficial in thinning the blood to prevent abnormal excessive blood clotting. Plaquenil is commonly used in combination with other treatments for lupus.''For resistant skin disease, other antimalarial drugs, such as ''chloroquine'' (''Aralen'') or quinacrine, are considered and can be used in combination with hydroxychloroquine. Alternative medications for skin disease include ''dapsone'' and retinoic acid (Retin-A). Retin-A is often effective for an uncommon wart-like form of lupus skin disease. For more severe skin disease, immunosuppressive medications are considered as described below.''Medications that suppress immunity (immunosuppressive medications) are also called cytotoxic drugs. They are sometimes referred to as chemotherapy because they are also used to treat ''cancer'', generally in much higher doses than those used to treat lupus. Immunosuppressive medications are used for treating people with more severe manifestations of SLE, such as damage to internal organ(s). Examples of immunosuppressive medications include ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune''), and the disease-modifying drug ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). All immunosuppressive medications can seriously depress blood-cell counts and increase risks of infection and bleeding. Immunosuppressive medications may not be taken during ''pregnancy'' or ''conception'' because of risk to the fetus. Other side effects are specific for each drug. For examples, methotrexate can cause liver toxicity, while cyclosporine can impair kidney function.''In recent years, ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''CellCept'') has been used as an effective medication for lupus, particularly when it is associated with kidney disease. CellCept has been helpful in reversing active lupus kidney disease (lupus ''renal disease'') and in maintaining remission after it is established. Its lower side-effect profile has advantage over traditional immune-suppression medications.''In lupus patients with serious brain (lupus cerebritis) or kidney disease (lupus nephritis), plasmapheresis is sometimes used to remove antibodies and other immune substances from the blood to suppress immunity. Plasmapheresis is a process of removing blood and passing the blood through a filtering machine, then returning the blood to the body with its antibodies removed. Rarely, people with SLE can develop seriously low platelet levels, thereby increasing the risk of excessive and spontaneous bleeding. Since the spleen is believed to be the major site of platelet destruction, surgical removal of the spleen is sometimes performed to improve platelet levels. Other treatments have included plasmapheresis and the use of male hormones.''Plasmapheresis has also been used to remove certain harmful proteins (cryoglobulins) that can lead to vasculitis. End-stage kidney damage from SLE requires dialysis and/or a ''kidney transplant''.''Research is indicating benefits of ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') in treating lupus. Rituximab is an intravenously infused antibody that suppresses a particular white blood cell, the B cell, by decreasing their number in the circulation. B cells have been found to play a central role in lupus activity, and when they are suppressed, the disease tends toward remission. This may particularly helpful for people with kidney disease.''Another new B-cell-suppressing treatment is ''belimumab'' (''Benlysta''). Belimumab blocks the stimulation of the B cells (a B-lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS-specific inhibitor) and is approved for the treatment of adults with active autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus who are receiving standard therapy. It is important to note that the efficacy of belimumab has not been evaluated in patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus. Belimumab has not been studied in combination with other biologic therapies or intravenous cyclophosphamide.'  "
Is there a lupus diet?,"'While there is no specific lupus ''diet'', scientists have found that low-dose ''diet'' supplementation with ''omega-3'' fish oils could help patients with lupus by decreasing inflammation and disease activity and possibly decreasing heart-disease risk. It is generally recommended that patients with lupus eat a balanced diet that includes plant-based foods and lean sources of protein.''DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) has been helpful in reducing fatigue, improving thinking difficulties, and improving quality of life in people with SLE. Recent research indicates that DHEA diet supplementation has been shown to improve or stabilize signs and symptoms of SLE. DHEA is commonly available in health-food stores, pharmacies, and many groceries.'  "
How can a lupus patient help prevent disease activity (flares)?,"'SLE is undoubtedly a potentially serious illness with involvement of numerous organ systems. However, it is important to recognize that most people with SLE lead full, active, and healthy lives. Periodic increases in disease activity (flares) can usually be managed by varying medications. Since ultraviolet light can precipitate and worsen flares, people with systemic lupus should avoid sun exposure. Sunscreens and clothing covering the extremities can be helpful. Abruptly stopping medications, especially corticosteroids, can also cause flares and should be avoided. People with SLE are at increased risk of infections as SLE-related complications, especially if they are taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications. Therefore, any unexpected fever should be reported to medical professionals and evaluated.''The key to successful management of SLE is regular contact and communication with the doctor, allowing monitoring of symptoms, disease activities, and treatment of side effects.' "
How can systemic lupus erythematosus affect pregnancy or the newborn?,"'Lupus pregnancy deserves special review because it presents unique challenges. ''Pregnant'' women with SLE are considered high-risk ''pregnancies''. These pregnancies require interactive monitoring generally by a skilled rheumatologist together with an obstetrician expert in high-risk pregnancies. Women with SLE who are pregnant require close observation during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period. This includes fetal monitoring by the obstetrician during later pregnancy. These women can have an increased risk of miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) and can have flares of SLE during pregnancy. The presence of phospholipid antibodies, such as cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant, in the blood can identify people at risk for miscarriages. Cardiolipin antibodies are associated with a tendency toward blood clotting. Women with SLE who have cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant may need blood-thinning medications (aspirin with or without ''heparin'') during pregnancy to prevent miscarriages. Other reported treatments include the use of intravenous gamma globulin for selected people with histories of premature ''miscarriage'' and those with low blood-clotting elements (platelets) during pregnancy. Pregnant women who have had a previous blood-clotting event may benefit by continuation of blood-thinning medications throughout and after pregnancy for up to six to 12 weeks, at which time the risk of clotting associated with pregnancy seems to diminish. Plaquenil has now been found to be safe for use to treat SLE during pregnancy. Corticosteroids, such as ''prednisone'', are also safely used to treat certain manifestation of lupus during pregnancy.''Lupus antibodies can be transferred from the mother to the fetus and result in lupus illness in the ''newborn'' (""''neonatal'' lupus""). This includes the development of low red cell counts (hemolytic anemia) and/or white blood cell counts (leucopenia) and platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and skin rash. Problems can also develop in the electrical system of the baby\'s heart (congenital ''heart block''). Occasionally, a ''pacemaker'"" for the baby's heart is needed in this setting. Neonatal lupus and congenital heart block are more common in newborns of mothers with SLE who carry specific antibodies referred to as anti-Ro (or anti-SSA) and anti-La (or anti-SSB). (It is helpful for the newborn baby's doctor to be made aware if the mother is known to carry these antibodies, even prior to delivery. The risk of heart block is 2%; the risk of neonatal lupus is 5%.) Neonatal lupus usually clears after 6 months of age, as the mother's antibodies are slowly metabolized by the baby."" "
What is the prognosis of lupus? What does the future hold for people with systemic lupus?,"'Overall, the outlook for people living with systemic lupus is improving each decade with the development of more accurate monitoring tests and treatments.''The role of the immune system in causing diseases is becoming better understood through research. This knowledge will be applied to design safer and more effective treatment methods. For example, completely revising the immune system of people with extremely aggressive treatments that virtually temporarily wipe out the immune system is being evaluated. Current studies involve immune eradication with or without replacement of cells that can reestablish the immune system (stem-cell transplantation).''It should be noted that people with SLE are at a somewhat increased risk for developing ''cancer''. The ''cancer'' risk is most dramatic for blood ''cancers'', such as ''leukemia'' and ''lymphoma'', but is also increased for ''breast cancer''. This risk probably relates, in part, to the altered immune system that is characteristic of SLE.''Women with SLE appear to be at increased risk for ''heart disease'' (''coronary artery disease'') according to recent reports. Women with SLE should be evaluated and counseled to minimize risk factors for ''heart disease'', such as elevated blood ''cholesterol'', quitting ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', and ''obesity''.''Landmark research has shown clearly that ''oral contraceptives'' do not increase the rate of flares of systemic lupus erythematosus. This important finding is opposite to what has been thought for years. Now we can reassure women with lupus that if they take birth-control pills, they are not increasing their risk for lupus flares. ''Note'': Women who are at increased risk of blood clotting, such as women with lupus who have phospholipid antibodies (including cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant), should avoid birth-control pills or any estrogen medications.''Individuals living with SLE can improve their long-term prognosis by learning about the many aspects of the illness as well as closely monitoring their own health with their doctors.'

Where can one get more information about systemic lupus erythematosus?,"'For more information about systemic lupus erythematosus, see the following sites:''The Arthritis Foundation (http://www.arthritis.org)''PO Box 19000''Atlanta, GA 30326''Lupus Foundation of Minnesota (http://www.lupusmn.org)' "
What is sleep?,"'Physiologically, ''sleep'' is a complex process of restoration and renewal for the body. Scientists still do not have a definitive explanation for why humans have a need for sleep. We do know that sleep is not a passive process or ""switching off"" of body functions; sleep is believed to be important in many physiologic processes including the processing of experiences and the consolidation of memories. It is also clear that sleep is essential, not only for humans but for almost all animals. ''The importance of sleep is underscored by the symptoms experienced by those suffering from sleep problems. People suffering from ''sleep disorders'' do not get adequate or restorative sleep, and sleep deprivation is associated with a number of both physical and emotional disturbances.' "
What causes the body to sleep?,"'Sleep is influenced by the circadian rhythms (regular body changes in mental and physical characteristics that occur in the course of about 24 hours). These are controlled by brain neurons that respond to light, temperature and hormones and other signals and comprise the body\'s biological clock. This clock helps regulate the ""normal"" awake and sleep cycles. Disruption of these cycles can make people sleepy, or somnolent, at times people want to be awake. For example, ''travelers'' experience ""''jet lag''"" when they cross time zones. When a New Yorker arrives in Paris at midnight Paris time, his or her body continues to operate (their biological clock) on New York time. It may take several days to reset a person\'s biologic clock, depending on how much it has been altered by the time change. Different organ systems in the body recover at different rates.''There is evidence that some aspects of sleep are under genetic influence; a gene termed DEC2 is being investigated as causing people that possess it to require only about 6 hours of sleep. Researchers have only begun to examine the genetics involved in sleep.' "
What are the stages of sleep?,"'There are two general states of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. NREM sleep is further subdivided (see below).''Disruptions in the entire sleep cycle or in the individual phases are believed to account for the various types of sleep disorders.' REM sleep (rapid-eye movement): REM sleep is unlike any of the other stages of sleep. It was first described in 1953 when sleep researchers noticed a unique pattern of brain waves (signals recorded on an electroencephalogram (EEG), a type of test that measures the electrical impulses within the brain). These brain waves had a fast frequency and low voltage, similar to the brain waves seen in the normal awake state. Other characteristics of REM sleep include complete inactivity of the voluntary muscles in the body, with the exception of the muscles that control eye movements. Rapid eye movements are also observed during REM sleep. People who are awakened during REM sleep often report that they were dreaming at the time. About 20% to 25% of sleep time is REM sleep; in infants it can comprise about 40%. NREM (non-rapid eye movement): NREM sleep occurs in 3 stages, according to the pattern of brain electrical activity: Stage N1 sleep, or the transition from wakefulness to deeper sleep. This is the lightest stage of sleep, and people may not always perceive they are asleep when in this stage. Stage N2 sleep is a true sleep state, and accounts for 40% to 50% of sleep time. Stage N3 sleep has been called deep sleep, delta sleep, or slow wave sleep. This stage accounts for about 20% of sleep in young adults."
How long does it take to get REM sleep?,"""Sleep typically occurs in cycles that range from 90 to 120 minutes in length, with 4 to 5 cycles occurring during each night's sleep. In the first half of the night, there is a transition from wakefulness into stage N1 sleep, then to stages N2, and N3. Stages N2 and N3 then reappear, followed by the first instance of REM sleep. Cycles of stage N2 and REM sleep alternate with each other for the second half of the night. Typically, there is a greater portion of N sleep in the first half of the night and REM sleep in the later portion of the night."" "
Why is REM sleep important?,"'REM sleep makes up less than 25% of total sleep time, and the reason for its importance is not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that REM sleep is necessary for the brain to preserve memories and maintain appropriate neurological connections.' "
What percentage of sleep should be deep sleep?,"'Deep (N3) sleep, as defined above, only accounts for about 20% of total sleep. The largest amount of deep sleep takes place in the first half of the night.' "
How much sleep does a person need?,"'Individuals vary greatly in their need for sleep; there are no established criteria to determine exactly how much sleep a person needs. Eight hours or more may be necessary for some people, while others may consider this to be too much sleep.''The National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that most average adults need about 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. ''Newborn'' ''babies'', by contrast, sleep from 16 to 18 hours a day. Preschool-aged children typically sleep between 10 and 12 hours a day. Older, school-aged children and ''teens'' need at least 9 hours of sleep a night. Women in the ''first trimester'' of ''pregnancy'"" have been observed to need a few more hours' sleep than is usual for them."" "
Does the amount of sleep we need change as we age?,"'Changes in the sleep cycle do occur with ''aging''. Deep or slow wave sleep (Stage N3) sleep declines as we age, while light sleep (Stage N1) increases with age, so that older adults may spend less time in the more restorative stages of sleep and more time in lighter sleep. Older people are also more easily aroused from sleep. While some people believe that older adults need less sleep as they get older, there is no scientific evidence that older people need less sleep than younger adults.' "
What are signs and symptoms of sleep deprivation?,"'Feeling tired or drowsy at any time during the day is one symptom of not having enough sleep. Being able to fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down in the evening also may be a sign a person may be suffering from sleep deprivation. People who suffer from sleep deprivation often experience so-called ""microsleeps,"" which are short bursts of sleep in an otherwise awake person.''Sleep-deprived people perform poorly on tests such as driving simulators and tests of hand-eye coordination. Sleep deprivation can also magnify the effects of ''alcohol'', meaning that a sleep-deprived person will be more susceptible to becoming impaired after alcohol consumption than a well-rested person. ''Caffeine'' and other ''stimulants'' cannot successfully overcome the drowsiness associated with sleep deprivation.'  "
What are and what causes sleep disorders?,"'Sleep disorders are disruptions of the sleep cycle or the quality of sleep. About 50 to 70 million Americans are believed to suffer from chronic sleep disorders, with millions more affected on an occasional basis. Doctors have defined over 70 different types of sleep disorders, but the most common sleep disorders are ''insomnia'', ''sleep apnea'', ''restless legs syndrome'', and ''narcolepsy''.''Other sleep disorders include:'   Insomnia is the perception of poor-quality sleep, including the inability to fall asleep or stay asleep. Because people differ in their need for sleep, there are no fixed criteria that define insomnia. Insomnia is very common and occurs in 30% of the general population. Approximately 10% of the population may suffer from chronic (long-standing) insomnia. Sleep onset insomnia is characterized as occurring at the beginning of the desired sleep time and lasting for greater than 30 minutes. Sleep maintenance insomnia is when individuals fall asleep, but awaken periodically or for lengthy periods during the night, increasing the wake-after-sleep-onset (WASO). Sleep apnea is another common sleep disorder characterized by a reduction or pause of breathing (airflow) during sleep. Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain does not send the signal to the muscles to take a breath, and there is no muscular effort to take a breath. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the brain sends the signal to the muscles and the muscles make an effort to take a breath, but they are unsuccessful because the airway becomes obstructed and prevents an adequate flow of air. Mixed sleep apnea occurs when there is both central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea. Restless leg syndrome (RLS), also known as nocturnal myoclonus, is a type of sleep disorder characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable desire to move the legs. These abnormal sensations usually occur in the lower legs during the evening. Periodic leg movements (PLMs) are related to RLS, but occur after the onset of sleep and are labeled as a sleep disorder or syndrome when the movements cause increased activity in the brain. During the early stages of sleep, these episodes of leg movement often last up to an hour. The abnormal sensations of RLS are quite variable. They have been described as a crawling, creeping, pulling, drawing, tingling, pins and needles, or prickly discomfort. They are not cramping in character. Patients with RLS may have difficulty falling asleep because of the difficulty getting comfortable and an increased urge to move their legs. Many patients with RLS will have PLMs and vice versa, but they are not the same disorder. Narcolepsy is a disease of the central nervous system that results uniformly in excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Other primary symptoms of narcolepsy include the loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), distorted perceptions (hypnagogic hallucinations), and the inability to move or talk (sleep paralysis). Additional symptoms can include disturbed nocturnal sleep and automatic behaviors (affected persons carry out certain actions without conscious awareness). All of the symptoms of narcolepsy may be present in various combinations and degrees of severity. periodic limb movement disorder hypersomnia sleepwalking snoring REM sleep behavior disorder nightmares, and circadian rhythm disorders, and night shift work sleep disorder"
How are sleep problems diagnosed?,"""Doctors use a number of different tests to evaluate sleep and determine whether a sleep disorder is present. A careful medical history and physical examination are performed to help identify any medical conditions that may be interfering with the person's sleep. The health care practitioner will also ask about the use of prescription and non-prescription medications as well as alcohol, tobacco, and ""'caffeine'' use. Laboratory tests may also be used to help diagnose any medical conditions that may cause sleep problems.''In some cases, specialized testing is recommended to help determine whether or not a person may be suffering from a sleep disorder. Some of the most common sleep tests include the following:' Polysomnography is often simply referred to as a ""sleep study."" Full sleep studies with additional information about the patterns and events during sleep are most commonly performed in specially designed labs in hospitals or clinics. In this test, functions such as airflow, breathing effort, blood oxygen levels, leg movements, electrocardiogram (ECG), and body position may be measured along with electrodes attached to the face and scalp to measure brain waves (electroencephalogram or EEG) and muscle tone during a night's sleep. Newer technologies have allowed the assessment of sleep disordered breathing in a patient's home setting. This type of out-of-lab testing with a portable sleep monitor usually follows a clinical evaluation by a sleep specialist.  The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is designed to measure daytime sleepiness. The test is based upon the fact that the sleepier an individual is, the faster he or she will fall asleep. In this test, the patient is given four to five opportunities to nap in a quiet, dark room, usually at two hour intervals during the day. Body functions such as EEG and muscle tone are measured as in polysomnography. The time period needed from wakefulness to sleep onset is measured to determine the ""sleep latency."" This is repeated during each of the naps, and an average time for sleep latency across all the naps is calculated. Usually a sleep latency of 5 minutes or less is signifies severe daytime sleepiness. Related to the MSLT is the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), which measures the individual's ability to stay awake when reclining in a quiet, darkened room. The Epworth sleepiness scale is a questionnaire that is given to patients, often as part of an office visit to a health care practitioner. The test asks individuals to rate how likely they would be to fall asleep in a number of situations (such as a passenger in a car, sitting quietly after lunch, etc.)."
How are sleep problems treated?,"'The treatment of sleep disorders depends upon the exact disorder and the degree of severity of the symptoms. Both medical and non-medical approaches are generally used in the treatment of sleep disorders. In some cases, such as sleep apnea, surgical treatments may be considered. In some patients, more than one type of sleep disorder may be present, requiring a combination of treatment considerations.'  "
Sleep hygiene,"'Non-medical treatment options are often referred to as sleep hygiene. Sleep hygiene is the practice of behavioral habits that offer the maximum potential for restorative and sound sleep. Good sleep hygiene practices include:' Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol use before bedtime. Some studies have shown that caffeine consumed early in the day can have an effect on the ability to fall asleep at night. Have and adhere to a regular bedtime and waking schedule. Maintain a comfortable sleep environment, including a comfortable temperature. Avoid watching television or using electronics with backlit screens in bed and falling asleep with the TV on in 
	the room. Do not lie in bed awake, worrying about not sleeping (or anything else negative). This produces anxiety that can actually make the problem worse. Get regular daily exercise (it is recommended that individuals avoid exercise two hours prior to bedtime)."
Other therapies,"'Of course, many people with sleep disorders will require treatment beyond sleep hygiene measures. ''Behavioral therapies'' are successful for many people who suffer from insomnia. These therapies may consist of stimulus control measures, such as using the bed for sleeping and sex only and not for other activities such as reading or TV watching. ''Sleep restriction therapies'' are often used to help individuals avoid staying in bed too long and actually over-sleeping after a night of insomnia.' "
Sleep aids (prescription and OTC),"'Medications'' can be of value in treating some types of sleep disorders. However, since sedating medications typically have the potential for ''addiction'' and abuse, their use must be carefully supervised by a health care practitioner. Among the types of prescription ''drugs'' that have been prescribed for specific sleep disorders include:''OTC sleep medications'' are sometimes used for the short-term treatment of insomnia. These include the sedating ''antihistamines'' such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''). However, this is not a recommended use of these or other similar drugs due to their many side effects and the possibility of long-term drowsiness the following day.''Melatonin'', a chemical released from the brain which induces sleep, has been tried in supplement form and promoted as a natural sleep remedy for treatment of insomnia. But studies have shown that it has been generally ineffective in treating common types of insomnia, except in specific situations in patients with known low levels of melatonin.''CPAP'' devices'' (continuous positive airway pressure; a device worn over the face that holds the airway open by maintaining constant air pressure) or AutoPAP (PAP delivered over a range of pressures) and ''dental appliances'' have been effective in the management of sleep-related breathing disorders, including sleep apnea. CPAP is typically the first line of therapy for most adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Surgery can be effective for some patients and may help patients respond to CPAP. Newer, implantable devices that stimulate the muscles of the upper airway during sleep may also be a treatment option for some patients.' Benzodiazepines, such as triazolam (Halcion), temazepam (Restoril), and lorazepam (Ativan) Newer, non-benzodiazepine sedative drugs: zaleplon (Sonata), zolpidem (Ambien or Ambien CR, Zolpimist), and eszopiclone (Lunesta). Ramelteon (Rozerem), an insomnia drug that acts by mimicking the action of melatonin (see below) Suvorexant (Belsomra) is the first in a new class of drugs known as orexin receptor antagonists (ORAs for the treatment of insomnia. Suvorexant works by promoting the natural transition from wakefulness to sleep by inhibiting the wakefulness-promoting orexin neurons of the arousal system. Antidepressant medications have been used to treat insomnia in people who may also suffer from depression. Examples are trazodone (Desyrel), amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), and doxepin (Sinequan, Adapin). A number of prescription drugs have been used to treat restless legs syndrome, including carbidopa-levodopa, opioids (such as propoxyphene [Darvon, Darvon-N, Dolene]) or tramadol (Ultram) for intermittent symptoms, carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR , Equetro, Carbatrol),clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium, Diastat), triazolam (Halcion), temazepam (Restoril), baclofen, bromocriptine, clonidine (Catapres, Catapres-TTS, Jenloga), gabapentin (Neurontin), ropinirole (Requip) and pramipexole (Mirapex). In sleep apnea and other sleep disorders in which airway obstruction is a problem, topical nasal decongestants may provide some relief. However, many clinicians warn people with sleep apnea never to use sleeping pills or medications that are sedative as the person could be prevented from waking enough to stimulate breathing, which could lead to brain damage or sudden death."
Are sleep problems and disease related?,"'Sleep problems occur in a number of different medical and psychiatric conditions. For example, ''asthma'' attacks and ''stroke'' are conditions that tend to occur frequently during the night or early morning hours. The relationship between sleep stages and certain types of epileptic ''seizures'' is complex and not completely understood, but certain sleep stages tend to either exacerbate or prevent the spread of ''seizure'' activity in the brain. ''Sleep problems occur with ''chronic pain'' and conditions in which ''pain'' is worse at night, because the ''pain'"" may interfere with sleep. Pain medications and other types of medications taken on a regular basis for chronic conditions can also have an effect on an individual's sleep pattern. Those suffering from ""'cancer'', '""Alzheimer's""' disease, and ''brain injury'' are also commonly affected by sleep disturbances.''Psychiatric diseases such as ''depression'' are also associated with sleep problems. This condition can be associated with both too much sleep and too little sleep. In fact, sleep problems are associated with a majority of mental disorders, and poor quality or insufficient sleep can worsen the symptoms of mental or psychiatric conditions.' "
How can I get a good night's sleep?,"'Practicing good sleep hygiene (see above), including maintenance of a regular bedtime and awakening schedule, is the best way to ensure restful and restorative sleep. Avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and strenuous exercise in the hours prior to bedtime can also help improve the quality of your sleep. Many people report that they lie awake at night worrying about problems or situations they will face during the coming day. In this case, it can be helpful to write a to-do list or a list of items to act upon the following day prior to bedtime, giving yourself permission to ""let go"" of these items during the night. ''If you are concerned about the quality of your sleep or if you have the symptoms of a sleep disorder, it is important to consult your health care practitioner. He or she can help you determine the cause of your sleep problem and recommend appropriate therapy.' "
What is insomnia and what causes it?,"'Insomnia'' is difficulty falling or staying asleep, the absence of restful ''sleep'', or poor quality of ''sleep''. ''Insomnia'' is a symptom and not a disease. The most common causes of ''insomnia'' are:''Insomnia can also be caused by poor sleeping habits such as excessive daytime naps or ''caffeine'' consumption and poor sleep hygiene. ''The American Academy of Sleep Medicine estimates 30% of adults have some symptoms of insomnia, 10% have insomnia symptoms so severe they cause consequences such as daytime sleepiness, and less than 10% have chronic insomnia.''Insomnia may be classified by how long the symptoms are present.''Transient insomnia may progress to short-term insomnia and without adequate treatment short-term insomnia may become chronic insomnia.

What are natural treatments for insomnia?,"'There are several ways insomnia may be treated without use of \tmedication. These include behavioral modification and use of natural herbal \tremedies.''When a person consults a doctor about insomnia, they may be asked to keep a sleep log for several weeks to monitor sleep habits. The treatment options for short-term or chronic insomnia include not only medications, but often sleep habit and behavioral modifications for optimal long-term results.''Evaluating sleep habits is important in the management of insomnia. Treatment of underlying ''sleep disorders'' and in some instances, changing sleep habits may correct the problem without the need for medications.

Can melatonin treat insomnia?,"'Melatonin'"" (for example, Melatonex) is the only hormone available OTC for insomnia. Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland that helps regulate the body's clock or sleep-wake cycle. The secretion of melatonin is increased by darkness and decreased by light. The exact mechanism of how melatonin induces sleep has not been determined. Melatonin also decreases mental alertness and body temperature.""'Melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement and is, therefore, not regulated by the FDA. It is commonly used for jet lag, insomnia, and sleep disturbances related to working night shifts. Some limited evidence suggests melatonin may be useful for treating sleep disturbances.''In 2005, MIT analyzed 17 peer-reviewed studies using melatonin. The analysis showed that melatonin was effective in helping people fall asleep at doses of 0.3 milligrams (mg). In some preparations the dosage of melatonin is significantly higher and these larger doses have shown to be less effective after only a few days of use. If possible, patients may want to stay with the same formulation or brand if it is effective for them.''If a person would like to try melatonin tablets, consult a doctor first.''Dosing:'' There is no established dose or time of administration. Individuals should follow the product labeling for dosing and administration.''Pregnancy'' and lactation:'' The use of melatonin during pregnancy or lactation has not been studied adequately.\xa0Based on past experience with other agents and the possibility of unknown risks to the fetus, melatonin should be avoided during pregnancy while ''breastfeeding''. Consult your doctor before you use melatonin if you are ''pregnant'' or breastfeeding.''Children:'' The use of melatonin in children may be effective, particularly in children with disturbed sleep due to ''autism'' spectrum disorders. However, it should not be used as a first-choice treatment in children. Consult your pediatrician before giving your child melatonin for sleep.''Drug interactions'':'' Although melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement, it should be thought of as a drug. It has side effects and may have drug interactions that have not been identified. The level of melatonin that the body produces is increased by certain drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants or SRRIs (for example, fluoxetine [Prozac], ''sertraline'' [''Zoloft''], ''paroxetine'' [''Paxil'']) and ''monoamine oxidase inhibitors'' (for example, tranylcypromine [Parnate], phenelzine [Nardil]). The interaction between these antidepressants and melatonin\xa0 used as a sleeping aid has not been assessed.''Side effects:'' The most common adverse effect of melatonin is drowsiness. Therefore, tasks that require alertness (for example, driving) should be avoided for four to five hours after taking melatonin. Melatonin also may also cause ''itching'', abnormal heartbeats, and ''headaches''. Melatonin appears to be safe when used short-term (less than three months). Long-term side effects of melatonin are unkown.''Melatonin is either derived from animal sources or synthesized in a laboratory. Melatonin obtained from animal sources has a higher likelihood of contamination, which can cause ''allergic'' reactions and viral transmission, than synthetic melatonin.''Melatonin may stimulate the immune system. People with severe ''allergies'' or other disorders that may be caused by an overactive immune system (for example, ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'') should avoid using melatonin.''Other herbal products: '' Natural herbal ''supplements'' such as ''valerian'', chamomile, ''kava'' kava, and others have been touted as remedies for insomnia; however, the safety or effectiveness of these products has not been documented. Consult your doctor before taking any herbal ''supplements'' to treat insomnia.' "
"What over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are there for 
insomnia?",'Self-treatment of insomnia with ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) drugs is advisable only for transient or short-term insomnia. OTC sleep aids should only be used for a short period of time in conjunction with changes in sleeping habits. Chronic use of these drugs may result in dependence on them. This creates a situation in which sleep is not possible unless the drug is used. Chronic insomnia should be evaluated by a physician. '  
Antihistamines,"'Diphenhydramine'' (for example, Sominex, Nytol) and doxylamine (for example, Unisom) are antihistamines currently marketed as OTC sleep aids. Diphenhydramine is the only agent considered to be safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration.  Other uses for diphenhydramine include ''allergies'', ''motion sickness'', and ''cough'' suppression. Scientists believe that diphenhydramine and doxylamine cause sedation by blocking the action of histamine in the brain, but the exact mechanism of action is not known. ''If insomnia is associated with ''pain'', there are numerous products containing a combination of an ''antihistamine'' and ''pain reliever''. These combination products should not be used if ''pain'' is not present because the added pain reliever is not necessary.''Pregnancy and lactation:''  The effects of diphenhydramine and doxylamine on the fetus have not been evaluated adequately. Diphenhydramine\xa0 is classified as a pregnancy ""category B"" drug, and is routinely safely used during pregnancy. Although the likelihood of an adverse effect on the fetus is low, sleeping agents probably should be avoided during pregnancy. Both agents may decrease lactation (production of milk). Additionally, these drugs are secreted into the ''breast milk'', which could affect the ''newborn''. ''Nursing'' mothers should avoid both drugs. Consult a physician if you are pregnant and have insomnia.''Children: ''Children less than 12 years of age should not use doxylamine because its use in this in age group has not been assessed.''Elderly:'' Sedative effects of these drugs may interact with other potentially sedating medications. Consult a doctor before using these drugs.''Drug interactions:''  Diphenhydramine and doxylamine add to the sedative effects of alcohol and other medications that cause drowsiness.''Side effects:''  Drowsiness is the most frequent side effect of both diphenhydramine and doxylamine. These agents should not be used in situations where mental alertness is required (for example, driving). Diphenhydramine and doxylamine also cause ''constipation'', dry mouth, and ''difficulty urinating''. Both drugs may worsen the symptoms of ''glaucoma'', ''asthma'', ''heart'' problems, and prostate gland enlargement. People with these conditions should not use OTC sleep aids without consulting a physician.''Both drugs may paradoxically cause excitation, resulting in nervousness and insomnia. This occurs most often in children and the elderly.' "

What stimulant products are available OTC?,"'People with insomnia often suffer from ''fatigue'' as a result of sleep deprivation. Stimulant products are frequently used in an attempt to offset ''fatigue'' and other unpleasant side effects that can accompany a lack of sleep. (These products are also used by people who need to stay awake for longer periods of time than is normal for them, such as for school examinations or long distance driving.)  However, the use of stimulant products can also cause insomnia, leading to a counterproductive effort to deal with sleep deprivation.' "
Caffeine,"'Caffeine (for example, NoDoz, Caffedrine) is the sole active ingredient in most non-prescription stimulants. It is the only drug approved by the FDA for this purpose. Caffeine is used for improving alertness and for staying awake. Caffeine is a powerful stimulant, but tolerance (the need to use increasing amounts) can be developed.  Caffeine also is present in medications for ''menstrual cramps'', ''headaches'', and colds. Additionally, caffeine is found in coffee, tea, soft ''drinks'', and ''chocolate''. ''Caffeine increases alertness by stimulating the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. It decreases muscle ''fatigue'' by stimulating muscle contraction. Caffeine also increases the heart rate and the force of contraction of the heart. The effect of caffeine varies among individuals and some people are only affected minimally.''Pregnancy and lactation:''  Studies have shown that moderate caffeine intake does not cause low birth weights, miscarriages, or premature births. However, there are reports of birth problems in women who consume more than 300 milligrams per day of caffeine. Daily caffeine intake should probably be limited to less than 300 milligrams during pregnancy. '""Caffeine passes into breast milk. The concentration of caffeine in breast milk is approximately one-percent of the amount in the mother's blood. A lack of sleep and irritation may occur in ""'breastfed'' infants whose mothers consume more than 600 milligrams of caffeine per day. No adverse effects have been noted in breastfed infants whose mothers consume between 200-336 milligrams per day of caffeine. A mother can limit the amount of caffeine her infant receives by limiting the amount of her caffeine intake and ingesting the caffeine after nursing.''Children:''   Caffeine is not recommended for children less than 12 years of age.''Drug interactions:''''Cimetidine'' (''Tagamet''), ''norfloxacin''''Noroxin'', ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro''), and the ''estrogens'' in oral contraceptives block the break-down and elimination of caffeine from the body. Use of caffeine with these drugs could lead to increased levels of caffeine in the body and, therefore, a higher likelihood of side effects. ''Caffeine decreases the absorption of iron tablets. Iron should be administered one hour before or two hours after the consumption of caffeine.''Caffeine decreases the effects of ''sedatives'', and sedatives decrease the restlessness, alertness, and arousal caused by caffeine.''Adverse effects:''  The most common adverse effects of caffeine are insomnia, nervousness, excitement, ''headaches'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and ''stomach pain''. Caffeine also causes abnormal heartbeats and increases heart rate. ''Dependence can occur from the regular use of caffeine. If caffeine intake is stopped suddenly, a withdrawal reaction that consists of fatigue, ''headaches'', ''anxiety'', ''vomiting'', and restlessness may occur. Symptoms of withdrawal start 12-24 hours after the last consumption of caffeine and may last for a week.' "

How much sleep do children need?,"'Just as with adults, the amount of ''sleep'' children need varies with both age and unique needs of the individual. Below are general guidelines for children of various ages. If your child is happy and thriving, but needs more or fewer hours of ''sleep'"" than indicated below - rest assured they will remain healthy. The National Sleep Foundation's 2015 Guidelines recommend the following for sleep in children and ""'teens''.'  1 to 4 weeks old: Neonates spend approximately 65% to 75% of their daily activity in a sleep state. Waking time is of short duration and it is rare for a child of this age to have a ""day-night"" cycle. Their day-night ""clock"" is not functional until 6 to 8 weeks of age. Mothers of newborns should use their infant's sleep pattern to sleep also. 1 to 4 months old: Infants at this early age require sleep 14 to 17 hours 
of sleep per day. Many begin to develop a day-night cycle during the early weeks of this period. 
At this age, many infants have the ability to sleep evening blocks of 5 to 6 hours without interruption; however most will wake for feedings or diaper changes during the night. 4 to 12 months old: Infants in this age range require 12 to 15 hours of sleep daily. Good news for parents 
- they begin to sleep for longer continuous periods at night. Also, early in this time period, many children benefit from multiple daytime naps, though there is significant variability between different infants.  1 to 3 years old: While specialists point out that most toddlers need about 12 to 14 hours of daily sleep, many may be forced to survive on less. Daycare and erratically spaced car trips necessary for the needs of older siblings often deny or disrupt continuous sleep patterns, most often naps. 3 to 6 years old: This age range commonly needs approximately 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day with younger individuals taking a nap after lunch. Any need for napping is generally absent by the time a child enters 1st grade. 7 to 12 years old: Younger children in this age range commonly require 
9 to 11 hours of sleep each night; pre-teens often receive 9 to 10 hours (though some may require more). 12 to 18 years old: Middle and high school student lifestyle requirements (school, after school activities, dinner and finally homework) often reduce the sleep duration from the recommended 8 to 
10 hours to 6 to 8 hours. The various social network computer websites coupled with cell phone text communication 
and television viewing also may cut into a teenager's sleep time."
Can a lack of sleep impact a child's behavior?,"'The symptoms of a lack of sleep are often obvious to watchful parents. Some of these tell-tale signs include: ' recurrently falling asleep in the car (excluding young infants); requiring extreme stimulation and repetitive reminders to get up in the morning;  behavioral abnormalities such as excessive emotionalism, aggression, and crankiness; and  an older child's (over 8 years of age) recurrent need for an afternoon nap."
What is sleep hygiene?,"'A common definition of sleep hygiene is'' '' ""all behavioral and environmental factors that precede sleep and may interfere with sleep."" Daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping may be a reflection of poor sleep hygiene. Detailed specifics are listed below. General areas to consider include: ' Personal habits: Establish consistent routines around bedtimes and awakening times  Sleep environment: The bedroom should be a slightly cooler temperature 
(between 60 F to 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C), and eliminate any distracting noise in the bedroom Getting ready for bed: Establish a calming pre-sleep ritual (for example, reading, not watching TV) and  Miscellaneous: Examples include limiting intake of foods/liquids/medications which may disrupt a restful sleep"
What are some common sleep disorders in children?,"""The University of Michigan's ""'Sleep Disorders'' program includes five issues that may be disruptive of good sleep practices. These include: ' Sleep deprivation: As noted in the previously, the amount of sleep generally required varies with age and genetic predisposition. Unfortunately many older children, especially teens, do not receive an appropriate amount of sound sleep. Night waking: All children after the first 7 to 8 months of life start to be more sensitive to internal and external stimuli. If an infant has not yet learned to calm himself and resettle back to sleep, the parents commonly are summoned to help the child return to sleep. This pattern may repeat itself several times each night. Separation anxiety: Children experience this emotion commonly at 5 months of age as well as during the toddler years. Such children become anxious and are unable to enter a comfortable sleep pattern unless parents are present.  Resistance to sleep/settling problems: This occurs when your child does not want to go to bed at a reasonable time. Stalling, temper tantrums, and other resistance patterns are common. Parental persistence generally will resolve this common issue. Parasomnias: Parasomnias are problems that disrupt sleep. Examples include night terrors, grinding of teeth, sleepwalking, etc."
Sleep Apnea symptoms in children,"'Sleep apnea'' is an extremely serious sleep pathology in which the child will struggle to breath and possibly stop ''breathing'"". This process most commonly is a consequence of an enlarged tonsil and adenoid tissues that obstruct the child's upper ""'airway'"". Parents of such children will report that it sounds as if their child is being choked during sleep. Complications of sleep apnea include reduced oxygen to the brain and strain of the right side of the heart. If you believe your child may have sleep apnea, you should discuss your concerns with your child's pediatrician. An evaluation by and ENT (ears-nose-throat) specialist is often indicated. It is helpful to either audio/video record such an episode prior to such an evaluation."" "
Parasomnia symptoms in children,"'Parasomnias are disruptive sleep related events. They include several infrequent events (''periodic limb movement disorder'', ''restless leg syndrome'') and more common events (''teeth grinding'', night terrors, and ''nightmares'', sleepwalking, and ''bedwetting''). Periodic limb movement disorder occurs while asleep and is characterized by repetitive leg and (occasionally) arm movement that persist throughout the night. The child or teenager does not complain of any discomfort or abnormal sensations. In contrast, ''restless leg syndrome'' occurs while awake and affected individuals often describe a sensation of their legs ""falling asleep.""''Nightmares occur during REM (dreaming period) sleep and thus are more common later in the night. The child acts scared but may be comforted by their parents. Such children will often be able to remember their dream. Simple parental reassurance and comforting is effective. In contrast, night terrors occur in non-''REM sleep'' and thus generally within the first 4 hours of sleep. The child may become very violent with crying out in a confused manner as well as thrashing of arms and legs. Routine comforting of the child is not helpful and the child will be confused and bewildered if awakened. Generally, the child will rapidly return to a ""normal"" sleep with no memory of the events in the morning.' "
Confusional arousal symptoms in children,"'Confusional arousals are a variant of night terrors in older infants and toddlers that occur during the first half of the nighttime sleep sequence. It is felt that the child is so deeply asleep and the normal waking pattern at the end of the sleep cycle is suppressed. ''The major distinguishing point of confusional arousals versus night terrors is that the former gradually build from moaning, to crying out, and may culminate in the child standing and yelling out apparent random words or phrases. ''Conversely, night terrors tend to have an acute onset with the very rapid development of thrashing and yelling (commonly for the parents or caregivers). Confusional arousal and night terrors share several key points important for the child:' Don't try to awaken the child. They are asleep and if awakened, will have difficult time falling back to sleep. Anything that upsets the normal sleep rhythms (illness, not sleeping in their own home, and disrupted naps) may trigger either pattern."
Night terror symptoms in children,"'Night terrors are somewhat rare events that have their highest frequency in children 4 to 12 years of age. They are commonly outgrown by adulthood, though some adults manifest the same brain ''EEG'' (""brain wave"") changes during sleepwalking. ''Night terrors differ from nightmares (see previously). Night terrors manifest themselves with the person bolting upright in bed, screaming and thrashing about and stare blankly at the concerned adult who has come to investigate. They tend to occur during the first third of the child\'s sleep cycle. Children characteristically do not ""calm down"" when their parent attempts to soothe what appears to be a fearful experience. EEG studies demonstrate that the child is not awake (i.e. he/she is asleep), and if awakened, has no knowledge or memory of the immediately preceding events. The duration of night terror episodes is short lived. Some authorities believe that night terrors may be a response to sleep deprivation, ''stress'', ''fever'', or ''fatigue''.' "
Narcolepsy symptoms in children,"'Narcolepsy'' is more common in adults than children. It has been defined as ""a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Narcolepsy is a chronic condition for which there is no cure."" Research has shown that narcolepsy is not a type of ''seizure'', ''fainting'' episode, or psychological illness. Symptoms of narcolepsy include:' Excessive daytime sleepiness: affected individuals have an uncontrollable need to sleep during the day; Sudden loss of muscle tone (Cataplexy): this may range from slurred speech to total collapse of all voluntary muscles. Emotional stimulation (often positive by nature, for example, laughter) may trigger such an attack; Sleep paralysis: Characterized by a temporary (1-2 minutes) period of the inability to speak or move when falling asleep or waking; Vivid or frightening hallucinations which occur most commonly during REM (dreaming) sleep."
Sleepwalking symptoms in children,"'The onset of sleepwalking (somnambulism) typically presents in prepubertal children most frequently at age 11 to 12, and occurs more often in boys than girls. The overall incidence of sleepwalking is approximately 18%. Like night terrors, the individual is difficult to arouse during the event and does not remember the experience. Sleepwalking most commonly occurs during the first third of the sleep cycle. Some sleepwalkers may also mumble during sleepwalking episodes and occasionally obscene words may be uttered. Medications are rarely necessary to manage sleepwalking episodes. Ensuring a safe environment (protection against falls or ''walking'' out of the house) and maintenance of good sleep habits (avoiding sleep deprivation) are important considerations to prevent sleepwalking.' "
Do teenagers have the same sleep requirements as younger children?,"'Most teens need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day. Some studies have indicated that they have a different internal ""sleep clock"" than those younger or older than them. Researchers have demonstrated that teens are truly ""night owls,"" and if left to their own devices, would spontaneously wake from a good night\'s sleep anywhere from 9:00 am to 10:00 am. High school teachers who have classes before this time period have empiric experience to second this observation. Younger children may need anywhere from 12-15 hours (infant: 2 naps plus nighttime long block) to 9-11 hours (middle school child). ' "
How can I teach my child or teenager healthy sleep habits and good sleep hygiene?,"'Primary to establishing good sleep habits is a realization that sleep is a normal and necessary function. However, just as with other normal and necessary functions (for example, eating, toilet training, etc.), a battle may develop between parents and their child in this area. ''All children older than 5 to 6 months of age need to master the ability to self-soothe and relax in order to successfully fall asleep. Depriving them of this skill by either feeding or rocking them to sleep, reading until the child falls asleep, or lying down with the child in order to facilitate falling asleep, is a recipe for frustration - both for the child and the parent. ''Tired children (of any age) intuitively know when they are tired and, if provided the proper environment, will easily and quickly fall asleep. ''When they awaken during the middle of the night they are capable of falling back to sleep without parental intervention. In this circumstance, both child and parents awake refreshed the next morning.' "
What are some ways I can help my child or teenager get a better night's sleep?,"'These ""do\'s"" are adapted from ""''Sleep Problems'': Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System and ""Healthy Sleep Tips"" from the National Sleep Foundation.'  Make bedtime a special time. Create special soothing and calming experiences with the opportunity for special ""talks"" or sharing experiences that foster comfort for both child and parent. Study your child so you can determine when he is ready to sleep. Once this is determined you can start the ""get ready for bed"" routine with enough time in advance so the child doesn't get a ""second wind"". Keep the bedtime routine consistent and simple. Mental and physical stimulation is counter productive. Dim lights starting about 10 – 15 minutes before going to sleep.  Bright lights act as a stimulant to the child's brain.   Keep the bedtime routine portable. For example, it can occur whether at home or outside of the home (for example, in a motel during vacation). Make sure your child is both mentally and physically tired at the end of the day. Children need between 30 to 60 minutes per day of vigorous playtime (depending on the age). Besides fostering good sleep habits, such a program will help maintain optimum weight gain. Establish a restful atmosphere. Keep the lights dim, limit noise and electronic devices. Teens should turn off computers/TV's and cell phones when retiring to bed. 
The bedroom temperature should be between 60 F and 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C. Avoid afternoon naps in children over 6 years of age."
"What are some ""don'ts"" for getting my child or teen to sleep?","'These ""don\'ts"" are adapted from ""Sleep Problems: Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System.' Don't put your child to bed with a bottle of juice, milk or formula. Sugar in such drinks promotes tooth decay. Water is acceptable. Don't fill up the bed with toys. Limit the crib/bed to one to two ""special"" items. Too many items are over stimulating and the child will have a hard time not playing with them. Eliminate any object that might be a safety hazard. Don't threaten to send your child to bed as a punishment. Bedtime should be an enjoyable experience that will promote falling asleep in a timely fashion. Avoid caffeine before bed: Caffeinated drinks such as cola, chocolate, iced tea, 
energy drinks, etc. Limit TV in the afternoon and at night. TV stimulation may carry on longer than you suspect. Having a TV in a child's room may be counterproductive to getting your child or teen to sleep. A 2014 National Sleep Foundation study indicates that 72% of children 6 years old to 17 years old have at least one electronic device in their bedroom.  These children may get up to one hour less sleep per night as their peers without such devices in the bedroom."
What is sleep apnea?,"""Sleep apnea is a disorder characterized by a reduction or pause of breathing (airflow) during sleep. It is common among adults, becoming more common in children. Although a diagnosis of sleep apnea often will be suspected on the basis of a person's medical history, there are several tests that can be used to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment of sleep apnea can be either surgical or nonsurgical.""'An apnea is a period of time during which breathing stops or is markedly reduced. In simplified terms, an apnea occurs when a person stops breathing for 10 seconds or more. If a person stops breathing completely or take less than 10% of a normal breath for a period that lasts 10 seconds or more, this is an apnea. This definition includes complete stoppage of airflow. Other definitions of apnea that may be used include at least a 4% drop in oxygen in the blood, a direct result of the reduction in the transfer of oxygen into the blood when breathing stops.''Apneas usually occur during sleep. When an apnea occurs, sleep usually is disrupted due to inadequate breathing and poor oxygen levels in the blood. Sometimes this means the person wakes up completely, but sometimes this can mean the person comes out of a deep level of sleep and into a more shallow level of sleep. Apneas are usually measured during sleep (preferably in all stages of sleep) over a 2-hour period. An estimate of the severity of apnea is calculated by dividing the number of apneas by the number of hours of sleep, giving an apnea index (AI in apneas per hour); the greater the AI, the more severe the apnea.''A hypopnea is a decrease in breathing that is not as severe as an apnea. Hypopneas usually occur during sleep and can be defined as greater than 30% of a normal breath. Like apneas, hypopneas also may be defined as a 3-4% or greater drop in oxygen in the blood. Like apneas, hypopneas usually disrupt the level of sleep. A hypopnea index (HI) can be calculated by dividing the number of hypopneas by the number of hours of sleep.''The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is an index of severity that combines apneas and hypopneas. Combining them gives an overall severity of sleep apnea including sleep disruptions and desaturations (a low level of oxygen in the blood). The apnea-hypopnea index, like the apnea index and hypopnea index, is calculated by dividing the number of apneas and hypopneas by the number of hours of sleep.''Another index that is used to measure sleep apnea is the respiratory disturbance index (RDI). The respiratory disturbance index is similar to the apnea-hypopnea index; however, it also includes respiratory events that do not technically meet the definitions of apneas or hypopneas, but do disrupt sleep.''Sleep apnea is formally defined as an apnea-hypopnea index of at least 15 episodes/hour in a patient if he or she does not have medical problems that are believed to be caused by the sleep apnea. This is the equivalent of approximately one episode of apnea or hypopnea every 4 minutes.''High blood pressure'', ''stroke'', daytime sleepiness, ''congestive heart failure'' (low flow of blood to the ''heart''), ''insomnia'', and mood disorders can be caused or worsened by sleep apnea. In the presence of these conditions, sleep apnea is defined as an apnea-hypopnea index of at least five episodes/hour. This definition is stricter because these individuals may be already experiencing the negative medical effects of sleep apnea, and it may be important to begin treatment at a lower apnea-hypopnea index.'  "
What are the types of sleep apnea?,"'There are three types of sleep apnea:''During sleep, the brain instructs the muscles of breathing to take a breath. ' central sleep apnea (CSA), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and mixed sleep apnea (both central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea).  Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain does not send the signal to the muscles to take a breath and there is no muscular effort to take a breath. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the brain sends the signal to the muscles and the muscles make an effort to take a breath, but they are unsuccessful because the airway becomes obstructed and prevents an adequate flow of air. Mixed sleep apnea, occurs when there is both central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea. "
What is central sleep apnea and what causes it?,"'Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain does not send the signal to breathe to the muscles of breathing. This usually occurs in infants or in adults with ''heart disease'', cerebrovascular disease, or congenital diseases, but it also can be caused by some medications and high altitudes.'""Central sleep apnea may occur in premature infants (born before 37 weeks of gestation) or in full-term infants. It is defined as apneas lasting more than 20 seconds, usually with a change in the heart rate, a reduction in blood oxygen, or hypotonia (general relaxation of the body's muscles). These children often will require an apnea monitor that sounds an alarm when apneas occur. Central sleep apnea in children is not the same thing as ""'sudden infant death syndrome'' (''SIDS'').''Under normal circumstances, the brain monitors several things to determine how often to breathe. If it senses a lack of oxygen or an excess of carbon dioxide in the blood it will speed up breathing. The increase in breathing increases the oxygen and decreases the carbon dioxide in blood. Some people with heart or lung disease have an increase in carbon dioxide in their blood at all times.''When there is a chronic (long-term) increase in blood carbon dioxide, the brain starts to ignore the oxygen level and monitors the blood carbon dioxide level to determine when to take the next breath. The control of breathing also becomes slower to respond to changes in carbon dioxide levels; so when a person takes more or deeper breaths and ""blows off"" carbon dioxide the drive to breathe decreases and the rate of breathing decreases. As a result of slower rate of breathing, carbon dioxide builds back up in the blood and the rate of breathing increases again. The brain, slow to adjust, continues to signal for more rapid breathing until the carbon dioxide level drops too low. Breathing then slows down or stops until the carbon dioxide level rises again. This pattern of abnormal breathing is called Cheyne-Stokes breathing (after the men who described it). It is characterized by repetitive cycles of fast breathing followed by slow breathing and apnea. The full cycle is roughly around 90 seconds. This breathing pattern happens when the person is awake or asleep, but becomes more of a problem when asleep. Some patients with ''heart failure'' have central sleep apnea associated with a Cheyne-Stokes pattern of breathing.''Central sleep apnea usually occurs in adults with other medical problems. In infants, it usually occurs with prematurity or other congenital disorders. In both patient groups it is usually suspected by the primary care doctor. Central sleep apnea can be diagnosed with a sleep study or overnight monitoring while the patient is in the hospital.''In infants, central sleep apnea is treated with an apnea alarm. This alarm monitors the infant\'s breathing with sensors and sounds a loud noise when the infant experiences an apnea. The alarm usually wakes the infant and the parents. Most infants usually ""out-grow"" the central apnea episodes, so the alarm monitoring is stopped after the episodes resolve. In infants with other congenital problems, apnea monitoring may be needed for a longer period.''In adults with central sleep apnea, the apneas are treated by treating the underlying ''heart disease'', medication interaction, high altitude, or other primary problem.' "
What is obstructive sleep apnea and what causes it?,"'In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), apneas have four components.''First, it is necessary to describe a ""normal breath."" A normal breath of air passes through the nasal passages, behind the soft palate and uvula (part of the soft palate), then past the tongue base, through the throat muscles, and between the vocal cords into the ''lungs''. An obstruction to the flow of air at any of these levels may lead to apnea. The following are some examples:''To break it down even further:''People with obstructive sleep apnea have an airway that is more narrow than normal, usually at the base of the tongue and palate. When lying flat, the palate is above the air passage. When the pharyngeal muscles (muscles of the pharynx or throat ) relax the palate can fall backwards and this can obstruct the airway.''The genioglossus muscle is located where the base of the tongue attaches to the jawbone in front. Most people have enough space behind the tongue to take a breath without needing to pull the tongue forward. However, when obstructive sleep apnea patients are awake, this muscle needs to be active to pull the base of the tongue forward to open the airway. During sleep, most muscles including the genioglossus relax. During the stage of rapid eye movement (REM), the muscles completely relax. Relaxation of the genioglossus muscle during sleep allows the base of the tongue to fall backwards and the airway closes.'""Patients with obstructive sleep apnea often don't report waking up during the night with each episode of apnea. Frequently, during the apnea the brain only awakens from a deep sleep (stages N3 [non-rapid eye movement Stage 3], or REM) to a shallow level of sleep. The genioglossus muscle then contracts and pulls the tongue forward so that a breath can be taken. The patient may remain asleep, but the deep sleep that is important to be fully rested the following day is disrupted."" First, the airway collapses or becomes obstructed. Second, an effort is made to take a breath, but it is unsuccessful. Third, the oxygen level in the blood drops as a result of unsuccessful breathing. Finally, when the amount of oxygen reaching the brain decreases, the brain signals the body to wake up and take a breath. (This is what the bed partner hears as a silence followed by a gasp for air.) airflow can become diminished if a person has a deviated septum (the middle wall of the nose that separates the two nostrils). A septum can be deviated to one or both sides narrowing the air passages; there are filters in the nose called turbinates that can obstruct airflow when they become swollen; if the palate and uvula (the part of soft palate that hangs down in the back of the throat) are long or floppy, they can fall backwards and close the area through which air flows; the back of the tongue can also fall backwards and obstruct breathing especially when individuals lay flat on their backs; or the side walls of the throat can fall together to narrow or close the airway. the muscles of breathing work to expand the chest and lower the diaphragm to degenerate a negative pressure between the airways of the lungs and outside; this negative pressure literally sucks air into the lungs; the nasal passages, palate, tongue, and pharyngeal tissues can all contribute to narrowing of the airway; if during an attempt to breathe the airway collapses or is obstructed the tissues of the airway are sucked together by the negative pressure; the harder the chest tries to pull air in the greater the negative pressure and the more the tissues of the airway are sealed together; and finally, when the oxygen in the blood stream decreases the person wakes up or the level of sleep becomes more shallow in order to more consciously take a breath."
How common is obstructive sleep apnea?,"'Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is estimated to affect about 24% to 31% of men and 9% to 21% of women. In one study of people over 18 years of age, obstructive sleep apnea was estimated to develop in 1.5% of people per year over the 5 year study. It is probably more common than either of these numbers because the population is becoming more ''obese'', and ''obesity'' worsens obstructive sleep apnea. More shocking is the estimate that only 10% of people with obstructive sleep apnea are currently receiving treatment and many patients with sleep apnea remain undiagnosed.''Some groups are more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea.' Men are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea than women before age 50. After age 50, the risk is the same in men and women. Among obese patients, a majority have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea worsens in severity and prevalence with increasing obesity. Among patients with heart disease, a significant portion have obstructive sleep apnea, and among patients with strokes, a majority have obstructive sleep apnea. African-Americans over the age of 65 have a 2.5 times greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea than Caucasians. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in the Chinese population is similar to American Caucasians, but the Chinese population is generally smaller and less obese than the general American population. Therefore, something besides obesity must be the explanation for obstructive sleep apnea in the Chinese population. We do not understand the reasons for these differences, but studies are ongoing to better define the risks. The prevalence of sleep apnea in nonobese and otherwise healthy children younger than 8 years old is considered as high as 1% to 10%. Obstructive sleep apnea may develop in children of all ages, even in infants. Prematurely born infants are at a higher risk to develop sleep apnea."
What are obstructive sleep apnea symptoms?,"'Obstructive sleep apnea has many well-studied consequences. First, as one would expect, it disrupts sleep. Patients with disrupted sleep cannot concentrate, think, or remember as well during the day. This has been shown to cause more accidents in the work place and while driving. Thus, people with obstructive sleep apnea have a three-fold greater risk of a car accident than the general population. ''Sleep apnea symptoms at night time include: ''Sleep apnea also can cause significant and sometimes serious daytime symptoms as a result of insufficient sleep at night, including: ''It is important to note that the bed partner of individuals with sleep apnea may also suffer from poor nighttime sleep and can have some of the same symptoms.  '   Snoring, usually loud and bothersome to others Gasping for air, witnessed apneas, or choking sensation Insomnia Restless sleep daytime sleepiness nonrestorative sleep (feeling as tired in the morning as before going to bed) fatigue frequent day time naps headaches irritability  poor memory and attention confusion  mood and personality changes, such as depression and anxiety sexual dysfunction"
What are some of the complications of sleep apnea?,"'Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be a risk factor for the development of other medical conditions. ''High blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), heart failure, heart rhythm disturbances, ''atherosclerotic'' heart disease, ''pulmonary hypertension'', ''insulin resistance'', and even death are some of the known complications of untreated obstructive sleep apnea. Cognitive impairment (memory problems), ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') are also among possible complications of untreated sleep apnea.''Sleep apnea can cause or worsen ''high blood pressure'' and heart problems. Cessation of breathing frequently during the night (every 1 to 4 minutes) can cause increased ''stress'' on the heart. As the oxygen saturation in the blood decreases and the apnea continues, the sympathetic nervous system (responsible for the ""fight or flight"" response of the body) is activated. This fight or flight response sends nerve signals to the blood vessels to constrict (tighten up) and to the heart to work harder. When the vessels constrict, more blood is sent to the brain and muscles. However, as a result this increases the ''blood pressure'', which requires the heart to work harder to pump blood through the smaller caliber vessels. That, combined with the signal for the heart to work harder and the lower available oxygen in the blood from apnea, causes increased ''stress'' on the heart throughout the night. Sleep is normally the time when the heart has less work to do and can ""rest.""''Among patients with obstructive sleep apnea that do not have high blood pressure, 45% will develop high blood pressure within 4 years. If one examines patients who have hard-to-control blood pressure, that is, taking more than one medicine for control, up to 80% can potentially have obstructive sleep apnea. When the obstructive sleep apnea is treated, blood pressure decreases.''The risk for congestive heart failure increases by 140% and the risk of ''stroke'' by 60% times with obstructive sleep apnea.''Obstructive sleep apnea can complicate the treatment of ''atrial fibrillation''. ''Atrial fibrillation'' is an abnormal heart rhythm in which the upper part of the heart (''atrium'') is beating out of coordination with the lower part (ventricle). The treatment is to cardiovert the heart (resetting the ''atrium'' and allowing it to synchronize with the ventricle). After ''cardioversion'', 50% of patients have a recurrence of ''atrial fibrillation'', but patients with obstructive sleep apnea have an 80% recurrence.' "
How is obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed and evaluated?,"'Obstructive sleep apnea can be diagnosed and evaluated by subjective (perceived or biased) and objective (factual, based on empirical data) methods. An example of a subjective method that measures the effects of obstructive sleep apnea on patients is the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.''The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a self-report test that establishes the severity of sleepiness. A person rates the likelihood of falling asleep during specific activities. Using the scale from 0 to 3 below, the risk of dozing can be ranked from the chart below.''0 = Unlikely to fall asleep''1 = Slight risk of falling asleep''2 = Moderate risk of falling asleep''3 = High likelihood of falling asleep''After ranking each category, the total score is calculated. The range is 0 to 24, with higher scores suggesting greater sleepiness.''Breaking it down further, excessive daytime sleepiness is greater than 10. It is important to note that in patients with insufficient sleep (less than 7-7.5 hours for most adults), they can also have daytime somnolence even without obstructive sleep apnea.''Primary snorers usually have a score less than 10, and individuals with moderate to severe sleep apnea usually have a score greater than 16. Self-reported, subjective measures such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale usually are combined with a thorough medical history. The history includes questions about:''Next a physical examination is performed to examine the areas of possible airway collapse.''The primary objective test for obstructive sleep apnea is polysomnography, also referred to as a sleep study. This test measures different physical and physiological parameters while a subject is asleep. During attended polysomnography, a technician observes a person sleeping and monitors recording equipment in the setting of a sleep laboratory. A typical polysomnography test includes:''The ''EEG (electroencephalogram) ''monitors brain waves and can be used to determine the level of sleep or wakefulness. It is helpful for determining if an event (respiratory or limb movement) disrupts the level of sleep.''An ''EOG (electro-oculogram)'' measures eye movements using sticker electrodes placed next to each eye. During ''REM sleep'' (dreaming sleep), the eyes typically move from side-to-side. This measurement can help determine the duration of REM sleep.''An ''EMG (electromyogram) ''measures muscle movements. Frequently, an additional monitor is placed on the chin to measure muscle relaxation (tone). During stage 1-4 sleep there is a baseline muscle tone; however, during REM sleep all muscles relax. The EMG also helps to determine the duration of REM sleep. An EMG of the legs can be used to detect ""''restless legs syndrome''"" or periodic leg movements during sleep.''Oral and nasal airflow'' can be measured by several different methods to help determine the size and frequency of breaths during sleep. Chest and abdominal movements occur with each attempt to breathe and can be used to distinguish between central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea. (During central sleep apnea, the signal to take a breath is not given, so the muscles do not attempt to take a breath. During obstructive sleep apnea, the muscles attempt to take a breath, but no air moves.)''Measurement of the loudness of snoring'' can be used to quantify snoring. (Sometimes a measurement is needed to convince someone that they have a snoring problem.) It can also be used to measure changes after treatments for snoring.''Oximetry'' is used to measure the decreases in oxygen in the blood during apneas and hypopneas.''The video monitor'' is most helpful for detecting movement disorders, parasomnias, or ''seizures'' during sleep. (Often a patient will not remember ''sleepwalking'', sleep talking, or other parasomnias, so a video is helpful to review the events with the patient.)''After polysomnography is completed the data are analyzed by a board certified sleep specialist. The number of apneas, hypopneas, leg movements, and desaturations as well as sleep levels are all recorded in a formal report, and a diagnosis is made.''Although the primary objective test for obstructive sleep apnea is the sleep study (polysomnography); other tests for obstructive sleep apnea include the:''For someone who reports being ''sleepy during the day'', it is sometimes helpful to measure how sleepy they are. Also, after treatment of ''sleep problems'' the doctor may want to measure improvement in daytime sleepiness. Sleepiness can be measured with a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT).''Basically, the MSLT measures how fast someone falls asleep during the day. It must be done after an overnight sleep study (polysomnography), which documents adequate opportunity for sleep the night before. The test is composed of four to five naps that last 20 minutes and are spaced2 hours apart. The person is instructed to try and fall asleep. The average time to fall asleep is calculated for all four or five tests. Normal time would be greater than 10 minutes to fall asleep. ''Excessive sleepiness'' is less than 5 minutes to fall asleep.''The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) also measures daytime sleepiness. The person in this test is instructed to try to stay awake. This is repeated for four 40-minute sessions 2 hours apart. Not falling asleep in all four tests is the strongest objective measure of no daytime sleepiness.''Some agencies use these tests to ensure that their employees are not excessively sleepy while at work. Specifically, airline pilots and truck drivers who have sleepiness need to be tested. This is done for public safety and work productivity. Unfortunately, there is no test that will guarantee that someone will not fall asleep at his or her job or while driving.''Obstructive sleep apnea can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. This stratification assists in determining the direction of treatment. For example, some treatments that are excellent for mild sleep apnea nearly always will fail for severe sleep apnea.''The severity level is measured with polysomnography. In one grading scale using the apnea-hypopnea index, mild obstructive sleep apnea is 5 to 15 events per hour, moderate obstructive sleep apnea is 15 to 30 events per hour, and severe obstructive sleep apnea is more than 30 events per hour.' 0 to 9 = Average daytime sleepiness 10 to 15 = Excessive daytime sleepiness 16 to 24 = Moderate to severe daytime sleepiness work performance, daytime sleepiness, driving and accident history, napping, falling asleep during meetings, and decreased memory. In the nose, this includes the septum, turbinates, nasal polyps, adenoid hypertrophy, and nasopharynx (back of the nose). In the mouth, the palate, tonsils, uvula, pharyngeal walls, and neck circumference are all examined. A flexible nasopharyngoscopy is usually performed to examine the airway during active breathing and simulated snoring maneuvers. (The nasopharyngoscope is a fiber-optic, flexible tube approximately 18 inches in length and an eighth of an inch in diameter with a camera on its end. The camera end is inserted through the nasal passage to the upper throat or pharynx where the actions of the tongue and palate can be observed.) an electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors brain waves, an electro-oculogram (EOG) monitors eye movements, an electromyogram (EMG) monitors muscle activity, measurement of oral and nasal airflow, measurement of chest and abdominal movement, audio recording of the loudness of snoring, blood oxygen levels (oximetry), and video monitoring of the subject during the study. Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)"
What are the nonsurgical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea?,"'The nonsurgical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea are similar to the non-surgical treatments for snoring with a few differences. Treatments include:''Behavioral changes are the simplest treatments for mild obstructive sleep apnea, but often the hardest to make. Occasionally, apneas occur only in some positions (most commonly lying flat on the back). A person can change his or her sleeping position, reduce apneas, and improve their sleep.''Obesity is a known contributing factor to obstructive sleep apnea. It is estimated that a 10% ''weight gain'' will worsen the apnea-hypopnea index, and a 10% ''weight loss'' will decrease the apnea-hypopnea index. Therefore, a healthy lifestyle and ''diet'' that encourages ''weight loss'' will improve obstructive sleep apnea.''Unfortunately, most people with obstructive sleep apnea are tired and do not have much energy for ''exercise''. This is a difficult behavioral spiral since the more tired a person is, the less they ''exercise'', the more weight they gain, the worse the obstructive sleep apnea becomes, and the more tired they become. Frequently, after obstructive sleep apnea is treated by other methods people are able to ''lose weight'' and the obstructive sleep apnea may improve.''Sleep hygiene and other behavioral modifications known to improve the overall quality of sleep are also recommended. Below are some common practices that can induce sleep and enhance its quality:''Many medications have been studied for obstructive sleep apnea; however, because obstructive sleep apnea is due to an anatomic airway narrowing it has been difficult to find a medication that helps. Additional studies are being conducted and may proivide and alternative in the future.''A dental appliance is similar to a mouthpiece and holds the jaw and tongue forward and the palate up, thus preventing closure of the airway. This small increase in airway size often is enough to control the apneas.''Dental appliances are an excellent treatment for mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. It is reported to be effective for these groups. A dental appliance does not require surgery; it is small, portable, and does not require a machine. They may be considered for use in combination with other treatment as well, including CPAP and nasal or other upper airway surgery. There are some disadvantages to the dental appliance. It can cause or worsen temporomandibular joint (''TMJ'') dysfunction. If the jaw is pulled too far forward, it can cause ''pain'' in the joint when eating. For this reason, it is best to have a dentist,\xa0''oral surgeon'', or ENT surgeon who specializes in sleep fit and adjust the appliance. A dental appliance requires natural ''teeth'' to fit properly, it must be worn every night, and the cost is variable, as is insurance coverage.''Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is probably the best, non-surgical treatment for any level of obstructive sleep apnea. In finding a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, the primary goal is to hold the airway open so it does not collapse during sleep. The dental appliances and surgeries (described later) focus on moving the tissues of the airway. CPAP uses air pressure to hold the tissues open during sleep.'""CPAP was first used in Australia by Dr. Colin Sullivan in 1981 for obstructive sleep apnea. It delivers the air through a nasal or face-mask under pressure. As a person breathes, the gentle pressure holds the nose, palate, and throat tissues open. It feels similar to holding one's head outside the window of a moving car. A person can feel the pressure, but can also breathe easily.""'The CPAP machine blows heated, humidified air through a short tube to a mask. The mask must be worn snugly to prevent the leakage of air. There are many different masks, including nasal pillows, nasal masks, and full-face masks. CPAP machines today are smaller than a toaster. It is portable and can be taken on trips.''Determining CPAP pressure:'' With CPAP it is important to use the lowest possible pressure that will keep the airway open during sleep. This pressure is determined by ""titration."" Titration frequently is performed with the help of polysomnography. It can be performed during the same night as the initial polysomnography or on a separate night. In the sleep laboratory an adjustable CPAP machine is used. A mask is fit to the person and he or she is allowed to fall back asleep. However, for many patients, the titration portion of treatment is increasingly done by an ""auto-titrating"" CPAP machine at home, APAP.''During baseline sleep the apneas and hypopneas occur, and the technician then slowly increases the CPAP pressure until the apneas and hypopneas stop or decrease to a normal level. A different pressure may be needed for different positions or levels of sleep. Typically, laying on the back and REM sleep promote the worst obstructive sleep apnea. The lowest pressure or range of pressures that controls obstructive sleep apnea in all positions and sleep levels is prescribed.''Effectiveness of CPAP:'' CPAP has been shown to be effective in improving subjective and objective measures of obstructive sleep apnea. This effectiveness, however, is only achieved if patients adhere to the therapy, and this has proven difficult for many patients. If CPAP is tolerated,''When adjusted properly and tolerated, it is nearly 100% effective in eliminating or reducing obstructive sleep apnea.''An important clinical outcome of CPAP use is in the area of ''prevention'' of the potential complications of obstructive sleep apnea. Studies have shown that the proper use of CPAP reduces hospitalization for cardiac and pulmonary causes in people with obstructive sleep apnea. More generally, treating obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP can reduce the risks of conditions related to obstructive sleep apnea, such as, ischemic heart disease, ''abnormal heart rhythms'', ''stroke'', ''hypertension'', and ''insulin'' dependence.''Problems with CPAP:'' The first 2 to 4 weeks is the crucial time to become a successful CPAP user. During this time, it is important to try to sleep as many hours a night as possible with the mask on. If the CPAP mask does not fit properly or the machine is not working it is important to have it fixed immediately. It is also helpful to remember all of the increased risks of untreated obstructive sleep apnea (decreased productivity, ''heart attacks'', strokes, car accidents, and sudden death) as an incentive to continue using CPAP.''People with severe obstructive sleep apnea may never get a normal night of sleep. They often put on the CPAP mask and think it is the best thing ever. They quickly get used to it because it allows them to sleep. They take it on vacations because without it they have no energy and are always sleepy.''However, CPAP is not always easy to use. People with only mild to moderate sleep apnea often have a harder time using CPAP. A majority of people with CPAP machines report that they use them, but only some of them actually use them more than 4 hours per night when the actual use time is measured. A large percentage of people who start using CPAP, stop using it.''It is not easy to sleep with a mask that is blowing air into the nose. Some people are claustrophobic and have difficulty getting used to any mask. If a patient has nasal congestion or a septal deviation; it is important to have these evaluated since they can be treated (as discussed later). Some people do not like the inconvenience of sleeping with the mask or traveling with the machine. Others do not like the image of having to sleep with a mask. The noise of the machine blowing air can also be bothersome to some people using the CPAP or their bed partners.''Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) was designed for people who do not tolerate the higher pressures of CPAP. It is similar to CPAP in that a machine delivers a positive pressure to a mask during sleep. However, the BiPAP machine delivers a higher pressure during inspiration, and a lower pressure during expiration, which allows the person not to feel like they are breathing out against such a high pressure, which can be bothersome. It is most helpful for people who require a higher pressure to keep their airway open. BiPAP was designed to improve CPAP compliance; however it is difficult to measure an increase in compliance when compared to standard CPAP. BiPAP is often only approved by insurance companies after documentation that a patient cannot tolerate CPAP.''The auto-titrating CPAP machine is a ""smart"" CPAP machine that makes pressure adjustments throughout the night. As discussed above, different pressures are needed for different levels of sleep and positions. The goal of auto-titrating CPAP is to have the lowest possible pressure for each position or sleep level. At a given pressure, if a person starts to have an apnea or hypopnea, the machine adjusts the pressure higher until the episodes are controlled. If a person is in a sleep level or position that doesn\'t need a higher pressure, the pressure is reduced. The benefit is when a lower pressure is all that is required, the machine is not stuck at the highest pressure needed. The down side is, if the machine does not adjust, a person can be stuck at a lower pressure having episodes of sleep apnea.''With auto-titrating CPAP, the mean pressure throughout the night is lower and two-thirds of the night is spent below the set CPAP pressure. The machine also can adjust for the changes in pressure that are needed to overcome the effects of weight gain and ''alcohol'' or sedative use. It may also improve compliance; however, this has not been measured. The disadvantages of auto-titrating CPAP are that leaks may underestimate pressure or airflow. Each company has a different algorithm for adjusting the pressure and adjusting for leaks. It is unclear which company has the best algorithm, but studies are on-going.'   behavioral changes, dental appliances and mouthpieces, CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), and medications. reduce lighting and noise in the bedroom; avoid reading or watching TV in bed; avoid eating or exercising prior to sleep; use the bedroom only for sleeping; keep work-related activities outside of the bedroom; and try a period of physical and mental relaxation before going to bed. In people with nasal airway obstruction causing obstructive sleep apnea, nasal steroid sprays have been shown to be effective. In one study, the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) decreased from 20 to 11 with nasal sprays. Topical nasal decongestants such as oxymetazoline and neosynephrine, also can temporarily improve nasal swelling. The problem is that they cannot be used for more than 3 to 5 days without decreased effectiveness and withdrawal symptoms. People who have obstructive sleep apnea due to hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone production) is uncommon. However, some have improved with thyroid replacement therapy. People with normal thyroid function will not improve with this therapy. People who have obstructive sleep apnea due to obesity may improve with diet medications if they are effective in assisting with weight loss. Other medications have been studied, including medroxyprogesterone (Provera, Cycrin, Amen), acetazolamide (Diamox), theophylline (Theo-Dur, Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24, Theolair, Uniphyl, Slo-Phyllin), tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In these studies, they were shown to have little or no effect. There are also new medications to help increase alertness. They may be temporarily successful in increasing attention; however, they do not treat the sleep deprivation or the cause of obstructive sleep apnea. In cases where sleep apnea may be caused by another underlying condition, appropriate treatment of such conditions is recommended and may be beneficial. For example, treating underlying heart failure may improve sleep apnea if it is a contributing factor. In people with sinusitis and nasal congestion, the swelling and inflammation of the upper airway passages can cause snoring and sleep apnea. Therefore, medications to treat underlying sinusitis and congestion can potentially improve sleep apnea in these individuals. Medications are also available that could increase daytime wakefulness in people who suffer from sleep apnea. These medications stimulate the brain through an unknown mechanism of action. The prototypical drug in this class is called modafinil (Provigil). Studies have revealed greater resolution of daytime sleepiness when using modafinil in patients with sleep apnea. A similar, newer drug in this class, called armodafinil (Nuvigil), has a longer half-life and is also approved by the FDA for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in people with sleep apnea. Armodafinil has shown similar clinical results in significantly improving daytime quality of life and functioning. It is important to note that the primary treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) remains CPAP (described below). Stimulants, such as modafinil (Provigil) and armodafinil, are recommended for those who have excessive daytime sleepiness despite proper CPAP use at night. They are not meant to replace CPAP use, but rather, as an adjunctive therapy to CPAP in those who have daytime symptoms even with CPAP use. Approximately one third of people who use CPAP at night for sleep apnea may continue to have somnolence during the day. This is the population that could benefit from using modafinil (Provigil) or armodafinil (Nuvigil). It decreases apneas and hypopneas. It decreases sleepiness as measured by surveys and objective tests. It improves cognitive functioning on tests. It improves driving on driving simulation tests and decreases the number of accidents in the real world."
What are the surgical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea?,"'There are many surgical options to treat obstructive sleep apnea. The type of surgery that is chosen is dependent on an individual\'s specific anatomy and severity of sleep apnea. People often want surgery because it promises a cure with a single treatment. Surgery sounds easier than losing 10 pounds and more convenient than wearing a dental appliance or mask every night. However, surgery is not the ""miracle cure"" either. Most surgeries are safe; however every surgery, no matter how small, carries risks. Most surgeries require time off from work to heal and some are quite painful for up to 2-3 weeks. Some of the potential general risks of surgery include:''Surgery should be considered only after all the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery are understood. Some insurance companies require a 3+-week trial of treatment with CPAP before they will even consider authorizing surgery for sleep apnea. This is not an unreasonable approach. CPAP, if tolerated, controls most sleep apnea, and this may be better than surgical options. It is difficult to have a serious, permanent complication using CPAP as compared to the possibility of such a complication with surgery.'""Any surgical treatment for sleep apnea must address the anatomic problem areas. There may be one or several areas that compromise airflow and cause apnea. Surgical treatments can address the nose, palate, tongue, jaw, neck, obesity, or several of these areas at the same time. Each surgery's success rate is determined by whether or not a specific airway collapse or obstruction is prevented. Therefore, the ideal surgery is customized for each patient and depends on each patient's specific problem. Some surgical options include:""'Many people have several levels of obstruction and, therefore, these surgical techniques frequently are performed together (for example, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with genioglossus advancement and hyoid suspension).''It is rare for obstructive sleep apnea to be caused by nasal obstruction alone. The nasal ''cavity'' can be obstructed by swelling of the turbinates, septal deviation, and nasal polyps. Surgeries to address each of these potential causes of obstruction can improve the flow of air through the nasal passages. Nasal surgery is most successfully used for sleep apnea to improve the effectiveness of CPAP. Nasal obstruction makes CPAP difficult if not impossible to tolerate. Surgery to open the nasal passages markedly improves tolerance to CPAP.''Various surgical procedures that stabilize the tissue at the roof of the mouth (palate) and walls of the throat (pharynx) have been described. The effectiveness of the procedures depends on the tissues involved with collapse of the airway in addition to what is happening elsewhere in the airway. Traditionally, an uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) was developed. It is a long and fancy term to describe a surgery aimed at preventing collapse of the palate, ''tonsils'', and pharynx which is common in sleep apnea. UPPP is most successful in patients who have large tonsils, a long uvula (the most posterior part of the palate that hangs down in the back of the throat), or a long, wide palate. It also is more successful in patients who are not obese.''An UPPP operation is performed under general anesthesia and the patient is completely asleep. In simple terms, the tonsils are removed, the uvula is removed, and the palate is trimmed. All of the surgical ''cuts'' are closed with ''stitches''. UPPP may require an overnight stay in the hospital to monitor breathing and to control pain. UPPP is a painful operation similar to a ''tonsillectomy'' in an adult (tonsillectomy in children is less painful). Frequently, it is recommended for patients undergoing UPPP to take 10 days to 2 weeks off from work. In the postoperative period, people usually are on a liquid only diet and require liquid pain medication.''A UPPP is successful a majority of the time in preventing or decreasing obstructive sleep apnea. Studies also have demonstrated a decrease in mortality and decrease in risk of car accidents after UPPP. Some people who have a ""successful UPPP"" and fewer episodes of apnea, still have to use a CPAP after surgery to completely control their obstructive sleep apnea but it has also been shown to improve the quality of life in many individuals following surgery.''There are complications that are unique to UPPP.''A more recently developed surgical therapy involves implantation of a small generator that stimulates the hypoglossal nerve to the tongue and upper airway muscles during sleep. As described, obstructive sleep apnea for many patients occurs when the muscles of the airway relax naturally during sleep. UAST therapy attempts to overcome the impact of that muscle relaxation and subsequent obstruction.''Initial studies evaluating the ability of UAST to stabilize the airway have been very promising in select patients for 3 years and longer. One device is FDA-approved and provides therapy for patients who meet certain criteria, including previously failed medical therapy or CPAP. Implantation of the device includes the placement of a small generator in the anterior chest wall (similar to a cardiac ''pacemaker'') with a stimulation lead placed around the hypoglossal nerve in one side of the neck. An additional sensory lead measures the breathing cycle to determine the timing of stimulation. Patients turn the device on before they go to sleep using a small hand held remote. There are no external hoses. This is considered the only surgery that does not alter the anatomy of the airway, however there are certain risks to consider and other contraindications.''In some people with obstructive sleep apnea, the area of collapse is between the base of the tongue and the back wall of the throat (pharynx). Several surgeries have been used to decrease the size of the base of tongue and to open the airway. Most of these procedures are performed as an addition to other surgical procedures. Midline glossectomy is one method to decrease the size of the tongue. Under general anesthesia, various devices may be used to cut a trough down the middle of the base of the tongue. The difficulty with this procedure is to remove enough tissue to prevent collapse without changing the natural functions of the tongue during speaking and swallowing. This procedure may be considered for people who have had collapse in the lower part of the airway below the palate and tonsils.\xa0Combined with other surgical procedures, midline glossectomy has been reported to be very successful.''The tongue base has also been the focus of surgical procedures to shrink the base of the tongue by scarring. Tissue that ''scars'' usually shrinks in size. For example, radiofrequency energy has been used to injure and scar the base of tongue. Usually the first treatment is performed under general anesthesia. A radiofrequency probe is placed in the muscle of the back of the tongue and energy is delivered. Over time, the tissue scars and shrinks. Frequently, several treatments are applied to the tongue. The later treatments can be performed in the setting of an office.''One complication of radiofrequency treatment is an infection or ''abscess'' in the tongue. An abscess in the tongue can narrow the airway and may require surgical treatment. A 17% reduction in volume of the tongue has been measured using this technique; however, this is generally not a successful technique if it is used alone. Therefore, reduction of the base of the tongue is frequently combined with UPPP or other procedures.''The genioglossus muscle is the muscle that attaches the base of the tongue to the inside front of the jaw bone. Genioclossus advancement or tongue suspension are types of surgical methods to reposition the tongue and relieve obstruction in the lower portion of the upper airway during sleep. The genioglossus pulls the tongue forward. In people with obstructive sleep apnea, it has been shown that the genioglossus is more active in holding the airway open at rest. When the genioglossus muscle relaxes during sleep the airway narrows and collapses. There are several procedures that pull the tongue forward to enlarge the airway. A genioglossus advancement typically detaches the part of the jaw bone where the muscle attaches and moves it forward about 4 mm. This pulls the base of the tongue forward. Genioglossus advancement is performed under general anesthesia and requires cutting the bone and screwing it back in place. This usually is performed in combination with hyoid suspension or UPPP.''There also are less invasive methods to advance the genioglossus muscle. One method uses a stitch through the base of the tongue that attaches to a screw on the inside of the jaw. This method may be less invasive; however it is thought to be less effective and less permanent.''The hyoid bone helps support the larynx and tongue in the neck. It is located below the mandible and tongue, but above the laryngeal cartilages. It is not directly attached to any other bones, but rather is attached to strap muscles above and below. The strap muscles elevate or depress the larynx during swallowing. As part of a surgery to bring the tongue and soft tissues up and forward, the hyoid bone may be suspended. This is usually performed with other surgical procedures, such as an UPPP or genioglossus advancement.''In general, the hyoid bone is sutured up closer to the mandible. This pulls the tongue forward and up. This procedure is very rarely done alone without other surgical procedures. Like other surgical procedures for obstructive sleep apnea, hyoid suspension has an adequate success rate when performed in an appropriately selected patient.''Maxillomandibular advancement is a surgical procedure that moves the jaw and upper ''teeth'' forward. This pulls the palate and base of the tongue forward and opens the airway. This procedure is best suited for a thin patient with a small jaw or patients with craniofacial, boney abnormalities. Both the jaw and maxillary bones are cut, moved forward, realigned, and plated into place. Care must be taken to keep the teeth aligned and preserve a normal bite and, therefore, the procedure usually is performed by an oral surgeon. The nerve to the front teeth and lip passes through the jawbone and is at risk for injury. Care must be taken to preserve the nerve so that there is normal sensation. In appropriate patients, maxillomandibular advancement has up to a 90% success rate for at least two years but longer term effectiveness is variable.''Palate implants stiffen the palate. In select patients, they may prevent the palate from collapsing into the pharynx where it can obstruct the airway. They also decrease the vibrations of the palate that cause snoring. Palate implants have now been approved for people with mild sleep apnea; however, they are successful for only a small group of people with mild sleep apnea and palate collapse. A 250 pound man with an apnea-hypopnea index of 50 and decreases in blood oxygen to 85% will probably not be cured with a palate implant.''A tracheostomy is a procedure to bypass the narrowed airway. The trachea is the specialized tube that connects our larynx (voice box) to the lungs. It can be felt in the lowest part of the neck in most people. If the obstruction to airflow is occurring above the larynx, a tracheostomy can be inserted to direct airflow directly into the trachea. The tracheostomy tube is passed through the skin of the lower neck directly into the trachea. This surgery is performed under general anesthesia and requires observation postoperatively for complications in the intensive care unit.''Tracheostomy generally is reserved for morbidly obese patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea who are not candidates for other treatments. They usually can keep the tracheostomy tube capped during the day while breathing normally through their nose and mouth, and then open the tracheostomy tube at night. That way, they will have a normal voice and mouth breathing while awake, and breathe through the tracheostomy tube only at night.''A tracheostomy can be a temporary procedure, kept in place only as long as it is needed. It is easy to remove the tube, and the body will usually heal the skin and close the opening rather quickly. Tracheostomy has close to a 100% rate of cure for obstructive sleep apnea because it bypasses the problem in the upper airway. In mixed sleep apnea obstructive apneas resolve immediately, but in central apneas, which are due to metabolic changes caused by the obstructive apneas, it usually take some time for the apneas to resolve. Studies have shown improvements in sleepiness, ''hypertension'', and cardiac risks following tracheostomy.''While it can be extremely effective, there are risks and complications of tracheostomy.''Most patients do not need to resort to a tracheostomy for sleep apnea; however it is a life-saving procedure for a few patients.''Bariatric (obesity) surgery is a type of surgery in obstructive sleep apnea. It is effective because most sleep apnea is caused by or worsened by obesity. Bariatric surgery is associated with a marked reduction in weight post-operatively. One study demonstrated an average weight loss of 120 pounds and an improvement in RDI from 96 to 11. All patients had at least a 55% decrease in their respiratory disturbance index.''Bariatric surgery is only an option for morbidly obese patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea. There is a 10% morbidity (illness, disease) rate associated with this type of surgery as well as a 1% mortality (death) rate. Patients can regain the weight they lost after surgery. Bariatric surgery, like the other surgical procedures that have been discussed, has significant risks and is not suitable for most patients with obstructive sleep apnea.' bleeding, infection, scar tissue, pain, loss of work, change in voice, problems swallowing, failure to cure sleep apnea, anesthesia risks (including allergic reaction, stroke, heart attack, and death), and other unforeseen surgical complications. nasal airway surgery, palatal and pharayngeal surgery (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty), upper airway stimulation therapy, tongue reduction, tongue repositioning or genioglossus advancement, hyoid suspension, maxillomandibular procedures, palatal implants, tracheostomy, bariatric surgery, and combinations of the above. Bleeding in the area of the tonsils may occur up to 14 days after surgery in about 3% of people. Occasionally, a second operation is needed to stop this postoperative bleeding. If large amounts of scar tissue form with the healing that follows the surgery, in particular between the nose and back of the mouth, the scarring can result in an airway that is narrower than it was preoperatively. This can result in nasal and pharyngeal stenosis, a difficult problem to treat. Velopalatal insufficiency is another complication of UPPP. One job of the palate is to close the back of the nose and direct food and liquids down the throat during swallowing. If the palate is too short or it cannot move far enough back, sometimes liquids may enter the nose during swallowing. Velopalatal insufficiency frequently is a temporary problem after surgery, but it may become permanent in up to 2% of people. The uvula and palate are used in some languages (for example Hebrew and Farci) to produce guttural fricative sounds. After UPPP, that sound cannot be made and may make some words difficult to pronounce. The palate also closes the nose during speech to prevent a ""nasal"" sounding voice. Some changes in voice can be permanent after UPPP. The first is a psychosocial problem. Most people do not want to walk around with a tube coming out of their neck. The tracheostomy hole must be cared for and cleaned daily. Local infections or scar tissue can form around the hole on the inside or outside. Because of the tube, some people get recurrent infections in the bronchi (the tubes through which air passes from the trachea to the lungs). Severe life-threatening bleeding occurs rarely if the tube erodes into a major blood vessel in the neck. The trachea may stay narrowed at the tracheostomy site after the tube is removed. This may necessitate further surgery."
Why is it important to treat obstructive sleep apnea?,"'When a person with obstructive sleep apnea considers all the options for treatment, he or she may be tempted to not choose any of them. The masks and dental appliances have to be worn every night and the surgeries are painful and have no guarantee that they will be successful. When considering the consequences of all the treatments, however, it is important to remember that there are consequences of not receiving treatment. '""It is estimated that only a small percentage of patients with obstructive sleep apnea are being treated. Some of the remaining people with obstructive sleep apnea know that they have a problem, but they choose not to pursue treatment. People with obstructive sleep apnea may have a right to accept the risks to their health that refusing treatment poses; however, when they drive they put everyone else at risk as well. People who refuse treatment for their obstructive sleep apnea should be reported to the DMV, which often will suspend their driver's licenses.

Introduction to PLMD,"'Periodic limb movement disorder'' (PLMD) is a ''sleep'' disorder characterized by rhythmic movements of the limbs during ''sleep''. The movements typically involve the legs, but upper extremity movements may also occur. Movements occur periodically throughout the night and can fluctuate in severity from one night to the next. They tend to cluster in episodes that last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. These movements are very different from the normal spasms, called hypnic myoclonia, that we often experience initially while trying to fall asleep.'  "
What Causes PLMD?,"'The causes of PLMD are unknown. However recent research has shown that people with a variety of medical problems, including '""Parkinson's""' disease and ''narcolepsy'', may have frequent periodic limb movements in sleep.''PLMD may be caused by medications, most notably, ''antidepressants''.' "
What Are the Symptoms of PLMD?,"'Symptoms of PLMD are usually leg movements with the extension of the big toe in combination with a partial flexing of the ankle, knee, or hip. Movement of the legs is more typical than movement of the arms. It can often cause a partial or full brief awakening resulting in fragmented sleep. Patients are frequently unaware of these movements.'  "
How Is PLMD Diagnosed?,"'A sleep partner may observe PLMD, which often affect the partner before the patient knows of his or her behavior. In other cases, the diagnosis is made on an overnight polysomnogram (a test that records bodily functions during sleep). This test is often used to assess the cause of daytime sleepiness or recurrent awakenings from sleep. Blood work may be done in order to test iron status, ''folic acid'', vitamin B12, thyroid function, and magnesium levels.' "
How Is PLMD Treated?,"'Generally, there are several classes of ''drugs'"" that are used to treat PLMD. These include the Parkinson's disease drugs, anticonvulsant medications, ""'benzodiazepines'"", and narcotics. Current treatment recommendations consider the anti-Parkinson's medications as a first line of defense. Medical treatment of PLMD often significantly reduces or eliminates the symptoms of these disorders.""'There is no cure for PLMD and medical treatment must be continued to provide relief.'  "
What Should Someone With PLMD Avoid?,"'The use of ''caffeine'' often intensifies PLMD symptoms. ''Caffeine''-containing products such as ''chocolate'', coffee, tea, and soft ''drinks'' should be avoided. Also many antidepressants can worsen PLMD.''WebMD Medical Reference'  "
Sleep paralysis introduction,"'Have you ever felt like you were awake but unable to move? You might have even felt afraid but could not call for help? This condition is called ''sleep'' ''paralysis''. ''Sleep'"" paralysis may leave you feeling frightened, especially if you also see or hear things that aren't really there. Sleep paralysis may happen only once, or you may have it frequently -- even several times a night.""'The good news: sleep paralysis is not considered a dangerous health problem. Read on to find out more about sleep paralysis, its possible causes, and its treatment.' "
Is sleep paralysis a symptom of a serious problem?,"'Sleep researchers conclude that, in most cases, sleep paralysis is simply a sign that your body is not moving smoothly through the stages of sleep. Rarely is sleep paralysis linked to deep underlying psychiatric problems.''Over the centuries, symptoms of sleep paralysis have been described in many ways and often attributed to an ""evil"" presence: unseen night demons in ancient times, the old hag in Shakespeare\'s Romeo and Juliet, and alien abductors. Almost every culture throughout history has had stories of shadowy evil creatures that terrify helpless humans at night. People have long sought explanations for this mysterious sleep-time paralysis and the accompanying feelings of terror.' "
What is sleep paralysis?,"'Sleep paralysis is a feeling of being conscious but unable to move. It occurs when a person passes between stages of wakefulness and sleep. During these transitions, you may be unable to move or speak for a few seconds up to a few minutes. Some people may also feel pressure or a sense of choking. Sleep paralysis may accompany other ''sleep disorders'' such as ''narcolepsy'"". Narcolepsy is an overpowering need to sleep caused by a problem with the brain's ability to regulate sleep.""  "
When does sleep paralysis usually occur?,"""Sleep paralysis usually occurs at one of two times. If it occurs while you are falling asleep, it's called hypnagogic or predormital sleep paralysis. If it happens as you are waking up, it's called hypnopompic or postdormital sleep paralysis."" "
What happens with hypnagogic sleep paralysis?,"'As you fall asleep, your body slowly relaxes. Usually you become less aware, so you do not notice the change. However, if you remain or become aware while falling asleep, you may notice that you cannot move or speak.' "
What happens with hypnopompic sleep paralysis?,"'During sleep, your body alternates between REM (rapid eye movement) and NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep. One cycle of REM and NREM sleep lasts about 90 minutes. NREM sleep occurs first and takes up to 75% of your overall sleep time. During NREM sleep, your body relaxes and restores itself. At the end of NREM, your sleep shifts to REM. Your eyes move quickly and dreams occur, but the rest of your body remains very relaxed. Your muscles are ""turned off"" during ''REM sleep''. If you become aware before the REM cycle has finished, you may notice that you cannot move or speak.' "
Who develops sleep paralysis?,'Up to as many as four out of every 10 people may have sleep paralysis. This common condition is often first noticed in the teen years. But men and women of any age can have it. Sleep paralysis may run in families. Other factors that may be linked to sleep paralysis include:' a lack of sleep a sleep schedule that changes mental conditions such as stress or bipolar disorder sleeping on the back other sleep problems such as narcolepsy or nighttime leg cramps use of certain medications substance abuse
How is sleep paralysis diagnosed?,"'If you find yourself unable to move or speak for a few seconds or minutes when falling asleep or waking up, then it is likely you have isolated recurrent sleep paralysis. Often there is no need to treat this condition. However, check with your doctor if you have any of these concerns:''Your doctor may want to gather more information about your sleep health by doing any of these things:' you feel anxious about your symptoms your symptoms leave you very tired during the day your symptoms keep you up during the night ask you to describe your symptoms and keep a sleep diary for a few weeks discuss your health history, including any known sleep disorders or any family history of sleep disorders refer you to a sleep specialist for further evaluation conduct overnight sleep studies or daytime nap studies to make sure you do not have another sleep disorder"
How is sleep paralysis treated?,"'Most people need no treatment for sleep paralysis. Treating any underlying conditions such as narcolepsy may help if you are anxious or unable to sleep well. These treatments may include the following:'   improving sleep habits -- such as making sure you get six to eight hours of sleep each night using antidepressant medication to help regulate sleep cycles treating any mental health problems that may contribute to sleep paralysis treating any other sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy or leg cramps"
What can I do about sleep paralysis?,"""There's no need to fear nighttime demons or alien abductors. If you have occasional sleep paralysis, you can take steps at home to control this disorder. Start by making sure you get enough sleep. Do what you can to relieve ""'stress'"" in your life -- especially just before bedtime. Try new sleeping positions if you sleep on your back. And be sure to see your doctor if sleep paralysis routinely prevents you from getting a good night's sleep.""  "
What are sleep related breathing disorders?,"'Sleep'' related ''breathing'' disorders are a group of disorders that affect our breathing while we are asleep, and are characterized by disruptions of normal breathing patterns that only occur during ''sleep''. Therefore, the person with the disorder may be the last to know he or she has a problem. Sleep related breathing disorders constitute a subset of the broad group of ''sleep disorders'' that include many other disorders such as ''insomnia'' (difficulty sleeping), hypersomnias (inappropriately falling asleep, for example, ''narcolepsy''), parasomnias (activities during sleep, for example, ''sleepwalking'' and sleep terrors), and sleep related movement disorders (for example, ''restless leg syndrome''). The most common sleep related breathing disorders are ''snoring'' and ''sleep apnea''.'  "
Why do we sleep?,"'This is a complex topic that we only partially understand. Mammals, reptiles, birds, and even fruit flies have been observed sleeping. A manatee can sleep with one side of its brain while the other side is awake and alert. Sleeping in this way avoids a long period of unconsciousness, during which it would be very vulnerable. Humans typically need 7-8 hours of sleep every night, but individuals vary in their need for sleep. Sleep should be restorative and is necessary to maintain health. During sleep, we rest and repair our muscles and organize our thoughts and memories. Therefore, if we become sleep deprived, we feel both physically fatigued and mentally exhausted. Many studies show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease in problem solving ability, attention, and manual reflex times.' "
What are the stages of sleep?,"'Sleep stages can be measured by monitoring the electrical impulses within the brain, often termed brain waves. These electrical impulses, or brain waves can be monitored with an ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG''). Sleep can be broken up into three stages and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Stage 1 sleep is the most superficial and stage 4 is the deepest. Stage 1 and 2 sleep are both considered to be light sleep, while stage 3 sleep is deeper, more restorative sleep. This stage is important for the body to feel well. ''REM sleep'' is the sleep stage in which we typically dream. During REM, the brain sends signals to the muscles to relax, so we do not ""act out"" our dreams. The relaxation of muscles in REM sleep can sometimes worsen sleep related breathing disorders like ''snoring'' and ''sleep apnea''. We typically spend about 50% of our sleep in stages 1 and 2, 25% in stages 3, and 25% in REM sleep.''For additional information please visit the Sleep Center.' "
Introduction to Hypersomnia,"'Hypersomnia'', or excessive sleepiness, is a condition in which a person has trouble staying awake during the day. People who have hypersomnia can fall asleep at any time; for instance, at work or while they are driving. They may also have other ''sleep''-related problems, including a ''lack of energy'' and trouble thinking clearly.''According to the National ''Sleep'' Foundation, up to 40% of people have some symptoms of hypersomnia from time to time.'  "
What Causes Hypersomnia?,"'There are several potential causes of hypersomnia, including:'   The sleep  disorders narcolepsy (daytime sleepiness) and sleep apnea 
  (interruptions of breathing during sleep) 
  Not getting enough sleep at night (sleep deprivation) 
 Being overweight
 Drug or
	alcohol abuse
 A head injury or a neurological disease, such as multiple sclerosis Prescription drugs, such as tranquilizers 
  Genetics (having a relative with hypersomnia)"
How Is Hypersomnia Diagnosed?,"'If you consistently feel drowsy during the day, talk to your doctor. In making a diagnosis of hypersomnia, your doctor will ask you about your sleeping habits, how much sleep you get at night, if you wake up at night, and whether you fall asleep during the day. Your doctor will also want to know if you are having any emotional problems or are taking any medications that may be interfering with your sleep.''Your doctor may also order some tests, including blood tests, computed tomography (CT) scans, and a sleep test called polysomnography. In some cases, an additional ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG''), which measures the electrical activity of the brain, is needed.' "
How Is Hypersomnia Treated?,"'If you are diagnosed with hypersomnia, your doctor can prescribe various drugs to treat it, including ''stimulants'', ''antidepressants'', as well as several newer medications (for example, ''Provigil'' and Xyrem).''If you are diagnosed with ''sleep apnea'', your doctor may prescribe a treatment known as continuous positive ''airway'' pressure, or ''CPAP''. With CPAP, you wear a mask over your nose while you are sleeping. A machine that delivers a continuous flow of air into the nostrils is hooked up to the mask. The pressure from air flowing into the nostrils helps keep the airways open.''If you are taking a medication that causes drowsiness, ask your doctor about changing the medication to one that is less likely to make you sleepy. You may also want to go to bed earlier to try to get more sleep at night, and eliminate ''alcohol'' and ''caffeine''.'  "
What is sleepwalking?,"'Sleepwalking is characterized by a complex action behavior (''walking'') during ''sleep''. Occasionally, the person may talk, but it does not make sense. The person\'s eyes are commonly open, but have a characteristic glassy ""look right through you"" character.''Sleepwalking most commonly occurs during early childhood and less commonly during adolescence.'  "
What do you do when someone is sleepwalking? Should you wake them up?,"'One common misconception is that a person sleepwalking should not be awakened. It is not dangerous to awaken a sleepwalker, although it is common for the person to be confused or disoriented for a short time when awake. Another misconception is that a person cannot be injured while sleepwalking. Injuries caused by sleepwalking, for example, tripping and loss of balance, are common.' "
Why do people walk in their sleep?,"'Sleepwalking has been described in medical literature dating before Hippocrates (460 BC-370 BC). In Shakespeare\'s tragic play, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth\'s famous sleepwalking scene (""out, damned spot"") is ascribed to her guilt and resulting insanity as a consequence of her involvement in the murder of her father-in-law.''Parasomnias are a group of ''sleep'' behaviors common in in children, ''teens'', and occasionally adults. To understand parasomnias, it is helpful to understand the physiology of sleep.''Sleep occurs in two broad categories defined by characteristic changes during an ''EEG'' (electro encephalogram, “brain wave test”). The two categories are REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) sleep cycles. Non-''REM sleep'' has four “levels” characterized by unique patterns of the EEG.''An entire sleep cycle from Stage I (non-REM) thru REM sleep lasts between 90 and-120 minutes and repeats 4 to 5 times during the sleep experience. Each “level” of non-REM and REM sleep last between 5 to 15 minutes. A large Canadian study reviewed sleep patterns of children aged 2.5 to 6 years and discovered approximately 88% of them experienced parasomnias, and 15% were sleepwalkers. Other signs and symptoms associated with sleepwalking were: (1) sleep terrors (40%), (2) sleep ''enuresis'' (''bedwetting'', 25%), (3) ''bruxism'' (grinding of the ''teeth'', 46%), and rhythmic movements (such as head banging, 9%).''Sleepwalking characteristically occurs during the first or second sleep cycles, specifically, during stages III and IV, otherwise known as deep sleep. Due the short time frame involved, sleepwalking tends not to occur during naps.''Sleepwalking activity may include simply sitting up and appearing awake while remaining asleep, getting up and walking around, or complex activities such as moving furniture, going to the bathroom, dressing and undressing, and similar activities. Some people even drive a car while actually asleep. The episode can be very brief (a few seconds or minutes) or can last for 30 minutes or longer.''Upon waking, the sleepwalker has no memory of his or her behaviors.'   Stage I: introduction to sleep during which there is generalized muscle relaxation and effort is required to keep your eyes open. Stage II: beginning to sleep (light sleep) Stage III and IV: deep sleep REM sleep: associated with dreaming"
What causes sleepwalking?,"'Sleepwalking seems to be associated with ''inherited'' (genetic), environmental, physiologic, and medical factors.''One study documented that sleepwalking is ten times more likely to occur if a first-degree relative has a history of sleepwalking.''Sleep deprivation, chaotic sleep schedules, ''fever'', ''stress'', magnesium deficiency, and ''alcohol'' intoxication can trigger sleepwalking. ''Drugs'', for example, sedative/''hypnotics'' (drugs that promote sleep), neuroleptics (drugs used to treat psychosis), minor tranquilizers (drugs that produce a calming effect), ''stimulants'' (drugs that increase activity), and ''antihistamines'' (drugs used to treat symptoms of ''allergies'') associated with an increased likelihood of sleepwalking.''Physiologic factors that may contribute to sleepwalking include:' The length and depth of slow wave sleep (states III and IV of non-REM sleep). These stages are more commonly seen in younger children and thus may explain the age differences in the frequency of sleepwalking. Conditions such as pregnancy and menstruation are known to increase the frequency of sleepwalking. Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) Fever Gastroesophageal reflux (acid reflux - food or liquid regurgitating from the stomach into the food pipe) Nghttime asthma Nighttime seizures (convulsions) Obstructive sleep apnea (condition in which breathing stops temporarily while sleeping) Psychiatric disorders, for example, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, or dissociative states (for example, multiple personality disorder) "
What are symptoms of sleepwalking? How can you tell if they are sleepwalking?,"'Following are examples of symptoms of sleepwalking.'   Episodes range from quiet walking around the room to agitated running or attempts to ""escape."" The person sleepwalking may appear clumsy and dazed in his or her behavior. Typically, the eyes are open with a glassy, staring appearance as the person quietly roams around the house. They do not, however, walk with their arms extended in front of them as is inaccurately depicted in movies. On questioning the person sleepwalking, responses are slow with simple thoughts, contain nonsense phraseology or absent responses. If the person is returned to bed without awakening, they usually do not remember the event. Older children, who may awaken more easily at the end of an episode, often are embarrassed by the behavior (especially if it was inappropriate). In lieu of walking, some children perform repeated behaviors (such as straightening their pajamas). Bedwetting may also occur. Sleepwalking is not associated with previous sleep problems, sleeping alone in a room or with others, fear of the dark (achluophobia), or anger outbursts. Some studies suggest that children who sleepwalk may have been more restless sleepers between the ages of four and five, and more restless with more frequent awakenings during the first year of life."
What tests diagnose sleepwalking?,"'Usually, no exams and tests are necessary. However, a medical evaluation may be completed to rule out medical causes of sleepwalking. Occasionally, a psychological evaluation can determine whether excessive ''stress'' or ''anxiety'' is the cause of sleepwalking. Sleep study tests may be done in persons in whom the diagnosis is still unclear.' "
How do you stop sleepwalking? What is the treatment or cure?,"'A person who has a sleepwalking disorder can take the following measures:''Sleepwalking may be associated with an underlying medical condition, for example, ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''), obstructive ''sleep apnea'', periodic leg movements (''restless leg syndrome''), or ''seizures''. To help prevent sleepwalking, underlying medical condition should be treated.''Medications for the treatment of sleepwalking disorder may be necessary in the following situations:''Benzodiazepines'', such as estazolam (ProSom), or ''tricyclic antidepressants'', such as ''trazodone'' (''Desyrel''), have been shown to be useful. ''Clonazepam'' (''Klonopin'') in low doses before bedtime and continued for three to 6 weeks is usually effective.''Medication can often be discontinued after three to 5 weeks without recurrence of symptoms. Occasionally, the frequency of episodes increases briefly after discontinuing the medication.''Relaxation techniques, mental imagery, and anticipatory awakenings are preferred for long-term treatment of persons with sleepwalking disorder.'  get adequate sleep; meditate or do relaxation exercises; avoid any kind of stimuli (auditory or visual) prior to bedtime; keep a safe sleeping environment, free of harmful or sharp objects; sleep in a bedroom on the ground floor if possible to prevent falls and avoid bunk beds; lock the doors and windows; remove obstacles in the room, tripping over toys or objects is a potential hazard; cover glass windows with heavy drapes; and place an alarm or bell on the bedroom door and if necessary on any windows. when the possibility of injury is real; when continued behaviors are causing significant family disruption or excessive daytime sleepiness; and when other measures have proven to be inadequate. Relaxation and mental imagery should be undertaken only with the help of an experienced behavioral therapist or hypnotist. Anticipatory awakenings consist of waking the child or person approximately 15-20 minutes before the usual time of an event, and then keeping him or her awake through the time during which the episodes usually occur. "
What other sleep conditions have similar symptoms of sleepwalking?,"'Sleepwalking, night terrors, and confusional arousals are all related, common non-REM ''sleep disorders'' that tend to overlap in some of their symptoms. Approximately 15%-20% of young children through mid-adolescence will experience some or all of these behaviors. Moreover, seizures occurring during sleep (''nocturnal'' seizures) can cause movement disorder during sleeping.''Night terrors:'"" Like sleepwalking night terrors tend to occur during the first half of a night's sleep - often within 30 to 90 minutes from falling asleep. Also like sleepwalking, they occur during stage III of non-REM sleep. However, unlike sleepwalking, an individual with night terrors will portray a sudden and often agitated arousal that may appear to parents as violent and terrified behaviors. During such an episode, the child characteristically will not be comforted by an embrace from a parent or ""'caregiver''.''Night terrors often start during the toddler years with peak incidence between five and seven years of age. During these times evidence of a surge in autonomic nervous system activity is evident. Accelerated ''heart'' and respiratory rates, ''dilated pupils'', and ''sweating'' are characteristic.''Triggers for night terrors may include sleep deprivation, stress, and medications (stimulants, ''sedatives'', antihistamines, etc). Unlike sleepwalking, episodes of night terrors may recur for several weeks in a row, abate completely, and later return.''Confusional arousals:'' Similar to night terrors, confusional arousals are characterized by a sudden and violent arousal from sleep with behaviors described as agitated and semi-purposeful in pattern. Speech is generally coherent (unlike sleepwalking). A distinguishing point between night terrors and confusional arousals is the lack of autonomic nervous system (accelerated heart/respiratory rates, dilated pupils, ''sweating'"") phenomena in the latter. Confusional arousals tend to occur during the first half of a night's sleep (during stage II non-REM sleep). They are characteristically short-lived, lasting 5 to 15 minutes but can last up to 30 minutes in duration. ""'Amnesia'' for the event is characteristic.''Nocturnal seizures:'' Several important differential points help delineate the above three sleep behaviors from ''seizure'' activity. Seizures by their nature are very brief, often lasting only a few minutes. In addition, ''seizure'"" events are likely to be confused with the above; and are characterized by a series of repeated, stereotypical, and frequent behaviors occurring in clusters. Moreover, seizures more commonly occur in the second half of the night's sleep. Patients often will have postictal (symptoms after the seizure) complications such as ""'headache'', extreme grogginess, hard to arouse, as well as ''incontinence of urine'' and ''stool''. To assist in establishing a correct diagnosis a ''neurologist'' may perform a video-EEG study to help clarify the issue. Home videos taken on a smart phone are often very helpful in establishing the diagnosis.' "
What are the complications of sleepwalking?,'A common complication is injury sustained during sleepwalking activities.' 
How can you prevent sleepwalking?," Avoid the use of alcohol or central nervous system depressants if prone to sleepwalking. Avoid fatigue or insomnia, because this can instigate an episode of sleepwalking. Avoid or minimize stress, anxiety, and conflict, which can worsen the condition. "
What is the prognosis of sleepwalking?,"'Sleepwalking may or may not reduce with age, as described above. It usually does not indicate a serious disorder, although it can be a symptom of other disorders.' "
When should you call your health care professional about sleepwalking?,"'Sleepwalking usually does not require a visit to your healthcare professional. However, the condition should be discussed with your healthcare professional if sleepwalking:' is accompanied by other symptoms, is frequent or persistent, or includes potentially dangerous activities (such as driving). If you have any history of strange activity or sleepwalking while taking medications for insomnia like zolpidem (Ambien), you should also speak to your physician."
Introduction to endoscopy,"'The use of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopes has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ''esophagus'', stomach, duodenum, and colon (''large intestine''). The last remaining frontier in the ''intestines'' has been the small intestine. Wireless ''capsule endoscopy'' allows physicians to visualize the inside of the intestines from the esophagus through to the colon, but capsule ''endoscopy'"" has limitations, the most notable of which are the inability to control the capsule's passage and to perform therapeutic interventions, such as biopsy and electrocautery. Although capsule endoscopy is likely to remain an important diagnostic procedure because of its simplicity, the limitations of capsule endoscopy have been overcome by the development of balloon endoscopy, also known as enteroscopy.""  "
What is balloon endoscopy?,'There are two types of balloon endoscopy: single balloon and double balloon. ' 
Single balloon endoscopy,"'For single balloon endoscopy, a 200 cm long flexible, fiberoptic, endoscope (a hose-like tube one centimeter in diameter with a light and a camera on the tip) is fitted with an equally long overtube that slides the full length of the endoscope. On the tip of the overtube is a balloon that can be inflated and deflated. The balloon is blown up to anchor the overtube within the intestine. While the overtube is anchored, the endoscope can be advanced further into the small intestine. By withdrawing the overtube the small intestine can be shortened and straightened to make the passage of the inner endoscope easier. The balloon may then be deflated so that the overtube can be inserted further and the endoscope advanced again. The endoscope itself is a standard endoscope with working channels that allow the intestine to be inflated with air, rinsed with water, or used to guide biopsy or electrocautery instruments to the tip of the endoscope.' "
Double balloon endoscopy,"'For double balloon endoscopy, similar equipment is used, but a second balloon is located on the tip of the endoscope. Both balloons - the one on the overtube and the one on the endoscope - can be alternatively inflated to anchor the overtube or the endoscope to assist with the passage of the endoscope or overtube, respectively.' "
What to expect with balloon endoscopy,"'Balloon endoscopy, like other gastrointestinal endoscopy, requires intravenous sedation. The procedures are long, often requiring 1-3 hours. The most important complications of balloon endoscopy are perforation of the small intestine or bleeding either due to insertion of the endoscope or the use of therapeutic instruments.'  "
What is the future for balloon endoscopy?,"'Balloon endoscopy is revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal diseases. Nevertheless, its use is restricted because of the large expenditure of time that is necessary to perform it. Either newer, faster systems will need to be designed or, perhaps, paramedical personnel will be needed to perform the insertions before balloon endoscopy is as commonly performed as other types of endoscopy. For now, when there is concern about disease in the small intestine, wireless capsule endoscopy often is performed first. Then, if abnormalities are found, or if despite a normal capsule endoscopy there still is a strong suspicion that there may be disease in the small intestine, balloon endoscopy is performed.' "
How does normal gut bacteria cause SIBO?,"'The small intestine is a relatively clean place. The stomach receives food, mixes it with acid and digestive juices and turns it into a clean slurry that is pushed through the three parts of small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) where the nutrients are absorbed into the body. The refuse is dumped into the ''large intestine'', or colon, where water is absorbed and the feces become more solid and are eliminated from the body.''The normal bacteria (flora) of the gut, perform important functions, helping to digest certain ''vitamins'' like ''folic acid'' and ''vitamin K'', and they protect the intestine from being invaded by disease causing bacteria. However, if the normal function of the intestine is compromised, bacterial overgrowth may occur. This may be the result of a lack of adequate stomach acid, damage to the intestine by toxins like ''alcohol'', or a decrease in the speed at which the small intestine transfers material to the colon.''The colon is not as clean as the small intestine and reflux, or backflow, of ''stool'' into the small intestine can colonize it with colonic bacteria.''This article will discuss only the type of SIBO associated with intestinal diseases and conditions.'  "
Associated SIBO: Types of other diseases or conditions associated with it,"'Small intestine bowel overgrowth is often associated with another illness that affects the function of the small intestine. The body has many protective mechanisms to keep bacteria under control, including stomach acidity and intestinal motility, the ability for the intestine to move its contents downstream at an appropriate speed. Bacterial growth is hindered by the presence of bile and immunoglobulins. Finally, the ileocecal valve prevents ''stool'' from refluxing from the colon (large intestine) into the ileum or the last part of the small intestine.'""Any illness or disease that affects the body's defense mechanism puts a person at risk for SIBO, but the majority of people develop SIBO because of an intestinal motility problem. These may include""'Bowel motility may be affected by neurologic diseases including''People with ''diabetes'' with autonomic dysfunction (nerve damage) may also develop dysmotility.''Other intestinal diseases that may be associated with SIBO include:' complications from gastric bypass surgery, bowel strictures and adhesions that can lead to intermittent bowel obstructions, diverticuli or outpouchings of the small intestine, and tumors. myotonic dystrophy,  Parkinson's disease, and a rare condition called intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Crohn's disease Celiac disease Achlorhydria (chronic inflammation causes the stomach to become unable to produce acid) Cirrhosis of the liver Alcohol abuse Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Scleroderma, leukemia and lymphoma may also increase the risk of developing small intestine bacterial overgrowth."
SIBO symptoms and signs,"'There are no specific complaints or physical findings that can make the diagnosis of SIBO. Instead, small intestine bacterial overgrowth should be considered in the presence of a compilation of many non-specific symptoms; each by themselves would not be worrisome but together can point to the potential diagnosis.''Initial symptoms are specific to the gastrointestinal tract and abdomen and include:''A person with SIBO does not need to have all of these symptoms.'""As the disease progresses, the bacterial overgrowth inhibits the body's ability to properly absorb nutrients from the ""'diet''. This can lead to vitamin and ''electrolyte'' abnormalities, protein deficiencies, and difficulties with fat absorption.''Inability to absorb vitamin B12 can lead to symptoms of ''pernicious anemia'', including a ''low red blood cell count'' and ''peripheral neuropathy''. ''Anemia'' also may be due to ''iron deficiency''. Decreased ''Vitamin A'' may lead to night ''blindness''. Metabolic bone disease may be due to ''Vitamin D deficiency'' and decreased calcium. This may also lead to muscle twitching and spasms.''Malnutrition may result in ''weight loss'', and progress to excessive muscle wasting (cachexia). Inability to absorb ''fats'' in the ''diet'' may lead to steatorrhea (excess fat in the feces) that results in foul smelling oily stool, and may cause some anal leakage or ''fecal incontinence''.'   Abdominal pain Bloating Indigestion Diarrhea Excess gas or flatulence"
Is there a test to diagnose the condition?,"'The initial symptoms of small intestine bacterial overgrowth are non-specific and it may take time for the person and health care professional to consider SIBO as a potential cause. The clues may come from illnesses associated with malabsorption of proteins, fats and ''vitamins''. When there is malabsorption it is important to look for SIBO.''Blood tests may be ordered looking for different causes of ''anemia'', electrolyte imbalance, and vitamin deficiencies.''Breath tests may be considered to diagnose SIBO by looking for the byproducts of ''digestion'' , especially those produced by bacteria. Upper GI ''endoscopy'' allows a ''gastroenterologist'' to look at the inside of the upper part of the small intestine and take biopsies or small bits of tissue that can be examined under the microscope. Biopsies can determine if there is damage to the lining of the intestine that may be giving rise to the symptoms either through the mechanism of bacterial overgrowth or via another mechanism.''While these diagnostics tests are being performed, it is appropriate for the health care professional to look for conditions that are associated with SIBO. If such a condition is already known, then maximizing treatment of the associated condition may be undertaken at the same time the diagnosis of which\xa0SIBO is being considered and tested.' "
Antibiotic and probiotic treatment for SIBO,"'The treatment for SIBO includes controlling and treating any underlying associated illness. The goal is to control the symptoms of small intestine bacterial overgrowth since it may not be possible to ""cure"" the disease.''Antibiotics are one of the treatments that are helpful in controlling the excess bacteria. It is important that not all the bacteria in the intestine are eradicated, since some are required to help with normal digestion.''Amoxillin-clavulanate (''Augmentin'') and rifaxamin (''Xifaxan'') are the two common first line antibiotics that may be prescribed. Depending upon the situation, other antibiotics may also be considered, including:''While a single course of antibiotics for 1-2 weeks may be sufficient, SIBO has a tendency to relapse, and sometimes repeated courses of antibiotics may be required. In some people, the antibiotics will be routinely cycled, meaning that they will alternate a 1-2 weeks on the antibiotic with 1-2 weeks off.''In addition, underlying vitamin and nutrient deficiencies due to malabsorption should be treated.'   clindamycin metronidazole (Flagyl) floxins (ciprofloxacin [Cipro, Cipro XR, Proquin XR] levofloxacin [Levaquin]) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra)"
How can the condition be prevented?,"'Since SIBO usually is a secondary illness that occurs because the intestine has in some way been affected by another disease, it is important to keep chronic diseases properly treated and under control as best as possible.' "
Does SIBO relapse? What's the prognosis?,"'Small intestine bacterial overgrowth is usually associated with another underlying illness. Even with appropriate treatment, the relapse rate is high and often depends upon how well the underlying illness is managed and controlled.' "

Is there a test to diagnose the condition?,"'The initial symptoms of small intestine bacterial overgrowth are non-specific and it may take time for the person and health care professional to consider SIBO as a potential cause. The clues may come from illnesses associated with malabsorption of proteins, fats and ''vitamins''. When there is malabsorption it is important to look for SIBO.''Blood tests may be ordered looking for different causes of ''anemia'', electrolyte imbalance, and vitamin deficiencies.''Breath tests may be considered to diagnose SIBO by looking for the byproducts of ''digestion'' , especially those produced by bacteria. Upper GI ''endoscopy'' allows a ''gastroenterologist'' to look at the inside of the upper part of the small intestine and take biopsies or small bits of tissue that can be examined under the microscope. Biopsies can determine if there is damage to the lining of the intestine that may be giving rise to the symptoms either through the mechanism of bacterial overgrowth or via another mechanism.''While these diagnostics tests are being performed, it is appropriate for the health care professional to look for conditions that are associated with SIBO. If such a condition is already known, then maximizing treatment of the associated condition may be undertaken at the same time the diagnosis of which\xa0SIBO is being considered and tested.' "
Antibiotic and probiotic treatment for SIBO,"'The treatment for SIBO includes controlling and treating any underlying associated illness. The goal is to control the symptoms of small intestine bacterial overgrowth since it may not be possible to ""cure"" the disease.''Antibiotics are one of the treatments that are helpful in controlling the excess bacteria. It is important that not all the bacteria in the intestine are eradicated, since some are required to help with normal digestion.''Amoxillin-clavulanate (''Augmentin'') and rifaxamin (''Xifaxan'') are the two common first line antibiotics that may be prescribed. Depending upon the situation, other antibiotics may also be considered, including:''While a single course of antibiotics for 1-2 weeks may be sufficient, SIBO has a tendency to relapse, and sometimes repeated courses of antibiotics may be required. In some people, the antibiotics will be routinely cycled, meaning that they will alternate a 1-2 weeks on the antibiotic with 1-2 weeks off.''In addition, underlying vitamin and nutrient deficiencies due to malabsorption should be treated.'   clindamycin metronidazole (Flagyl) floxins (ciprofloxacin [Cipro, Cipro XR, Proquin XR] levofloxacin [Levaquin]) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra)"
How can the condition be prevented?,"'Since SIBO usually is a secondary illness that occurs because the intestine has in some way been affected by another disease, it is important to keep chronic diseases properly treated and under control as best as possible.' "
Does SIBO relapse? What's the prognosis?,"'Small intestine bacterial overgrowth is usually associated with another underlying illness. Even with appropriate treatment, the relapse rate is high and often depends upon how well the underlying illness is managed and controlled.' "
Introduction to endoscopy,"'The use of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopes has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ''esophagus'', stomach, duodenum, and colon (''large intestine''). The last remaining frontier in the ''intestines'' has been the small intestine. Wireless ''capsule endoscopy'' allows physicians to visualize the inside of the intestines from the esophagus through to the colon, but capsule ''endoscopy'"" has limitations, the most notable of which are the inability to control the capsule's passage and to perform therapeutic interventions, such as biopsy and electrocautery. Although capsule endoscopy is likely to remain an important diagnostic procedure because of its simplicity, the limitations of capsule endoscopy have been overcome by the development of balloon endoscopy, also known as enteroscopy.""  "
What is balloon endoscopy?,'There are two types of balloon endoscopy: single balloon and double balloon. ' 
Single balloon endoscopy,"'For single balloon endoscopy, a 200 cm long flexible, fiberoptic, endoscope (a hose-like tube one centimeter in diameter with a light and a camera on the tip) is fitted with an equally long overtube that slides the full length of the endoscope. On the tip of the overtube is a balloon that can be inflated and deflated. The balloon is blown up to anchor the overtube within the intestine. While the overtube is anchored, the endoscope can be advanced further into the small intestine. By withdrawing the overtube the small intestine can be shortened and straightened to make the passage of the inner endoscope easier. The balloon may then be deflated so that the overtube can be inserted further and the endoscope advanced again. The endoscope itself is a standard endoscope with working channels that allow the intestine to be inflated with air, rinsed with water, or used to guide biopsy or electrocautery instruments to the tip of the endoscope.' "
Double balloon endoscopy,"'For double balloon endoscopy, similar equipment is used, but a second balloon is located on the tip of the endoscope. Both balloons - the one on the overtube and the one on the endoscope - can be alternatively inflated to anchor the overtube or the endoscope to assist with the passage of the endoscope or overtube, respectively.' "
What to expect with balloon endoscopy,"'Balloon endoscopy, like other gastrointestinal endoscopy, requires intravenous sedation. The procedures are long, often requiring 1-3 hours. The most important complications of balloon endoscopy are perforation of the small intestine or bleeding either due to insertion of the endoscope or the use of therapeutic instruments.'  "
What is the future for balloon endoscopy?,"'Balloon endoscopy is revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal diseases. Nevertheless, its use is restricted because of the large expenditure of time that is necessary to perform it. Either newer, faster systems will need to be designed or, perhaps, paramedical personnel will be needed to perform the insertions before balloon endoscopy is as commonly performed as other types of endoscopy. For now, when there is concern about disease in the small intestine, wireless capsule endoscopy often is performed first. Then, if abnormalities are found, or if despite a normal capsule endoscopy there still is a strong suspicion that there may be disease in the small intestine, balloon endoscopy is performed.' "
What Is Bowel Diversion Surgery?,"'Bowel diversion surgery allows ''stool'' to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the ''large intestine'' is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any part of the small or ''large intestine''.''Some bowel diversion surgeries (those called ostomy surgery)divert the bowel to an opening in the abdomen where a ''stoma'"" is created. A surgeon forms a stoma by rolling the bowel's end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. An ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect ""'stool''.''Other bowel diversion surgeries reconfigure the ''intestines'' after damaged portions are removed. For example, after removing the colon, a surgeon can create a colon like pouch out of the last part of the small intestine, avoiding the need for an ostomy pouch.''Cancer'', ''trauma'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''), bowel obstruction, and ''diverticulitis'' are all possible reasons for bowel diversion surgery.''' "
Which Parts of the Gastrointestinal Tract Are Affected by Bowel Diversion Surgeries?,"'Bowel diversion surgeries affect the large intestine and often the small intestine.''Small Intestine''''The small intestine runs from the stomach to the large intestine and has three main sections: the duodenum, which is the first 10 inches; the jejunum, which is the middle 8 ''feet''; and the ileum, which is the final 12 ''feet''. Bowel diversion surgeries only affect the ileum.''''\xa0''Large Intestine''''The large intestine is about 5 feet long and runs from the small intestine to the anus. The colon and rectum are the two main sections of the large intestine. Semisolid digestive waste enters the colon from the small intestine. Gradually, the colon absorbs moisture and forms stool as digestive waste moves toward the rectum. The rectum is about 6 inches long and is located right before the anus. The rectum stores stool, which leaves the body through the anus. The rectum and anus control bowel movements.' "
What are the different types of bowel diversion surgery?,"'Several surgical options exist for bowel diversion.''Some people only need a temporary bowel diversion; others need permanent bowel diversion.' Ileostomy diverts the ileum to a stoma. Semisolid waste flows out of the stoma and collects in an ostomy pouch, which must be emptied several times a day. An ileostomy bypasses the colon, rectum, and anus and has the fewest complications. Colostomy is similar to an ileostomy, but the colon (not the ileum)is diverted to a stoma. As with an ileostomy, stool collects in an ostomy pouch. Ileoanal reservoir surgery is an option when the large intestine is removed but the anus remains intact and disease-free. The surgeon creates a colonlike pouch, called an ileoanal reservoir, from the last several inches of the ileum. The ileoanal reservoir is also called a pelvic pouch or J-pouch. Stool collects in the ileoanal reservoir and then exits the body through the anus during a bowel movement. People who have undergone ileoanal reservoir surgery initially have about six to 10 bowel movements a day. Two or more surgeries are usually required, including a temporary ileostomy, and an adjustment period lasting several months is needed for the newly formed ileoanal reservoir to stretch and adjust to its new function. After the adjustment period, bowel movements decrease to as few as 4 to 6 a day. Continent ileostomy is an option for people who are not good candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery because of damage to the rectum or anus but do not want to wear an ostomy pouch. As with ileoanal reservoir surgery, the large intestine is removed and a colon-like pouch, called a Kock pouch, is made from the end of the ileum. The surgeon connects the Kock pouch to a stoma. A Kock pouch must be drained each day by inserting a tube through the stoma. An ostomy pouch is not needed and the stoma is covered by a patch when it is not in use."
Which bowel diversion surgery is appropriate?,"'The type, degree, and location of bowel damage, and personal preference, are all factors in determining which surgery is most appropriate. For example, people whose disease affects the ileum are poor candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery or continent ileostomy because of the increased risk of disease recurrence and the need for pouch removal.''Discussing treatment options with a doctor and seeking the advice of an ostomy nursea (specialist who cares for people with bowel diversions)are highly recommended.' "
Concerns Related to Bowel Diversion,"'Although bowel diversion surgery can bring great relief, many people fear the practical, social, and psychological issues related to bowel diversion. An ostomy nurse is trained to help patients deal with these issues both before and after surgery. People living with an ostomy or who need bowel diversion surgery may also find useful advice and information through local or online support groups.' "
Bowel Diversion Surgery at A Glance," Bowel diversion surgery allows stool to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the large intestine is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any portion of the small or large intestine. The type, degree, and location of bowel damage, and personal preference, are all factors in determining which bowel diversion surgery is most appropriate. An ostomy nurse can help patients deal with the practical, social, and psychological issues related to bowel diversion."
Hope through Research,"'The National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases conducts and supports basic and clinical research into many digestive disorders, including ''inflammatory bowel disease'' and ''diverticular disease''.''Participants in ''clinical trials'' can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research. For information about current studies, visit www.ClinicalTrials.gov.' "
What is smallpox?,"'Smallpox is an infectious disease of the past that health care professionals eliminated worldwide by vaccination. The variola virus causes the disease, which only spreads from person to person. Affected people became very ill with a high ''fever'' and a characteristic rash. Up to one-third of people with smallpox died. Although the disease has been wiped out, samples of the virus still exist in high-security laboratories in the United States and Russia. This has led to concerns about use of the virus in biological warfare. For this reason, health care providers still vaccinate some military personnel against smallpox.' "
What is the history of smallpox?,"'Smallpox existed for more than 12,000 years. Mummies from ancient Egypt showed evidence of infection, including the mummy of Ramses V. Smallpox entered the New World in the 16th century, carried by European explorers and conquistadors. Because the aboriginal inhabitants had no immunity to the disease, smallpox often decimated native populations. There are even reports where people intentionally infected Native American populations with infected blankets in the 18th ''century -- one'' of the early examples of biological warfare. During the 20th century, there were 300 million to 500 million deaths from smallpox worldwide, compared to 100 million from ''tuberculosis''.''It was not until the end of the 18th century that an effective method of vaccination was developed. An English scientist named Edward Jenner discovered it. Jenner observed that milkmaids often got a mild disease called cowpox and that this seemed to make them immune to smallpox. His vaccination strategy involved transferring the blister fluid from a person with cowpox to a person who had not yet had smallpox (an obsolete process termed variolation). This gave the susceptible person a cowpox infection (which was usually mild) and conveyed protection from smallpox. After a time, a virus similar to cowpox, called vaccinia, was substituted in the vaccine.''The last naturally occurring case of smallpox was in Somalia in 1977. In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Health Assembly certified that the world was finally free of smallpox. Thus, smallpox was the first disease to be entirely eradicated. Campaigns are now under way to try to eliminate other diseases such as ''polio'' and ''measles''.''The WHO, post-eradication of the virus clinically (no smallpox cases in the world), has encouraged all member nations to destroy any remaining laboratory cultures of the virus. However, the rise of biological warfare technology led to concerns that people could weaponize smallpox to use in ''bioterrorism''. Both the U.S. (CDC, Atlanta, Georgia) and Russia (Koltsovo) decided to retain their stockpiles in case they were needed to produce novel ''vaccines'' against a biological agent. This has understandably stirred up controversy. Supporters of retaining the cultures note that existing stocks of the virus have been used to develop and test new treatments and ''vaccines''. The entire viral genome has been sequenced, leading to concerns that the virus may be recreated even if current stocks are destroyed.''Smallpox is a life-threatening disease (30% or higher death rate with severe hemorrhagic disease) and is on the list of potential biological weapons considered to pose the greatest threat to public health. Other agents on this list include ''anthrax'', ''plague'', smallpox, ''botulism'', ''tularemia'', and the viral hemorrhagic ''fevers'', including ''Ebola'' and Marburg ''viruses''.' "
What causes smallpox?,"'A poxvirus called variola (''Poxviridae'' family of viruses, genus ''Orthopoxvirus'') causes smallpox. Variola is a relatively large brick-shaped virus that contains double-stranded DNA. The virus resides in large numbers in many organs (skin, kidneys, spleen, ''liver'', and other organs) of infected people. Death occurs because of overwhelming toxemia, thought to be due to immune complexes trying to react to the large number of viral particles. Variola infection only occurs in humans, which was helpful in eradicating the disease. There are two strains called variola major and variola minor (also known as alastrim). As implied by the names, variola major is more likely to cause serious disease and death than variola minor.' "
What are the risk factors for smallpox?,"'In the past, the major risk factor for getting smallpox infection was close association with another infected person with smallpox who expelled virus-contaminated droplets in ''coughs'' and sneezes; infrequently, some patients may have obtained the disease from touching heavily contaminated items and then transferring viruses to their own mucous membranes. Currently, the major risk factors are working in highly specialized laboratories that may still have smallpox viruses in storage by accident or become contaminated while either working with the viruses (for example, a pox virus lab tech, vaccinator, or transporter) or using the viruses as a biological weapon.' "
"Is smallpox contagious, and how long is it contagious?","'Smallpox is highly contagious and remains contagious until all the scabs have fallen off. Usually, the contagious period takes about three to four weeks after the initial rash develops for the patient to be noncontagious.' "
What is the incubation period for smallpox?,'The incubation period for smallpox is a little longer than that for many other viruses; symptoms develop about seven to 17 days after exposure.' 
How does smallpox spread?,"'Most transmission of smallpox is directly from person to person. Large, infectious droplets of saliva are expelled during ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'' and then inadvertently inhaled by another person. This usually requires close face-to-face contact and is similar to the way that ''mumps'', ''measles'', and ''influenza'' are spread. On average, a single individual would infect approximately 60% of their household contacts. Infected objects, such as used silverware or heavily contaminated bedding, may carry sufficient numbers of organisms to infect another person if improperly handled, although this route of transmission is much less common.' "
What are smallpox symptoms and signs?,"'Fever is the most common initial symptom and can be quite high. ''Flu-like symptoms'' such as body aches, ''chills'', and ''headache'' accompany the fever. Often, the patient is too unwell to get out of bed (malaise). Within 24-48 hours, a rash begins to appear everywhere on the body but especially on the legs, arms, mouth, and face. ''Pharyngitis'' (''sore throat''), ''abdominal pain'', ''back pain'', and occasionally ''vomiting'' may also develop. Smallpox may also affect the eyes, leading to potential blindness among survivors. Symptoms in children are similar to those in adults. The rash also appears on the palms and soles and goes through stages as the disease progresses. At the beginning, the rash consists of red dots that become raised. The skin lesions (see Figure 1) rapidly fill with fluid and may turn yellow, resembling pus (pus-filled lesions). Rarely, the rash may start to fill with blood (hemorrhagic smallpox), which is a poor prognostic sign. After one to two weeks, the lesions scab over and eventually fall off, leaving deep ''scars''. One of the defining features of smallpox is that all the lesions on the body are always at the same stage of development. This is in contrast to ''chickenpox'' where new lesions form while old ones are healing.''Approximately one-third of people with smallpox died from the infection. People who had an extensive rash were at higher risk of death. People who had only a few lesions or a milder rash had a lower risk of death. Infections caused by the variola minor strain were less severe and death occurred in only approximately 1% of cases.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose smallpox?,"'When smallpox was common, an experienced clinician could make the diagnosis simply by looking at the rash and examining the patient. Any case that occurs now will likely be a result of bioterrorism or biological warfare. In that event, misdiagnosis or delays in diagnosis could cause the infection to spread. Thus, it is still important for clinicians to be able to diagnose smallpox. The CDC has developed an online tool (http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/diagnosis/evalposter.asp) to help clinicians assess the likelihood that a rash is due to smallpox.' "
What specialists treat smallpox?,"'If a physician considers smallpox as a possible diagnosis for any patient, public health authorities should be notified immediately and their instructions on the protective measures for medical caregivers and others should be followed carefully. They can help determine if additional testing is warranted. Health care professionals may test material from ''blisters'', throat swabs, and blood samples for the presence of variola DNA. Physicians perform these tests at the CDC and require prior authorization. The person(s) obtaining the specimens should have a recent smallpox vaccination (within three years) or no contraindication to immediate vaccination. Infectious-disease specialists, emergency-medicine specialists, infection-control specialists, and experts trained in biological warfare are likely to be consulted. Other specialists like ophthalmologists may need to be consulted if complications develop.' "
What is the treatment for smallpox?,"'Treatment for smallpox is supportive, meaning that patients should keep hydrated, fever should be treated with ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or a similar medication, and the patient should be closely monitoring to determine if there is a need for ''blood pressure'' support. Although there are no medications proven to work against human infection, some medications have shown promise in the laboratory, including a derivative of the antiviral drug cidofovir (''Vistide''), its analogs and virus inhibitor ST-246. Intravenous vaccinia immunoglobulin (VIGIV) has been used in early acquired accidental contaminations of the eyes or mouth. If the patient is hospitalized, strict airborne and contact isolation procedures should be followed; the room should have negative air pressure and HEPA air filters.' "
Is it possible to prevent smallpox with a vaccine?,"'Smallpox is a vaccine-preventable disease. There is an effective vaccine for the prevention of smallpox. Health researchers use a virus called vaccinia to make the vaccine. The similarity between these two names (vaccine and vaccinia) is not coincidental because smallpox was the first disease to be prevented by vaccination. In 2007, a second-generation smallpox vaccine (ACAM2000) was licensed. The vaccine contains live vaccinia virus but does not contain any smallpox virus. It is not a shot and doctors administer it in a unique manner: a sharp, pronged piece of metal is dipped in the vaccine and then used to prick the skin of the recipient. Doctors repeat this process several times. If successful, the site of vaccination will develop small ''blisters'' that scab and heal, leaving a ''scar'', thus producing minor adverse reactions (a process called scarification). While the blisters are active, people should keep the site clean, dry, and covered to prevent the vaccinia virus from spreading to others.''Many older adults still have a vaccine scar on their arms from their vaccination when they were younger. Smallpox vaccine, like other live ''vaccines'' including the ''yellow fever'"" vaccine, teaches the body's immune system to remember how to make antibodies. There may still be a level of protection, even decades after vaccination. However, physicians recommend revaccination in the event of a smallpox exposure. Interestingly, vaccination after exposure provides some protection against severe disease.""'Health officials no longer recommend vaccination for the general population because the disease has been eradicated. Currently, only selected military personnel and laboratory workers who handle the smallpox virus still get the vaccine.''Vaccination side effects (adverse reactions) are uncommon but are sometimes serious and potentially fatal. Complications occur in approximately 75 per million adults vaccinated for the first time. Because the vaccine contains live vaccinia virus, the virus may spread and infect the heart, causing ''myocarditis'' (infection of the heart muscle) or ''pericarditis'' (infection of the sac around the heart). The vaccine can also infect the brain (''encephalitis'') or eye or cause a generalized rash. Vaccine complications lead to death in approximately one person for every million newly vaccinated people. Complications are much less common in revaccination. People with weak immune systems and those with ''skin conditions'' like ''eczema'' are at higher risk for complications. ''Pregnant'' women should not be vaccinated because of the risk of fetal death.''A new FDA-approved drug that treats smallpox was introduced in 2018. Health researchers have never tested the antiviral pill (drug) tecovirimat (Tpoxx) in humans, but it was very effective in animals in protecting them from ''monkeypox'' and rabbit pox, diseases that are related to smallpox. The drug, when safety-tested in 359 humans, caused no severe side effects. Development of the drug was done in order to have treatment available in case of either a biological lab accident or to protect against a bioterror attack with the virus.' "
"What is the prognosis for smallpox, and what are complications of smallpox?","'Approximately one-third of people with smallpox died. Those who survived bore the scars of the disease for life. If the eye was infected, blindness was common. In the 19th century, smallpox was the leading cause of childhood blindness. It is possible that experimental medications will decrease complications and mortality rates, but health researchers cannot test this since human disease no longer exists. However, if the disease was reintroduced to humans (for example, by bioterrorists or other individuals), some investigators suggest the death rate may exceed one-third of the population and debilitate and scar many of those people that survive the disease.' "
Where can people find more information on smallpox?,'The CDC web site (''https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/index.html'') is an excellent source of information on smallpox. It provides comprehensive information on the disease and the vaccine.' 
How does our sense of smell work?,"'The sense of smell is part of our chemical sensing system, or the chemosenses. Sensory cells in our nose, mouth, and throat have a role in helping us interpret smells, as well as taste flavors. Microscopic molecules released by the substances around us (foods, flowers, etc.) stimulate these sensory cells. Once the cells detect the molecules they send messages to our brains, where we identify the smell.''Olfactory, or smell nerve cells, are stimulated by the odors around us--the fragrance of a gardenia or the smell of bread baking. These nerve cells are found in a small patch of tissue high inside the nose, and they connect directly to the brain. Our sense of smell is also influenced by something called the common chemical sense. This sense involves nerve endings in our eyes, nose, mouth, and throat, especially those on moist surfaces. Beyond smell and taste, these nerve endings help us sense the feelings stimulated by different substances, such as the eye-watering potency of an onion or the refreshing cool of peppermint.'""It's a surprise to many people to learn that flavors are recognized mainly through the sense of smell. Along with texture, temperature, and the sensations from the common chemical sense, the perception of flavor comes from a combination of odors and taste. Without the olfactory cells, familiar flavors like coffee or oranges would be harder to distinguish."" "
What are the smell disorders?,"'People who experience smell disorders experience either a loss in their ability to smell or changes in the way they perceive odors. As for loss of the sense of smell, some people have ''hyposmia'"", which is when their ability to detect odor is reduced. Other people can't detect odor at all, which is called ""'anosmia'"". Some people experience change in the perception of odors, or notice that familiar odors become distorted. An odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul. Still other people may perceive a smell that isn't present at all."" "
What causes smell disorders?,"'Smell disorders have many causes, some clearer than others. Most people who develop a smell disorder have recently experienced an illness or an injury. Common triggers are upper respiratory infections and head injuries. In some patients, the exact cause for decreased smell remains unknown, even after more serious causes are ruled out.''Among other causes of smell disorders are polyps in the nasal ''cavities'', ''sinus infections'', hormonal disturbances, or dental problems. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as insecticides and solvents, and some medicines have also been associated with smell disorders. People with head and neck cancers who receive radiation treatment are also among those who experience problems with their sense of smell.'  "
How are smell disorders diagnosed?,"'Doctors and scientists have developed tests to determine the extent and nature of a person\'s smell disorder. Tests are designed to measure the smallest amount of odor patients can detect as well as their accuracy in identifying different smells. In fact, an easily administered ""scratch and sniff"" test allows a person to scratch pieces of paper treated to release different odors, sniff them, and try to identify each odor from a list of possibilities. In this way, doctors can easily determine whether patients have hyposmia, anosmia, or another kind of smell disorder.' "
Are smell disorders serious?,"'Yes. Like all of our senses, our sense of smell plays an important part in our lives. The sense of smell often serves as a first warning signal. Smell can alert us to the smoke of a fire or the odor of a natural ''gas'' leak and dangerous fumes or spoiled food. Perhaps more important is that our chemosenses are sometimes a signal of serious health problems. Obesity, ''diabetes'', ''hypertension'"", malnutrition, Parkinson's disease, """"Alzheimer's""' disease, ''multiple sclerosis'"", and Korsakoff's psychosis are all accompanied or signaled by chemosensory problems like smell disorders."" "
Can smell disorders be treated?,"'Yes. Some people experience relief from smell disorders. Since certain medications can cause a problem, adjusting or changing that medicine may ease its effect on the sense of smell. Others recover their ability to smell when the illness causing their olfactory problem resolves. For patients with nasal obstructions such as polyps, surgery can remove the obstructions and restore airflow. Not infrequently, people enjoy a spontaneous recovery because olfactory neurons may regenerate following damage.'  "
What research is being done?,"'The NIDCD (National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders) supports basic and clinical investigations of chemosensory disorders at institutions across the Nation. Some of these studies are conducted at several chemosensory research centers, where scientists are making advances that help them understand our olfactory system and may lead to new treatments for smell disorders.''Some of the most recent research into our sense of smell is also the most exciting. Though a complete understanding of the uniquely sophisticated olfactory system is still in progress, recent studies on how receptors recognize odors, together with new technology, have revealed some long-hidden secrets to how the olfactory system manages to detect and discriminate between the many chemical compounds that form odors. Besides uncovering the physical mechanisms our bodies use to accomplish the act of identifying smell, these findings are helping scientists view the system as a model for other molecular sensory systems in the body. Further, scientists are confident that they are now laying the foundation to understanding the finest details about our sense of smell--research that may help them understand how smell affects and interacts with other physiological processes.'""Since scientists began studying the olfactory system, much has been discovered about how our chemosenses work, especially in how they're affected by ""'aging''. Like other senses in our bodies, our sense of smell can be greatly affected simply by our growing older. In fact, scientists have found that the sense of smell begins to decline after age 60. Women at all ages are generally more accurate than men in identifying odors, although ''smoking'' can adversely affect that ability in both men and women.'""Another area of discovery has been the olfactory system's reaction to different medications. Like our sense of taste, our sense of smell can be damaged by certain medicine. Surprisingly, other medications, especially those prescribed for ""'allergies'', have been associated with an improvement of the sense of smell. Scientists are working to find out why this is so and develop ''drugs'"" that can be used specifically to help restore the sense of smell to patients who've lost it. Also, smell cells (along with taste cells) are the only sensory cells that are regularly replaced throughout the life span. Scientists are examining these phenomena, which may provide ways to replace these and other damaged sensory and nerve cells."" "
What can I do to help myself?,"'The best thing you can do is see a doctor. Proper diagnosis by a trained professional, such as an otolaryngologist, is important. These physicians specialize in disorders of the head and neck, especially those related to the ear, nose, and throat. Diagnosis may lead to an effective treatment of the underlying cause of your smell disorder. Many types of smell disorders are curable, and for those that are not, counseling is available to help patients cope.' "
What is secondhand smoke?,"'Secondhand smoke refers to tobacco smoke that is passively breathed in by people in the vicinity of a person who is ''smoking''. Terms that have been used to refer to secondhand smoke are ''passive smoking'', involuntary smoking, or ''environmental tobacco smoke'' (ETS). Secondhand smoke is a mixture of the smoke from the tobacco product itself (termed sidestream smoke) and exhaled smoke from the smoker (known as mainstream smoke).''When a nonsmoker inhales secondhand smoke, he or she is exposed to the same toxins and chemicals, including ''nicotine'', as the smoker.''Exposure of children to secondhand smoke also increases their health risks; and children are especially vulnerable to the effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Even children who do not live with smokers may be at risk for adverse effects of secondhand smoke. Chemicals from tobacco smoke inhaled by a ''nursing'' mother are also known to reach breast milk.' "
What causes secondhand smoke?,"'Cigarettes are the most common sources of secondhand smoke, followed by cigars and pipe smoke. People can be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke anywhere - in their homes, in the workplace, and in recreational settings.' "
What are the health risks of secondhand smoke?,"'Secondhand smoke carries many health risks. At least 250 harmful chemicals have been identified in secondhand smoke, including at least 50 carcinogens (chemicals that are known to cause ''cancer''). Just some of the dangerous chemicals present in secondhand smoke include vinyl chloride, cadmium, benzene, arsenic, and ethylene oxide.''Secondhand smoke is known to cause ''cancer''. It has been classified as a ""known human carcinogen"" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is also associated with ''cardiovascular'' and respiratory diseases as well as other serious health conditions; several are listed below. '  "
Lung cancer and secondhand smoke,'Passive smoking is an established risk factor for the development of ''lung cancer''. Research has shown that nonsmokers who reside with a smoker have an increased risk for developing ''lung cancer'' when compared with nonsmokers who do not reside with a smoker.' 
Cardiovascular disease and secondhand smoke,"'Like ''cigarette'' smoking itself, secondhand smoke is a significant risk factor for the development of ''cardiovascular disease'' and ''heart attack''.' "
Other lung diseases and secondhand smoke,"'Coughing'', chest congestion, and decreased lung function can also occur in those exposed to passive smoke. ''Babies'' exposed to secondhand smoke can also develop serious respiratory infections. Passive smoking is believed to cause lung infections (such as ''pneumonia'' and ''bronchitis'') in children younger than 18 months of age each year.' "
Secondhand smoke and other effects on children,"'In addition to the risk of ''pneumonia'' and respiratory infections in babies exposed to secondhand smoke (see above), passive smoke is known to increase the severity of ''asthma in children'' with this condition. ''Middle ear'' infections in children are also occur as a result of exposure to secondhand smoke. Babies who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for ''sudden infant death syndrome'' (SIDS).' "
Secondhand smoke and the effects on pregnant women,"'Like women who smoke, ''pregnant'' women who are exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of having low-birthweight babies.' "
Secondhand smoke and the possible link to breast cancer,"'The question of whether or not passive smoking is associated with an increased risk of ''breast cancer'' is currently a source of both investigation and controversy. ''Breast cancer'' risk in active smokers is not known to be increased, yet some studies have found a possible link to ''breast cancer'' with exposure to passive smoke. In 2006, the U.S. Surgeon General\'s report concluded that there is ""suggestive but not sufficient"" evidence of a link at this point.' "
Is there a safe level of secondhand smoke?,"'While, logically, more extensive or prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with greatest risk of having medical problems as a result, no safe limit for exposure to secondhand smoke has been established. Even low levels of secondhand smoke can be harmful. This means that all exposure to secondhand smoke should be avoided whenever possible.' "
What can be done about secondhand smoke exposure?,"'Local, state, and national governments have enacted a variety of laws designed to protect people from health dangers associated with secondhand smoke. These laws vary according to location. The American Lung Association has a listing of these regulations grouped by U.S. state (see References below). Legislation to prevent smoking in workplaces and public buildings is on the rise as the public becomes more informed about the risks of secondhand smoke.''Obviously, quitting smoking if you are a smoker is the best way to protect your family and friends from secondhand smoke. A number of support systems, programs, and even prescription medications are available to help smokers break the habit. ''If you are a non-smoker, the safest way to avoid passive smoke is not to allow others to smoke in your home. This is particularly important if there are children in your home. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, smoke-free workplaces are the only way to protect people from exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace, since separate smoking areas, cleaning the air, and ventilating the building are not sufficient to prevent exposure if people still are permitted to smoke inside the building.'  "
What is thirdhand smoke?,"'Thirdhand smoke exposure is a new concept; it is exposure to many of the toxic agents in smoke that have accumulated (as residue) in clothing, drapes, rugs, furniture, dust, and other items due to secondhand smoke. The toxic agents, deposited in and on items from secondhand smoke, can be absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes of non-smokers, especially by infants and young children. ''Prevention'' of secondhand smoke exposure can prevent thirdhand smoke exposure.' "
What is chewing tobacco?,"'Chewing tobacco is sometimes known as smokeless tobacco or spitting tobacco. It is available in two forms, snuff and chewing tobacco. Both types of chewing tobacco are held in the mouth inside the cheek or between the cheek and gum. Snuff and chewing tobacco are commonly available in tins or pouches; popular brand names include Skoal and Copenhagen. Snus (pronounced like ""snoose"") is a finely ground form of snuff that originated in Norway and Sweden that comes in small tins. The amount of snuff placed in the mouth is referred to as a pinch, dip, lipper, or quid. A portion of chewing tobacco is referred to as a plug, wad, or chew.''Chewing tobacco is known to contain at least 28 ''cancer''-causing chemicals, medically known as carcinogens. The main carcinogens in chewing tobacco are the tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). Some of the other ''cancer''-causing agents found in chewing tobacco are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, arsenic, benzopyrene, nickel, and cadmium. Many people mistakenly believe that snus is a safe form of chewing tobacco because it is steam-heated rather than fermented when produced in Norway or Sweden, causing it to have fewer nitrosamines. However, snus still contains a number of ''cancer''-causing chemicals. Snus made in America is not necessarily processed in the same way as in Norway or Sweden.''Nicotine is also found in snuff and chewing tobacco, like all tobacco products. Although nicotine is absorbed more slowly from chewing tobacco than from cigarettes, 3 to 4 times more nicotine is absorbed from chewing tobacco than from a ''cigarette'', and the nicotine from chewing tobacco remains longer in the bloodstream. Nicotine is the substance responsible for tobacco ''addiction''.''Chewing tobacco is not the same thing as chewing cigarettes. Chewing cigarettes (also termed ''e-cigarettes'') are designed to provide nicotine in vapor to the user without burning tobacco. However, the smokeless cigarettes still provide addictive nicotine to the user and secondhand nicotine to others.'  "
What are the health risks of chewing tobacco?,'A number of significant health risks are associated with the use of chewing tobacco.' 
Cancer risk and chewing tobacco,"'Users of snuff and chewing tobacco are at an increased risk for certain types of ''cancer'', most notably ''cancer'' of the oral ''cavity'' including ''cancers'' of the:''Some studies have suggested a link between the use of chewing tobacco and the development of:'   cheek, gums, lips, tongue, and floor and roof of the mouth. pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, and stomach cancer."
Other health risks of chewing tobacco,"'Those who use chewing tobacco have an increased risk of:''All of the above have been linked to chewing tobacco use.''Some studies have shown a link between an increased risk of ''cardiovascular disease'' (including ''heart attacks'' and ''stroke'') in users of snuff and chewing tobacco, although these risks are not as great as those observed in ''smokers''. Further research is needed to determine whether or not chewing tobacco use presents a significant risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''.' developing gum diseases and gum recession (pulling away of the gum tissue from the teeth); leukoplakia (whitish patches inside the mouth that can become cancerous); abrasion (wearing down) of teeth; staining of teeth; tooth decay; and tooth loss."
Is chewing tobacco safer than cigarette smoking?,"'Chewing tobacco has been widely marketed as a way for cigarette smokers to use tobacco in smoke-free areas, so it is safer for other people because they are not exposed to ''secondhand smoke''. However, in 1986, a statement from the U.S. Surgeon General concluded that users of chewing tobacco should know that chewing tobacco ""is not a safe substitute for ''smoking'' cigarettes."" Chewing tobacco contains nicotine, which is highly addictive, as well as a number of known cancer-causing chemicals. Any form of tobacco use poses an increased risk of developing cancer, and no level is considered safe.''While the risks of getting cancer from chewing tobacco are lower than those associated with ''smoking'' cigarettes, the health risks of chewing tobacco are very real and potentially fatal. Chewing tobacco use also has not been shown to be helpful for smokers who want to ''quit smoking''.' "
What is being done to reduce the use of chewing tobacco?,"'Parents are encouraged by health care professionals, school authorities, and public health officials to include the topic of chewing tobacco use when they discuss the hazards of any tobacco use with their children, especially teenaged children. It is better never to start than try to stop the addictive tobacco (nicotine) habit in any form.''Legislation has been enacted to help reduce the number of people who use tobacco products and reduce adverse health risks associated with tobacco use. The Family ''Smoking'' ''Prevention'' and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the power to regulate tobacco products in the U.S., which will allow for increased regulation of marketing and advertising of tobacco products, including chewing tobacco.'""In 2015, San Francisco became the first U.S. city to ban the use of smokeless tobacco at sporting events, including AT&T Park, home of the city's Major League Baseball team, the Giants."" "
What treatments are available to help people quit using chewing tobacco?,"'Chewing tobacco is an ''addiction'' that can be overcome. As with ''cigarette smoking'', various support systems, programs, and even prescription medications are available to help people quit using chewing tobacco. Examples of products available used to wean a person from nicotine addiction from chewing tobacco include:''Prescription medicines such as ''bupropion'' SR (''Zyban'' and ''Wellbutrin'' SR) and ''varenicline'' tartrate (''Chantix'') have been effective in some patients who are trying to quit nicotine.'   nicotine gum (Nicorette), nicotine patches (Habitrol, Nicoderm CQ, Nicotrol), and lozenges."
Smoker's lung introduction,"'Cigarette smoking'' is associated with a wide variety of abnormalities throughout the body that cause not only illness, but also, all too often, death. Indeed, if all deaths from diseases related to ''smoking'' (lung disease, ''heart disease'', and ''cancers'' of many different organs) were considered, a case could be made for ''cigarette smoking'' as the leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Ironically, it is also the most preventable cause of death in our society!''This photo essay will focus on '""smoker's lung.""' The term ""smoker\'s lung"" refers to the structural and functional abnormalities (diseases) in the lung caused by ''cigarette smoking''. First, the normal structure and function of the lung will be described and illustrated. Then, the structural and functional abnormalities caused by ''smoking'' will be described and illustrated.' "
What is the structure of the normal lung?,"'We have a right lung and a left lung that reside in the chest ''cavity'' and surround the ''heart''. A thin membrane called the pleura covers the outer surface of the lung. The air we breathe gets into the lung through an ''airway'' (path for air). ''Figure 1'' is a diagram showing the main parts of the airway and lung.''The airway consists of the oral and nasal ''cavities'', which connect to the voice box (larynx), which connects to the windpipe (trachea). Note in the diagram that the windpipe splits into two air passages called bronchi, one going to each lung (right and left main bronchi). The trachea and larger bronchi contain C-shaped rigid bars of cartilage in their walls. The cartilage helps to keep the airway from collapsing when there is negative pressure in the airway, as occurs when we breathe in (inhale or inspire). The right lung has three separate sections (upper, middle, and lower lobes), while the left lung has just an upper and a lower lobe. Each lobe has its own bronchi and blood supply.''Further along in the airway, within the lung, the bronchi continue to divide into ever-smaller (narrower) tubes, much like the branches of a tree. (Hence, the term ''tracheobronchial tree''.) The walls of the bronchi contain muscles that can cause the airway to expand (widen) or contract (narrow). For example, during ''exercise'', the airway expands to increase airflow (ventilation). Conversely, when exposed to polluted or very ''cold'' air, the airway contracts to protect the downstream tissues from injury. The smaller branches of the bronchial tree, called ''bronchioles'', also contain muscle, but they lack cartilage. Notice in Figure 1 that the very smallest bronchioles (respiratory bronchioles) connect directly to tiny air sacs in the lung, called alveoli. ''Figure 2'' shows a microscopic section of a normal bronchial wall.''In this picture, you can see that the bronchial wall contains cartilage and muscle, as described above. Also, note that different types of cells make up the lining (epithelium) of the bronchi (as well as of the trachea and bronchioles). One type of cell is called a goblet cell because of its shape. The goblet cells produce ''mucus'', which lubricates the airways and traps inhaled foreign material (e.g., bacteria, ''viruses'', and pollutants). Other cells in the epithelium are called ciliated cells, which are discussed in the next paragraph. Beneath the surface of the airway, the goblet cells and other epithelial cells are clustered into structures called bronchial glands. These glands secrete additional mucus and other lubricating fluids.''Inflammatory cells are also in the normal bronchial wall. Look again at Figure 2 and observe that they are scattered beneath the lining of the airway. These inflammatory cells, also known as white blood cells, include neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Their job (in this situation) is to destroy and/or engulf any inhaled foreign material that becomes trapped in the mucus. In doing so, however, inflammatory cells create debris. To help dispose of the debris, most of the cells that line the airway have hair-like processes called ''cilia''. These ciliated cells sweep and push the foreign material and debris up into the larger airways where they can be coughed up or spit out.''The lung resembles a sponge and is composed of millions of alveoli. This structure provides a huge surface for ''gas'' exchange that has been estimated to be equal to the size of a tennis court. (These tiny air sacs can be seen with a magnifying glass.) ''Figure 3'' is a microscopic section of a normal lung, showing the alveoli.'""The wall (alveolar septum) of each alveolus contains a very small blood vessel called a capillary. Blood flows slowly through each capillary to allow time for the lung to perform its main function, which is the exchange of gas (oxygen and carbon dioxide). The actual site for gas exchange is pictured in the high magnification section on the right side of figure 3. Thus, the capillary blood picks up oxygen (O2) from the inhaled air in the alveoli. At the same time, the capillary blood releases the body's waste gases, most importantly carbon dioxide (CO2), into the alveoli. (Waste gases are by-products of the body's metabolism.)"" "
What processes determine normal function of the lung?,"'As just indicated, the main function of the lung is the exchange of the gases oxygen and carbon dioxide. So, the blood in the alveolar capillaries takes oxygen from inhaled air that is in the alveoli. Then, the oxygenated blood circulates through the body to deliver the oxygen to the tissues. In the exchange of gases, the blood in the alveolar capillaries releases carbon dioxide to the alveoli. Then, when we breathe out (exhale or expire), the carbon dioxide is removed from the alveoli through the airway and eliminated from body. Accordingly, three processes determine normal lung function:''Ventilation ''is the moving of air into and out of the lung. This process requires an open (unobstructed) airway. Increasing and decreasing the size of the chest ''cavity'' is what accomplishes the movement of air. You see, as the chest cavity enlarges, a vacuum is created in the airway and air rushes in. Then, with ''breathing'' out, the chest cavity becomes smaller and air is pushed out. The muscles in the chest wall (intercostal muscles between the ribs), and the muscles in the ''diaphragm'' work together to change the size of the chest cavity. (The diaphragm is a flat muscular membrane that separates the chest from the abdomen.) In addition, when we breathe really hard, we even use muscles in the neck (referred to as accessory muscles for breathing) to help expand the chest.''Diffusion'' is the process that accomplishes the actual gas exchange across the alveolar walls. This process requires normal alveolar septae (the walls of the air sacs) that contain intact capillaries. Finally, a normal ''blood supply'' depends on normal capillaries, normal red blood cell counts (no ''anemia''), and normal pumping of blood by the heart. Any disease that interferes with ventilation, diffusion, or blood supply to the lung will impair lung (pulmonary) function and decrease delivery of oxygen to the tissues of the body.' Ventilation Diffusion Blood supply"
What are the abnormalities (diseases) in smoker's lung?,"""The major abnormalities in smoker's lung are grouped under the label of ""'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''). It is estimated that 40 million people worldwide suffer from ''COPD''. ''COPD'' is the 4th leading cause of death in the USA. Even more disturbing is the fact that COPD is the only one of the ""top 5"" ''causes of death'' to increase in the past decade. While COPD has been thought of as a disease of men, it is estimated that by the year 2010 there will be more women than men affected by COPD. These statistics are especially sad because COPD is a preventable disease by stopping ''smoking''; unfortunately, this is easier said than done. About 70% of ''smokers'' want to quit, but only 7% who try are smoke free after one year. However, one should not give up. Numerous tries, sometimes more than 10, and professional help often are needed, but the health benefits of ''smoking cessation'' make it worth the effort.''COPD is made up of two major, related diseases. One, ''emphysema'', involves the lung alveoli, and the other, ''chronic bronchitis'', involves the bronchial airway. (Both conditions are discussed below.) In this essay, I will use the term chronic ''bronchitis'' to include chronic ''bronchiolitis'' and chronic respiratory ''bronchiolitis''. I do this because these three conditions have the same pathology (structural abnormalities), cause the same symptoms, and differ only in their location in the airway. At any rate, some smokers primarily have ''emphysema'' and some primarily have chronic ''bronchitis''. Most, however, have a combination of these two diseases.' "
What happens to the lung in emphysema?,"'In emphysema, the walls of the air sacs (alveolar septae) are destroyed. Consequently, the individual air spaces (alveoli) become larger but irregular and decreased in number. These larger spaces are less efficient than normal sized alveoli for gas exchange. Thus, emphysema impairs diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide (gas exchange). The more extensive the emphysema, the poorer the gas exchange becomes. Also, in emphysema, the capillaries are destroyed with the rest of the alveolar wall. As a result, emphysema also disrupts the normal blood supply. ''Figure 4 '""contrasts the nasty appearance of a smoker's emphysematous lung with a normal lung.""'Emphysema usually starts in the upper lobes of the lung and, as depicted in this photo, is more severe in the upper lobes for complex reasons. That is, the abnormal (enlarged and irregular) air sacs (alveoli) are more prominent in the upper lobes. (The blood vessels in the ''lungs'' should not be mistaken for the abnormal air sacs.) '""In someone with severe emphysema, the entire chest actually can enlarge. What probably happens is that the patient's extra (compensatory) efforts to suck in as much air as possible (to increase ventilation) contribute to enlarging the lungs and the chest. Thus, a person with severe emphysema often develops what has been described as a ""'barrel-chest.' "
How does emphysema come about?,"'Simply put, the ''cigarette'' smoke attracts inflammatory cells (white blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages) into the lung. Then, the inflammatory cells release substances called proteases. The proteases dissolve the proteins in the alveolar walls (septae) and thereby destroy the septae. As a result, the alveoli join together (coalesce) to form the larger, irregular, inefficient air sacs.''It turns out that about half of all smokers develop emphysema. Mild emphysema is seen occasionally in non-smokers and may be due to ''passive smoking'' (exposure to other people smoking, or ""''secondhand smoke''"") and industrial air pollution. Severe emphysema, however, is seen only in smokers or in some people with rare ''inherited'' diseases (e.g., alpha-1-''antitrypsin'' deficiency). Still, it takes about 30 years of smoking to develop ''fatal '""emphysema. This is because people usually don't die from emphysema until more than 60% of the lung tissue is affected."" "
Why does smoker's lung look black?,"'The lung is connected and exposed by the airways to a potentially noxious outside world. Accordingly, the alveolar spaces normally contain specialized scavenger cells, called alveolar macrophages. The job of these macrophages is to engulf (phagocytize) any possibly harmful foreign material that enters the lung through the airways.''As you can imagine, cigarette smoke contains many impurities that are inhaled in great numbers directly into the lung. For this reason, the alveolar spaces of the smoker contain numerous scavenger cells (macrophages) that are filled with engulfed (phagocytized) particles of impurities and debris, as illustrated in '""Under the microscope, with this high magnification, you can actually see the black and brown engulfed particles in the alveolar scavenger cells. Indeed, smoker's lung may have so much of this particulate material that the lung looks gray-black to the naked eye. Most of the time, you don't need a microscope to tell if someone is or was a heavy smoker. A naked eye examination of a smoker's lung will usually reveal an enlarged gray-black lung with enlarged air spaces (the emphysema, as you saw in Figure 4 and will see again in Figure 8)."" "
What happens to the airways in chronic bronchitis?,"'In chronic ''bronchitis'', smoke damages the cells that line the airway (epithelial cells). ''Nicotine'' is one of the many components of cigarette smoke that is directly toxic to the lining cells of the airway. (Of course, the nicotine is also addictive.) The tissue damage attracts inflammatory cells. These cells then release enzymes that further damage the lining cells of the airway and stimulate goblet cells to increase in number and to increase mucus production. ''Figure 6'' is a microscopic section of a bronchial wall in a smoker with chronic bronchitis.''The major consequence of chronic bronchitis is airway obstruction. In fact, this figure demonstrates mucus and debris blocking the bronchial airway. Indeed, the most important cause of airway obstruction in chronic bronchitis is blockage by mucus, inflammation, progressive scarring (fibrosis), and/or narrowing (constriction) of the airways. As a result of the bronchial blockage, gases cannot get to and from the alveoli. In other words, chronic bronchitis interferes with ventilation.''It is important to know that people with ''asthma'' likewise have chronic bronchitis with airway obstruction. In ''asthma'', however, the cause of obstruction is somewhat different and the obstruction usually occurs in attacks that are reversible. In any case, both smokers and asthmatics with bronchitis may ''cough'', wheeze, and spit up thick mucus (sputum) from the lung.' "
Are smokers with COPD predisposed to developing pneumonia?,"'The answer is yes. As previously mentioned, smoking increases mucus production and impairs the clearing action of the cilia in the airway. Also, the addition of bacteria, inflammatory cells, and damaged lung cells to the secretions in the airway and lung make the secretions especially thick, tenacious, and difficult to clear. Therefore, in such a stagnant and nutritious (the mucus) environment, bacteria can flourish and cause infection of the lung (''pneumonia''). Furthermore, even the inflammatory cells are damaged by tobacco smoke so that their ability to fight infection is diminished.''For all of these reasons, ''pneumonia'' is not only more common, but it is often also more severe in smokers with COPD (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'', that is, emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis) than in non-smokers without COPD. Moreover, the inflammatory cells that accumulate in the lung to fight off the infection can fill the alveolar spaces and thereby further limit diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Therefore, smokers with COPD, who already have impaired breathing (pulmonary function), often become much worse when there is a superimposed infection of the lung (''pneumonia'').''Figure 7'' is a microscopic section of a lung with pneumonia in a patient with COPD.''Notice that most of the alveoli are filled with inflammatory cells. Some alveoli, however, are unaffected and empty because the involvement of this lung with pneumonia is patchy.'  "
What about lung cancer in smokers?,"'Smoke contains more than 60 carcinogens (chemicals that cause ''cancer'') and about 200 known toxic substances. Scientists are still learning about how carcinogens work and why only some people who smoke get ''lung cancer'"". Genes are the hereditary units in chromosomes and appear to have a lot to do with a person's susceptibility to ""'cancer''. The genes are made up of DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid), which controls how cells divide and reproduce (proliferate). Damage to DNA from cigarette smoke can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and growth, which is what ''cancer'' is finally all about.''It is of interest that some smokers develop COPD, some develop ''lung cancer'"", some get neither, and some get both. We really don't know the reason for these different susceptibilities. Besides that, lung cancer from smoking can take a number of different forms. For example, the cancer cells can resemble cells of the skin (""'squamous cell carcinoma''), cells of the bronchial glands (''adenocarcinoma''), or specialized cells of the nervous system (neuroendocrine ''carcinoma''). ''Figure 8'"" shows an adenocarcinoma in a smoker's lung with severe emphysema.""""What do you think the outcome (prognosis) is for this patient with lung cancer? Well, almost all types of lung cancer are particularly deadly. Thus, if a lung cancer is more than an inch or so in diameter (as in this patient) or has spread outside of the lung, fewer than 50% of affected individuals will survive another 5 years. And that is even with the best of therapy. What's more, consider a cancer that is less than an inch in size (or not large enough to be seen on a ""'chest X-ray'') and is confined to the lung. Unfortunately, even if such a cancer is completely removed by surgery, about 25% of individuals will still die from the cancer in less than 5 years from the time of diagnosis. The reason for this poor outcome (prognosis) is that lung cancers tend to spread (''metastasize'') early in the course of disease to other organs, most often the brain, ''liver'', and bone.' "
Are any of the pulmonary consequences of smoking reversible?,"'First, the bad news is that emphysema is not reversible. But now, the good news! If a person stops smoking, the inflammatory changes (chronic bronchitis) in the airways probably will go away. Furthermore, when a person stops smoking, the risk of developing lung cancer decreases, although it never goes back to normal. In other words, the risk of cancer in ex-smokers is less than in smokers, but remains greater than in non-smokers.' "
From what do smokers die?,"'Remarkably, despite a wealth of information on death rates (mortality) from cigarette smoking, little information is available on the specific causes of death in smokers. Smokers with COPD can die from lack of oxygen (''hypoxia'') in the tissues of the body. The hypoxia occurs because there is so little functioning lung left and/or the effort of breathing is so great that affected individuals just stop breathing from exhaustion. Other important causes of death in smokers include lung infection (pneumonia), lung cancer, cancers of the digestive, urinary, and genital systems, and ''leukemia''. Indeed, because smoking can cause cancer in so many organs, 30% of all cancer deaths can be related to cigarette smoking.''Nevertheless, because smoking is such a powerful risk factor for the development of ''coronary atherosclerosis'' (hardening and blockage of the arteries of the heart), ''heart disease'' is by far the most common cause of death in smokers. Moreover, since autopsies are done in less than 10% of patients who die in hospitals and less than 1% of patients who die in ''nursing'"" homes, we really can't prove why most smokers die. You see, even though a clinician is often correct about the cause of a person's death, only an ""'autopsy'' can be definitive.' "
Introduction,"""Leukoplakia is a white or gray patch that develops on the tongue or the inside of the cheek. It is the mouth's reaction to chronic irritation of the mucous membranes of the mouth. Leukoplakia patches can also develop on the female genital area; however, the cause of this is unknown.""'The growth can occur at any time in your life, but it is most common in the elderly.''""Hairy"" leukoplakia of the mouth is an unusual form of leukoplakia that is seen only in people who are infected with ''HIV'', have ''AIDS'', or ''AIDS-related complex''. It consists of fuzzy, hence the name ""hairy,"" white patches on the tongue and less frequently elsewhere in the mouth. It may resemble ''thrush'', an infection caused by the fungus Candida which, in adults, usually occurs if your immune system is not working properly, and may be one of the first signs of infection with the ''HIV'' virus.' "
What Causes Leukoplakia?," Irritation from rough teeth, fillings, or crowns, or ill-fitting dentures that rub against your cheek or gum Chronic smoking, pipe smoking, or other tobacco use Sun exposure to the lips Oral cancer, although rare HIV or AIDS"
What Are the Symptoms?,"'The presence of white or gray colored patches on your tongue, gums, roof of your mouth, or the inside of the cheeks of your mouth may be a sign of leukoplakia. The patch may have developed slowly over weeks to months and be thick, slightly raised, and may eventually take on a hardened and rough texture. It usually is painless, but may be sensitive to touch, heat, spicy foods, or other irritation.'  "
How Is Leukoplakia Diagnosed?,"'Your dentist may suspect leukoplakia upon examination; however, a biopsy will likely be taken to rule out other causes, such as ''oral cancer''. During the biopsy, a small piece of tissue from the lesion will be removed to be examined in a lab. A numbing agent will be used so that you will not feel any ''pain''.' "
How Is Leukoplakia Treated?,"'Treatment, if needed, involves removing the source of irritation. For example, if leukoplakia is caused by a rough tooth or an irregular surface on a ''denture'' or filling the tooth will be smoothed and dental appliances repaired. If leukoplakia is caused by ''smoking'', you will be asked to minimize or stop smoking or using other tobacco products.''Leukoplakia is usually harmless, and lesions usually clear in a few weeks or months after the source of irritation is removed. If eliminating the source of irritation is ineffective in reducing leukoplakia, the lesion may need to be surgically removed. The lesion can be removed either by your general dentist or by an ''oral surgeon'' in their office under local anesthesia.''Hairy leukoplakia requires treatment with an antiviral medication.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by Charlotte E.

What processes determine normal function of the lung?,"'As just indicated, the main function of the lung is the exchange of the gases oxygen and carbon dioxide. So, the blood in the alveolar capillaries takes oxygen from inhaled air that is in the alveoli. Then, the oxygenated blood circulates through the body to deliver the oxygen to the tissues. In the exchange of gases, the blood in the alveolar capillaries releases carbon dioxide to the alveoli. Then, when we breathe out (exhale or expire), the carbon dioxide is removed from the alveoli through the airway and eliminated from body. Accordingly, three processes determine normal lung function:''Ventilation ''is the moving of air into and out of the lung. This process requires an open (unobstructed) airway. Increasing and decreasing the size of the chest ''cavity'' is what accomplishes the movement of air. You see, as the chest cavity enlarges, a vacuum is created in the airway and air rushes in. Then, with ''breathing'' out, the chest cavity becomes smaller and air is pushed out. The muscles in the chest wall (intercostal muscles between the ribs), and the muscles in the ''diaphragm'' work together to change the size of the chest cavity. (The diaphragm is a flat muscular membrane that separates the chest from the abdomen.) In addition, when we breathe really hard, we even use muscles in the neck (referred to as accessory muscles for breathing) to help expand the chest.''Diffusion'' is the process that accomplishes the actual gas exchange across the alveolar walls. This process requires normal alveolar septae (the walls of the air sacs) that contain intact capillaries. Finally, a normal ''blood supply'' depends on normal capillaries, normal red blood cell counts (no ''anemia''), and normal pumping of blood by the heart. Any disease that interferes with ventilation, diffusion, or blood supply to the lung will impair lung (pulmonary) function and decrease delivery of oxygen to the tissues of the body.' Ventilation Diffusion Blood supply"
What are the abnormalities (diseases) in smoker's lung?,"""The major abnormalities in smoker's lung are grouped under the label of ""'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''). It is estimated that 40 million people worldwide suffer from ''COPD''. ''COPD'' is the 4th leading cause of death in the USA. Even more disturbing is the fact that COPD is the only one of the ""top 5"" ''causes of death'' to increase in the past decade. While COPD has been thought of as a disease of men, it is estimated that by the year 2010 there will be more women than men affected by COPD. These statistics are especially sad because COPD is a preventable disease by stopping ''smoking''; unfortunately, this is easier said than done. About 70% of ''smokers'' want to quit, but only 7% who try are smoke free after one year. However, one should not give up. Numerous tries, sometimes more than 10, and professional help often are needed, but the health benefits of ''smoking cessation'' make it worth the effort.''COPD is made up of two major, related diseases. One, ''emphysema'', involves the lung alveoli, and the other, ''chronic bronchitis'', involves the bronchial airway. (Both conditions are discussed below.) In this essay, I will use the term chronic ''bronchitis'' to include chronic ''bronchiolitis'' and chronic respiratory ''bronchiolitis''. I do this because these three conditions have the same pathology (structural abnormalities), cause the same symptoms, and differ only in their location in the airway. At any rate, some smokers primarily have ''emphysema'' and some primarily have chronic ''bronchitis''. Most, however, have a combination of these two diseases.' "
What happens to the lung in emphysema?,"'In emphysema, the walls of the air sacs (alveolar septae) are destroyed. Consequently, the individual air spaces (alveoli) become larger but irregular and decreased in number. These larger spaces are less efficient than normal sized alveoli for gas exchange. Thus, emphysema impairs diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide (gas exchange). The more extensive the emphysema, the poorer the gas exchange becomes. Also, in emphysema, the capillaries are destroyed with the rest of the alveolar wall. As a result, emphysema also disrupts the normal blood supply. ''Figure 4 '""contrasts the nasty appearance of a smoker's emphysematous lung with a normal lung.""'Emphysema usually starts in the upper lobes of the lung and, as depicted in this photo, is more severe in the upper lobes for complex reasons. That is, the abnormal (enlarged and irregular) air sacs (alveoli) are more prominent in the upper lobes. (The blood vessels in the ''lungs'' should not be mistaken for the abnormal air sacs.) '""In someone with severe emphysema, the entire chest actually can enlarge. What probably happens is that the patient's extra (compensatory) efforts to suck in as much air as possible (to increase ventilation) contribute to enlarging the lungs and the chest. Thus, a person with severe emphysema often develops what has been described as a ""'barrel-chest.' "
How does emphysema come about?,"'Simply put, the ''cigarette'' smoke attracts inflammatory cells (white blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages) into the lung. Then, the inflammatory cells release substances called proteases. The proteases dissolve the proteins in the alveolar walls (septae) and thereby destroy the septae. As a result, the alveoli join together (coalesce) to form the larger, irregular, inefficient air sacs.''It turns out that about half of all smokers develop emphysema. Mild emphysema is seen occasionally in non-smokers and may be due to ''passive smoking'' (exposure to other people smoking, or ""''secondhand smoke''"") and industrial air pollution. Severe emphysema, however, is seen only in smokers or in some people with rare ''inherited'' diseases (e.g., alpha-1-''antitrypsin'' deficiency). Still, it takes about 30 years of smoking to develop ''fatal '""emphysema. This is because people usually don't die from emphysema until more than 60% of the lung tissue is affected."" "
Why does smoker's lung look black?,"'The lung is connected and exposed by the airways to a potentially noxious outside world. Accordingly, the alveolar spaces normally contain specialized scavenger cells, called alveolar macrophages. The job of these macrophages is to engulf (phagocytize) any possibly harmful foreign material that enters the lung through the airways.''As you can imagine, cigarette smoke contains many impurities that are inhaled in great numbers directly into the lung. For this reason, the alveolar spaces of the smoker contain numerous scavenger cells (macrophages) that are filled with engulfed (phagocytized) particles of impurities and debris, as illustrated in '""Under the microscope, with this high magnification, you can actually see the black and brown engulfed particles in the alveolar scavenger cells. Indeed, smoker's lung may have so much of this particulate material that the lung looks gray-black to the naked eye. Most of the time, you don't need a microscope to tell if someone is or was a heavy smoker. A naked eye examination of a smoker's lung will usually reveal an enlarged gray-black lung with enlarged air spaces (the emphysema, as you saw in Figure 4 and will see again in Figure 8)."" "
What happens to the airways in chronic bronchitis?,"'In chronic ''bronchitis'', smoke damages the cells that line the airway (epithelial cells). ''Nicotine'' is one of the many components of cigarette smoke that is directly toxic to the lining cells of the airway. (Of course, the nicotine is also addictive.) The tissue damage attracts inflammatory cells. These cells then release enzymes that further damage the lining cells of the airway and stimulate goblet cells to increase in number and to increase mucus production. ''Figure 6'' is a microscopic section of a bronchial wall in a smoker with chronic bronchitis.''The major consequence of chronic bronchitis is airway obstruction. In fact, this figure demonstrates mucus and debris blocking the bronchial airway. Indeed, the most important cause of airway obstruction in chronic bronchitis is blockage by mucus, inflammation, progressive scarring (fibrosis), and/or narrowing (constriction) of the airways. As a result of the bronchial blockage, gases cannot get to and from the alveoli. In other words, chronic bronchitis interferes with ventilation.''It is important to know that people with ''asthma'' likewise have chronic bronchitis with airway obstruction. In ''asthma'', however, the cause of obstruction is somewhat different and the obstruction usually occurs in attacks that are reversible. In any case, both smokers and asthmatics with bronchitis may ''cough'', wheeze, and spit up thick mucus (sputum) from the lung.' "
Are smokers with COPD predisposed to developing pneumonia?,"'The answer is yes. As previously mentioned, smoking increases mucus production and impairs the clearing action of the cilia in the airway. Also, the addition of bacteria, inflammatory cells, and damaged lung cells to the secretions in the airway and lung make the secretions especially thick, tenacious, and difficult to clear. Therefore, in such a stagnant and nutritious (the mucus) environment, bacteria can flourish and cause infection of the lung (''pneumonia''). Furthermore, even the inflammatory cells are damaged by tobacco smoke so that their ability to fight infection is diminished.''For all of these reasons, ''pneumonia'' is not only more common, but it is often also more severe in smokers with COPD (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'', that is, emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis) than in non-smokers without COPD. Moreover, the inflammatory cells that accumulate in the lung to fight off the infection can fill the alveolar spaces and thereby further limit diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Therefore, smokers with COPD, who already have impaired breathing (pulmonary function), often become much worse when there is a superimposed infection of the lung (''pneumonia'').''Figure 7'' is a microscopic section of a lung with pneumonia in a patient with COPD.''Notice that most of the alveoli are filled with inflammatory cells. Some alveoli, however, are unaffected and empty because the involvement of this lung with pneumonia is patchy.'  "
What about lung cancer in smokers?,"'Smoke contains more than 60 carcinogens (chemicals that cause ''cancer'') and about 200 known toxic substances. Scientists are still learning about how carcinogens work and why only some people who smoke get ''lung cancer'"". Genes are the hereditary units in chromosomes and appear to have a lot to do with a person's susceptibility to ""'cancer''. The genes are made up of DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid), which controls how cells divide and reproduce (proliferate). Damage to DNA from cigarette smoke can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and growth, which is what ''cancer'' is finally all about.''It is of interest that some smokers develop COPD, some develop ''lung cancer'"", some get neither, and some get both. We really don't know the reason for these different susceptibilities. Besides that, lung cancer from smoking can take a number of different forms. For example, the cancer cells can resemble cells of the skin (""'squamous cell carcinoma''), cells of the bronchial glands (''adenocarcinoma''), or specialized cells of the nervous system (neuroendocrine ''carcinoma''). ''Figure 8'"" shows an adenocarcinoma in a smoker's lung with severe emphysema.""""What do you think the outcome (prognosis) is for this patient with lung cancer? Well, almost all types of lung cancer are particularly deadly. Thus, if a lung cancer is more than an inch or so in diameter (as in this patient) or has spread outside of the lung, fewer than 50% of affected individuals will survive another 5 years. And that is even with the best of therapy. What's more, consider a cancer that is less than an inch in size (or not large enough to be seen on a ""'chest X-ray'') and is confined to the lung. Unfortunately, even if such a cancer is completely removed by surgery, about 25% of individuals will still die from the cancer in less than 5 years from the time of diagnosis. The reason for this poor outcome (prognosis) is that lung cancers tend to spread (''metastasize'') early in the course of disease to other organs, most often the brain, ''liver'', and bone.' "
Are any of the pulmonary consequences of smoking reversible?,"'First, the bad news is that emphysema is not reversible. But now, the good news! If a person stops smoking, the inflammatory changes (chronic bronchitis) in the airways probably will go away. Furthermore, when a person stops smoking, the risk of developing lung cancer decreases, although it never goes back to normal. In other words, the risk of cancer in ex-smokers is less than in smokers, but remains greater than in non-smokers.' "
From what do smokers die?,"'Remarkably, despite a wealth of information on death rates (mortality) from cigarette smoking, little information is available on the specific causes of death in smokers. Smokers with COPD can die from lack of oxygen (''hypoxia'') in the tissues of the body. The hypoxia occurs because there is so little functioning lung left and/or the effort of breathing is so great that affected individuals just stop breathing from exhaustion. Other important causes of death in smokers include lung infection (pneumonia), lung cancer, cancers of the digestive, urinary, and genital systems, and ''leukemia''. Indeed, because smoking can cause cancer in so many organs, 30% of all cancer deaths can be related to cigarette smoking.''Nevertheless, because smoking is such a powerful risk factor for the development of ''coronary atherosclerosis'' (hardening and blockage of the arteries of the heart), ''heart disease'' is by far the most common cause of death in smokers. Moreover, since autopsies are done in less than 10% of patients who die in hospitals and less than 1% of patients who die in ''nursing'"" homes, we really can't prove why most smokers die. You see, even though a clinician is often correct about the cause of a person's death, only an ""'autopsy'' can be definitive.' "
Smoking and Heart Disease Introduction,"'Most people associate ''cigarette'' ''smoking'' with ''breathing'' problems and ''lung cancer''. But did you know that ''smoking'' is also a major cause of ''heart disease'' for men and women?''About 20% of all deaths from ''heart disease'' in the U.S. are directly related to cigarette ''smoking'"". That's because smoking is a major cause of coronary artery disease.""""A person's risk of ""'heart disease'' and ''heart attack'' greatly increases with the number of cigarettes he or she smokes. Smokers continue to increase their risk of heart attack the longer they smoke. People who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day have more than twice the risk of heart attack than nonsmokers. Women who smoke and also take ''birth control pills'' increase several times their risk of heart attack, ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''.''Cigarette smoke not only affects smokers. When you smoke, the people around you are also at risk for developing health problems, especially children. ''Environmental tobacco smoke'' (also called passive smoke or ''secondhand smoke'') affects people who are frequently around smokers. ''Secondhand smoke'' can cause chronic respiratory conditions, ''cancer'', and heart disease. It is estimated that around 35,000 nonsmokers die from heart disease each year as a result of exposure to environmental ''tobacco'' smoke.' "
How Does Smoking Increase Heart Disease Risk?,'The ''nicotine'' present in smoke causes heart disease by:' Decreasing oxygen to the heart. Increasing blood pressure and heart rate. Increasing blood clotting. Damaging to cells that line coronary arteries and other blood vessels.
How Can Quitting Smoking Be Helpful?,"'Now that you know how smoking can be harmful to your health and the health of those around you, here are some ways quitting can be helpful. If you quit smoking, you will:' Prolong your life. Reduce your risk of disease (including heart disease, heart attack, 
	high 
blood pressure, lung cancer, throat cancer, 
	emphysema, ulcers, 
	gum disease, and 
other conditions). Feel healthier. After quitting, you won't cough as much, you'll have fewer 
sore throats and you will increase your stamina. Look better. Quitting can help you prevent face

How to Quit Smoking,"""There's no one way to quit smoking that works for everyone. To quit, you must be ready both emotionally and mentally. You must also want to quit smoking for yourself and not to please your friends or family. It helps to plan ahead. This guide may help get you started.""  "
What Should I Do First to Stop Smoking?,"'Pick a date to stop smoking and then stick to it.''Write down your reasons for quitting smoking. Read over the list every day, before and after you quit. Here are some tips to think about.' Write down when you smoke, why you smoke, and what you are doing when you 
smoke. You will learn what triggers you to smoke. Stop smoking cigarettes in certain situations (such as during your work 
break or after dinner) before actually quitting. Make a list of activities you can do instead of smoking. Be ready to do 
something else when you want to smoke. Ask your doctor about using
	nicotine gum or patches. Some people find these 
aids helpful. Join a smoking cessation support group or program. Call your local chapter 
of the American Lung Association."
How Can I Avoid Smoking Again?,"  Don't carry a lighter, matches, or cigarettes. Keep all of these smoking 
reminders out of sight. If you live with a smoker, ask that person not to smoke in your presence, 
or better yet, to quit with you. Don't focus on what you are missing. Think about the healthier way of life 
you are gaining. When you get the urge to smoke, take a deep breath. Hold it for 10 seconds 
and release it slowly. Repeat this several times until the urge to smoke is 
gone. Keep your hands busy. Doodle, play with a pencil or straw, or work on a 
computer. Change activities that were connected to smoking cigarettes. Take a walk or 
read a book instead of taking a cigarette break. When you can, avoid places, people, and situations associated with smoking. 
Hang out with nonsmokers or go to places that don't allow smoking, such as the 
movies, museums, shops, or libraries. Don't substitute food or sugar-based products for cigarette smoking. Eat 
low-calorie, healthful foods (such as carrot or celery sticks, sugar-free hard 
candies) or chew gum when the urge to smoke strikes so you can avoid weight 
gain. Drink plenty of fluids, but limit alcoholic and caffeinated beverages. They 
can trigger urges to smoke. Exercise. Exercising will help you relax. Get support for quitting. Tell others about your milestones with pride. Work with your doctor to develop a plan using over-the-counter or 
prescription nicotine-replacement aids."
How Will I Feel When I Quit Smoking?,"'You may crave cigarettes, be irritable, feel very hungry, ''cough'' often, get ''headaches'', or have ''difficulty concentrating''. These symptoms of withdrawal occur because your body is used to nicotine, the active addictive agent within cigarettes.''When withdrawal symptoms occur within the first two weeks after quitting, stay in control. Think about your reasons for quitting. Remind yourself that these are signs that your body is healing and getting used to being without cigarettes.''The withdrawal symptoms are only temporary. They are strongest when you first quit but will usually go away within 10 to 14 days. Remember that withdrawal symptoms are easier to treat than the major diseases -- like heart disease and lung ''cancer'' -- that smoking can cause.'""You may still have the desire to smoke, since there are many strong associations with smoking. People may associate smoking with specific situations, with a variety of emotions or with certain people in their lives. The best way to overcome these associations is to experience them without smoking cigarettes. If you relapse do not lose hope. Seventy-five percent of those who quit smoke again. Most smokers quit three times before they are successful. If you relapse, don't give up! Plan ahead and think about what you will do next time you get the urge to smoke.""'The good news is your risk of heart disease is cut in half after quitting tobacco for one year. After 15 smoke free years, your risk is similar to that of a person who has never smoked.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Facts you should know about smoking and quitting smoking," Although smoking is an addiction, people can quit smoking. Secondhand smoke is harmful to the health of children, unborn children, family members, and coworkers. Quitting smoking cuts the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory diseases. The steps in quitting, each of which requires special attention and efforts by the smoker, are getting ready to quit, quitting, and staying quit. A number of techniques are available to assist people who want to quit, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), behavioral modification, self-help literature, and prescription medications. In nicotine replacement therapy, which is the cornerstone of most smoking cessation programs, another source of nicotine is substituted while the cigarettes are stopped. (The idea of nicotine replacement therapy is to eliminate both the smoking habit - although the addiction remains - and the symptoms of withdrawal. Then, the replacement nicotine is gradually stopped.) Currently, three forms of nicotine replacement therapy are available over the counter: nicotine patches, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges, while two forms are available by prescription, an inhaler and a nasal spray. Nicotine replacement therapy has about a 25% success rate, which increases to 35% or 40% when nicotine replacement therapy is combined with intensive behavioral counseling. Nicotine-containing substances have side effects, interactions with other medications, effects on other medical conditions, and limitations in their use. Varenicline (Chantix) is a prescription drug that can help adults quit smoking. It is believed to act on the same receptors (the sites where nicotine acts to produce its effects) in the brain as nicotine, resulting in activation (stimulation) of these receptors and blocking the ability of nicotine to attach to these receptors. A prescription drug called bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin) has also been found to be effective in helping people to stop smoking. e-cigarettes are smokable, refillable or replaceable cartridges or cartridges that hold liquid that contains nicotine, solvents, and flavors. The safety of e-cigarettes is not known at this time."
What problems does smoking cause?,"'By smoking, you can cause health problems not only for yourself but also for those around you.'""Smoking is an addiction. Tobacco contains nicotine, a drug that is addictive. The nicotine, therefore, makes it very difficult (although not impossible) to quit. In fact, since the U.S. Surgeon General's 1964 report on the dangers of smoking, millions of Americans have quit. Still, approximately 484,000 deaths occur in the U.S. each year from smoking-related illnesses. This represents almost 1 out of every 5 deaths. The reason for these deaths is that smoking greatly increases the risk of getting ""'lung cancer'', ''heart attack'', chronic lung disease, ''stroke'', and many other ''cancers''. Smokers die an average of 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. Smoking is the most preventable cause of death. In addition, smoking is perhaps the most preventable cause of ''breathing'' (respiratory) diseases within the USA.'""Smoking harms not just the smoker, but also family members, coworkers, and others who breathe the smoker's cigarette smoke, called ""'secondhand smoke'' or passive smoke. Among infants up to 18 months of age, secondhand smoke is associated with as many as 300,000 cases of ''chronic bronchitis'' and ''pneumonia'"" each year. In addition, secondhand smoke from a parent's cigarette increases a child's chances for middle ear problems, causes ""'coughing'' and ''wheezing'', worsens ''asthma'"", and increases an infant's risk of dying from ""'sudden infant death syndrome'' (''SIDS'').''Smoking is also harmful to the unborn fetus. If a ''pregnant'' woman smokes, her fetus is at an increased risk of ''miscarriage'', early delivery (prematurity), ''stillbirth'', infant death, and low birth weight. In fact, it has been estimated that if all women quit ''smoking during pregnancy'', about 4,000 new ''babies'' would not die each year.''Exposure to passive smoke can also cause ''cancer''. Research has shown that non-smokers who reside with a smoker have a 24% increase in risk for developing lung ''cancer'' when compared with other non-smokers. An estimated 3,000 lung ''cancer'' deaths occur each year in the U.S. that are attributable to ''passive smoking'', and an estimated 49,000 deaths each year in total from all smoking-related conditions occur as a result of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke also increases the risk of ''stroke'' and ''heart disease''. If both parents smoke, a teenager is more than twice as likely to smoke as a teenager whose parents are both nonsmokers. Even in households where only one parent smokes, young people are more likely to start smoking.'""The term addictive disease or addiction describes a persistent habit that is harmful to the person. Thus, addiction is a chronic (long duration) disease with reliance on the substance causing the addiction. The addictive substance also causes the accompanying deterioration of a person's physical and psychological health.""""Psychologically, an individual's behavior pattern establishes how the addictive substance is used. One type of behavior is compulsive behavior, which is an overwhelming and irresistible interest in use of the substance. For example, the compulsive addict makes sure that the substance is always available. Another type of behavior is habitual behavior, which is using the substance regularly or occasionally for the desirable effects. Physically, continuous use of the substance leads to dependence on the drug by the body. This dependence means that when the drug is discontinued, symptoms of withdrawal or distress occur.""'Nicotine is the component of cigarettes that addicts. Almost immediately upon ''inhalation'', the body responds to the nicotine. An individual feels relaxed, calmer, and happier than before the inhalation. These pleasant feelings reflect the physical side of addiction, but then, not smoking cigarettes causes a craving for more cigarettes, irritability, impatience, ''anxiety'', and other unpleasant symptoms. Indeed, these symptoms are the symptoms of withdrawal from cigarettes. Moreover, with time, more and more nicotine is desired to produce the favorable effects and to avoid the symptoms of withdrawal.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of cigarette addiction?,"'The signs of addiction to cigarettes include:''Quitting smoking makes a difference right away in the way you feel. You can taste and smell food better. Your breath smells better. Your ''cough'' goes away. These benefits happen for men and women of all ages, even those who are older. They happen for healthy people as well as those who already have a disease or condition caused by smoking.''Even more importantly, in the long run, quitting smoking cuts the risk of lung cancer, many other cancers (including laryngeal, oral ''cavity'', stomach, esophageal, cervical, kidney, bladder, and colon cancers), ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and other lung or breathing (respiratory) diseases (for example, chronic ''bronchitis'', ''pneumonia'', and ''emphysema''). Smoking also increases the risk of ''peripheral vascular disease'' and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Moreover, ex-smokers have better health than current smokers. For example, ex-smokers have fewer days of illness, fewer health complaints, and less frequent bouts with chronic ''bronchitis'' and ''pneumonia'' than current smokers. People who quit smoking can actually reduce their risk of developing lung cancer or other smoking-related diseases.''Finally, quitting smoking saves money. The average cost of a pack of cigarettes is approximately $6.28 a pack (depending on where you live). A smoker with a pack a day habit spends approximately $44.00 per week ($2,288 per year).'

What are the steps in quitting?,"'First, one can do certain things to get ready to quit. Then, there are other things to do on the day of quitting. Finally, one can do things to help oneself to remain abstinent. (This is the hardest part.) ' "
Getting ready to quit smoking," Set a date for quitting. If possible, plan to have a 
  friend quit smoking with you. 
 It's best to pick a day within the next month. A date too far off in the future 
 will give you a chance to procrastinate and postpone, while a date too soon may 
 not allow you to make a plan for medications or support systems. Notice when and why you smoke. Try to find the things 
  in your daily life that you often do while smoking (such as drinking your 
  morning cup of coffee or driving a car). 
  Change your smoking routines: Keep your cigarettes in 
  a different place. Smoke with your other hand. Don't do anything else when you 
  are smoking. Think about how you feel when you smoke. 
  Smoke only in certain places, such as outdoors. 
 When you want a cigarette, wait a few minutes. Try to 
  think of something to do instead of smoking. For example, you might chew gum 
  or drink a glass of water. 
  Buy one pack of cigarettes at a time. Switch to a 
brand of cigarettes that you don't like. "
On the day you quit smoking,"   Get rid of all your cigarettes. Put away your 
  ashtrays.  Change your morning routine. When you eat breakfast, 
  don't sit in the same place at the kitchen table. Stay busy. 
  When you get the urge to smoke, do something else 
  instead. 
  Carry other things to put in your mouth, such as gum, 
  hard candy, or a toothpick. 
  Reward yourself at the end of the day for not 
smoking. See a movie or go out and enjoy your favorite meal.  Tell your friends and family members about your decision to quit 
	smoking, and ask for their support."
Staying quit,"   The expected consequences of quitting are 
  irritability, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite, and of course, 
  urges to smoke. So, if you feel more short-tempered or distracted or sleepier 
  than usual, don't worry because these feelings will pass. 
  Try to exercise. For example,
	go for a walk,
	ride a 
  bike, if you have access to a pool
 swim, take a
	yoga or
	Pilates class. 
  Consider the positive things about quitting. For 
  example, think about how much you like yourself as a non-smoker, the health 
  benefits for you and your family, and the example you set for others around 
  you. A positive attitude will help you through the tough times. 
  When you feel tense, try to keep busy and think about 
  ways to ease the tenseness. Tell yourself that smoking won't make it any 
  better, and go do something else. 
  Eat regular meals because feeling hungry is sometimes 
  mistaken for the desire to smoke. 
  Start putting the money you save by not 
  buying cigarettes in a ""money jar."" 
  Let others know that you have quit smoking. You will 
  find that most people will support you. Many of your smoking friends may want 
  to know how you quit. It's good to talk to others about your quitting. In 
  fact, people who stay off smoking for at least one year often have had very 
  strong support from a companion or co-worker. 
  If you slip-up and smoke, don't be discouraged or give up and return to 
 your smoking habit. Many 
  former smokers have tried to quit several times before they finally 
succeed. "
What methods can help a person quit smoking?,"'Several methods are available to assist those who decide to quit smoking. The main categories of methods are:''Each method actually offers several different options. Moreover, combinations of the methods usually are necessary, and no one combination will work for everyone. In fact, it may be necessary to try several different methods or combinations of methods before success is achieved. ''Due to the addictive nature of nicotine, some form of behavioral modification is often necessary for successful cessation of smoking. Educational programs, hypnosis, and aversion therapy (learning how to avoid cigarettes) are a few options. Smokers may be counseled to avoid specific triggers or situations that lead to smoking. For example, instead of awakening and grabbing a cigarette at the bedside or smoking immediately after a meal, people may be encouraged to replace the urge to smoke with another activity, such as, taking a walk or reading a book.

Nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking,"""Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) became available over the counter in the 1990's. The purpose of nicotine replacement therapy is to substitute another source of nicotine while cigarettes are discontinued. By this means, the habit of smoking is eliminated, even though the addiction to nicotine remains intact. But at the same time, nicotine replacement therapy eliminates the symptoms of withdrawal that can trigger more smoking. In addition, behavioral counseling to change smoking-related behavior usually is necessary. Once cigarettes have been replaced during nicotine replacement therapy, the amount of nicotine is then gradually reduced. ""'Currently, there are different forms of nicotine replacement therapy available ''over-the-counter'' and include: ' nicotine transdermal systems or patches (Nicoderm CQ and Nicotrol), 
	 nicotine 
polacrilex resin or gum (Nicorette), and  nicotine lozenges (Commit). "
Nicotine patches,"'The ''nicotine patch'' (Nicoderm CQ and Nicotrol) contains nicotine that is stored within a specially designed support or matrix. Once applied, the nicotine transdermal system steadily releases nicotine that is absorbed across the skin and into the blood stream. The gum contains nicotine that is released slowly upon chewing and ""parking"". Parking refers to the action of shifting the gum to one side of the cheek after chewing in order to speed the absorption of nicotine. Nicotine lozenges contain nicotine within a hard candy that allows for slow release of nicotine as the candy dissolves in the mouth. A program for slowly weaning users from nicotine replacement products is provided by each product\'s manufacturer. ''The nicotine patch, Nicoderm CQ, is available in three strengths; 21, 14, and 7 mg. People are advised to begin with the 21 mg patch if they smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day or the 14 mg patch if they smoke less than 10 cigarettes per day. After six weeks of wearing the initial patch strength, the next lowest patch strength is worn for two weeks. If therapy was started with the 21 mg patch, an additional two weeks is required for the 7mg patch. A maximum of eight or 10 weeks, depending upon the strength of the first patch used, is recommended for a successful quitting program. The Nicoderm CQ patch can be worn for 16 hours (from awakening until bedtime) or 24 hours if the urge to smoke is great upon awakening. ''Nicotrol is available as a 15 mg patch, and should be worn no more than 16 hours per day. Nicotrol may be worn for up to six weeks.

Nicorette gum,"'The gum, Nicorette, is available in a variety of flavors in 2 strengths; 4 and 2 mg. Patients are advised to begin with the 4 mg piece of gum if they smoke more than 25 cigarettes per day or the 2 mg piece if they smoke fewer than 7 cigarettes per day. No more than 20 pieces of the 4 mg strength or 30 pieces of the 2 mg strength should be chewed in one day. Initial weaning from treatment should begin after 2 to 3 months and be completed by 4 to 6 months.

Nicotine lozenges,"""Commit nicotine lozenges are available in 2 or 4 mg doses. One dose consists of one lozenge, and no more than 20 doses should be consumed in one day. The manufacturers of Commit recommend choosing the proper dosage based upon when you usually have the first cigarette of your day. According to the manufacturer's instructions, if you smoke within 30 minutes of getting up in the morning, you should use the stronger 4 mg dose. If not, you should use the 2 mg lozenges. ""'Biting or chewing nicotine lozenges instead of allowing them to dissolve can lead to ''indigestion'' or  ''heartburn''. You should not eat or drink anything while the lozenge is in your mouth. The lozenges will last for about 20-30 minutes when allowed to dissolve in the mouth. The most ''commonly reported side effects with nicotine lozenges'' are:''How effective is nicotine replacement therapy?'' ''Approximately 25% of patients successfully stop smoking with nicotine patch therapy. The success rate with nicotine gum is similar. There have not yet been studies to compare the effectiveness of nicotine lozenges to the patch or gum. The rate of success for nicotine replacement therapy increases 35% to 40% when intensive behavioral counseling is added. ' indigestion,  throat

"What 
prescription products are available for smoking cessation?","'There are products for cessation of smoking that are available by prescription only. Nicotine for nicotine replacement therapy is available by prescription as an inhaler or nasal spray (Nicotrol Inhaler and ''Nicotrol NS'').These other forms of delivery of nicotine seem to work as well as the nicotine patches or gum. Prescription nicotine replacement products are more expensive than''over-the-counter products''.''Varenicline (Chantix) is a prescription drug approved by the U.S. FDA to help adults quit smoking. Chantix does not contain nicotine, but is believed to act on the same receptors (the sites where nicotine acts to produce its effects) in the brain as nicotine, resulting in activation (stimulation) of these receptors and blocking the ability of nicotine to attach to these receptors. Chantix should be taken seven days prior to the date an individual desires to quit smoking, and most people will keep taking Chantix for up to 12 weeks. ''Side effects of the Chantix may include:''Chantix is not appropriate for use by pregnant and breast-feeding women and people with certain chronic medical conditions.''Bupropion (Zyban) is a medication that is used primarily for treating ''depression''. This drug, however, also has been found to be effective in helping people to quit smoking, and has been approved by the U.S. FDA for use in smoking cessation in adults. ''Other agents that have been tried for cessation of smoking include serotonin reuptake antagonists (''drugs'' also used for ''depression'') and the anti-hypertensive drugs ''clonidine'' (''Catapres'') and calcium channel blockers. Although these agents appear to be less effective than nicotine replacement therapy, they may be effective for some people. '   nausea,  vomiting,  gas,  
constipation, and 
	 changes in dreaming. "
How can nicotine-containing products be used safely?,"'Users of nicotine-containing products should understand that all of these products have side effects as well as effects on other underlying medical conditions such as ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', ''asthma'', and heart disease. Furthermore, these products can have interactions with other prescribed medications such as ''pain'' relievers, blood thinners, and ''high blood pressure'' medications. And finally, they do have their limitations. The following guidelines are to help you safely use these products to achieve your goal of quitting smoking. ' Always read the labels and know the ingredients in 
  the products. Never take more than the recommended dose without checking with 
  your doctor first. 
  If you are pregnant or 
 nursing a baby, seek the 
  advice of a health professional before using any nicotine-containing product. 
  Do not use a nicotine-containing product if you 
  continue to smoke, chew tobacco, use snuff, or other nicotine-containing 
  products. 
  Consult a physician before using nicotine-containing products if you are under 18 years of age 
 and: Have heart disease, an irregular heartbeat, or have 
    had a recent heart attack (Nicotine can 
increase your heart rate.) 
  Have high blood pressure that is not controlled 
    with medication (Nicotine can increase your blood pressure.)

What are e-cigarettes?,"'e-Cigarettes are smokable, refillable containers or cartridges that contain fluid consisting of solvents, flavors, and varying amounts of nicotine. Inhaling from the devices is known as ""vaping.""  Negative pressure on the cartridge created by inhaling triggers a battery-powered heating and vaporization of the solution. The composition of the fluid in e-cigarettes varies depending upon the manufacturer.' "
Is an e-cigarette harmful?,"'There is little scientific information that determines how safe or unsafe e-cigarettes may be. Nicotine in any form is known to be addictive, and nicotine addiction can develop from using e-cigarettes. Nicotine has been shown to cause adverse health effects including:''More serious effects can occur with high doses of nicotine, such as:''The US Food and Drug Administration has reported that cancer-causing nitrosamines have been detected in some e-cigarettes. Further, poison centers have reported numerous cases of poisonings of small children from consuming the liquid in the cartridges of e-cigarettes.' 
	nausea, 
	 
	vomiting, 
	 
abdominal pain, and 
	 eye irritation.  increased heart rate,  
high blood pressure, 
	 seizures,  
coma, and 
	 even death. "
Is secondhand smoke from e-cigarettes harmful?,"'e-Cigarettes expel vapors that contain nicotine, which is known to be addictive. Depending on the composition of the fluid in the cartridge, nitrosamines or other dangerous chemicals may also be expelled. It is not known at this time how significant the risk is to the health of those who breathe secondhand vapors from e-cigarettes.''Little is known about the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes, but nicotine has been shown to be harmful to the developing fetus. Nicotine narrows blood vessels and interferes with circulation of blood to the fetus. It can interfere with development of the fetal brain and may harm fetal lung function. It also increases the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Doctors recommend that pregnant women abstain from both smoking and e-cigarette use. ' "
What is the latest research on smoking?,"'Health care workers have become extremely active in publicizing the negative effects of smoking. In fact, health care workers have been instrumental in passing various legislation to limit smoking in public. As a result, the proportion of people in the US who smoke has dropped from 40.4% in 1965 to around 17% in 2013 (data from the US Department of Health).''This reduction in the percent of people who smoke has been significantly less in women than in men. From 1965 to 2010, smoking among men dropped from 50.2% to 20.5% while during the same period, smoking among women dropped from 31.9% to 15.3%. So, in the future, efforts need to be made to understand and eliminate this difference between the genders.'""One interesting area of the current research on smoking is the study of the population distribution of the genes for smoking (genetic epidemiology). (Genes determine an individual's ""'inherited'' characteristics.) Only a small fraction of individuals who start smoking as an adolescent will actually become nicotine dependent. So, what determines which individuals will become nicotine-dependent? Investigators have found that smoking initiation (the obligatory first step) and the development of nicotine dependence are both influenced by genetic factors. The genetic factors appear to play a larger role in nicotine dependence than in smoking initiation. The next step will be to identify these genes and learn how they work in order to facilitate the development of effective ''prevention'' and treatment strategies for tobacco addiction.''Teen smoking rates remain of concern. In 2011 19% of high school girls and 28% of boys had used some form of tobacco in the prior month.. According to the American Cancer Society, the majority of cigarette use- in almost 90% of people who smoke- begins before a person reaches 18 years of age. Very few people start smoking after age 25. Statistics show that 99% of adult smokers had started by age 26. Education of the at-risk teen population is therefore critical for prevention of tobacco use. Various celebrities and activist groups actively promote campaigns aimed at a teen audience that educate about the consequences of smoking and offer advice on smoking cessation and prevention. While teen smoking rates increased during the 1990s (36% of ''teens'' smoked in 1997), prevention and education campaigns have brought about a decrease in teen smoking in recent years.' "
How does smoking affect a pregnant woman and her baby?,"'Tobacco ''smoking'' affects both mother and baby and poses health risks to both. Smoking during pregnancy puts the baby at risk for health problems during the pregnancy and after the baby is born. Nicotine and all the harmful (and  ''cancer'""-causing) products inhaled from the tobacco enter the bloodstream of the mother and are passed directly into the baby's circulation through the placenta. Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 harmful chemicals, over 70 of which are known to be carcinogenic (""'cancer'' causing). ''Some of the known health effects on the baby include: ''These risks to the baby increase with the number of cigarettes smoked during pregnancy. Of course, tobacco smoking is also harmful to the mother, increasing her risk of cancers, ''cardiovascular disease'', ''emphysema'', and other conditions.'  A decreased supply of oxygen available to the baby  Increased risk of 
miscarriage and stillbirth  Increased risk of poor growth and low birth weight 
 Increased risk of premature delivery  Increase in the heart rate of the baby 
 Increased risk of breathing problems in the baby "
Is any amount of smoking safe in pregnancy?,"'While the health risks increase with an increased amount of smoking, there is no known safe limit for tobacco smoking in pregnancy. All smoking can have serious health consequences for the baby. ' "
What are the risks of secondhand smoke in pregnancy?,"'Secondhand smoke is breathing tobacco smoke from being near a smoker. It also increases the risk of ''cardiovascular'' disease and cancers. The risks of smoking during pregnancy apply to pregnant women who breathe secondhand smoke as well.''For babies exposed to secondhand smoke, there is an increase in risk for developing ''asthma'' attacks, breathing problems, ear infections, impaired lung development, and ''coughing''. Children exposed to secondhand smoke require more ear tube surgeries than those who are not exposed. One study showed that exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with lower IQs in children. Sudden infant death syndrome is more common in babies born to women who smoked during pregnancy as well as in babies exposed to secondhand smoke. ' "
Can nicotine replacement products be used during pregnancy to quit smoking?,"'Nicotine replacement products result in a buildup of nicotine in the bloodstream in those who use them, decreasing the cravings and withdrawal symptoms for those trying to quit. However, the nicotine in the bloodstream directly enters the fetal circulation from the mother, and these products and their potential risks to the baby have not been studied in pregnant women. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that these products be used in pregnancy only when non-drug methods such as counseling have failed, and when the increased chance of quitting smoking with these products outweighs the unknown risks of nicotine use during pregnancy.

"What is marijuana, and how is it abused?","'Marijuana is a plant whose scientific name is ''Cannabis sativa''. Its leaves, seeds, stems, and/or roots are consumed by marijuana users for the purpose of feeling intoxicated (""high""). Although the plant contains hundreds of compounds, the one that has major intoxicating effects is called tetrahydrocannibinol (THC). Although medical marijuana is legal in a few states of the United States, it is one of many illegal drugs in most jurisdictions. Specifically, laws in most states deem it illegal to engage in possession of marijuana, either for the purpose of your own use or for the purpose of distributing it to others. ''Marijuana is the most commonly abused illegal substance worldwide. While the number of people who use marijuana at any one time does not seem to have increased in the past decade, the number of people who have a marijuana-related disorder has increased significantly. This seems to be particularly true for elderly individuals as well as for young Hispanic and African-American adults. In ''teens'', boys remain more likely than girls to smoke or otherwise use marijuana. Native-American adolescents seem to be the ethnic group most vulnerable to engage in recent marijuana use, and Asian adolescents tend to be the least likely. '  "
What is medical marijuana? How is medical marijuana prescribed?,"'Medical marijuana, also called marinol (Dronabinol), is a synthetic form of marijuana. It comes in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg capsules and is used for the treatment of poor appetite and food intake (''anorexia'') with ''weight loss'' in people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (''AIDS'') and for the ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' due to ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'' in individuals who have not responded adequately to usual treatments for those symptoms. When used for appetite stimulation, marinol is usually dosed at 2.5 mg once or twice per day before lunch, dinner, and/or bedtime. When it is being prescribed to quell nausea, it is usually prescribed at 5 mg, one to three hours before a chemotherapy treatment and every two to four hours after chemotherapy, up to six doses per day.''The most common physical side effects of marinol include asthenia (''lack of energy''), stomach upset, nausea, ''vomiting'', racing ''heart'' rate, facial flushing, and ''dizziness''.''The most common psychological side effects of marinol include ''anxiety'', sleepiness, ''confusion'', ''hallucinations'', and ''paranoia''.''This medication should, therefore, be used with caution in persons who have a ''mental health'' diagnosis, particularly ''depression'', ''mood swings'', ''schizophrenia'', or ''substance abuse''. When prescribed for those people, the individual is usually under the care of a psychiatrist.' "
What are other names for marijuana?,"'There are many, many ways of referring to marijuana. The technical term for marijuana is cannabis. Some terms like pot, hemp, herb, reefer, ganja, and weed refer to the substance itself. A higher potency form of marijuana is often called hashish or hash. Other words like joints, blunts, backwoods, buds, or bongs refer to the way that marijuana is smoked. Marijuana is also often smoked in pipes or baked in food, like brownies. ' "
What is the history and different types of marijuana?,"'The history of marijuana goes back for thousands of years. It was only made illegal in many countries during the 20th century. In the past 20 years in the United States, the legalization pros and cons of medical marijuana have been intensely debated as it has become legal to use it in 20 states and the District of Columbia. In those jurisdictions, people for whom medical marijuana has been specifically recommended by a physician must carry a (medical) marijuana card that indicates their use of the substance for a clear medical purpose. Individuals who do not carry such a card risk prosecution for marijuana possession. Different states that allow for legal use of marijuana have different guidelines for the legality of possessing and using medical marijuana. For example, at least one bans home cultivation, and there are regulations concerning the operations of dispensaries in some states. ''Federal laws continue to deem marijuana possession, as well as its distribution, as illegal, whether it is used for medicinal purposes or not. While the prosecution rates of individuals who carry small amounts of the substance along with a medical marijuana card tend to be low, dispensaries in states that have legalized medical marijuana remain criminalized and are therefore often raided by law-enforcement agencies. ''Attempts to completely legalize the use of marijuana, whether for medicinal purposes or not, remain strongly contested in most jurisdictions. For example, in 2010, Proposition 19, a measure that would have completely legalized possession and growing marijuana then taxed and regulated its use was defeated in the state of California. However, California already reduced legal sanctions for possessing small amounts of marijuana to the level comparable to the penalty for speeding on a freeway. '""There are a variety of marijuana types, also called strains. Strains tend to be based on leaf color as indicated in pictures, as well as the strains' potency and medical purpose. Medical strains of marijuana are specifically grown for a particular health benefit, like ""'pain management'' or reduction of nausea. Some states place restrictions on the strains of marijuana that may be legally used and sold. Marijuana dispensaries often sell hydroponic marijuana seeds through mail order, which can be grown in nutrient solution, with or without soil. ' "
Is marijuana addictive?,"'Numerous research studies show that marijuana is indeed an addictive substance. The rate of addiction to marijuana has increased for all age groups. Teens are using the drug at younger ages. About one out of every six adolescents who use marijuana develop addiction to it, and half the people who receive treatment for marijuana use are under the age of 25. While the frequency of use seems to have remained the same over the past several years, adults are becoming dependent on marijuana more often. Theories about potential reasons for that increase include increased access to marijuana that is of higher potency, as well as a lower age at which many individuals first use this drug. ''The symptoms of addiction to marijuana are similar to those of any other addictive substance. As with any other drug, in order to qualify for the diagnosis of marijuana addiction, the individual must suffer from a negative pattern of use of this drug, which results in significant problems or suffering, with at least three of the following symptoms occurring at the same time in the same one year period: ''The symptoms of marijuana withdrawal are similar to those of other drugs, especially tobacco. Those symptoms usually start one to two days after last using marijuana and include irritability, anger, ''depression'', ''insomnia'"", drug craving, and decreased appetite. These symptoms tend to interfere with the individual's attempts to stop using marijuana and can motivate the use of both marijuana and other drugs for relief. The symptoms of withdrawal tend to peak within four to six days and last from one to three weeks. "" Tolerance (decreased effects of marijuana over time or needing to increase the amount used to achieve the desired effect)  Withdrawal (characteristic symptoms that occur when the individual abstains from using marijuana for some days)  Often taking marijuana in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than planned Persistent desire to use marijuana or trouble decreasing or controlling its use Spending significant time either obtaining marijuana (for example, buying, growing), using it, or recovering from its effects Significant social, educational, occupational, or leisure activities are either abandoned or significantly decreased as a result of marijuana's use Marijuana use continues despite being aware of or experiencing persistent or repeated physical or psychological problems as a result of its use "
What are abusing marijuana effects on brain?,"'The bad effects of marijuana are numerous. For example, it can impair thinking, as in learning, and memory for several days after each time it is used. That risk seems to be even higher for people who score lower on IQ tests compared to those who score higher.''The social effects of ''smoking'' marijuana can be quite detrimental as well. Adolescents who use the substance are at higher risk of ''pregnancy'', dropping out of school, delinquency, legal problems, and achieving less educationally and occupationally. Individuals who become dependent on marijuana tend to be less motivated, less happy, or satisfied with their life. They are also at risk for ''depression'' and for using larger amounts of ''alcohol'' and other drugs.' "
What are abusing marijuana effects on body?,"'In terms of how long marijuana tends to stay in your system, it can be detected on drug tests for about two weeks. Like many other chemicals that are ingested, marijuana can affect your body in many ways. It seems to be associated with an increased occurrence of certain ''cancers''. It may also increase the risk of sexual dysfunction; statistics indicate that men who smoke or otherwise consume marijuana regularly are at higher risk of either having ''premature ejaculation'' or trouble reaching ''orgasm''. Men and women who use this substance on a regular basis seem to have more sexual partners and to be more at risk for contracting ''sexually transmitted diseases'' compared to those who do not use marijuana.'""Marijuana's effects on the body and brain of a developing fetus seem to be clearly negative. Exposure to this substance before birth (prenatally) is associated with negative effects on fetal growth and body weight, as well as on the impulse control, focusing ability, learning, memory, and decision making in the child who was exposed to marijuana before birth. These negative effects by no means only affect ""'babies'' who are exposed to marijuana before birth (in utero). Marijuana tends to negatively affect learning, judgment, and muscle skills in people who use marijuana by their own volition.' "
What are the treatments for marijuana abuse and addiction?,"'Most individuals with marijuana abuse or dependence are treated on an outpatient basis. Admission to outpatient and inpatient treatment programs for marijuana addiction has increased over the years to the point that the addiction to this substance is nearly as high as dependence on other illegal drugs, like ''cocaine'' or ''heroin''.''Behavioral treatments, like motivational enhancement therapy (MET), cognitive-behavioral therapy (''CBT''), and contingency management (CM), as well as family-based treatments have been found to be effective treatments for marijuana abuse and addiction.''In addition to the individual therapies just described, adolescents who abuse or are addicted to marijuana are often treated using one or more family therapies. These include multidimensional therapy, multisystemic therapy, family support network intervention, and brief strategic family therapy. Each of these interventions uses techniques that are designed to enhance the skills of the addicted individual and his or her family members as a way of discouraging marijuana use.''Although there is no medication that has yet been shown to be a clearly effective treatment of marijuana-use disorders, research shows that ''antidepressant'' medications like ''nefazodone'' (''Serzone'') and ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac'') may help some individuals manage marijuana withdrawal and to avoid relapse, respectively. Oral THC (Dronabinol) may also help alleviate symptoms of marijuana withdrawal. Successful psychotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of marijuana abuse or addiction include motivational approaches to coping skills development.' MET is designed to lessen the resistance a person who abuses marijuana may have to abstain from using it. This intervention is also designed to motivate the individual to change. CBT teaches people who abuse marijuana skills to help them stop using the drug and to ways to avoid or manage other problems that might prevent them from marijuana use recovery. CM usually provides marijuana users with vouchers of increasing value as a reward for repeatedly testing negative for (the absence of) drugs over time. Those vouchers are then exchanged for positive items or services that promote the person's participation in more positive (pro-social) activities, like securing employment or advancing their education or health."
Can marijuana abuse and addiction be prevented?,"'In order to prevent marijuana use, abuse, and addiction, an understanding of the risk factors for those issues is essential. In teens, availability of marijuana in their environment, as well as a tendency to engage in negative behaviors (deviancy) increase the likelihood of marijuana use. For some adolescents, using legal substances like alcohol and tobacco can be gateway drugs for marijuana use, in that the use of those substances increases the likelihood that the teen will use marijuana. ' "
What is the prognosis of marijuana abuse and addiction?,"'While many people with a marijuana-use disorder successfully stop using it with outpatient ''psychotherapy'' that provides motivation and teaches coping skills, the relapse rate is quite high. However, when treatment is provided frequently, that statistic improves. Individuals who begin ''smoking'' marijuana before 17 years of age seem to be more than three times more likely to attempt ''suicide'' than those who either never use the substance or do so after the age of 17. That risk goes the other way as well, in that people who develop depression or have thoughts of ''suicide'' before the age of 17 seem to be at a much higher risk of developing an addiction to marijuana. People who are vulnerable to developing psychosis (for example, having hallucinations like seeing things or ''hearing'"" voices that aren't there; or ""'delusions'', like unfounded beliefs that others are trying to harm him or her) may be more likely to do so if marijuana is used, even on a medicinal basis. Marijuana abuse or addiction is also associated with a much higher risk of developing a dependence on other drugs.' "

What is a venomous (poisonous) snakebite?,"'A venomous (poisonous) snake bite is a bite or a puncture ''wound'' made by a snake that is capable of injecting, secreting, or spitting venom into the penetrated skin wound, ''mucus'' membranes or the eyes where the toxin can be absorbed. Worldwide, there are about 20,000 to 100,000 snakebite deaths per year. In North America, there are about 25 species of snakes able to secrete venom. However, non-native poisonous species are present in zoos and held in private homes or other areas by snake collectors. Consequently, almost any type of venomous snake bite can be encountered in the US. About 7,000 snake bites are reported in the US per year, but because snake bites are not required to be reported, it is estimated that up to 45,000 bites per year may occur with about 8,000 by poisonous snakes. About five deaths per year are reported due to snakebites. The most common venomous snakes in the US are:''The first three are pit vipers (have a pit used to detect temperature changes and two movable fangs), and the coral snake is an elapid with short fixed fangs and no pit. Brown snakes are also elapid and are very poisonous.'   Rattlesnakes Copperheads Cottonmouths/water moccasins Coral snakes"
What is a nonvenomous (nonpoisonous) snakebite?, A nonvenomous (nonpoisonous) snake bite is a bite or puncture wound made by a snake that is incapable of secreting venom. This should be distinguished from a dry bite. A dry bite is a bite by a venomous snake that does not inject any venom. Even bites that are from a nonvenomous snake or are dry need to be evaluated as they can lead to significant tissue damage or infections.
What are the 	symptoms of a venomous snakebite?,"'The symptoms of a venomous snakebite depend on the type of toxin(s) secreted into the bite or puncture wound, and in part, on how much toxin is present in the tissue. The types of symptoms produced can be grouped into four groups:''Some toxins may cause more than one of these effects. Because of the various symptoms that can occur with venomous snakebites, the potential signs and symptoms to look for, as listed by the CDC include the following:''Symptoms from these toxins are somewhat variable and may occur quickly within minutes or they may be delayed for hours, depending on the toxin type and the amount absorbed. In general, small children are more vulnerable to snake bites because the relative larger amount of toxin absorbed in relation to their smaller body size can make the toxin effect more potent. Individuals with medical conditions like ''heart disease'' or other chronic diseases are also at higher risk of complications due to snakebite. The quick action of many toxins usually does not allow the immune system a chance to counter the toxin’s effects.''Identification of the snake helps emergency health care professionals to both anticipate the potential symptoms, and it allows for more rapid and appropriate treatment of the venomous snake bite. A detailed description and a picture of the snake will help identify the type of snake and the type of toxin. Do not waste time, however, in transporting the patient to an appropriate medical facility and do not put others in jeopardy of getting bitten.''The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed snakebite to its list of neglected tropical diseases. Sub-Saharan Africa has a lack of antivenom supplies; minute-to-minute delays in treatment can affect outcomes; for example in April 2019, a woman died on her wedding day a few hours after a snakebite in Nigeria.'   Cardiotoxins act on heart tissue. Neurotoxins act on nervous system tissue. Cytotoxins act on tissue at the site of the bite or on tissue that directly absorbs the venom. Hemotoxins act on the blood coagulation system and may cause internal bleeding. A pair of puncture marks at the wound Redness and swelling around the bite Severe pain at the site of the bite Nausea and vomiting Labored breathing (in extreme cases, breathing may stop altogether) Disturbed vision Increased salivation and sweating Numbness or tingling around the face and/or limbs"
How is a venomous snakebite diagnosed?,"'Any snakebite needs ''emergency medicine'' and evaluation. Identification of fang or bite marks is done, even if the snake is nonvenomous, to determine local ''trauma'' or tissue damage at the site of the bite. Identification of the snake type by description or picture, along with the circumstances of the bite and the surrounding environment usually provides the health care professional a working diagnosis. For example, a snakebite occurring in dry west Texas is likely a ''rattlesnake bite'', while a snakebite in a swampy area of the U.S. is likely a water moccasin, and Tiger snakes (body has bands of colors) are found mainly in Australia and its costal islands. A zookeeper or private snake owner/collector who is bitten will likely know the exact type of snake that caused the bite or toxic spray (spitting cobras).' "
What is the 	treatment for a venomous snakebite?,"'After a snake bites, there are two phases of treatment.''Many past home remedies, snakebite kits and other ''first aid'' treatment methods have been shown to make the effects of the snakebite worse. Consequently, the CDC has issued guidelines to use after the threat of additional bites to the patient or others is eliminated, about what to ''DO'' and what ''NOT TO DO'' if a snakebite occurs. The following are CDC recommendations:''Do ''NOT'' do any of the following:''Not included in the CDC recommendation is the bite of the Australian elapid snake, also termed a sea snake, which ''is'' emergently treated with a pressure bandage at the bite site with splinting and extremity immobilization. Others suggest no use of electric shocks for any snakebite.''The second phase of treatment consists of stabilization and supportive care, and when medically indicated, administration of antitoxin (antivenin) specific for the snake species and a ''tetanus'' booster ''vaccine''. A good practice is to call your local ''poison control'' center or the national Poison Help Line (1-800-222-1222), and also to consult a toxicologist and a surgeon to help care for the patient. Certain patients may require surgical treatment and admission to the hospital, as some snakebites can be life-threatening.''The treatment of non-venomous snake bites includes local ''wound care'' at the site of the bite, removing snake ''teeth'' if left in the bite site, attending to any trauma at the bite site, and a ''tetanus'' booster if needed. Some wounds may become infected and require additional treatment with antibiotics.'  The emergency treatment is provided on-site and during transport to an appropriate health care facility. The health care facility stabilizes the patient, administers antivenin if deemed necessary, and provides supportive treatment. Seek medical attention as soon as possible (dial 911 or call local Emergency Medical Services) Try to remember the color and shape of the snake, which can help with identification and treatment of snake venom in the snakebite. Keep still and calm. This can slow down the spread of venom. Inform your supervisor (if the bite occurs at work). Apply first aid if you cannot get to the hospital right away.Lay or sit down with the bite below the level of the heart.Wash the bite with soap and water.Cover the bite with a clean, dry dressing. Lay or sit down with the bite below the level of the heart. Wash the bite with soap and water. Cover the bite with a clean, dry dressing. Do not pick up the snake or try to trap it. Do not wait for symptoms to appear if bitten, rather seek immediate medical attention. Do not apply a tourniquet. Do not slash the wound with a knife. Do not suck out the venom. Do not apply ice or immerse the wound in water. Do not drink alcohol as a painkiller. Do not drink caffeinated beverages."
What are the complications of a venomous snakebite?,"'The complications of venomous snake bites can range from mild to severe and may mimic other human diseases like hemorrhagic ''fever'', ''ALS'' (''Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis'') and autoimmune disease, for example. Complications include ''pain'' and swelling at the bite site, ''allergic reaction'', vision damage (from toxin sprays especially), ''compartment syndrome'' (localized severe swelling that can damage or destroy nerves and blood vessels, leading to muscle necrosis), infection (including methicillin-resistant bacteria), limb loss, ''gangrene'', ''sepsis'', internal bleeding, cardiac damage, respiratory compromise, possible long-term psychological effects or mental disorders, and even death.'  "
Can a snakebite be prevented?,"'Many snake bites can be prevented as most snakes are not aggressive toward humans unless they sense danger. Consequently, avoidance of snakes usually prevents a bite, so people should not try to handle, capture or threaten (for example, tease with a stick) any snake. Statistical studies suggest that about 40% of all snake bites in the US occur in people that consumed alcoholic ''drinks'"". If a person's workplace involves areas known to be a habitat of snakes, wearing protective boots, thick pants, and gloves may reduce the chances of a snake bite; or at least it may reduce the bite trauma and the amount of venom distributed."" "
What is the prognosis for a venomous snakebite?,"'Most snakebites, when quickly and appropriately treated, have a good prognosis. If left untreated for various increasing lengths of time after the snake bites, the prognosis usually diminishes while the complications increase. Deaths are unlikely, as fewer than 10 deaths per year are due to snakebites in the U.S.' "
What is snoring?,"'Snoring, like all other sounds, is caused by vibrations that cause particles in the air to form sound waves. For example, when we speak, our vocal cords vibrate to form our voice. When our stomach growls (borborygmus), our stomach and ''intestines'' vibrate as air and food move through them.''While we are asleep, turbulent airflow can cause the tissues of the palate (roof of the mouth) and throat to vibrate, giving rise to snoring. Essentially, snoring is a sound resulting from turbulent airflow that causes tissues to vibrate during ''sleep''.''Any person can snore. Frequently, people who do not regularly snore will report snoring after a viral illness, after drinking alcohol, or when taking some medications.''People who snore can have any body type. We frequently think of a large man with a thick neck as a snorer. However, a thin woman with a small neck can snore just as loudly. In general, as people get older and as they gain weight, snoring will worsen.'  "
What causes snoring?,"'While we are ''breathing'', air flows in and out in a steady stream between our nose or mouth and our ''lungs''. There are relatively few sounds when we are sitting and breathing quietly. When we ''exercise'', the air moves more quickly and produces some sounds as we breathe. This happens because air is moving in and out of the nose and mouth more quickly and this results in more turbulence to the airflow and some vibration of the tissues in the nose and mouth.''When we are asleep, the area at the back of the throat sometimes narrows as the muscles relax, and even close off temporarily. The same amount of air passing through this smaller opening more rapidly can cause the tissues surrounding the opening to vibrate, which in turn can cause the sounds of snoring. Different people who snore have different reasons for the narrowing. The narrowing can be in the nose, mouth, or throat. Palatal snoring is often worse when an individual breathes through his or her mouth or has nasal obstruction.'  "
Why do people snore?,"'For breathing at rest, it is ideal to breathe through the nose. The nose acts as a humidifier, heater, and filter for the incoming air. When we breathe through our mouth, these modifications to the air entering our lungs occur to a lesser extent. Our lungs are still able to use the colder, drier, dirtier air; but you may have noticed that breathing really ''cold'', dry, or dirty air can be uncomfortable. Therefore, our bodies naturally want to breathe through the nose if possible.''The nose is made up of two parallel passages, one on each side, called the nasal ''cavities''. They are separated by a thin wall (the septum), which is a relatively flat wall of cartilage, bone, and lining tissue (called the nasal mucosa). On the lateral side (the wall of the nose closer to the cheeks) of each passage, there are three nasal turbinates, which are long, cylindrical-shaped structures that lie roughly parallel to the floor of the nose. The turbinates contain many small blood vessels that function to regulate airflow. If the blood vessels in the turbinates increase in size, the turbinate as a whole swell, and the flow of air decreases. If the vessels narrow, the turbinates become smaller, and airflow increases.''Almost everyone has a natural nasal cycle that generally will shift the side that is doing most of the breathing about every 2 to 6 hours. For example, if the right nasal turbinates are swollen, most of the air enters the left nasal passage. After about 6 hours, the right nasal turbinates will become smaller, and the left nasal turbinates will swell, shifting the majority of breathing to the right nasal passage. You may notice this cycle when you have a cold or if you have a chronically (long-standing) stuffy nose. The turbinates may also swell from ''allergic'' reactions or external stimuli, such as cold air or dirt.''As discussed above, we naturally want to breathe through our noses. Some people cannot breathe through their noses because of the obstruction of the nasal passages. This can be caused by a deviation of the nasal septum, ''allergies'', ''sinus infections'', swelling of the turbinates, or large ''adenoids'' (''tonsils'' in the back of the throat).''In adults, the most common causes of nasal obstruction are septal deviations from a broken nose or tissue swelling from ''allergies''.''In children, enlarged adenoids (''tonsils'' in the back of the throat) are often the cause of the obstruction.''People with nasal ''airway'' obstruction who must breathe through their mouths are therefore sometimes called ""mouth breathers."" Many mouth breathers snore, because the flow of air through the mouth causes greater vibration of tissues.''The soft palate is a muscular extension of the bony roof of the mouth (hard palate). It separates the back of the mouth (oropharynx) from the nasal passages (nasopharynx). It is shaped like a sheet attached at three sides and hanging freely in the back of the mouth.''The soft palate'' is important when breathing and swallowing.''The uvula'' is the small extension at the back of the soft palate. It assists with the function of the soft palate and also is used in some languages (Hebrew and Farsi) to produce the guttural fricative sounds (like in the Hebrew word ""L\'chaim""). English words do not use guttural fricative sounds.''The palate and attached uvula often are the structures that vibrate during snoring and surgical treatments for snoring may alter these structures and prevent guttural fricative sounds. Therefore, if you speak a language that uses guttural fricative sounds, a surgical treatment for snoring may not be recommended or appropriate for you.''After a night of heavy snoring, the soft palate and uvula may be swollen in the morning. Patients may experience an increased sensation of gagging in the morning until the swelling subsides.''The tonsils'' are designed to detect and fight infections. They are located at the back of the mouth on each side of the throat (oropharynx). They are also called the palatine tonsils. Like other infection-fighting tissue, the tonsils swell while they are fighting bacteria and ''viruses''. Often, the tonsils do not return to their normal size after the infection is gone. They can remain enlarged (hypertrophied) and can narrow the airway vibrate, and cause snoring.''The soft palate'', as described above, is the flap of tissue that hangs down in the back of the mouth. If it is too long or floppy, it can vibrate and cause snoring.''The uvula'' is suspended from the center and back of the soft palate. An abnormally long or thick uvula also can contribute to snoring.''The base of the tongue'' is the part of the tongue that is the farthest back in the mouth. The tongue is a large muscle that is important for directing food while chewing and swallowing. It also is important for shaping words while we are speaking. It is attached to the inner part of the jaw bone (mandible) in the front and to the hyoid bone underneath.''The tongue must be free to move in all directions to function properly. Therefore, it is not attached very tightly at the tip or top of the tongue. If the back of the tongue is large or if the tongue is able to slip backward, it can narrow the space through which air flows in the pharynx, which can lead to vibrations and snoring.''Sleep consists of several stages, but in general, they can be divided into REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM stages. Snoring can occur during all or only some stages of sleep. Snoring is most common in ''REM sleep'', because of the loss of muscle tone characteristic of this stage of sleep, and during deep sleep or non-REM Stage 3 sleep.''During REM sleep, the brain sends the signal to all the muscles of the body (except the breathing muscles) to relax. Unfortunately, the tongue, palate, and throat can collapse when they relax. This can cause the airway to narrow and worsen snoring.''When we are asleep, we are usually (though not always) lying down. Gravity acts to pull on all the tissues of the body, but the tissues of the pharynx are relatively soft and floppy. Therefore, when we lie on our backs, gravity pulls the palate, tonsils, and tongue backward. This often narrows the airway enough to cause turbulence in airflow, tissue vibration and snoring. Frequently, if the snorer is gently reminded (for example, with a gentle thrust of the elbow to the ribs or a tickle) to roll onto his or her side, the tissues are no longer pulled backward and the snoring lessens.' During nasal breathing, the palate moves forward and ""opens"" the nasal airway for air to pass into the lungs. During swallowing, the palate moves backward and ""closes"" the nasal passages, thereby directing the food and liquid down the esophagus instead of into the back of the nose."
How do medications and alcohol affect snoring?,"'The root cause of snoring is vibration of the tissues while breathing. Some medications as well as alcohol can lead to enhanced relaxation of muscles during sleep. As the muscles of the palate, tongue, neck, and pharynx relax more, the airway collapses more. This leads to a smaller airway and greater tissue vibration. Some medications encourage a deeper level of sleep, which also can worsen snoring.' "
Why is snoring a problem?,"'Snoring sometimes can be the only sign of a more serious problem. People who snore should be evaluated to be certain that other problems such as ''sleep apnea'', other ''sleeping problems'', or other sleep related breathing problems are not present.'""If the snorer sleeps and breathes normally, then snoring is only a problem for the snorer's bed partner or family members. In fact, snoring often disrupts the sleep of family members and partners more than it affects the snorer. Frequently, partners of snorers report leaving the bedroom (or making the snorer leave the bedroom) many nights per week. Snoring may not be a medical problem, but it can become a significant social problem for the snorer and sleep problem for the bed partner.""  "
What diseases or conditions can cause snoring?,"'It is important to determine if snoring is related to an underlying medical condition or is an isolated (primary) problem (not associated with any underlying disease).''More specifically, primary snoring is not associated with obstructive ''sleep apnea'', upper airway resistance, ''insomnia'', or other ''sleep disorders''. This distinction is important because of the associated link between the underlying conditions and other adverse health effects.''For example, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with higher risks of ''cardiovascular disease'' such as ''heart attacks'' and ''strokes''. This association is thought to exist because of higher prevalence of ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'') in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea. On the other hand, studies have shown that people with primary snoring did not have higher rates of elevated ''blood pressure'' compared to the general public. Despite this, there is increasing evidence of a relationship between snoring and other significant health problems. However, the exact cause of this relationship remains unclear.' "
What are different levels of snoring?,"'Mild resistance to airflow for any of the above reasons in the upper airways may result in some snoring that is not associated with any sleep disturbance.' If resistance to airflow increases, the efforts to maintain adequate ventilation and breathing may cause transient arousal from sleep that is typically not severe enough to cause the level of oxygen in the blood to decrease (hypoxia). This is called the respiratory effort related arousal (RERA). When the resistance increases even further, the ventilatory efforts cannot keep up with the degree of resistance to maintain adequate levels of oxygen, and airflow decreases or stops. This often leads to a decrease in the level of oxygen in the blood. As a result, sleep becomes more fragmented and arousal more frequent. The events are referred to as obstructive hypopneas (reduced breathing) or apneas (absent breathing), and the condition is termed obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome."
How should someone with snoring be evaluated?,"""To thoroughly evaluate someone with a snoring problem, it is important to also talk to that person's bed partner or family members. A complete history and physical examination is often performed.""'In addition, more detail about the snoring and ''sleep problems'' needs to be obtained. The patients may be asked about their sleep pattern and sleep hygiene, daytime symptoms of sleepiness, daytime napping, and frequency of awakening at night.'""A thorough physical examination may also be performed including assessing the patient's body weight and body mass index (""'BMI''), assessment of the neck circumference (area around the neck), and visualization of the throat, nasal, and oral ''cavities'' to determine how narrow the oral and nasal passages are.' "
How is it determined if snoring is a medical problem?,"'People who sleep (or lie awake not sleeping) near a snorer often report signs that may indicate a more serious problem. Witnessed apnea (stopping breathing) or gasping can suggest a breathing problem (sleep apnea, see below) or resulting ''heart'' problems. Leg kicking or other jerking movements can indicate a problem such as ''periodic limb movement disorder'' or ''restless leg syndrome''. Referral to a sleep specialist may be recommended if obstructive sleep apnea, ''restless leg syndrome'', and ''periodic limb movement disorder'' are suspected. Multiple studies have shown that simple clinical evaluations cannot determine if a person only snores, or if he or she has a more significant sleep disturbance. Therefore, a sleep study is often needed to determine if obstructive sleep apnea is present prior to initiating any treatments.'""If someone's sleep is disrupted because of snoring, the person may also notice other symptoms. Frequently, people complain of difficulty waking up in the morning or a feeling of insufficient sleep. They may take daytime naps or fall asleep during meetings. If sleep disruption is severe, people have fallen asleep while driving or performing their daily work.""'Daytime sleepiness can be estimated with a sleepiness inventory, and a sleep study can be performed if a sleeping problem is suspected. There are two general types of sleep studies:''A home (unattended) sleep study can measure some basic parameters of sleep and breathing. A pre-test evaluation by a sleep medicine specialist to determine if home testing is appropriate is recommended. Often, the home sleep study will include pulse ''oximetry'"" (a measurement of the level of oxygen in the blood), a record of movement, snoring, and apneic (pause in breathing) events. A home study can prove that there are no sleeping problems or suggest that there may be a problem. Some types of home sleep studies may monitory blood vessel reactions or tone as well as detecting respiratory events. Improved technology has expanded the ability to perform testing in the person's own sleep environment.""'If a home sleep study suggests a problem, treatment is often initiated. If the results are not clear, repeat testing with a full sleep study (polysomnography) may be performed in a clinic. (For a complete description of a full sleep study, see below).''If the sleepiness inventory and sleep study suggest there are no sleeping or breathing disorders, a person is diagnosed with primary snoring. Treatment options then can be discussed.''The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a ""test"" based on a patient\'s own report that establishes the severity of sleepiness. A person rates the likelihood of falling asleep during specific activities. Using the scale from 0 to 3 below, patients rank their risk of dozing in the chart below. (This chart can be printed out and taken to the doctor.)''After ranking each category, the total score is calculated. The range is 0-24, with the higher the score the more sleepiness.''Scoring:''Breaking it down further, excessive daytime sleepiness is greater than 10. Primary snorers usually have a score less than 10, and individuals with moderate to severe sleep apnea usually have a score greater than 16. (One woman filled out the sleepiness scale and had a low score. Sitting in the physician\'s office, however, she was falling asleep while waiting. The physician asked her why her score was so low. She replied, ""I don\'t ever read books, watch TV, or ride in a car, so the likelihood that I would fall asleep doing those things is very low."")' Home sleep study (portable sleep study) Full sleep study (polysomnography in a laboratory with a technician) 0 = Unlikely to fall asleep 1 = Slight risk of falling asleep 2 = Moderate risk of falling asleep 3 = High likelihood of falling asleep 0 to 9 = Average daytime sleepiness 10 to 15 = Excessive daytime sleepiness 16 to 24 = Moderate to severe daytime sleepiness"
What are some objective tests to measure sleepiness?,"'For someone who reports being ''sleepy during the day'', it is sometimes helpful to measure how sleepy he or she is. Also, after treatment of sleep problems, we sometimes want to measure improvement in daytime sleepiness.''Sleepiness can be measured with a ''Multiple Sleep Latency Test'' (MSLT). Basically, the MSLT measures how fast someone falls asleep during the day. It must be done after an overnight sleep study (polysomnography) has documented adequate opportunity for sleep the night before and no untreated obstructive sleep apnea. The test is composed of four to five ""naps"" that last 20 minutes each and are spaced two hours apart. The person is instructed to ""try to fall asleep."" The average time to fall asleep is calculated for all four or five tests. A normal time would be greater than ten minutes needed to fall asleep. ''Excessive sleepiness'' is defined as falling asleep in less than five minutes.''The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test'' (MWT) also measures daytime sleepiness. The person taking this test is instructed to ""try to stay awake."" This is repeated for four 40-minute sessions, two hours apart. Not falling asleep in all four tests is the strongest objective measure of the absence of daytime sleepiness.''Some businesses use these tests to ensure that their employees are not excessively sleepy while at work. Specifically, airline pilots and truck drivers who experience sleepiness need to have a test to ensure public safety and productivity at work. Unfortunately, there is no test that will guarantee that someone will not fall asleep at his or her job or while driving.' "
What are the treatments for snoring?,"'The goals for the treatment of snoring may be difficult to determine. The problem of snoring usually is a problem for the bed partner or roommate. Therefore, successful treatment should also include the goal of achieving a successful night\'s sleep for the bed partner or roommate. This makes treatment of snoring a challenge. For example, someone may have a successful treatment if his or her snoring decreases from a jackhammer level to that of a passing truck. If their bed partner is happy, then the snoring problem is ""cured."" However, another person whose snoring decreases from a mild sound to the level of heavy breathing may still have an unhappy bed partner.''Most procedures to treat snoring are focused on reducing the ''flutter'' or movement of the soft palate (roof of the mouth). This addresses palatal flutter snoring. If the snoring originates from behind the tongue or from the lateral walls of the throat, palatal procedures will be less effective.''It is wise to look at the ""success"" reports for various treatments with a critical eye. If the number of nights that a bed partner has to leave the room decreases from seven nights per week to one night per week, is that success? Some would say that it is. However, the bed partner (or snorer) still has to leave the room one night per week. It is important to know what the expectations for a ""cure"" are before considering any treatments.'  "
What are the five main categories of non-surgical treatments for snoring?,"'The five main categories of non-surgical treatment of snoring are:''Behavioral changes are the easiest to identify, but some of the hardest to accomplish. For example, if a person gains 10 pounds, snoring may become a problem. It is easy to tell a person to lose the ten pounds, but it is difficult to accomplish. Behavioral changes include ''weight loss'', changing sleeping positions, avoiding alcohol, ''smoking cessation'', and changing medications that may be the cause of snoring.''Losing weight may improve snoring. Snoring usually is worse when lying flat on the back, as discussed previously. To help this problem, a pocket can be sewn into the back of the snorer\'s pajama tops. A tennis or golf ball in the pocket will ""encourage"" the snorer to roll over to sleep on his/her side. Special sleeping pillows to prevent sleeping on the back are also available. Alcohol or sedative medications make snoring worse, and therefore should be avoided.''As previously discussed, snoring can be exacerbated by normal airflow through a narrowed area in the throat. Part of the narrowing is caused by the tongue and palate falling backwards during sleep. Some dental devices have been developed that hold the jaw forward. Since the tongue is attached in the front to the jaw, the tongue also is held forward when these devices are used. Some devices are designed to hold the palate up and forward.''Dental devices (similar to a mouthpiece) may also be referred to as oral appliances or mandibular advancement devices. The devices are best made by a dentist or experienced physician to ensure a correct fit without causing problems and adequate treatment of the sleep problem. These devices may improve snoring in 70% to 90% of cases. There are some drawbacks to dental devices, however. They must be worn every night in order to work, can cause or exacerbate temporomandibular joint (''TMJ'') problems, can cause excessive salivation, and can be moderately expensive.''The available data on some of these devices revealed both subjective and objective improvement in snoring. These devices may be appropriate and recommended for those individuals with primary snoring or mild obstructive sleep apnea who did not benefit or did not qualify for the previously discussed behavioral changes.''For people with narrow nasal passages, snoring can be alleviated with nasal devices or medications. Breath-rite strips open the anterior nasal valve (front part of the nose). If this is the main or only area of narrowing, snoring may improve with use of these strips, but this is frequently not the case.''If nasal mucosal (lining) swelling from ''allergies'' or irritation is causing the problem, nasal sprays may help. Nasal saline irrigation spray is a way to clean and moisturize the nasal lining since environmental irritants that stay in the nose (dust, ''pollen'', and smoke) continue to irritate as long as they are present. The nasal lining also swells when it is cold and dry. Nasal saline helps to wash away irritants and moisturizes the mucosa without side effects.''Other nasal sprays that may be used to improve nasal breathing include nasal steroid sprays and nasal decongestants. They are very helpful for swelling due to minor allergies or irritation. Steroid sprays decrease inflammation in the nasal passages. Very little of the steroid is absorbed into the body from the nose so there are few side effects with these sprays. Nasal decongestants that shrink the blood vessels in the turbinates also can be used to improve snoring that results from ''nasal congestion''.''These measures may also be helpful for people who only snore when they have upper respiratory infections or colds, which typically cause swelling of the airway passages.''CPAP or continuous positive airway pressure is a device that is commonly used in patients with a clinical diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. This device works by providing a constant, increased air pressure to prevent airway narrowing during inspiration and expiration. It entails wearing a mask that is connected by tubing to a pump that keeps the pressure of the inspired air at a higher than normal level.''This device has proven to cause subjective and objective improvement of snoring and other symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. The air pressures are adjusted individually for each patient based on the parameters of a sleep study.''The main problem with CPAP is that it has to be worn to be effective. The machines are smaller and have enhanced features along with a wide variety of mask interfaces to improve comfort and compliance. Despite this, patient adherence to the use of CPAP often is not optimal.''There are many other simple over the counter products available to help with snoring. Generally, they may not be scientifically studied and recommended. They may be useful in some people subjectively, but night to night variability in results has also been reported. Regardless, if snoring exists, then it needs to be fully evaluated by a physician to assure that there is no underlying potential medical condition and to choose a proven method of treatment.' Behavioral changes Dental devices Nasal devices and medications Nasal CPAP Over-the-counter products"
What are the surgical options for snoring?,"'Surgery to treat snoring is designed to reduce obstruction or narrowing in the anatomic area that is causing the snoring. There may be more than one involved area, so surgery on only one of the narrowed areas may decrease snoring but not eliminate it entirely. Decreasing palatal and uvular flutter are also believed to help in reducing the snoring sounds.'""Surgical treatment of snoring is generally focused on the nasal passages, palate and uvula, and tongue. Most of the surgical procedures are performed in a doctor's office. In general, individual insurance carriers determine what medical conditions are covered as a benefit of the plan. Insurance is frequently changing, and, therefore, coverage policies may vary. As always, it is important to check with your own insurance carrier and pre-confirm the estimated cost and coverage for any planned medical treatment or surgery.""'It is prudent to undergo a formal sleep study (polysomnogram) prior to performing surgery to assure that snoring is not a manifestation of obstructive sleep apnea. If sleep apnea is the case, then more conservative CPAP needs to be prescribed and attempted first. In addition, if snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnea, then a surgical correction may mask the obvious symptom of a potentially serious condition and leave sleep apnea undiagnosed.''Nasal surgery to treat snoring is generally focused on improving a narrow nasal passage. While improvements in snoring may occur after improvements in nasal breathing, some studies have not shown this to be the case.'""In the doctor's office, radio-frequency energy can be used to shrink the turbinates by creating ""'scar tissue'' in them, resulting in a more open nasal passage. The procedure takes about 15 minutes. Most of that time is spent numbing the nasal tissue with topical and injectable medications.''The procedure is performed with a wand that is placed into the tissues. Radio-frequency energy then is released into the tissues for about ten seconds. Several applications are done on each side of the nose for maximal effect. The procedure is successful when ''scar'' tissue forms. Therefore, it takes about three months to see the full effect of the procedure. As the scar tissue softens over time, however, the swelling and narrowing may recur. The procedure then can be repeated as needed in the office.''Several other anatomic problems can cause or worsen snoring. The nasal septum is the ""wall"" in the center of the nose that separates the right and left nasal passages. After ''trauma'' (including during birth), the septum can be deviated to one side or may curve to both sides (one side by the front of the septum and the other by the back of the septum). The septum deviation can be corrected by removing the crooked cartilage. This surgery usually is performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. After surgery, if the nasal obstruction is improved, the snoring often improves.''Nasal polyps'' are mucosal ""growths"" in the nose that are usually caused by allergies. As they continue to enlarge over time, they can cause nasal obstruction. If the polyps are large enough, they will require surgery to remove them. This surgery was previously performed in the doctor\'s office. However, it is currently more usual to perform the surgery in the operating room under general anesthesia. Removing the polyps reduces nasal obstruction, which may improve snoring.''Snoring can also be caused by a long, floppy palate and uvula. There are several procedures that involve the uvula and palate. Some procedures remove the tissue whereas others try to stiffen the tissues. Because the procedures are performed on soft tissue, over time the tissue stiffening can soften. As a result, a reduction in the effect may occur.'""Uvulectomy is the removal of the uvula. This can easily be performed under local anesthesia in the doctor's office. A person usually does not miss having the uvula. However, there is a period of one to two weeks of discomfort in the throat after the procedure. Some people require strong ""'pain'' medications for several days, whereas others need only ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or an ''over-the-counter'' equivalent. Most people describe the ''pain'' as similar to a bad viral ''sore throat'' that is worse when swallowing. The main risks of uvulectomy are pain, bleeding, and altered speech (if you speak a language with guttural fricatives like Hebrew or Farsi).'""Laser assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) is an older procedure which involves trimming the palate with a laser. It can be performed in the doctor's office under local anesthesia. Small ""'cuts'' are made in the palate on each side of the uvula with a laser. Several procedures are usually needed for a maximal effect. The scarring caused by the procedure stiffens the palate, decreasing the ability of the palate to vibrate and pulls the palate sideways to tighten it. This procedure results in moderate pain for one to two weeks that is generally controlled with oral pain medications.''Other methods to stiffen the palate in the office include injections with a sclerosing agent, ''radiofrequency ablation'' of the palate, cold ablation of the palate, or in-office palatoplasty procedures.''Snoring due to a long, floppy palate can be treated with office procedures that stiffen the palate. Like a sail on a sailboat, the air moving around the palate can cause vibrations of the tissue. For a sailboat sail, battens are placed to stiffen the sail and decrease vibration. Similarly, a stiffer palate vibrates less. The palate can be stiffened by creating scar tissue (as discussed previously) or with implants.'""Radio-frequency ablation of the palate can be performed under local anesthesia in the doctor's office. Usually, three tunnels in the tissue are made with a radiofrequency wand. The radiofrequency energy is applied for approximately ten seconds with the wand in the palate muscle tissue. The tissue heals as scar tissue, and the palate becomes stiffer and vibrates less. Generally, scar tissue in the palate continues to form for up to three months. Up to 77% of people report reduced snoring after this procedure, however, as the tissue continues to heal over time, the palate may soften and re-obstruct. One study demonstrated a 29% relapse in snoring after one year.""'Palate implants are now being used to treat snoring. They are made from Dacron, which is a non-reactive material that has been used for many years for heart valve surgery and ''hernia'' repair. Dacron also encourages the normal tissue to grow into it. Small Dacron implants are placed into the palate under local anesthesia. The implants stiffen the palate just like scar tissue does after radiofrequency treatments. The implants stay in the tissue, so recurrence of snoring should be reduced.''Correct patient selection is important. The placement of the implants is done near the posterior edge of the hard palate. If the patient has a long, floppy, soft palate and uvula, there may be a lower likelihood of successful reduction in snoring. Multiple implants can be placed, with additional implants added up to a total of 5 in some cases. Some relapse after 12 months was common in many studies, and no significant reduction in obstructive sleep apnea has been shown with any consistency.''There is a small increased risk of infection after insertion of foreign material in the palate tissue. If this occurs, the implant should be removed and replaced with another implant. Although this sounds like a negative consequence, infection actually leads to scarring, which helps decrease the vibrations of the palate. The implant procedure results in less tissue inflammation and therefore the procedure does not hurt as much or for as long as following radio-frequency treatments.' "
What is the success of surgery for snoring?,"'Surgeries are generally successful in reducing snoring. The success of a procedure depends on the problem area causing the snoring. For example, someone with nasal ''congestion'"" will not have much improvement with a palate procedure and vice versa. The other factor that makes success hard to measure is the definition of success. As discussed earlier, the goal of surgery should include a successful night's sleep for those around the snorer.""'Palate implant surgery has been reported to decrease snoring. On a loudness scale of 1 to 100, the average decrease is from 79 to 48 at three months. Is a snoring level of 48 a success? For some people it may be, but for others it may not. Similarly, palate implant surgery was recommended by 89% of snorers, but only 69% of their partners. Palatal implant surgery, like other surgeries, is very successful if the patients are carefully selected. Only people with snoring due to palate problems will improve with palate surgery, and only the snorer\'s partner will determine if the improvement in snoring is a ""success.""' "
What are the signs and symptoms of snoring?,"'Snoring can be a symptom of common conditions such as ''allergies'' or ''asthma''. But it also can be a symptom of a serious medical condition called ''obstructive sleep apnea'' in which a person stops ''breathing'' intermittently during ''sleep''. A person with ''sleep apnea'' may snore loudly or make choking noises as they try to breathe. The body becomes deprived of oxygen, and a person may wake up from it. When severe, this can happen hundreds of times during the night or when sleeping at other times during the day. ''Sleep apnea'' is associated with a higher risk for' high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes."
How can I get my partner to stop snoring?,"""If you're living with someone who snores, the first step is making sure they know they snore (if they are not awakened by their own snoring they may not be aware of it). Next encourage them to visit a doctor to diagnose and treat the underlying cause. You also can help your partner track their snoring habits if the doctor needs a sleep journal. They may try some of the home remedies mentioned previously to stop snoring. ""'In the meantime, sharing a bed with a snorer can be exhausting. To take care of yourself: '  Use earplugs Try a white noise machine Try going to bed before your partner – 
if you're already asleep maybe you won't hear them Consider sleeping in separate bedrooms. 
This is often a last resort and a personal decision for partners."
What kinds of doctors treat snoring?,"""Many kinds of doctors treat snoring, depending on the underlying cause. You may first consult your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner or internist, or a child's pediatrician. ""'For further testing and management of snoring or ''sleep disorders'' such as sleep apnea you may be referred to a sleep medicine specialist. ''Allergies'' may be treated by an allergist, and ''asthma'' may be treated by a lung specialist (''pulmonologist'') or respiratory therapist. If you have nasal deformities such as a ''deviated septum'' or nasal polyps you may see an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT, or otolaryngologist), and if you require removal of your ''tonsils'' or adenoids you may be referred to a general surgeon. ''Sometimes an oral appliance is helpful to help stop the snoring. This may be fitted by a dentist. ' "
What is the diagnosis of snoring?,"'The diagnosis of the underlying cause of snoring will depend on the symptoms and the suspected reason for the snoring. The doctor will start by asking about ''allergies'', medications, and whether you drink alcohol or smoke. The mouth, nose, and throat will be examined to see if there are any physical deformities that may be the cause of the snoring.''If sleep apnea is suspected, you may be asked about whether you wake up gasping for breath, if you fall asleep during the day, if your partner notices you snore loudly or stop ''breathing'' while you sleep, and if your sleep is not refreshing. You may need to keep a diary of your sleep habits and snoring.''A sleep study may be necessary to monitor your sleep patterns and diagnose whether you have sleep apnea or any other sleep disorder.' "
What natural home remedies help a person stop snoring?,"'Once you have ruled out sleep apnea as the cause of your snoring, the next step is figuring out how to stop snoring. There are some home remedies and behavior changes that may help reduce or eliminate snoring:' Lose weight. Don't sleep on your back. Avoid alcohol. Don't take muscle relaxants (talk to your doctor before stopping any prescription medication, and ask about alternatives). Quit smoking. Try an anti-snoring pillow. Use nasal strips to open nasal passages. Take a hot shower before bed to open the sinuses. Change sheets frequently if allergies cause snoring (vacuum and dust regularly too.) Use a humidifier or vaporizer. Throat exercises Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Antisnoring apps: For those who love technology, there are several anti-snoring apps available. Download these anti-snoring solutions them onto your phone or tablet, to figure out ways to stop snoring. These apps can help record your snoring, analyze your sleep, and even play a sound to awaken you when they detect a snore."
What anti-snoring aids and devices help stop snoring?,"'When snoring is caused by obstructive sleep apnea, a ''CPAP'' (Continuous Positive ''Airway'' Pressure) is often prescribed. This machine uses air pressure to keep the airways open while you sleep so you do not stop breathing, and it is an effective non-surgical treatment for sleep apnea. There are a few variations of ''CPAP'' devices:''An anti-snoring mouthpiece may be a viable treatment for snoring. Many people snore because airflow as you breathe causes the tissues in the back of your throat to vibrate. Anti-snoring aids such as mouthpieces (also called mouth guards or night guards) help bring the jaw forward to widen the back of the airway, allowing air to pass through without resistance, stopping snoring. Sometimes, these mouthpieces can stop snoring immediately, the first time they are used. There are two main types of anti-snoring mouthpieces: ''A chinstrap will not help reduce snoring.'' A study by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that a chinstrap does not improve sleep disordered breathing and is ineffective in improving snoring.'  Nasal CPAP mask: This covers the nose 
only and is the most common type of CPAP. This type works best for those who 
breathe from their nose and they can operate with higher air pressure settings. 
	It is not good for mouth breathers or those who have allergies or sinus issues.
	 Nasal pillow: These are small prongs 
that insert directly into the nostrils. It is smaller and may be more 
comfortable for some people. It's also good for those with a lot of facial hair 
who cannot get a good seal on a standard CPAP mask, or for those who feel 
claustrophobic with a mask covering their face. They may cause nasal dryness and 
	nosebleeds, or pressure ulcers in the nostrils, and can be less comfortable with 
higher-pressure airflow.  Full face CPAP mask: This covers the 
entire nose and mouth and has side straps to keep the mask in place. It works 
best for those who require high pressure air flow, and prevents air leakage for 
those who sleep on their backs. It is not optimal for stomach sleepers, and can 
be difficult to wear glasses, watch TV, or read while wearing it.  Tongue Stabilizing Devices (TSD) work 
by sucking the tongue forward or downward, increasing the opening at the back of 
the throat, helping to decrease the amount of tissue that can vibrate. Some 
people find them uncomfortable and they may cause increased salivation.  Mandibular Advancing Devices (MAD), 
also called Jaw Advancing Device (JAD) work by moving the lower jaw forward to 
open up the back of your throat and let air pass through more freely. They also 
move the tongue forward. They may cause some discomfort or shifting of your 
	teeth. 
	"
What foods or drinks may help a person stop snoring?,"""It's important to avoid foods that may trigger or increase snoring. For example, if you have ""'food allergies'', avoid these foods as they may cause inflammation in your mouth and throat, restricting the airway and leading to snoring. Alcohol is a relaxant, and it relaxes the muscles in the back of the throat, which can increase the blockage of the throat and make it harder for air to pass through. Foods you might try to help reduce snoring include:'  Non-dairy milk: Dairy can cause some people to have increased mucus, so plant-based milk will help avoid this problem (for example almond or soy milk). Hot tea: If you have a cold or sinus congestion that causes your snoring, hot beverages such as tea (with a little honey) can be soothing. Turmeric: This spice is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. Fruit and vegetables: These are full of antioxidants and fiber, and can help you lose weight. Peppermint: Stick with the oil (not the candy) for anti-inflammatory benefits. Horseradish: It can help dry excess mucus. Water: Stay hydrated."
What medical treatments help a person to quit snoring?,"'Medical treatments for snoring include assistive breathing devices such as the CPAP. Sometimes, surgery may be required. If snoring is due to a deviated septum, nasal polyps or other nasal deformities, surgery can correct these problems. Surgery also can reduce bulky tissue in the throat or alter bone structure to reduce or cure your snoring. Types of surgery that may be performed to cure causes of snoring include: ' Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy to 
remove enlarged tonsils and/or adenoids Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) which 
thins and tightens tissue in the throat Thermal ablation palatoplasty (TAP) 
uses radio waves to shrink throat tissues Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty 
(LAUP) uses a laser to shorten the uvula Palatal implants (also called the 
Pillar procedure) involves insertion of implants into the soft palate to help 
stiffen the soft tissue and reduce vibration Somnoplasty uses radiofrequency heat 
energy to remove or stiffen tissues of the uvula and soft palate so they don't 
vibrate"
Can snoring be prevented?,"'Snoring can be prevented by preventing the underlying cause. ' If you are overweight, lose weight. If you have allergies, change sheets 
frequently and keep your bedroom vacuumed and dusted, and take 
doctor-recommended allergy treatments. Don't smoke. Avoid alcohol. Don't take muscle relaxants or 
medications that make you snore. Ask your doctor for alternatives. Never stop 
taking prescribed medication without talking to your doctor first. Sleep on your side."
Facts you should know about somnoplasty, Somnoplasty is a surgical treatment for snoring. Somnoplasty uses heat energy to modify the tissues of the uvula and soft palate. Somnoplasty is an in-office procedure done with local anesthesia. Somnoplasty is not indicated for the treatment of sleep apnea.
What is a somnoplasty?,"'During normal ''breathing'', air passes through the throat on its way to the ''lungs''. The air travels past the tongue, soft palate, uvula, and ''tonsils''. The soft palate is the back of the roof of the mouth. The uvula is the prominent anatomic structure dangling downward visibly at the back of the mouth (pharynx). When a person is awake, the muscles in the back of the throat tighten to hold these structures in place preventing them from collapsing and/or vibrating in the ''airway''. During ''sleep'', the uvula and soft palate frequently vibrate causing the distinctive sounds of ''snoring''. Snoring may also originate from the walls of the throat and further down around the tongue base.''The most important aspect of snoring treatment is to first rule out the presence of obstructive ''sleep apnea''. Obstructive ''sleep'' apnea is well known to be associated with significant medical problems such as ''heart disease'', risk for ''stroke'', increased somnolence, and increased risk for motor vehicle accidents. Snoring is a hallmark sign of obstructive sleep apnea for many patients. However, just because someone snores, it does not mean they have sleep apnea. To rule out obstructive sleep apnea, they require an overnight sleep study. The test is usually conducted in a lab or at home with specialized equipment and should be evaluated by a sleep medicine physician. When snoring is present without obstructive sleep apnea, it is called primary snoring.''Somnoplasty is a\xa0unique surgical method for reducing habitual snoring by removing or stiffening tissues of the uvula and soft palate. Unlike other approaches (such as the laser), somnoplasty uses very low levels of radiofrequency heat energy to create finely controlled localized ''burn''-areas beneath the lining (mucosa) of the soft tissues of the soft palate. These ''burn'' areas are eventually resorbed by the body, shrinking the tissue volume and stiffening the tissues, thereby reducing symptoms of snoring. Somnoplasty is performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting and takes approximately 30 minutes.''The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is here for your information only, not to frighten you, but to make you aware and more knowledgeable concerning this procedure. Although many of these complications are rare, all have occurred, at one time or another, in the hands of experienced surgeons practicing the standards of community care. Anyone who is contemplating any type of surgery must weigh the potential risks and complications against the potential benefits of the surgery, or any alternative to surgery.'   Failure to resolve or eliminate snoring. Most surgeons feel that about 80% of patients who undergo a somnoplasty will have a significant reduction in their snoring at least a year or more; and an additional percentage of patients will notice reduced levels of snoring such that their sleep partners will report that it's level is no longer offensive. Failure to cure sleep apnea or other pathological sleep disorders. Pathological sleep disorders, like sleep apnea, are medical problems which may have associated serious complications. At this time, the somnoplasty procedure has not been proven to cure these disorders. Nasal regurgitation, a change in voice, or velopharyngeal insufficiency whereby liquids may flow into the nasal cavity during swallowing (rare). Need for revision, or further and more aggressive surgery. Prolonged pain, infection, bleeding, or impaired healing. Thermal or electrical injury to the mucus membranes of the soft palate, uvula, or mouth. This may result in tissue loss by burn. While not considered a complication, recurrence of snoring over time (usually greater than a year) has been noted for many snoring treatments. This is felt to occur as the tissue stretches out over time."
What happens before a somnoplasty?,"'You should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days of the date of your procedure. If there is any question as to the contents of a medication, please call your doctor or consult your pharmacist. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others) is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. You should consult your doctor about whether or not ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Nuprin'', and others) or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' are permissible.''You may eat a light meal prior to your procedure. ''Smokers'' should make every effort to stop ''smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding.' "
What happens the day of the somnoplasty?,"'It is important that you know precisely what time you are to come to the office, and that you allow sufficient preparation time. You should wear comfortable loose-fitting clothes which will allow for a conductive pad to be placed on the lower back area.' "
What takes place during the somnoplasty?,"'Prior to the actual procedure, you will be given an oral spray to start anesthetizing the throat area. Once the throat is partially anesthetized, you will be given approximately three small injections in the roof of the mouth. Most patients find that the process of anesthetizing the throat to be of only minor discomfort.''During the operation, you will be asked to sit upright and will be fully awake throughout the entire procedure. Your surgeon will explain the process and demonstrate the equipment. The Somnus ""gun"" device, which is connected to a radiofrequency generator, is placed into the mouth. A small electrode located at the end of the device is inserted into the soft palate (back of the roof of the mouth). Radiofrequency is applied through the electrode. Sections of the electrode are insulated to protect the delicate surface of the tissue. Through controlled delivery of radiofrequency energy, the tissue is heated in a limited area around the electrode. Most patients find the procedure to be surprisingly comfortable.' "
What happens after the somnoplasty?,"'Snoring can be expected to be worse immediately after the procedure because of local swelling of the tissues treated. Improvement usually begins in one or two weeks, and continues to occur for up to several months.''You will be able to go home once you feel comfortable. Most patients can safely drive themselves home from the office. It is best to sleep with your head elevated on 2-3 pillows for several nights following the procedure. A sense of fullness in the back of the throat is commonly reported for several days. By keeping your head elevated above your ''heart'', you can minimize ''edema'' and swelling. Applying an ice pack to the neck may help relieve swelling.''You may experience a ''sore throat'' for several days for which you may take acetaminophen (Tylenol, and others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, and others). A throat lozenge, such as Cepacol, can be soothing to the throat.''Do not eat or drink until the anesthesia has gone away. After this time, you may advance your ''diet'' as tolerated.'""An appointment for a checkup should be made 7 to 10 days after the procedure. Call your doctor's office to schedule this appointment.""  Extreme difficulty swallowing. Difficulty breathing. Sudden bleeding from the surgical site."
What are electrolytes?,"'Chemically, electrolytes are substances that become ions in solution and acquire the capacity to conduct electricity. Electrolytes are present in the ''human body'', and the balance of the electrolytes in our bodies is essential for normal function of our cells and our organs. ''Common electrolytes that are measured by doctors with blood testing include sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The functions and normal range values for these electrolytes are described below. ' "
Sodium,"'Sodium is the major positive ion (cation) in fluid outside of cells. The chemical notation for sodium is Na+. When combined with chloride, the resulting substance is table salt. Excess sodium (such as that obtained from dietary sources) is excreted in the urine. Sodium regulates the total amount of water in the body and the transmission of sodium into and out of individual cells also plays a role in critical body functions. Many processes in the body, especially in the brain, nervous system, and muscles, require electrical signals for communication. The movement of sodium is critical in the generation of these electrical signals. Therefore, too much or too little sodium can cause cells to malfunction, and extremes in the blood sodium levels (too much or too little) can be fatal.''A Normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased sodium (hypernatremia) in the blood occurs whenever there is excess sodium in relation to water. There are numerous causes of hypernatremia; these may include kidney disease, too little water intake, and loss of water due to diarrhea and/or vomiting. A decreased concentration of sodium (hyponatremia) occurs whenever there is a relative increase in the amount of body water relative to sodium. This happens with some diseases of the liver and kidney, in patients with congestive heart failure, in burn victims, and in numerous other conditions."
Potassium,"'Potassium is the major positive ion (cation) found inside of cells. The chemical notation for potassium is K+. The proper level of potassium is essential for normal cell function. Among the many functions of potassium in the body are regulation of the heartbeat and the function of the muscles. A seriously abnormal increase in potassium (''hyperkalemia'') or decrease in potassium (''hypokalemia'') can profoundly affect the nervous system and increases the chance of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), which, when extreme, can be fatal.''The normal blood potassium level is 3.5 - 5.0 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 3.5 - 5.0 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased potassium is known as hyperkalemia. Potassium is normally excreted by the kidneys, so disorders that decrease the function of the kidneys can result in hyperkalemia. Certain medications may also predispose an individual to hyperkalemia. Hypokalemia, or decreased potassium, can arise due to kidney diseases; excessive losses due to heavy sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, eating disorders, certain medications, or other causes."
Chloride,"'Chloride is the major anion (negatively charged ion) found in the fluid outside of cells and in the blood. An anion is the negatively charged part of certain substances such as table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) when dissolved in liquid.\xa0Chloride plays a role in helping the body maintain a normal balance of fluids.''The balance of chloride ion (Cl-) is closely regulated by the body. Significant increases or decreases in chloride can have deleterious or even fatal consequences:''The normal serum range for chloride is 98 - 108 mmol/L.' Increased chloride (hyperchloremia): Elevations in chloride may be seen in diarrhea, certain kidney diseases, and sometimes in overactivity of the parathyroid glands. Decreased chloride (hypochloremia): Chloride is normally lost in the urine, sweat, and stomach secretions. Excessive loss can occur from heavy sweating, vomiting, and adrenal gland and kidney disease."
Bicarbonate,"'The bicarbonate ion acts as a buffer to maintain the normal levels of acidity (pH) in blood and other fluids in the body. Bicarbonate levels are measured to monitor the acidity of the blood and body fluids. The acidity is affected by foods or medications that we ingest and the function of the kidneys and ''lungs''. The chemical notation for bicarbonate on most lab reports is HCO3- or represented as the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). The normal serum range for bicarbonate is 22-30 mmol/L. ''The bicarbonate test is usually performed along with tests for other blood electrolytes. ''Disruptions in the normal bicarbonate level'' may be due to diseases that interfere with respiratory function, kidney diseases, metabolic conditions, or other causes.' "
What is hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'Hyponatremia refers to a lower-than-normal level of sodium in the blood. Sodium is essential for many body functions including the maintenance of fluid balance, regulation of ''blood pressure'', and normal function of the nervous system. Hyponatremia has sometimes been referred to as ""water intoxication,"" especially when it is due to the consumption of excess water, for example during strenuous ''exercise'', without adequate replacement of sodium.''Sodium is the major positively charged ion (cation) in the fluid outside of cells of the body. The chemical notation for sodium is Na. When combined with chloride (Cl), the resulting substance is table salt (NaCl).''The normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L). Results may vary slightly among different laboratories.'  "
What are the symptoms of hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'When sodium levels in the body are low, water tends to enter cells, causing them to swell. When this occurs in the brain, it is referred to as cerebral ''edema''. Cerebral edema is particularly dangerous because the brain is confined in the skull without room for expansion, and the swelling can lead to ''brain damage'' as the pressure increases within the skull. Cerebral edema occurs only in severe cases of hyponatremia.''In chronic hyponatremia, in which the blood sodium levels drop gradually over time, symptoms are typically less severe than with acute hyponatremia (a sudden drop in blood sodium level). Symptoms can be very nonspecific and can include:''Other possible symptoms include:''Nausea'' and ''vomiting'' may accompany any of the symptoms.'   headache, confusion or altered mental state, seizures, and decreased consciousness, which can proceed to coma and death. restlessness, muscle spasms or cramps, weakness, and tiredness."
What causes hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'A low sodium level in the blood may result from excess water or fluid in the body, diluting the normal amount of sodium so that the concentration appears low. This type of hyponatremia can be the result of chronic conditions such as ''kidney failure'' (when excess fluid cannot be efficiently excreted) and congestive ''heart failure'', in which excess fluid accumulates in the body. ''SIADH'' (syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone) is a disease whereby the body produces too much anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in retention of water in the body. Consuming excess water, for example during strenuous ''exercise'', without adequate replacement of sodium, can also result in hyponatremia.''Hyponatremia can also result when sodium is lost from the body or when both sodium and fluid are lost from the body, for example, during prolonged ''sweating'' and severe vomiting or ''diarrhea''.''Medical conditions that can sometimes be associated with hyponatremia are ''adrenal insufficiency'', ''hypothyroidism'', and ''cirrhosis'' of the ''liver''.''Finally, a number of medications can lower blood sodium levels. Examples of these include diuretics, vasopressin, and the sulfonylurea ''drugs''.' "
What tests diagnose hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'The symptoms of hyponatremia are nonspecific, so a blood test measuring the sodium level is required to confirm the diagnosis of hyponatremia. Sometimes the medical history (such as prolonged vomiting or ''excessive sweating'') will suggest the diagnosis. In other cases, further blood tests, urine tests, and imaging studies may be needed in order to determine the exact cause of the hyponatremia.'  "
What diets and treatment guidelines are used for hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'Mild chronic hyponatremia may not require treatment other than adjustments in ''diet'', lifestyle, or medications. For severe or acute hyponatremia, treatment typically involves the intravenous administration of fluids and ''electrolytes''. In these situations, medications are often needed that treat the underlying cause of the hyponatremia as well as medications to manage the accompanying symptoms.'  "
Facts you should know about an actinic keratosis," An actinic keratosis is a small, rough spot occurring on sun-exposed skin. Actinic keratoses are also known as a solar keratoses. Actinic keratoses occur most commonly in fair-skinned people after years of sun exposure. Common locations for actinic keratoses are the face, scalp, ears, back of the neck, upper chest, as well as the tops of the hands and forearms. Actinic keratoses are very thin superficial lesions that have not penetrated into the deeper layers of the skin; they are predisposed to become skin cancer however. Doctors can usually diagnose an actinic keratosis simply by physical examination. It is best to prevent actinic keratoses by minimizing sun exposure. Treatments for actinic keratoses include cryosurgery, scraping or burning, 5-fluorouracil cream, imiquimod (Aldara), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR, Cambia), ingenol mebutate (Picato), TCA skin peels, and photodynamic therapy."
"What is an actinic keratosis? 
What causes actinic keratoses?","'An actinic keratosis (AK) is a small, rough spot occurring on skin that develops because of chronic sun exposure. These small superficial spots are superficial ''skin cancers'' that have not invaded the deeper layers of the skin. Actinic keratoses characteristically appear on photo-damaged skin. Actinic keratosis is also referred to as a ''solar keratosis''.''Specialized forms of actinic keratoses include ''cutaneous horns'', in which the skin protrudes in a thick, hornlike manner, and ''actinic cheilitis'', a scaling and roughness of the lower lip and blurring of the border of the lip and adjacent skin. There are other causes of cutaneous horns, including ''warts'' and ''age spots'' (seborrheic keratoses).' "
What are actinic keratosis symptoms and signs?,"'Actinic keratoses generally range in size between 2-6 mm in diameter (between the size of a pencil point and that of an eraser). They are usually reddish in color, with a rough texture and often have a white or yellowish scale on top. There is often a prickling ''pain'' felt when it is touched.'  "
Who is at risk for actinic keratoses?,"'Those who develop actinic keratoses tend to be fair-skinned people who have spent years outdoors at work or play or who have exposed their skin to indoor tanning ''radiation''. Their skin often becomes wrinkled, mottled, and thinned from sun exposure. Others at risk include immunosuppressed organ transplant patients and patients treated with ''PUVA'' therapy (long-wave ultraviolet light plus an oral drug called psoralen) for ''psoriasis''.' "
Where on the body do actinic keratoses typically occur?,"'Common locations for actinic keratoses are the cheeks, ''bridge'' of the nose, rim of the ears, scalp, back of the neck, upper chest, and the tops of the hands and forearms. Men are more likely to develop AKs on top of the ears or on a bald pate, whereas long hair is often protective.'  "
What is the significance of an actinic keratosis?,"'Actinic keratoses localized superficial tumors with the biological potential to develop into invasive ''skin cancer''. Although the chance of an individual actinic keratosis progressing into an invasive ''squamous cell carcinoma'' is less than 1%, patients with many of these lesions (very common) who continue to expose their skin to carcinogenic ultraviolet sunlight are likely to develop invasive skin ''cancers''. Squamous cell skin cancers are locally destructive and have a small but real potential for ''metastasis'' (spreading to other areas). Treating actinic keratoses at an early stage will help prevent invasive ''skin cancer''. When patients are diagnosed with this condition, they often say, ""But I never go out in the sun!"" The explanation for this is that there can be a long delay, even decades, for these keratoses to develop. Short periods of sun exposure do not generally either produce actinic keratoses or transform them into skin cancers.' "
What specialists diagnose actinic keratoses?,"'Generally, primary care physicians or dermatologists can diagnose and care for actinic keratosis. If the lesion is especially large or thick, a biopsy may be advisable to make sure that the spot in question has not become a ''skin cancer''.''There are other spots, called seborrheic keratoses, which are not caused by sun exposure and have no relationship to skin cancers. These are raised brown lesions that may appear on any area of the skin. They also often run in families.'  "
What is the treatment for an actinic keratosis?,"'The best treatment for an AK is ''prevention''. For light-skinned individuals, this means minimizing their sun exposure. By the time actinic keratoses develop, however, the relevant ultraviolet radiation is often so far in the past that prudent preventive measures play a relatively small role. Fortunately, treatment methods are usually simple and straightforward:'   Cryosurgery: Freezing with liquid nitrogen Other forms of surgery: Doctors sometimes scrape away or burn off AKs. Laser resurfacing: Using either carbon dioxide (CO) or erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) lasers 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): Creams containing this medication cause AKs to become red and inflamed before they fall off. Although effective, this method often produces unsightly and uncomfortable skin for a period of weeks, thus making it impractical for many patients. This method is best for patients who have a great deal of sun damage and many AKs. Once the skin heals, it often looks much smoother and even-toned. Imiquimod (Aldara): This immune stimulator is similar in its indications and effects to 5-FU. Ingenol mebutate (Picato): Is derived from the sap of a plant of the genus Euphorbia, which is related to the poinsettia plants that are popular at Christmas time. It is helpful in the treatment of small areas, but causes significant irritation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT): This therapy involves applying an agent (aminolevulinic acid [Levulan] or ALA) that sensitizes the skin to light, leaving it on for about one hour, and then exposing the skin to light that activates the chemical. This blue light is absorbed by the compound, releasing the energy as heat which is believed to destroy the actinic keratoses. Like 5-FU and imiquimod, photodynamic therapy works best for patients with many AKs. Patients need to avoid exposure to sun or intense fluorescent light for two days after treatment to prevent ongoing peeling. Diclofenac (Solaraze): This cream is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), an agent related to ibuprofen (Advil, Children's Advil/Motrin, Medipren, Motrin, Nuprin, PediaCare Fever), a popular medication for headaches. Diclofenac is gentler than 5-FU or imiquimod, causing less inflammation, but must be applied for a longer period of about two months to achieve only modest improvement. Superficial chemical peels using trichloracetic acid (TCA) can also be effective. This procedure is performed in the doctor's office."
Are there home remedies for actinic keratoses?,"'There are no home remedies for actinic keratoses, but many will resolve spontaneously if sun exposure can be strictly limited. Those lesions that do not resolve need professional medical attention.' "
Is it possible to prevent actinic keratoses?,"'Sun avoidance is the simplest way to avoid actinic keratoses. This would include applications of ''SPF'' 50 sunscreens to exposed skin, wearing sun-protective clothing, shade-seeking behavior, and avoiding tanning. There is now some evidence that taking niacinamide (nicotinamide), not ''niacin'', may have some preventative benefit. Niacinamide is available at many health food stores. Concerns about ''vitamin D deficiency'' can be avoided by taking multivitamin ''supplements''.' "
What is the prognosis of an actinic keratosis?,"'Patients who develop actinic keratoses should be examined at least once yearly. Actinic keratoses are an indicator that sufficient sun exposure has occurred to produce skin cancers such as ''basal cell carcinoma'', ''squamous cell carcinoma'', and ''malignant melanoma''. The purpose of these regular checks is to prevent and detect the development of invasive skin ''cancer''. Furthermore, continual avoidance of excessive sun exposure can decrease the risk of recurrences.' "
What is excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)?,"'The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis, excessive sweat or excessive sweating, produces a lot of embarrassment and unhappiness. Primary hyperhidrosis occurs in otherwise healthy individuals with no apparent cause. Secondary hyperhidrosis is much less common and can be due to certain ''drugs'', a variety of serious systemic diseases, neurological disorders, facial surgery, and ''anxiety''. Of the approximately 3% of Americans who suffer from excessive sweating, 50% involve the underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis). Underarm problems tend to start around ''puberty'', while palm and sole sweating may begin earlier, often during childhood. Untreated, these problems may continue throughout life.''Sweating is embarrassing, stains clothes, and may complicate business and social interactions. Excessive sweat can have serious practical consequences, like making it difficult to hold tools, grip a steering wheel, or shake hands.'  "
What is the cause of excessive sweating?,"'Otherwise healthy people with excessive sweating have primary hyperhidrosis. Heat and emotions may trigger hyperhidrosis in some, but many who suffer from hyperhidrosis perspire nearly all the time, regardless of their mood or the weather.''Secondary hyperhidrosis can be caused by medications such as ''dopamine'' agonists, ''antidepressants'', antipsychotics, ''alcohol'', and ''insulin''. Systemic disorders such as ''diabetes mellitus'', ''hyperthyroidism'', '""Parkinson's""' disease, and tumors such as ''pheochromocytoma'' and ''lymphoma'' have been associated with secondary hyperhidrosis.'  "
What signs and symptoms accompany hyperhidrosis?,"'Generally, the only sign of excessive sweating is the presence of abundant moisture in the anatomical area affected. The presence of this moisture can predispose to skin infections.''As stated above, there are a number of conditions and diseases that produce secondary hyperhidrosis. Treating the underlying condition can help relieve at least some of the excessive sweating.''The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweat.''Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating ''skin conditions''. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose hyperhidrosis?,"""The diagnosis is made clinically on the basis of a patient's history and physical examination. If the sweating is excessive and constant, then the diagnosis is obvious. It is not unusual that one must rely on the patient's history to determine the diagnosis. Research centers measure sweat production by comparing the weight of filter paper left on the skin for a specified interval before and after sweating.""'Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating skin conditions. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
What are medical treatment options for hyperhidrosis?,"'Through a systematic evaluation of causes and triggers of excessive sweating, followed by a judicious, stepwise approach to medical treatment, many people with this annoying disorder can achieve improved quality of life. The decision on initial treatment depends upon the severity of the condition and the anatomical areas that are affected.''The approach to treating hyperhidrosis generally proceeds as follows:''When regular antiperspirants fail, as they often do, to remedy hyperhidrosis, most doctors start by recommending aluminum chloride hexahydrate (''Drysol'', various generics), a prescription-strength version of aluminum chloride. It is applied just before bedtime seven to 10 nights in a row, then roughly once a week as a maintenance medication. The aluminum salts in this preparation collect in the sweat ducts of the patient and block them. Over time, the excessive ''perspiration'"" may diminish to such an extent that no further treatment is needed. This method works reasonably well for many patients whose problem is excessive underarm sweating, but it's not satisfactory for most of those with clammy palms and sweating of the soles of the ""'feet''.''The main side effect with aluminum chloride is irritation, which can sometimes, but not always, be overcome by reducing the frequency of use or applying anti-inflammatory medications such as lotions containing hydrocortisone.'""Iontophoresis was introduced over 50 years ago to treat excessive sweating. Its exact mechanism of action is still unclear. The procedure uses water to conduct an electric current to the skin, which combats the production of sweat. The current is applied typically for 10-20 minutes per session, initially with two to three sessions per week followed by a maintenance program of treatments at one- to three-week intervals, depending upon the patient's response. Iontophoresis treatments sound painful but in fact are not.""""Patients purchase devices for this treatment through a doctor's prescription. There are three iontophoresis devices that are registered with and cleared by the U.S. FDA; the R.A. Fischer and the Hidrex USA devices require a prescription, whereas the Drionic device is available without a prescription. They work best on palms and soles but can be adapted for use in the underarms. Medical insurers sometimes cover the cost.""'Oral anticholinergic drugs such as ''glycopyrrolate'' (''Robinul''), ''oxybutynin'', and ''propantheline'' bromide can be quite effective for this condition, but they can produce side effects like ''dry mouth'', ''insomnia'', and ''blurred vision''. The dosage should be titrated carefully.''Topical anticholinergic pads''Recently, a new topical treatment using glycopyrronium tosylate impregnated gauze pads (Qbrexza) has received approval for the treatment of axillary (armpit) hyperhidrosis.''Botulinum toxin (Botox), a muscle poison much in the news as a cosmetic treatment for ''wrinkles'', has actually been used in many areas of medicine for some time, such as in the treatment of ''muscle spasms'' and certain types of ''headaches''. Its latest medical use is for treating excessive underarm sweating.''Botox is injected into tissues of the armpit or hand. The drug works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, which is the chemical that activates sweat glands. This may produce approximately six months of relief from sweating. The injections are uncomfortable, but use of a very small needle minimizes discomfort.''Now that this treatment option has received FDA approval, many health insurers are providing coverage for the injections and the Botox itself, which is quite costly.''Currently, the FDA has not approved Botox for treating sweating of the palms and soles of the feet, though some physicians are administering it as an off-label use, with some success. Drawbacks of using this treatment for the palms and soles are ''pain'', requiring ''nerve blocks'' to numb the hands in order to make the injections tolerable, and the potential for temporary muscle ''weakness''.'""These new techniques produce energy that presumably destroys sweat glands while preserving other tissues. Currently, only the armpits seem to be appropriate treatment sites. Treatments occur in a doctor's office and in recent studies have been accompanied by local swelling and irritation as well as a variety of other relatively minor side effects. Sweating seems to be significantly decreased for a time with these treatments. How these would be used in other anatomical areas aside from the armpits is not clear.""   Over-the-counter antiperspirants: Patients usually try home remedies like these first because they are readily available. Antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride (for example, Certain-Dri) may be more effective when other antiperspirants have failed. So-called ""natural"" antiperspirants are often not very helpful for patients. Prescription-strength antiperspirants: those containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate Iontophoresis: a device that uses a direct current to drive ions into the sweat gland using tap water occasionally mixed with aluminum ions or other substances Oral medications: from the group of medications known as anticholinergics, which reduce sweating Topical medicated pads: pads impregnated with anticholinergic medications for use in the armpits Botox (botulinum toxin): approved in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating excessive axillary sweating Microwave destruction: a device destroys the sweat glands, purportedly causing minimal damage to other tissues Surgery: paraspinal sympathectomy, or interruption of certain nerve pathways, as a last resort"
Are there home remedies for hyperhidrosis?,"'Over-the-counter antiperspirants may be effective, but usually the patient has already tried these.' "
Can surgery treat hyperhidrosis? What are potential side effects of surgery for hyperhidrosis?,"'Localized axillary hyperhidrosis has been treated by surgical removal of a substantial portion of axillary skin. Another approach is the use of ''liposuction'' curettage, although how this effectively damages the dermal sweat glands is hard to visualize.''Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) refers to surgical interruption of the sympathetic nerves responsible for sweating. Sympathectomy is an operation intended to destroy part of the nerve supply to the sweat glands in the skin. The surgeon inserts a special endoscopic instrument into the chest between two ribs just below the armpit. The lung is briefly deflated to better visualize and destroy the nerves. Sympathectomy is both effective and risky. Even with newer endoscopic techniques, complications of the procedure can include compensatory, excessive sweating in other parts of the body as well as lung and nerve problems. As many of these complications are serious and not reversible, this option is rarely used, and then only as a last resort.'  "
Is it possible to prevent hyperhidrosis?,"'No, it is not possible to prevent hyperhidrosis.''Most hyperhidrosis patients can be effective and safely treated.' "

Facts you should know about somnoplasty, Somnoplasty is a surgical treatment for snoring. Somnoplasty uses heat energy to modify the tissues of the uvula and soft palate. Somnoplasty is an in-office procedure done with local anesthesia. Somnoplasty is not indicated for the treatment of sleep apnea.
What is a somnoplasty?,"'During normal ''breathing'', air passes through the throat on its way to the ''lungs''. The air travels past the tongue, soft palate, uvula, and ''tonsils''. The soft palate is the back of the roof of the mouth. The uvula is the prominent anatomic structure dangling downward visibly at the back of the mouth (pharynx). When a person is awake, the muscles in the back of the throat tighten to hold these structures in place preventing them from collapsing and/or vibrating in the ''airway''. During ''sleep'', the uvula and soft palate frequently vibrate causing the distinctive sounds of ''snoring''. Snoring may also originate from the walls of the throat and further down around the tongue base.''The most important aspect of snoring treatment is to first rule out the presence of obstructive ''sleep apnea''. Obstructive ''sleep'' apnea is well known to be associated with significant medical problems such as ''heart disease'', risk for ''stroke'', increased somnolence, and increased risk for motor vehicle accidents. Snoring is a hallmark sign of obstructive sleep apnea for many patients. However, just because someone snores, it does not mean they have sleep apnea. To rule out obstructive sleep apnea, they require an overnight sleep study. The test is usually conducted in a lab or at home with specialized equipment and should be evaluated by a sleep medicine physician. When snoring is present without obstructive sleep apnea, it is called primary snoring.''Somnoplasty is a\xa0unique surgical method for reducing habitual snoring by removing or stiffening tissues of the uvula and soft palate. Unlike other approaches (such as the laser), somnoplasty uses very low levels of radiofrequency heat energy to create finely controlled localized ''burn''-areas beneath the lining (mucosa) of the soft tissues of the soft palate. These ''burn'' areas are eventually resorbed by the body, shrinking the tissue volume and stiffening the tissues, thereby reducing symptoms of snoring. Somnoplasty is performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting and takes approximately 30 minutes.''The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is here for your information only, not to frighten you, but to make you aware and more knowledgeable concerning this procedure. Although many of these complications are rare, all have occurred, at one time or another, in the hands of experienced surgeons practicing the standards of community care. Anyone who is contemplating any type of surgery must weigh the potential risks and complications against the potential benefits of the surgery, or any alternative to surgery.'   Failure to resolve or eliminate snoring. Most surgeons feel that about 80% of patients who undergo a somnoplasty will have a significant reduction in their snoring at least a year or more; and an additional percentage of patients will notice reduced levels of snoring such that their sleep partners will report that it's level is no longer offensive. Failure to cure sleep apnea or other pathological sleep disorders. Pathological sleep disorders, like sleep apnea, are medical problems which may have associated serious complications. At this time, the somnoplasty procedure has not been proven to cure these disorders. Nasal regurgitation, a change in voice, or velopharyngeal insufficiency whereby liquids may flow into the nasal cavity during swallowing (rare). Need for revision, or further and more aggressive surgery. Prolonged pain, infection, bleeding, or impaired healing. Thermal or electrical injury to the mucus membranes of the soft palate, uvula, or mouth. This may result in tissue loss by burn. While not considered a complication, recurrence of snoring over time (usually greater than a year) has been noted for many snoring treatments. This is felt to occur as the tissue stretches out over time."
What happens before a somnoplasty?,"'You should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days of the date of your procedure. If there is any question as to the contents of a medication, please call your doctor or consult your pharmacist. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others) is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. You should consult your doctor about whether or not ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Nuprin'', and others) or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' are permissible.''You may eat a light meal prior to your procedure. ''Smokers'' should make every effort to stop ''smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding.' "
What happens the day of the somnoplasty?,"'It is important that you know precisely what time you are to come to the office, and that you allow sufficient preparation time. You should wear comfortable loose-fitting clothes which will allow for a conductive pad to be placed on the lower back area.' "
What takes place during the somnoplasty?,"'Prior to the actual procedure, you will be given an oral spray to start anesthetizing the throat area. Once the throat is partially anesthetized, you will be given approximately three small injections in the roof of the mouth. Most patients find that the process of anesthetizing the throat to be of only minor discomfort.''During the operation, you will be asked to sit upright and will be fully awake throughout the entire procedure. Your surgeon will explain the process and demonstrate the equipment. The Somnus ""gun"" device, which is connected to a radiofrequency generator, is placed into the mouth. A small electrode located at the end of the device is inserted into the soft palate (back of the roof of the mouth). Radiofrequency is applied through the electrode. Sections of the electrode are insulated to protect the delicate surface of the tissue. Through controlled delivery of radiofrequency energy, the tissue is heated in a limited area around the electrode. Most patients find the procedure to be surprisingly comfortable.' "
What happens after the somnoplasty?,"'Snoring can be expected to be worse immediately after the procedure because of local swelling of the tissues treated. Improvement usually begins in one or two weeks, and continues to occur for up to several months.''You will be able to go home once you feel comfortable. Most patients can safely drive themselves home from the office. It is best to sleep with your head elevated on 2-3 pillows for several nights following the procedure. A sense of fullness in the back of the throat is commonly reported for several days. By keeping your head elevated above your ''heart'', you can minimize ''edema'' and swelling. Applying an ice pack to the neck may help relieve swelling.''You may experience a ''sore throat'' for several days for which you may take acetaminophen (Tylenol, and others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, and others). A throat lozenge, such as Cepacol, can be soothing to the throat.''Do not eat or drink until the anesthesia has gone away. After this time, you may advance your ''diet'' as tolerated.'""An appointment for a checkup should be made 7 to 10 days after the procedure. Call your doctor's office to schedule this appointment.""  Extreme difficulty swallowing. Difficulty breathing. Sudden bleeding from the surgical site."
What is an ultrasound?,"""While the patient's history and physical examination are the initial steps of making a medical diagnosis, the ability to peer inside the body can be a powerful tool. Ultrasound is an imaging technique that provides that ability to medical practitioners.""'Ultrasound produces sound waves that are beamed into the body causing return echoes that are recorded to ""visualize"" structures beneath the skin. The ability to measure different echoes reflected from a variety of tissues allows a shadow picture to be constructed. The technology is especially accurate at seeing the interface between solid and fluid filled spaces. These are actually the same principles that allow SONAR on boats to see the bottom of the ocean.'  "
What is ultrasonography?,"'Ultrasonography is a form of body imaging using sound waves to facilitate makeing a medical diagnosis. A skilled ultrasound technician is able to see inside the body using ultrasonography to answer questions that may be asked by the medical practitioner caring for the patient. Usually, a radiologist will oversee the ultrasound test and report on the results, but other types of physicians may also use ultrasound as a diagnostic tool. For example, obstetricians use ultrasound to assess the fetus during ''pregnancy''. Surgeons and emergency physicians use ultrasound at the bedside to assess ''abdominal pain'' or other concerns.''A transducer, or probe, is used to project and receive the sound waves and their echoes. A gel is wiped onto the patient\'s skin so that the sound waves are not distorted as they cross through the skin. Using their understanding of human anatomy and the machine, the technician can evaluate specific structures and try to answer the question asked by the patient\'s physician. This may take a fair amount of time and require the probe to be repositioned and pointed in different directions. As well, the technician may need to vary the amount of pressure used to push the probe into the skin. The goal will be to ""paint"" a shadow picture of the inner organ that the health care practitioner has asked to be visualized.''The physics of sound can place limits on the test. The quality of the picture depends on many factors.''Ultrasound can be enhanced by using Doppler technology which can measure whether an object is moving towards or away from the probe. This can allow the technician to measure blood flow in organs such as the ''heart'' or ''liver'', or within specific blood vessels.' Sound waves cannot penetrate deeply, and an obese patient may be imaged poorly. Ultrasound does poorly when gas is present between the probe and the target organ. Should the intestine be distended with bowel gas, organs behind it may not be easily seen. Similarly, ultrasound works poorly in the chest, where the lungs are filled with air. Ultrasound does not penetrate bone easily. The accuracy of the test is very much operator dependent. This means that the key to a good test is the ultrasound technician."
For what purposes are ultrasounds used?,"'Ultrasound is not limited to diagnosis, but can also be used in screening for disease and to aid in treatment of diseases or conditions. ' "
Diagnostic uses for ultrasound,"'Ultrasound is routinely used for assessing the progression of a pregnancy. Pelvic ultrasounds can be obtained trans-abdominally where the probe is placed on the abdominal wall, or trans-vaginally, where the probe is placed in the vagina. For example ultrasound in obstetrics/gynecology is used to diagnose growths or tumors of the ovary, uterus, or, Fallopian tubes.''Echocardiography'"" (echo=sound + cardio=heart + graphy=study) evaluates the heart, the heart valve's motion, and blood flow through them. It also evaluates the heart wall motion and the amount of blood the heart pumps with each ""'stroke''.''Echocardiography can be performed in two ways:''Anatomically, the esophagus sits near the heart and allows clearer images. However, this approach is a little more invasive.''Different groups of illnesses can be assessed by echocardiography:''Ultrasound can detect blood clots in veins (superficial or deep venous thrombosis) or artery blockage (stenosis) and dilatation (aneurysms). Some examples of ultrasound testing include:''Aside from its use in obstetrics, ultrasound can evaluate most of the solid structures in the abdominal ''cavity''. This includes the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, prostate, testicles, uterus, and ovaries.''The thyroid gland can be imaged using ultrasound looking for nodules, growths, or tumors.''Ultrasound can be used to detect bulging of fluid from a swollen ''knee joint'' into the back of the knee, called a '""Baker's cyst""'.'   trans-thoracic: the probe is place on the chest wall to obtain images, and trans-esophageal: where the probe is placed through the mouth into the esophagus. Valves in the heart keep blood flowing in one direction when the heart pumps. For example, when the heart beats, blood is pumped from the left ventricle through the aortic valve into the aorta and the rest of the body. The aortic valve prevents blood from back-flowing into the heart as it fills for the next beat. Echocardiography can determine if the valve is narrow or leaking (regurgitating, insufficient). By following how the patient fares clinically, repeated echocardiograms can help determine whether valve replacement or repair is warranted. The same principles apply to the mitral valve which keeps blood flowing from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The heart muscle pumps blood to the body. If the heart weakens, the amount of blood it pumps with each beat can decrease, leading to congestive heart failure. The echocardiogram can measure the efficiency of the heart beat and how much blood it pumps; which assists in determining whether medications are needed. It also is used to monitor how well medications are working. Echocardiography can visualize the heart chambers to detect blood clots in conditions such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rhythm). In other situations, the test can help diagnose endocarditis (an infection of the heart valves) by visualizing ""vegetations"" (an infected mass) on the valves themselves. Echocardiography also can detect abnormal fluid collections (pericardial effusions) in the pericardium. Echocardiograms are used to diagnose and monitor pulmonary artery hypertension. Carotid ultrasound is performed in patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes to determine whether the major arteries in the neck are blocked causing the decreased blood supply to the brain. The aorta is the large blood vessel leaving the heart that supplies blood to the rest of the body. The walls of the aorta are under significant pressure from the force of the heartbeat and over time, may weaken and widen. This is called an aneurysm, and it can be detected in the abdomen by ultrasound (abdominal aortic aneurysm). For those patients with small aneurysm, observation may be recommended and the aneurysms size followed over time by repeated tests. Veins can also be evaluated by ultrasound and it is a common test to assess whether swelling in a leg is due to a blood clot, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or another cause. Ultrasound is the preferred technique to test for gallstones or an infected gallbladder. The ultrasound can reveal the stones as well as signs of infection, including thickening of the gallbladder wall and fluid surrounding the gallbladder. The ultrasound may find blockage in the bile ducts. For those patients where the radiation of a CT scan (computerized tomography) is a potential risk (pregnant patients or children), ultrasound may be used to look for diseases like appendicitis or kidney stones. Ultrasound is the test of choice to diagnose testicular torsion. Pelvic ultrasound is used in gynecology to help assess non-pregnancy related issues like lower abdominal pain, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, uterine growths, and endometriosis."
Screening uses for ultrasound,"'Ultrasound may be used to screen for blood vessel diseases. By measuring blood flow and blockage in the carotid arteries, the test can predict potential risk for future ''stroke''. Similarly, by measuring the diameter of the aorta in the abdomen, ultrasound can screen for aneurysm (abnormal dilatation) and the risk of rupture. These tests may be indicated for an individual patient or they may be offered as a community wide health screening assessment.' "
Therapeutic uses for ultrasound,"'Ultrasound may be used to help physicians guide needles into the body.''In situations where an intravenous line is required but it is difficult to find a vein, ultrasound guidance may be used to identify larger veins in the neck, chest wall, or groin.''Ultrasound may be used to guide a needle into a ''cavity'' that needs to be drained (for example, an ''abscess'') or a mass that needs to be biopsied, where a small bit of tissue is removed for analysis.' "
What are the risks of ultrasound?,"""There are no known risks to ultrasound, and as technology has improved, the machines have become smaller, portable and available for use at the patient's bedside. "" "
How do patients prepare for an ultrasound?,"'Preparation for ultrasound is minimal. Generally, if internal organs such as the gallbladder are to be examined, patients are requested to avoid eating and drinking with the exception of water for six to eight hours prior to the examination. This is because food causes gallbladder contraction, minimizing the size, which would be visible during the ultrasound.''In preparation for examination of the baby and womb during pregnancy, sometimes it is recommended that mothers drink at least four to six glasses of water approximately one to two hours prior to the examination for the purpose of filling the bladder. This helps improve the images captured during the exam.' "
How are the results of ultrasound interpreted and communicated to the physician?,"'The ultrasound is generally performed by a technician. The technician will notice preliminary structures and may point out several of these structures during the examination. The official reading of the ultrasound is done by a radiologist, a physician who is an expert at interpreting ultrasound images. The radiologist records the interpretation and transmits it to the practitioner requesting the test. Occasionally, during the ultrasound test the radiologist will ask questions of the patient and/or perform an examination in order to further define the purpose for which the test is ordered, or to clarify preliminary findings.''Plain ''x-rays'' might be ordered to further evaluate early findings.'""A summary of results of all of the above is reported to the health care practitioner who requested the ultrasound. They are then discussed with the patient in the context of the patient's overall health status."" "
What causes a sore throat?,"'There are several different causes of sore throats.''Viral infections:'' Viruses are the most common cause of sore throats. Several different viruses can cause common colds and an upper respiratory infections and include:''Bacterial infections'':'' Less common causes of bacterial infections that cause sore throats include:''Rarely, ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs''), for example, ''gonorrhea'' and ''chlamydia'', can cause a sore throat.''Toxins/Irritants:'' Many substances can cause sore throats, for example:' Viruses that cause the flu (influenza) Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus) Mumps (mumps virus) Croup (parainfluenza virus) Coxsackie A virus (herpangina) Strep throat Peritonsillar abscess Retropharyngeal abscess Diphtheria Epiglottitis Tonsillitis Cigarette smoke Air pollution Noxious airborne chemicals Medical conditions: Health problems, can cause sore throats, for example:Postnasal dripAllergiesCoughGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)Tumors Postnasal drip Allergies Cough Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Tumors Intentional or unintentional ingestion: Certain substances, for example, bleach, can cause a sore throat. Trauma/Injury: Any direct injury to the throat or neck area can cause a sore throat. Foreign body : Sore throats can be caused foreign bodies stuck in the throat, for example, a bone or piece of food. Excessive yelling or screaming: The throat and larynx can cause sore throats due to screaming or excessive yelling."
What are the differences between sore throat vs. strep throat?,"'Sore throat is a generic term used to describe the symptom of pain or discomfort in the throat. Usually, bacteria, viruses, trauma, and environmental toxins cause throat pain and its associated symptoms and signs. However, not all cases of sore throat are necessarily ''strep throat''.''Strep throat'' is a bacterial infection of the throat and ''tonsils'' (tonsilitis). ''Strep'' throat is specifically caused by group A ''Streptococcus'' bacteria. Diagnosis of the cause of ''strep'' throat, and the characteristic signs and symptoms, laboratory tests help diagnose the cause of strep throat. Two common tests are used to diagnose the cause of strep throat, the ''rapid strep test'' (RADT) and traditional throat culture.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of a sore throat?,"'The signs and symptoms of a sore throat vary depending on the underlying cause. However, the common symptom of a sore throat is the feeling of throat pain and discomfort, which often is worsened by swallowing or thile talking. Some people may complain of a scratchy or dry sensation in their throat as well.''Most sore throats are caused by viral infections. In addition to throat pain, common signs and symptoms of a sore throat include:''Distinguishing between a sore throat caused by a virus and strep throat can be challenging; however, certain signs and symptoms often can help differentiate between the two. Usually, people with strep throat have signs and symptoms that include red ''swollen tonsils'' with white patches (exudate).''Sore throats cause fever and swollen tender lymph nodes in the neck, ''without the symptoms'' that usually accompany a ''cold'' caused by a virus, for example:''An evaluation with a doctor may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of a sore throat while a throat culture (swab taken from the back of the throat) can definitively diagnose the cause of strep throat.'

"If I am pregnant and have a sore throat, what medications are safe to take?","'If you are pregnant and your sore throat symptoms are severe, talk to your doctor. Home remedies such as ''over-the-counter'' lozenges or saltwater gargles are generally safe. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') can be used for pain or fever. If symptoms last for more than three days, or are associated with a fever see your doctor to be tested for strep throat.' "
Is a sore throat contagious?,"'A sore throat may be ''contagious'', depending on the underlying cause. Most sore throats are caused by infections, and under these circumstances a sore throat can be contagious, whether it is caused by a viral infection (the most common cause) or strep throat. To prevent spreading contagious infections that cause sore throats, preventative measures should be taken to prevent the transmission of the infection.''Most types of these infections are transmitted person-to-person via saliva or nasal secretions commonly spread in airborne respiratory droplets, or through direct contact with infected objects (for example, cups or utensils) and infected surfaces. To stop the spread of infections to others:' Wash your hands fequently Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze Do not sharing utensils and cups"
Is there a test to diagnose the cause of sore throats?,"'To diagnose the cause of a sore throat, the doctor will ask for a detailed history of the illness and perform a physical examination. Because most cases of sore throats are associated with infections, your doctor may order tests to differentiate between a bacterial or viral infection. If your doctor suspects you have strep throat, usually, he or she will take a rapid strep test (swabbing the throat). It takes only minutes for the results, and usually can be obtained during an office visit. A throat culture may be sent to the lab for definitive evaluation of strep throat if the initial rapid strep test is negative. Usually, the results of the culture are available within 24 to 48 hours.''Usually, no further tests are needed, depending on the details of the medical history and the findings on a physical exam. Your doctor may need to order addditional tests to help determine the cause of the sore throat, for example:' Blood tests Radiologic imaging (CT scan or x-ray) of the throat and neck area to evaluate for other various causes of a sore throat (abscess, trauma/injury, tumor, etc). In certain cases, a specialist may be recommended depending on the symptoms and presumptive diagnosis (an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist, for example).."
What natural home remedies relieve sore throat pain and other symptoms?,"'Various home remedies help soothe throat pain and other symptoms of a sore throat.''If a sore throat is caused by infection, it is important to drink plenty of fluids and to rest in order to prevent ''dehydration'' and to allow the body to properly recover.'

What can I do if I keep getting a sore or strep throat?,"'There are a number of situations in which a child or adult can have recurrent positive strep tests.' The first, and most common, is that the strep bacteria were never eradicated in the first place. The person did not get all of the doses of the medication prescribed. Unless the affected person takes a full 5 to 10 day course of antibiotics, the strep throat will not clear. Even missing a dose or two can be a problem. The patient should take all medication exactly as prescribed, and finish all the medication, even if the sore throat has resolved. Individuals may be asymptomatic carriers of strep (a person who has strep in their throats all the time as part of their normal bacteria, but without symptoms of a sore throat). It may be necessary to test close contacts of a person with recurrent episodes of strep to see if they are carriers. All strep throat bacteria will be killed by penicillin. If penicillin does not cure strep throat, the affected person should see their doctor. In rare cases, other bacteria in the throat can secrete an enzyme (penicillinase) that breaks down penicillin. This can be overcome by using a drug that is resistant to this enzyme."
Can antibiotics cure a sore throat?,"""Most cases of sore throat are caused by a viral infection, so antibiotics in these situations are not needed. Antibiotics do not have any effect on a viral infection, as it will need to run its course and your body's natural defenses will typically clear this type of infection.""'However, if your sore throat is being caused by a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, then a course of antibiotics will be required to resolve the infection. Complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed, even if you feel better after a few days.'  "
How can I prevent from getting a sore throat?,"'Often, certain causes of sore throats can be prevented since the most common cause are infections. Whether a sore throat is caused by a viral infection or strep throat, you can help prevent getting or transmitting the infection to others.''Certain measures to help prevent less common causes of sore throats include:' Avoid close contact with people who are already ill with a viral upper respiratory tract infection or with strep throat (and other bacterial infections). Practice good personal hygiene habits, such as frequent and thorough hand washing. Avoid sharing personal objects (such as dishes, cups or utensils). Cover the mouth when coughing or sneezing. Wash the hands often. Avoiding touching potentially infected surfaces (computers, doorknobs, or phones) and direct contact with handkerchiefs, napkins, tissues, or towels used by the person with the infection. Taking antibiotics and finishting the full course to treat and decrease transmission of the bacteria causing the infection. Taking OTC medications to help prevent sore throats if the cause is GERD, allergies, postnasal drip, or cough. Avoid cigarette smoke, pollutants and noxious airborne chemicals. Taking safety measures and using protective sports equipment to help avoid traumatic injury to the neck and throat. Chewing your food carefully in order to prevent injury to the throat from a foreign body (from a fish bone, for example) Avoiding excessive or prolonged yelling."
When should I see a doctor for a sore throat?,"'Sore throat is a common symptom, and the decision to seek medical care can sometimes be difficult. Though many individuals with a sore throat will have a viral illness that will typically run its course and resolve without problems, certain causes of sore throats may require treatment beyond waiting out the illness and treating it with over-the-counter medications. See a doctor if your sore throat continues for an extended period.''If you have these signs or symptoms, make an appointment with doctor or to the nearest emergency department:' Severe sore throat Drooling Difficulty or inability to swallow saliva, food, or liquids Difficulty or inability to open your mouth Difficulty breathing Severe neck pain or neck stiffness Redness or swelling of the neck Bleeding from the throat, or blood in your saliva/phlegm Fever greatern than> 101 F (38.3 C)"
What is pharyngitis?,"'Pharyngitis'' is medical term for a ''sore throat''. Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx (throat) that results in throat discomfort, ''pain'' and/or throat scratchiness; in some individuals it may cause painful swallowing. ''Sore throat'' is usually caused by a viral infection and less commonly, a bacterial infection usually by group A ''streptococci'' (''strep throat''). Other causes of ''sore throat'' include inflammation due to ''allergy'', toxins, or ''cancer''. Some doctors distinguish pharyngitis from ''laryngitis'' and/or ''tonsillitis'', but others do not. ''Laryngitis'' is confined to the larynx (voice box) while tonsillitis is inflammation confined to the ''tonsils''. Since it is not unusual for a pharyngitis to spread to adjacent structures like the ''tonsils'' or larynx, it is not unreasonable to lump these inflammatory diseases together; however, the symptoms are slightly different for each disease.''There are three types of pharyngitis:'   Non-exudative (does not produce fluids like pus; this is the most common form of pharyngitis and usually caused by viruses) Exudative (produces a body fluid like pus; this usually suggest a bacterial cause) Ulcerative (production of small ulcers and/or a grayish membrane on parts of the pharynx). Ulcerative pharyngitis (mainly caused by bacteria) is infrequently seen but is considered to be a medical emergency."
Is a sore throat contagious?,"'Yes, pharyngitis (viral and bacterial) is ''contagious'' and can be transmitted from one person to another. Usually, mucus, nasal discharge and saliva can contain the viruses and/or bacteria that can cause sore throat. Consequently, even kissing can cause transfer of these organisms. Unfortunately, some of these viruses and bacteria that cause sore throat can survive for a period of time on objects like towels, brushes or even clothing, so that contact with these contaminated items can spread the disease.''Sore throat caused by ''allergy'', toxins, ''trauma'' or ''cancers'' are not contagious. The focus of this article will be on sore throat caused by viruses and bacteria since these are the most common causes of sore throat.' "
How will I know if someone has a sore throat?,"'Pharyngitis can cause the pharynx (the throat) tissue to become swollen and reddish. Some people can develop a mild ''fever'' and have some difficulties speaking or swallowing food. ''swollen Lymph nodes'' and tonsils may enlarge and become tender. Those affected may feel excessively tired.''Laboratory studies can detect group A ''streptococci'' (rapid antigen detection). Other diagnostic tests can include throat cultures or the ''mono'' spot test. A health care professional may help you determine the cause of your sore throat. In addition, some doctors use the specific set of criteria (Centor criteria) to determine the likelihood of a person getting ''strep throat'' (''Streptococcal'' pharyngitis).' "
How is sore throat spread?,"""Sore throat is transmitted from one person to another by bacteria or viruses in the infected person's saliva, mucus and/or nasal discharge. People that are not infected just need to come in contact with these substances directly or indirectly by touching contaminated objects such as hairbrushes, towels, or toothbrushes."" "
How will I know if I'm cured of a sore throat?,"'Sore throat caused by viruses is usually contagious as long as symptoms are present. Once the symptoms disappear, the person is usually no longer contagious and is ""cured"" of viral pharyngitis. However, the person may still be susceptible to other types of viruses that can cause pharyngitis. Bacterial pharyngitis usually is also contagious as long as symptoms are present but, in contrast to viral pharyngitis, antibiotics may reduce the time span of infection, and the individual becomes no longer contagious about 24 hours after taking an effective antibiotic.'  "
When should I contact a health care professional about a sore throat?,"'If a person has a sore throat should contact a health care professional if they''Go to an emergency department immediately if a person develops' have a sore throat for more than a week, if they develop a reddish rash, if the lymph nodes are swollen and tender, and/or if the person has a high fever. drooling, shortness of breath, or difficulty in eating or swallowing foods or liquids."
What should you know about sore throat treatments?,"'Various natural ''sore throat'' remedies can be used at home to help soothe ''sore throat'' ''pain'' and other symptoms. Some of these may be familiar, like drinking warm liquids with honey and lemon juice or gargling with salt water, and you may find some new ones too, such as slippery elm leaves and sage. ''Over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications and liquids also help soothe a ''sore throat''.''Sore throats may be caused by viral infections (including the ''common cold''), ''bacterial infections'' (''strep throat'' is a common cause of sore throats), ''tonsillitis'', and even ''pain'' following tonsillectomies (surgical removal of the ''tonsils'').''While this article discusses home remedies that can help with the ''pain'' and symptoms of ''sore throat'', it is important to note that some types of ''sore throat'' (such as ''strep throat'') must be treated with antibiotics to clear the infection and to prevent long-term complications. The remedies discussed in this article are for ''pain'' relief only and will not sure a bacterial infection.'  "
Sage/echinacea throat spray,"'A 2009 study showed an ''echinacea''/sage throat spray was as effective as a spray using typical numbing agents chlorhexidine/''lidocaine'' to relieve throat pain and scratchiness.'  Sage is antibacterial and antiseptic, and echinacea can have immune-boosting effects. Combined, these herbs can make for an effective throat spray that can provide fast pain relief."
Apple cider vinegar,"'Vinegar is acidic and can kill bacteria in the throat, and also coat and soothe a ''sore throat''. It may also loosen ''phlegm'' that may be irritating the throat.'   Use as a gargle - mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar with 8 ounces of water. This also can be combined with 1 teaspoon of salt for a saltwater vinegar gargle (gargling with warm salt-water remedy). You also can add 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with 1 tablespoon of honey to your tea (see gargling with warm water remedy)."
Raw garlic,"'Garlic'' has antiseptic properties, which can help if you have a bacterial infection, and it may help relieve sore throat pain.' When crushed, raw garlic releases a compound called allicin that has antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. The best way to use garlic for sore throats is simply to chew on a raw clove, or take a slice and suck on it for 15 minutes. This may be hard for most people to handle. To make the raw garlic easier to ingest, you can mince it and add some honey or olive oil. Blend some with other veggies and make vegetable juice. Add it to a little salsa. The key is to eat it raw and as soon as possible after crushing for the allicin to be effective."
Throat Coat tea,"'Throat Coat is an herbal tea sold to provide sore throat relief.' Throat Coat herbal tea contains licorice root, elm inner bark, marshmallow root, and licorice root aqueous dry extract and is sold to help relieve sore throat. A small study showed it helped reduce sore throat pain for 30 minutes after drinking it."
Peppermint essential oil,"'Once again, this is not the candy but the plant. The main component of peppermint is menthol, which acts as a ''decongestant'' by thinning ''mucus''.'  Peppermint may soothe a sore throat and ease a dry cough. Drink peppermint tea, or add some peppermint oil to a diffuser, or rub some peppermint essential oil on the chest (it may need to be diluted if the oil is strong)."
Licorice,"'Sorry kids, not the candy, but the herb. A 2009 study in the journal ''Anesthesia & Analgesia'' found a licorice gargle helped reduce postoperative sore throat pain.' In addition to soothing a sore throat, it is believed that licorice root may also help loosen congestion and reduce inflammation, which can also help you feel better. You can gargle with it, chew a piece of licorice root, or drink licorice tea."
Marshmallow root,"'This also is not the confection, but the herb. Like slippery elm, marshmallow root is a demulcent, and marshmallow root can soothe a sore throat by coating the irritated tissues of the throat.' It may also loosen mucus and help with cough that may accompany or aggravate a sore throat. Marshmallow root may be taken as a tea."
Slippery elm,"'Also known as Indian elm, moose elm, and sweet elm, slippery elm is believed to help coat the throat. It is considered a demulcent, which means it can help relieve irritation of the mucous membranes in the mouth by forming a protective film.' Slippery elm can be particularly effective when used in a lozenge as it can help prolong the pain-relieving effects. It may also be taken as a tea."
Frozen foods,"'Eating frozen foods such as popsicles or sorbet can help alleviate sore throat symptoms.' The cold temperatures can help ease the pain of a sore throat quickly, and many of these frozen foods are softer and easier to swallow. Non-dairy frozen items are preferred because in some individuals dairy products can more mucous, which can further irritate the throat. If dairy products do not irritate your throat, try low-fat ice cream, without added chips, nuts, or chunks that could scratch and irritate your sore throat."
Honey,"'Honey may be added to hot water or tea and lemon juice to help sooth a sore throat.' Honey has some antibacterial properties and may help ease sore throat due to infection. There are also studies that show it may help ease a cough, which can contribute to sore throat pain. Do not give honey to children and toddlers under 1 year of age, as it may be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum spores that may cause infantile botulism."
Eat chicken soup,"""Grandma was right on this one! It's warm and helps moisten the throat."" Just like drinking hot tea, hot soup can be soothing on a sore throat and can help thin sinus mucus. It also helps keep you hydrated (but stick with low sodium soups) and according to a study in the Chest Journal, it may even contain anti-inflammatory substances that could help reduce cold symptoms."
Warm saltwater gargle,"""Rinse the mouth with a warm saltwater gargle (1 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of water) and then spit it out. Don't swallow the salt, and don't use too much salt, as this could further dry out the sensitive throat membranes. Gargling with saltwater is an easy and economical way to help cleanse the throat and loosen phlegm."" Gargle frequently to relieve symptoms of throat irritation caused by postnasal drip. A 2005 study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that gargling with saltwater may even help prevent upper respiratory tract infections."
Cayenne pepper gargle,"'This home remedy has become popular recently. Cayenne pepper contains capsaicin, which has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.' The claim is that mixing ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper with 1 cup of water and gargling with it can help reduce inflammation and clear the infection of a sore throat. It takes several days of use to see improvement. It can sting and burn the mouth and throat. Do not use a cayenne pepper gargle if there are open sores in the throat."
Drink warm liquids," Drinking warm liquids such as caffeine-free tea with lemon juice and honey, warm water with lemon and honey, or warm soup broth can be soothing on a sore throat. Hot fluids also help thin sinus mucus, which allows for better drainage and decreased stuffiness, according to the American Osteopathic Association. Warm beverages also help keep you hydrated, which is important when you are feeling sick. Chamomile tea can also be relaxing and help you rest."
Suck on ice chips,"'Sucking on ice chips can help cool the throat, easing pain and inflammation.' When the ice melts it helps hydrate you, which can also reduce congestion and keep the throat moist."
Acupuncture,"'Acupuncture'' may help relieve sore throat pain; however, studies have shown mixed results. Practitioners claim there is a ""sore throat"" ''acupuncture'' point found on the hand that can provide fast relief from sore throat pain.''Before using any herbal or alternative natural remedies, consult your doctor as some ''supplements'"" can interact with prescription medications. Ask your child's pediatrician what home remedies and natural remedies are effective for ""'babies'' and toddlers, and women who are ''pregnant'' should talk to their obstetricians about the best choices to use during ''pregnancy''.' "
Zinc lozenges,"'Studies have shown that zinc lozenges may shorten the duration of a cold, and may reduce the severity of cold symptoms including sore throat.' Be careful if using zinc nasal sprays or gels. There are some reports of loss of smell with the use of zinc sprays or gels. Use for less than five days is usually safe and may shorten the duration of a cold. Also, like regular lozenges, zinc lozenges can help keep the throat moist, which may alleviate soreness. Young children should not be given lozenges."
Drink plenty of fluids,"'Stay hydrated! When you are sick with a sore throat, staying hydrated can help ease congestion, thin mucus secretions, and keep the throat moist.' Moreover, if your sore throat is accompanied by a fever, you may become dehydrated so you need to replenish lost fluids. Cold ice water can help soothe the throat, as can hot beverages. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks such as coffee or colas, because they can dehydrate you."
Rest,'Sleep'' is important in the recovery process.' Getting a good night's sleep helps the body's immune system fight off viruses and bacteria that can cause a sore throat. Rest also applies to the voice. Don't speak if unless it's necessary. Use texting or email to communicate until the throat feels better.
Lozenges or cough drops,"'Suck on lozenges or ''cough'' drops to keep the throat moist. Some brands have topical anesthetics, which will ease throat pain at least temporarily and last longer than sprays.' Lozenges with menthol also can feel refreshing and ease sore throat symptoms. Young children and toddlers should not be given lozenges as they can be a choking hazard."
Hard candy,"'Like lozenges or cough drops, hard candies can help because they stimulate the production of saliva and help keep the throat moist and lubricated, which can ease the soreness from a dry sore throat.' Hard candies are often preferred for children 5 years and older and adolescents. They can be as effective as medicated lozenges and sprays, and are less likely to have unwanted side effects. Moreover, like lozenges or cough drops, do not give young children or toddlers hard candies, as they can be a choking hazard."
Throat spray,"'Use throat spray with anesthetic to help relieve symptoms fast.' The most commonly used anesthetics in the over-the-counter throat sprays are phenol and benzocaine, which work by numbing the throat. These sprays won't cure a sore throat or shorten the duration of a cold, but they may provide instant temporary relief from sore throat pain."
A humidifier,"'Use a humidifier to moisten dry air and keep your throat moist, or lean over the sink with hot ''running'' water and drape a towel over your head and inhale.''A warm mist humidifier heats the water inside the unit and releases steam into the air. This type of humidifier is helpful in cold weather, and because it uses boiling water, it can help kill airborne bacteria. A cool mist humidifier can help cool the room and is a good option if you have children or pets, so there is no risk of accidental ''burns''.' You also can take a long, steamy shower. The moist air can help soothe your swollen sore throat, and may help if you are hoarse. Moist air also can help keep the nasal secretions from drying out, which can be uncomfortable. Humidifiers are good to use when babies and toddlers have dry sore throats, to help keep their throats moist. However, make sure you clean the humidifier and put fresh water in it regularly, so it does not become a breeding ground for more bacteria."
A warm compress,"'Use a warm compress on the neck. Keeping the throat warm may help soothe tender ''lymph nodes''.' You can use a warm heating pad or hot water bottle, or make your own warm compress by wetting a towel with hot water (wring the excess water out before placing on your neck)."
Quit smoking,"'If you smoke, there are plenty of reasons to quit, including easing a sore throat. Inhaling smoke from cigarettes, cigars, or pipes can cause a dry, irritated, and swollen throat, in addition to a cough, which can also irritate the throat.' The chemicals from the smoke irritate the tissues, and the heat generated by these smoked tobacco products also leads to a sore throat. Secondhand smoke also can cause a sore throat, so avoid being around anyone who is smoking if you have a sore throat."
Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications for sore throat pain,"'OTC pain medications such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'' or ''Motrin'') or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') can help relieve the pain and inflammation caused by a sore throat.' They may also help reduce an accompanying fever if the sore throat is caused by an infection such as strep throat. Note: Do not give aspirin to children because of its link to Reye's syndrome, a disorder that can cause brain damage and death."
What is a sore throat?,"'A ''sore throat'' is irritation and scratchiness in the throat accompanied by ''pain'' that often worsens with swallowing. A ''sore throat'' is often the first warning sign of an infection. The most common cause of a ''sore throat'' is a viral infection. Rarely, a bacterial infection can cause a sore throat. A sudden, severe sore throat without ''coughing'', ''sneezing'', or other ''cold'' symptoms may be an indication of a bacterial infection, usually caused by ''Streptococcus'' bacteria. Hence, it is called a ''strep throat''.' "
What are different types of sore throat?,"'Sore throats may be divided into three types based on the part of the throat they affect' Pharyngitis: It affects the area right behind the mouth. Tonsillitis: Swelling and redness of the tonsils, the soft tissue in the back of the mouth. Sometimes, white patches or areas of pus will form on the tonsils. These white patches are more common in strep throat than in a sore throat caused by a virus. Laryngitis: Swelling and redness of the voice box or larynx."
What are the common causes of a sore throat?,"'Causes of sore throats range from infections to injuries. Below are the most common causes of a sore throat' Viral infection: Viruses cause about 90% of sore throats. Common cold and influenza are the most common viral infections that may cause a sore throat.  Bacterial infection: A Streptococcus bacterium is the most common cause of a sore throat due to a bacterial infection. Strep throat causes nearly 40% of sore throat cases in children. Tonsillitis and sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia can also cause a sore throat. Allergies: Usually, the immune system reacts to allergy triggers such as pollen, grass and pet dander. It releases chemicals that cause symptoms such as nasal congestion, watery eyes, sneezing and throat irritation. Excess mucus in the nose can drip down the back of the throat. This is called postnasal drip and can irritate the throat. Injury: Any injury, such as a hit or cut to the neck, can cause pain in the throat. Getting a piece of food stuck in your throat can also irritate it. Repeated use strains the vocal cords and muscles in the throat. A person can get a sore throat after yelling, talking loudly or singing for a long period of time. Tumor: A tumor of the throat, voice box or tongue may cause a sore throat. When a sore throat is a sign of cancer, it doesn’t go away after a few days. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): It is a condition in which acid from the stomach backs up into the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to stomach). The acid burns the esophagus and throat and may sometimes cause a sore throat. Dry air: Dry air can suck moisture from the mouth and throat and leave them feeling dry and scratchy. The air is most likely dry in winter when the heater is running. Smoke, chemicals and other irritants: Many different chemicals and substances in the environment irritate the throat, including cigarette and other tobacco smoke, air or traffic pollution, cleaning products and other chemicals."
Should I take antibiotics for a sore throat?,"'Antibiotics cannot treat a sore throat if it is caused by a viral infection. Viruses cause about 90% of sore throats; hence, antibiotics should not be used immediately as treatment for a sore throat. Antibiotics may also cause side effects such as ''diarrhea'', ''vomiting'' and skin ''rashes''. Sore throats caused by a viral infection usually go away on their own in four to five days. Excessive antibiotic use may also render the antibiotic ineffective when it is needed.''A doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as ''penicillin'' if a sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection. However, a ''strep'' throat goes away in three to seven days with or without antibiotics.\xa0''Antibiotics may not make a person better faster. It lowers the risk of a bacterial infection spreading to another individual or other parts of the body such as the ears and sinuses. They may also prevent serious but rare problems such as ''rheumatic fever'' in children.' "
How can I treat a sore throat without antibiotics?,"'A sore throat usually lasts less than a week. If a sore throat lasts more than four days, medical attention may be required. Below are few remedies to soothe the throat' Suck on lozenges (only in children older than two years old). Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer. Gargle with warm salt water. Drink warm beverages and plenty of fluids. Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least one year of age or older. Get plenty of rest. Take over-the-counter medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve pain and reduce fever."
What are canker sores?,"'Canker sores'' (aphthous ulcers or aphthous stomatitis) are small, painful ulcers inside the mouth. They may occur on the tongue and on the inside linings of the cheeks, lips, and throat. They usually appear white, gray, or yellow in color, with a red border.''Canker sores are among the most common types of oral lesions, affecting about 20% of people. Women get canker sores more often than men. ''Canker sore'' susceptibility may be ''inherited'', and the condition can run in families.' "
"What are canker sores types, and what do they look like?","'Canker sores are not the same as ''cold sores'' (''fever blisters''), which are an infection caused by the ''herpes'' virus and are ''contagious''. ''Canker sores are not contagious,'' and are categorized into three types:'   Minor sores measure from 3 to 10 millimeters (mm) and are the most common type of canker sore. Lesions last 10 to 14 days and heal without scarring. Major sores are larger and deeper than minor sores, have an irregular border and a diameter of greater than 10 mm. Major canker sores may take weeks to months to heal and can leave a scar after healing. Herpetiform sores are characterized by large groups of multiple sores. These are small ulcers (2-3 mm) but there may be as many as 100 ulcers present at the same time. They tend to heal without scarring."
What causes canker sores?,"'The cause of most canker sores is not well understood, and multiple factors may cause sores to appear. Some possible causes of canker sores include the following:' Injury to the mouth may cause simple canker sores. Injury could be from vigorous tooth brushing, dental work, braces or dentures, or a sports accident. Acidic foods, including citrus fruits, may trigger a canker sore or make it worse. Food sensitivities or allergies (anything from highly acidic foods to chocolate and coffee) Diets low in vitamins B12, zinc, folate (folic acid), or iron Toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulfate Allergy to certain bacteria in the mouth Hormones Emotional stress Smoking Gastrointestinal tract diseases such as Celiac disease or Crohn's disease Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or Behçet's disease Other immune system weakness such as a cold or the flu, HIV/AIDS, or an organ transplant Systemic conditions such as Crohn's disease or nutritional deficiencies Oral cancer Certain drugs may cause canker sores, including:AspirinNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)Beta-blockersOral nicotineChemotherapy medicinesImmunosuppressantsPenicillamineSulfa drugsPhenytoinAnticholinergic bronchodilatorsPlatelet aggregation inhibitorsVasodilatorsProtease inhibitorsAntibioticsAntiretroviralsAntihypertensives Aspirin Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Beta-blockers Oral nicotine Chemotherapy medicines Immunosuppressants Penicillamine Sulfa drugs Phenytoin Anticholinergic bronchodilators Platelet aggregation inhibitors Vasodilators Protease inhibitors Antibiotics Antiretrovirals Antihypertensives"
Are canker sores the same thing as cold sores (fever blisters)?,"'No, canker sores are not the same thing as ''fever blisters'' (''cold sores'').''Canker sores occur inside the mouth and are not contagious''. ''Fever blisters'' are infections caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), they mostly occur on the lips and outside of the mouth, and they are very contagious.' "
What are signs and symptoms of canker sores?,"'Canker sores are painful sores inside the mouth. They may occur on the tongue, the lining of the cheeks, the gums, the inside of the lips, or the soft palate on the back of the roof of your mouth.

What natural or home remedies cure canker sores?,"'In most cases, canker sores do not require any treatment, and there is nothing specific you need to do to get rid of a canker sore because it usually will heal on its own. Home remedies can be used to help relieve pain and inflammation of canker sores.''If a you already have a canker sore, there are home remedies that can be used to help relieve the pain or irritation caused by the sore and to speed healing:''Consult a health care professional before using any home remedy as many have not been scientifically tested or proven effective.'   Topical medications applied directly on the sore, mouthwashes, and oral medications can relieve pain or inflammation. Allow ice chips to dissolve slowly in your moth for relief of pain. Avoid acidic foods such as citrus fruits or spicy foods that may aggravate the sore. If there is any vitamin deficiency (a doctor can test for this), take supplementation as prescribed. Brush teeth gently and use a brush with soft bristles. Use toothpaste and mouthwash that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate. Another home remedy is to mix milk of magnesia with Benadryl liquid and use as a mouth rinse. You can also dab milk of magnesia directly onto the canker sore with a cotton swab. Rinse your mouth with a salt water or baking soda rinse. Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda per ½ cup water, and rinse. Other natural remedies include goldenseal mouth rinse, deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) gargled in warm water, and saltwater rinses. Zinc lozenges may help provide relief and speed healing time. Do not give lozenges to young children, as they may be a choking risk. Vitamin C, vitamin B complex, and lysine can be taken orally when lesions first appear and may help speed healing. Infuse sage and chamomile herbs in water and use as a mouthwash four to six times daily. The herb Echinacea may help speed healing Carrot, celery, and cantaloupe juices may also be helpful."
What topical prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications cure canker sores?,"'Topical gels or ointments are used for canker sores to relieve pain, decrease inflammation, and prevent infection.'   Topical pain medications: Gels such as benzocaine (Orajel, Orabase) and lidocaine (an anesthetic) are used directly on the canker sore to relieve pain or discomfort. Canker sore patches (Canker Cover) provide pain relief while covering and protecting the sore as it heals. These types of medications can be found over the counter.Topical anti-inflammatory medications: Steroid medications such as triamcinolone acetonide or fluocinonide can be used topically to decrease inflammation from canker sores. These medications usually require a prescription and should be used exactly as your doctor or other health care professional has instructed. Topical antibiotics: These medications may be prescribed by your doctor or dentist if there is a possibility of the canker sore becoming infected with bacteria. Redness, crusting, pus discharge, or fever are signs of infection."
What mouthwash solutions be used to treat and cure canker sores?,"'Several mouthwash solutions may be used to treat canker sore symptoms, and include:' Diphenhydramine suspension (Benadryl Allergy liquid) is available over the counter and can be used as a mouth rinse because it has topical anesthetic effects on the tissue of the mouth and the canker sore. Put the suspension in your mouth, swish it around for 30 seconds to one minute, and spit it out. Do not swallow the rinse. Anti-inflammatory steroid mouth rinses may be prescribed to help reduce inflammation of the sores. Tetracycline antibiotic rinses may be prescribed and have been shown to relieve the pain and promote healing of canker sores. Do not use tetracycline if you are pregnant, people allergic to tetracycline, or if the person with the canker sore is a child under 16 years of age."
What oral medications are available to cure canker sores?,"'Several oral medications may help relieve symptoms of canker sores.'

What should a person do if they get recurrent or chronic canker sores?," If a person suffers from frequent canker sores, there may be an underlying medical reason or illness that causes them. See a health care professional or dentist if there are any concerns that canker sores are frequent. Predisposition to canker sores may just be genetic. However, some diseases that affect the immune system such as lupus, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, or HIV/AIDS may cause frequent or recurrent canker sores. Health care professionals can order tests to determine if there is an underlying medical reason for a person's frequent canker sores."
What are canker sores?,"'Canker sores'' are small painful ulcers in the mucous membranes that form the inner lining of the mouth. The cause of ''canker sores'' is unclear; no viral or bacterial cause has been proven. Researchers think that they occur or are triggered to occur in individuals when a certain set of circumstances arise such as''Canker sores'' can recur. ''Canker sores'' are sometimes confused with ''cold sores'', but ''cold sores'' are due to ''herpes'' ''viruses'' and are ''contagious'', while canker sores are not ''contagious'' and usually do not involve the lips.''Canker sores also are referred to as' emotional stress, hormonal changes, allergies, certain diseases (including Crohn's disease and celiac disease), a lack of certain nutrients and vitamins, sensitivity to certain chemicals in foods or drinks, or even minor trauma while tooth brushing or other minor mouth trauma. aphthous ulcers, aphthous stomatitis, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, and ulcerative stomatitis."
Are canker sores contagious?,"'Canker sores are not contagious. There is no person-to-person spread. Canker sores seem to develop in an individual when certain triggers occur (such as hormonal shifts, ''stress'' or exposure to certain foods or chemicals). Individuals that develop canker sores may not have the same triggers that cause canker sores to develop in other people.' "
What are the canker sore symptoms?,"'Shallow painful ulcers with a reddish border are characteristic of canker sores. They may appear on the soft palate, tonsil areas, tongue, and gums of the mouth. There are three types of canker sores: minor, major, and herpetiform.' Minor canker sores are usually smaller than 1 cm in diameter and account for about 80% of all canker sores. Major canker sores are greater than 1 cm in diameter, usually have irregular borders, and when they heal, the ulcers can leave scars and even distort the shape of the mucosal surface. Herpetiform canker sores are small - no larger than 1 mm - and usually occur in clusters (about 10–100 ulcers). Herpetiform canker sores are poorly named as they do not contain herpes viruses."
How do canker sores spread?,'Canker sores do not spread from person-to-person. Canker sores are recurrent and may seem to spread in an individual if the mechanisms that trigger ''canker sore'' development recurs frequently in an individual.' 
How do you get rid of canker sores?,"'There is no known cure for canker sores. There is only treatment for the painful symptoms. However, most minor ''canker sore'' problems last about 7 to 10 days while major canker sores may last weeks to months and may cause ''scars''.' "
When should I contact a doctor about canker sores?,"'Most minor canker sores do not require a doctor to treat them. However large canker sores (major canker sores) should be seen by a health-care professional. In addition, rapidly reoccurring sores (new canker sores occurring before older sores heal), sores that persist longer than two weeks, sores that cause problems with either eating or drinking, and sores associated with high ''fevers'' should be seen urgently by a physician.' "
What is IBS?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the presence of a cluster of symptoms and signs in adults or children that include cramping, ''abdominal pain'', increased gas, altered bowel habits, food intolerance, and bloating (distention).''Irritable bowel'' syndrome is a ""functional"" disorder. This term refers to the changes in the functioning of the ''digestive system'' that results in the collection of symptoms referred to as IBS, meaning that it is a problem with the movement (motility) rather than any damage to the tissues of the digestive system.''In the past, ''irritable bowel'' syndrome was also called spastic colon or bowel, functional bowel disease, mucous ''colitis'', or nervous colon.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of IBS?,"'Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized mostly by abdominal ''pain'' and cramping. Other symptoms and signs include:''While not technically a symptom, nearly 70% of people with IBS also experience ''indigestion''.''Symptoms are often relieved by bowel movements. Women with IBS may have more symptoms during their menstrual periods.'   Diarrhea: IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) can come with sudden urges to have bowel movements and loose stools. Constipation: IBS with constipation (IBS-C) can be accompanied by straining during bowel movements and infrequent stools. Increased gas Abdominal swelling or bloating Abdominal pain or discomfort Cramping pain after eating certain foods Nausea Mucousy or foamy stool Unexplained weight loss Loss of appetite"
What causes IBS?,"'The exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome is unknown. It is believed to be due to a number of factors, including alteration in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract motility, abnormal nervous system signals, increased sensitivity to pain, and food intolerances. The following are risk factors thought to cause IBS:' Abnormal movements of the colon and small intestines (too fast or slow, or too strong) Hypersensitivity to pain from a full bowel or gas Food sensitivities, possibly caused by poor absorption of sugars or acids in food Gastroenteritis (""stomach flu"" or ""stomach bug""), a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and intestines, may trigger IBS symptoms Psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression are observed in many people with IBS, though these conditions have not been found to be a direct cause of IBS. Reproductive hormones or neurotransmitters may be off-balance in people with IBS. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) Genetics is thought to be a possible cause of IBS, but so far, this hereditary link has not been proven."
Is there an IBS diet? What foods trigger IBS?,"'What you eat and how you eat can affect symptom of this condition. While it may not be possible to completely prevent IBS symptoms, you may find that certain foods trigger IBS symptoms. To help figure out which foods cause you symptoms, a doctor may suggest keeping a food diary.''Some foods can help in the ''prevention'' of symptoms.'   Dietary fiber supplements Water Low-fat foods High-carbohydrate foods (such as whole wheat pasta, brown rice, and whole grain breads) Probiotics (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus a and Bifidobacterium) and prebiotics Some people report kefir or Aloe Vera juice helps symptoms. Talk to a doctor about these home remedies. A high-fiber diet may help relieve constipation in some cases of IBS, but it may also worsen some symptoms such as bloating and gas. The current recommended daily fiber intake is 20-35 grams daily. Most people fall short of this daily fiber intake and can benefit from a small increase in fiber, but it is best to increase the amount in your diet slowly to reduce gas. Dairy products, including milk and cheese (Lactose intolerance symptoms can be similar to IBS symptoms.) Certain vegetables that increase gas (such as cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts) and legumes (such as beans) Fatty or fried foods Alcohol, caffeine, or soda Foods high in sugars Artificial sweeteners Chewing gum Nuts"
What is a low FODMAP diet?,"'A ''low FODMAP diet'' may also help relieve ''symptoms of IBS''. ''FODMAP'' refers to a group of short-chain carbohydrates (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) that are not well absorbed in the small intestine and are rapidly fermented by bacteria in the gut. These bacteria produce gas, which can contribute to IBS symptoms.''The lists of foods both high and low in ''FODMAPs'' are extensive. The International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, Inc. (IFFGD) has suggestions of foods to eat and foods to avoid if you follow the FODMAP diet for IBS. Talk to your doctor for more information.' "
What are IBS-D (IBS with diarrhea) and IBS-C (IBS with constipation)?, IBS-D stands for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. The most common symptoms of IBS-D include:Frequent stoolsFeeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movementsNausea.People with IBS-D also may experience signs and symptoms of:GasAbdominal pain or discomfortSudden urges to have a bowel movementLoose stools Frequent stools Feeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movements Nausea. People with IBS-D also may experience signs and symptoms of:GasAbdominal pain or discomfortSudden urges to have a bowel movementLoose stools Gas Abdominal pain or discomfort Sudden urges to have a bowel movement Loose stools IBS-C stands for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. The most common symptoms of IBS-C include:Infrequent stoolsStraining during bowel movementsFeeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movementsFeeling as if you need to have a bowel movement but are unableAbdominal painBloatingGas Infrequent stools Straining during bowel movements Feeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movements Feeling as if you need to have a bowel movement but are unable Abdominal pain Bloating Gas
IBS vs. IBD are the same bowel disease?,"'While both irritable bowel syndrome and ''inflammatory bowel disease'' can have similar symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and urgent bowel movements; however, IBS is not the same as ''IBD''.' IBD is a group of separate diseases that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and is a more severe condition. Irritable bowel syndrome is considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder because there is abnormal bowel function. IBS is a group of symptoms and not a disease in itself, which is why it’s called a ‘syndrome,’ and it is considered less serious than IBD. Irritable bowel syndrome does not cause inflammation like inflammatory bowel disease, and it does not result in permanent damage to the intestines, intestinal bleeding, rectal bleeding, ulcers, or the harmful complications that are often seen with IBD."
IBS vs. SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)? Are they the same disease?,"'Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is considered one of the factors that may produce signs and ''symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome'' (IBS). The medical data from studies done on SIBO are conflicting.''Some studies show an increase in gas production by intestinal bacteria as a cause of the pain and bloating associated with IBS. However, other studies done to determine if SIBO is the cause of IBS and if antibiotic treatment of SIBO is helpful in reducing or eliminating IBS symptoms have not been conclusive.' "
How is IBS diagnosed?,"'Irritable bowel syndrome is diagnosed by excluding other GI disorders that can cause similar symptoms. A complete history and physical is taken to determine the duration and frequency of symptoms. To be diagnosed with the condition, the duration of symptoms should be at least six months and should occur at least three times a month.''A doctor may order tests, including blood tests, ''stool'' tests, ''X-rays'', or ''CT scans''. There is no specific finding on these tests that can confirm the diagnosis of IBS, however, other problems can be ruled out by performing them.''Two relatively new blood tests may help diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. One test is for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), and the other is for irritable bowel syndrome with both diarrhea and constipation (irritable bowel syndrome mixed IBS-M). Neither test is able to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).''Both blood tests are for anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies. It is thought that these antibodies develop in some patients after an acute bout of gastroenteritis that is caused by several different, common types of bacteria. The overgrowth of these bacteria in the gut may trigger an immune attack on the patients’ own intestinal tissues (autoimmunity) with the ensuing inflammation and damage to the tissues causing the symptoms of IBS.''The tests may help distinguish between irritable bowel syndrome and ''inflammatory bowel disease'"" or IBD, a different type of intestinal inflammatory disease that includes Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''.''The antibody tests seems to be useful in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea IBS-D, but not IBS with constipation (IBS-C). The tests also appear to be specific, and if the antibodies are present, it is highly likely that IBS is present. However, the tests are insensitive, meaning if the antibodies are not present, the patient still may have IBS. Thus, these irritable bowel syndrome tests may be identifying only a subset of patients with IBS, those with post-infectious IBS. Both IBS blood tests have not undergone rigorous testing, and have not yet been approved by the FDA. It is expected to be an expensive test costing $500 to over $1,000.''A doctor also may send the patient to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the digestive system). Depending on the symptoms, an ''upper endoscopy'' and/or ''colonoscopy'' may be performed.'  "
What is the treatment for IBS?,"'Dietary modifications are the first treatments that should be tried to treat IBS. There are several types of foods in particular that often trigger characteristic symptoms and signs.''If dietary modifications and lifestyle changes do not adequately treat the symptoms and signs, a doctor may recommend medical therapies.'  "
What medications are used in the treat and manage IBS-D and IBS-D?,"   Antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide (Imodium), attapulgite (Kaopectate), and diphenoxylate and atropine (Lomotil) can be helpful if loose stools are one of the main signs. Eluxadoline (Viberzi) is a prescription for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). For females with IBS who experience severe diarrhea, alosetron (Lotronex) has been used. Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and IBS-related bloating. Bile acid binders including cholestyramine ( (Prevalite), colestipol (Colestid), or colesevelam (Welchol) can help some patients with IBS-D, but can also cause bloating. Over-the-counter laxatives such as polyethylene glycol 3350 ( (MiraLax), bisacodyl (Dulcolax), and psyllium seed husks (Metamucil) can help relieve constipation and keep bowel movements regular. Senna laxatives (Senokot, Ex-Lax Gentle Nature) may be taken short-term. Prescription laxatives such as lactulose (Constulose) may also be prescribed. Two drugs specifically used to treat IBS are lubiprostone (Amitiza), a laxative, and linaclotide (Linzess), a constipation medication. SSRI antidepressants fluoxetine (Prozac), citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), and escitalopram (Lexapro) may be helpful for those with constipation (IBS-C), but they can trigger IBS attacks in patients with diarrhea (IBS-D)."
What other drugs are used in the treatment of IBS symptoms and signs?," Antidepressants in low doses, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help relieve symptoms associated with IBS. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) and magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia). Antibiotics may be used when small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is suspected. Antianxiety medications such as diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and clonazepam (Klonopin) are occasionally prescribed short-term for people whose anxiety worsens their irritable bowel syndrome symptoms."
What medications treat IBS pain and cramping?," Antispasmodics, such as metoclopramide (Reglan), dicyclomine (Bentyl), and hyoscyamine (Levsin), decrease symptoms of pain and cramping. Antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil, Paregoric), doxepin ( (Silenor), desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Pamelor), and imipramine (Tofranil) may help with abdominal pain but due to side effects are usually reserved for severe cases."
What natural and home remedies or other lifestyle changes help IBS symptoms?,"'Some lifestyle changes that can also help relieve symptoms are:' Eat smaller, more frequent meals Quit smoking Exercise regularly Take probiotics Avoid caffeine Use stress management and relaxation techniques Mindfulness training Gut-directed hypnosis Biofeedback Pain-management techniques Cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy Regular exercise such as walking or yoga Get an adequate amount of sleep Try ginger or peppermint, which may help digestion Avoid laxatives unless prescribed by your health-care professional"
What are the complications of IBS?,"'In general, there are few complications associated with this functional disease other than the symptoms of the disease itself. If someone has ''hemorrhoids'', the diarrhea and constipation associated with IBS may irritate them. Moreover, a diet that is too strict limits nutrients that could cause problems related to lack of proper ''nutrition''.''The biggest complication of IBS may be on the quality of life. The ''stress'' and ''anxiety'' as well as the impact on daily activities the condition can cause may be troublesome for patients.''Irritable bowel syndrome does not lead to;' colon cancer, rectal bleeding, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis or UC."
Is there a cure for IBS?,"'There is no known cure for IBS, but there are many treatment options to reduce or eliminate symptoms. Good communication with a doctor is important to help manage this condition.' "
What is the prognosis for IBS? ,"""Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic disease with symptoms that tend to come and go. The overall prognosis for patients with IBS depends on the severity and frequency of symptoms, and the patient's ability to control these symptoms, whether by diet, lifestyle changes, or medications."" "
Can IBS be prevented?,"'It may not be possible to prevent developing IBS, but you can take steps to prevent symptoms for occurring or worsening. As discussed earlier, dietary and lifestyle changes can help you manage symptoms. To identify food triggers, your doctor may suggest that you keep a food diary and avoid foods that cause symptoms. Manage ''stress'' and ''anxiety'', and try cognitive therapy or psychotherapy if needed.' "
Which types of doctors treat IBS?,"""A primary-care provider or family-medicine specialist or a child's pediatrician may first diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. You will likely be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in disorders of the digestive system) for further treatment."" "
What are barrier methods of birth control (contraception)?,"'Barrier methods of contraception work by creating a physical barrier between sperm and egg cells so that fertilization cannot occur. The most common forms of barrier contraception are:''Spermicides, a form of chemical contraceptive that work by killing sperm, are often combined with barrier methods of contraception for greater effectiveness.''Barrier methods of contraception generally do not have the side effects of hormonal contraceptives, and some forms of barrier contraception (contraceptive sponges and condoms) may be obtained without a prescription and easily purchased over the counter at pharmacies.''The only medical contraindication to the use of barrier contraception is ''latex allergy'' (when using latex condoms). However, with the exception of male and female condoms that can provide some protection against infection with sexually-transmitted diseases (''STDs''), most methods of barrier contraception are not effective in preventing STDs.'  condoms (male and female), diaphragm, cervical cap, and contraceptive sponge."
Spermicides,"""During sexual intercourse, hundreds of millions of sperm are normally released into a woman's vagina. The large majority of these sperm die. They die because of the vagina's unfriendly environment, which is acidic, and because the ""'mucus'"" in the cervix above the vagina acts as a selective filter for the sperm. Only about 1% of all the sperm released in an ejaculation successfully pass through the woman's vagina and cervix to reach the uterus (the womb). However, it only takes one sperm to fertilize the ovum (the egg) and to achieve ""'conception''.''Spermicides are a type of contraceptive agent that work by killing sperm.'""Spermicides need to be placed in a woman's vagina prior to intercourse if they are to prevent viable sperm from reaching her uterus. Spermicides come in a wide variety of forms, including jellies, creams, foams, films, and suppositories. The active ingredient in essentially all spermicides is Nonoxynol-9. This is a detergent-like chemical that kills sperm (i.e. spermicidal).""'Once placed inside the vagina, the spermicide melts into a liquid that coats the vagina in order to provide a chemical barrier between the sperm and the cervix. Spermicidal foams are more effective than creams or jellies. Not only is it possible to achieve a better distribution with foam, but foam adheres better to the vaginal walls and cervix.''Suppositories are solid or semi-solid inserts which must be inserted in the vagina 15 minutes before intercourse in order to bind with vaginal moisture and liquefy.''Vaginal contraceptive film needs to be in place in the vagina about 5 minutes prior to sexual intercourse in order to liquefy and become effective.'""Spermicides resemble other methods of birth control in that they must be used properly in order to prevent pregnancy. Each type of spermicide has a unique method of use. For example, spermicidal creams, gels, and foams need to be deposited high up in the vagina near the cervix. Spermicidal suppositories must be unwrapped and inserted in the vagina. Squares of spermicidal film should be inserted into the vagina with the user's finger. It is important to follow the package's exact instructions.""""A spermicide should be placed in the vagina prior to the man's penis entering the vagina. It is a common mistake for a couple to wait too long before using the spermicide.""'There are two basic concerns with any given spermicide. 1) How long the spermicide stays in the desired place; and 2) how long the spermicide is active in killing sperm. Therefore, the timing of spermicide use must take into account both of these factors.''In general, spermicides tend to be effective soon after their application. They can be inserted 15 minutes or more before intercourse. However, if there is a significant delay before intercourse (for example an hour), more spermicide must be added.''A fresh application of spermicide must also be used for each act of intercourse.''Douching'' should be avoided for at least 8 hours after the last intercourse.''The effectiveness of spermicides in preventing pregnancy varies from 70 to 90%. This depends on the amount of spermicide and how it is used, the timing of use prior to intercourse, and how well the instructions on the package are followed.''Spermicides should not be used as protection for the woman or man against sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs). While spermicides may be partially protective against certain organisms that cause sexually transmitted infections, (e.g. ''Chlamydia'' and ''gonorrhea''), they also do not protect against the ''human Immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') infection.''The main objection voiced concerning spermicides is that they are ""messy."" A small percent (2% to 4%) of people may have an adverse reaction to Nonoxynol-9, which is experienced as an irritation or a burning sensation within the vagina or on the external genitalia.''Spermicides have some positive features. They are relatively inexpensive and they are available over-the- counter (OTC) without a prescription.''Note that some lubricating jellies available ''over-the-counter'' do not contain spermicide and are not meant to be used as a form of birth control. It is important to check the information on the package to be sure that the product contains spermicide or that the word ""contraceptive"" appears on the label.' "
Male condom,"'Male condoms are far more common than female condoms. A ''male condom'"" is a thin sheath that is worn over the man's penis during sexual intercourse. The ""'condom'' collects sperm so that it is not released into the vagina. Condoms are known as rubbers, sheaths, prophylactics, and many other names.''Condoms are made from a variety of materials including latex, rubber, ''plastic'' polyurethane, and animal tissue. They are also available in a variety of sizes, colors, styles, and thicknesses. They may be dry, lubricated, or treated with a spermicide. Although convenient, a wallet is not the best place to store condoms. Condoms last longer when they are stored under less moist conditions. In general, condoms have a shelf life of about five years if stored unopened in a cool, dry place.'""A condom must be the correct size and fit the man's erect penis properly. There should be 1/2 inch (about 1.25 cm) at the tip of the condom to provide a space for the sperm-filled semen to collect. Some condoms have this feature built in.""'Prior to any contact between the penis and the vagina, the condom is unrolled over the erect penis, ensuring the condom is not turned backwards or inside out. Some condoms come pre-lubricated. If additional lubrication is desired, a water-based product should be used. Spermicides may be used as lubricants with condoms and may thus increase the efficacy of the condom. Oil-based products such as Vaseline, vaginal creams, or mineral oil, may damage the condom and should never be used.''There is an obvious problem of lack of barrier protection if the condom breaks, slips, or comes off the penis. Condoms are quality controlled in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for manufacturing defects that could result in breakage. Condom failure can also be caused by the user and/or his partner. For example, long fingernails or jewelry can tear condoms.''Immediately after ejaculation, the condom should be removed from the vagina. It should be held firmly in place at the base of his penis, as it is withdrawn from the vagina. Care must be taken not to spill any of the ejaculate from the condom.''Each condom must be discarded after a single use. A new condom must be used for the next act of intercourse. Male condoms are not reusable.''Condoms can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. Most of those on the market are made of latex. The estimated effectiveness of the latex condom is 87% to 90% or 10 to 13 ''pregnancies''/100 women per year of sexual activity.''About 1% to 3% of people are ''allergic'' to latex. In such cases, they may be able to use condoms made of polyurethane, a type of plastic, can often be used. However, polyurethane condoms may break more easily than latex condoms and they do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs).''Latex condoms afford the maximum protection against sexually transmitted infections including ''HIV'' (human immunodeficiency virus) and ''herpes'' virus. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), consistent and correct usage of latex condoms:''Animal membrane condoms, made from the ''intestines'' of sheep, when used with contraceptive foam, can be effective in preventing pregnancy, but they may not provide adequate protection against all sexually transmitted infections. This is because the pores in the animal tissue permit small organisms such as ''viruses'' to pass through.''The most frequent complaint lodged regarding condoms is that their usage decreases sexual pleasure for the male. This is an unfortunate attitude because male condoms are an effective, acceptable, inexpensive, and safe method of birth control.' is highly effective in preventing sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. reduces the risk for many STDs that are transmitted by genital fluids (STDs such as Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis). reduces the risk for genital ulcer diseases, such as genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid, only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected. may reduce the risk for genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-associated diseases (for example, genital warts and cervical cancer)."
Female condom,"""The female condom is not well known in the United States. It is essentially a cylindrical vaginal pouch made of soft polyurethane (a type of plastic) with a ring at either end. One end of the pouch is open. The other end is closed. A woman inserts the closed end high up in her vagina over her cervix. The open end remains on the outside of her vagina. The vagina is now lined with the condom. When she has intercourse, the man inserts his penis into the open end of the woman's condom. Once intercourse is over and the man withdraws his penis, the condom containing the semen can now be removed and discarded.""'The female condom can be put in up to 8 hours before intercourse. A significant amount of practice may be necessary before a woman can properly insert and position a female condom. The sides of the internal ring can be folded together and inserted into the vagina much like a diaphragm is inserted. The female condom is thinner than the male condom and is resistant to degradation by oil-based lubricants.''A female condom should never be used when the man is also wearing a condom. The two condoms can stick together and tear, resulting in a total loss of protection.''The female condom (Reality) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993. The Reality Condom is made of polyurethane, but other types of female condoms are available in other areas of the world. Its estimated effectiveness is 85% (15 pregnancies/100 women per year) as compared to 87% to 90% for the male condom.''Problems associated with the female condom include irritation and allergic reactions to the polyurethane. Other concerns are that the female condom is cumbersome, difficult to insert, may not remain in place, and is unattractive. It may also produce unpleasant noises if there is not enough lubrication. For this reason, most female condoms are now generously pre-lubricated with silicone and packets of additional lubricant are included. The lubricant does not contain spermicide.''The female condom (Reality) can be purchased over-the counter (OTC) without a prescription, but it may cost more than a male condom. Package instructions currently advise single use but studies are underway to determine if the female condom can be safely washed and reused up to five times.''The main disadvantage of the female condom is that it is not as effective as its male latex counterpart.''The main disadvantage of the female condom is that it is not as effective as the male latex condom in preventing pregnancy.' "
Contraceptive sponge,"'The contraceptive sponge is a doughnut-shaped ring of polyurethane foam and is impregnated with the spermicide Nonoxynol-9. This chemical confers most of the contraceptive efficacy of this product.''Before intercourse, a woman inserts the sponge high into the vagina in the manner similar to the insertion of a tampon. The spermicidal sponge should then act as a barrier in order to prevent sperm from reaching the cervix. Once in place, the sponge provides protection for up to 24 hours without the need for additional spermicide.''The sponge must remain in the vagina for at least 6 hours following intercourse in order to provide optimum contraception. However, the same sponge should never remain in the vagina for more than a total of 30 hours because of the risk of ''toxic shock syndrome''. (''Toxic shock syndrome'' is an uncommon and potentially very serious illness that is caused by a type of bacteria. This illness occurs when certain types of products, such as tampons,are left in place for excessive periods of time. Package inserts for these products are careful to specify how long they may be safely kept in place. Each sponge is discarded after a single use.''The sponge is generally an effective birth control. Some users of the contraceptive sponge may experience irritation and allergic reactions. The sponge can also be difficult to remove from the vagina. Removal has been made easier by the addition of a woven polyester loop which can be more easily grasped with the fingers.''The estimated contraceptive efficacy of the sponge is estimated to be between 64% and 82%. The spermicide may provide some protection against ''Chlamydia'' and gonorrhea, but otherwise, the degree of this protection is unknown.' "
Diaphragm,"'The diaphragm is a soft, flexible, dome-shaped latex cup which is inserted into the vagina prior to intercourse. The rim of the cup contains a coil spring of metal which serves to hold it in place. The diaphragm blocks access to the cervix so that sperm cannot pass from the vagina into the uterus. The diaphragm must be covered on both sides and especially around its rim with spermicidal jelly, cream, or foam in order to form a tight seal with the vaginal walls.''A woman should insert the diaphragm into her vagina no more than 4 hours prior to intercourse. Following ''coitus'', she should check the diaphragm should be checked to ensure that it was not mechanically dislodged. The diaphragm must be left in place for at least 6-8 hours following intercourse, at which time it should be removed. Additional spermicidal jelly or foam must be inserted into the vagina each act of intercourse.''Since diaphragms are only available with a prescription, a woman must see a health care practitioner to have a diaphragm properly fitted (they come in a range of sizes), and to learn proper insertion techniques. There are no known long-term health risks associated with using the diaphragm and spermicide method of birth control. Some women may find spermicides to be irritating, but changing brands of spermicides may help. There is also an increased risk of ''urinary tract infections'' with diaphragm use. One possible reason is that the diaphragm puts increased pressure on the urethra or the spermicide may contribute to irritation leading to infection. (The cervical cap is not associated with increases in ''urinary tract infections''.)''The diaphragm may be appealing to women because it offers a safe temporary (not permanent) birth control that is under her control.''When the diaphragm and spermicide are used correctly, they are thought to have over an 82% success rate (18 pregnancies/100 women per year). To ensure protection, it is important to check the diaphragm after every use for rips or holes after each usage. This is best accomplished by filling the diaphragm with water and then holding it up to the light to observe for leakage. Also, the fit of the diaphragm should be checked annually, following pregnancy, and after significant ''weight loss''.''Using a diaphragm does not confer protection against sexually transmitted infections, although the spermicide does give partial protection against gonorrhea and Chlamydia. It can, however, be used with condoms in order to confer some protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
Cervical cap,"'The cervical cap is a small (1-1/2 inches or about 3 cm.), thimble-shaped dome made of latex or silicone rubber (it is much smaller than a diaphragm) which fits directly over the cervix. The cervical cap is used in conjunction with a spermicide. One small application of spermicide is placed inside the cap at the time of insertion. The cap plus spermicide prevent sperm from going through the cervix and entering the uterus.''The cervical cap is gently inserted into the vagina and positioned over her cervix. It can be inserted as long as 8 hours prior to intercourse, and can be allowed to remain in place for up to 48 hours. Unlike the diaphragm, fresh spermicidal jelly or foam does not need to be added with each act of intercourse as long as the cervical cap is correctly positioned over the cervix.''As with the diaphragm, a cervical cap requires a prescription. A woman must see a health care practitioner to determine the correct size and to ensure that she understands the proper insertion and removal techniques.''There are no known significant health risks associated with using the cervical cap and spermicide. The cervical cap can be difficult to insert, but it may be helpful for women who are unable to use a diaphragm because of poor muscle tone. Women who suffer from recurring urinary tract infections related to diaphragm usage may also want to elect to try the cervical cap.''It is important to remember that using a cervical cap does not protect from sexually transmitted infections, although spermicides may give some protection against Chlamydia and gonorrhea.''When the cervical cap and spermicide are used properly, they are more than 80% effective in achieving reliable contraception.'

What is spherocytosis?,"'Spherocytosis is the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) that are in the shape of a sphere (spherocytes) instead of the concave disk shape that is normal for red blood cells. These spherocytes are abnormal, fragile and possess a short lifespan as compared to normal red blood cells. The cells tax the ability of the spleen to clear out abnormal red cells and their products, and this can result in an enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and gallbladder disease problems. Spherocytosis can be found in hereditary spherocytosis (HS), and in a few other diseases such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The emphasis of this article is on hereditary spherocytosis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of spherocytosis?,"'The signs and symptoms of spherocytosis include:'  Anemia Paleness (pallor) Jaundice (especially in children) Intermittent jaundice (more often in adults) Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly; a majority of all patients with spherocytosis) Gallstone development (for example, bilirubin stones due to spherocyte lysis) Spherocytes seen in microscopic examination of red blood cells"
What causes spherocytosis?,"'Hereditary spherocytosis is the predominant cause of spherocytosis, and is caused by several genetic mutations that lead to membrane abnormalities of red blood cells. The disease usually is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; although a few people with hereditary spherocytosis may develop it secondary to new mutations. In addition, there is an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance that also may occur in about 20%-25% of all individuals with hereditary spherocytosis.''Spherocytosis may be present in autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which autoantibodies react with red blood cells and cause alterations in their membranes that includes lysis of red blood cells. Spherocytes may develop during this destruction of red blood cells. ' "
What kind of doctor treats spherocytosis?,"'Doctors that treat spherocytosis may include pediatricians, primary care physicians, internists, hematologists, hospitalists, and possibly surgeons (to remove gallbladders and/or spleens). Other doctors on the treatment team may include geneticists and/or immunologists.' "
How is spherocytosis diagnosed?,"'After the doctor takes a history and does a physical exam, the diagnosis of spherocytosis is based upon identifying the abnormal red blood cells under a microscope. Blood tests that often are ordered include:''Other tests may be done to rule in or rule out other diseases (for example, a ''bone marrow biopsy'') that may be a cause of abnormal red blood cells.'

What are the complications of spherocytosis?,"'Folic acid or folate levels may need to be monitored.'  One of the complications spherocytosis is a megaloblastic crisis (production of abnormally large immature and dysfunctional red blood cells). Appropriate folic acid supplementation may prevent this situation. Occasionally the spleen (due to splenomegaly and destruction of partially functioning red blood cells) and the gallbladder (due to repeated gallstone development) may need to be removed as a complication of spherocytosis. Anemia also is a complication of spherocytosis, and blood transfusions may be required. Occasionally, a sudden increase in symptoms termed a crisis may occur due to viral infections or other problems that may influence the bone marrow production of red blood cells."
What is the prognosis for a person with spherocytosis?,"'The prognosis for a person with spherocytosis is good to fair, and most individuals will have a normal life expectancy. Individuals that have the spleen and/or gallbladder removed may have fewer complications develop and have the abnormal red blood cells (spherocytes) survive and function longer, thus requiring fewer transfusions or other interventions.' "
What are other names for spherocytosis?,"'In general, spherocytosis is usually modified by another word; consequently, spherocytosis may be written in the medical literature are:' Hereditary spherocytosis Congenital hemolytic anemia Congenital hemolytic jaundice Chronic familial jaundice Spherocytic anemia Chronic acholuric jaundice"
What is spherocytosis?,"'Spherocytosis is the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) that are in the shape of a sphere (spherocytes) instead of the concave disk shape that is normal for red blood cells. These spherocytes are abnormal, fragile and possess a short lifespan as compared to normal red blood cells. The cells tax the ability of the spleen to clear out abnormal red cells and their products, and this can result in an enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and gallbladder disease problems. Spherocytosis can be found in hereditary spherocytosis (HS), and in a few other diseases such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The emphasis of this article is on hereditary spherocytosis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of spherocytosis?,"'The signs and symptoms of spherocytosis include:'  Anemia Paleness (pallor) Jaundice (especially in children) Intermittent jaundice (more often in adults) Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly; a majority of all patients with spherocytosis) Gallstone development (for example, bilirubin stones due to spherocyte lysis) Spherocytes seen in microscopic examination of red blood cells"
What causes spherocytosis?,"'Hereditary spherocytosis is the predominant cause of spherocytosis, and is caused by several genetic mutations that lead to membrane abnormalities of red blood cells. The disease usually is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; although a few people with hereditary spherocytosis may develop it secondary to new mutations. In addition, there is an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance that also may occur in about 20%-25% of all individuals with hereditary spherocytosis.''Spherocytosis may be present in autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which autoantibodies react with red blood cells and cause alterations in their membranes that includes lysis of red blood cells. Spherocytes may develop during this destruction of red blood cells. ' "
What kind of doctor treats spherocytosis?,"'Doctors that treat spherocytosis may include pediatricians, primary care physicians, internists, hematologists, hospitalists, and possibly surgeons (to remove gallbladders and/or spleens). Other doctors on the treatment team may include geneticists and/or immunologists.' "
How is spherocytosis diagnosed?,"'After the doctor takes a history and does a physical exam, the diagnosis of spherocytosis is based upon identifying the abnormal red blood cells under a microscope.

What should you know about spider bites?,"'Most spiders in the US are harmless. However, black widow and ''brown recluse spider'' bites are dangerous, and sometimes life-threatening. Black widow and brown recluse spider bites need immediate medical treatment.''Spider bites are actually rare occurrences, and most presumed people that have been bitten by spiders are likely due to another condition that mimics the symptoms or signs of a ''spider bite''. Bites from most (non-poisonous) spiders cause local redness, irritation, and ''pain'' that usually can be treated at home.''Black widow spider bite'' symptoms are immediate ''pain'', burning, redness, and swelling. Other signs and symptoms of a ''black widow spider bite'' are a feeling of a pinprick, and sometimes double fang marks on the person where the spider bit. Often, a person does not know that a ''black widow spider'' has bitten them.''Symptoms of a ''brown recluse spider bite'' are a mild sting followed by severe pain and local redness that usually develops within eight hours or more after the bite. Some brown recluse spider bites may include a purple or blue area around the bite, which is surrounded by a whitish ring and a large outer ring in a bull’s eye pattern. A fluid ''blister'' then forms at the spider bite site and then sloughs off revealing a deep ulcer that may turn black. Other signs and symptoms of a black widow or ''brown recluse spider bite'' may include abdominal or ''joint pain'', ''fever'', ''nausea'', and ''headache''.''If you think that, you or someone you know has been bitten by a black widow or brown recluse spider, call 911 or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department for treatment.' "
What are the first signs and symptoms of spider bites that aren't not poisonous?,"   Bites from most (non-poisonous) spiders cause local redness, irritation, and pain that usually can be treated at home using an over-the-counter pain reliever along with application of cooling packs or a wet cloth to relieve swelling. These local reactions usually resolve without treatment over a period of 7-10 days. Rarely, an individual can have an allergic reaction to a spider bite, even to a bite from a non-poisonous spider, but allergic reactions are more likely to be due to contact with a spider than from a spider bite."
What are the signs and symptoms of a black widow spider bites (pictures)?,"   A black widow spider bite is said to feel like a pinprick, although victims may not realize that they have been bitten. Sometimes double fang marks may be seen at the location of the bite. The most common localized symptoms of a black widow spider bite includeimmediate pain,burning,swelling, andredness around the bite. immediate pain, burning, swelling, and redness around the bite."
What are the signs and symptoms of a brown recluse spider bite (pictures)?,"'The bite of a brown recluse spider leads to a mild stinging, followed by local redness and severe pain that usually develops within eight hours but may occur later. Some reports of brown recluse bites describe a blue or purple area around the bite, surrounded by a whitish ring and large red outer ring in a ""bull\'s eye"" pattern. A fluid-filled ''blister forms'' at the site and then sloughs off to reveal a deep ulcer that may turn black.'  "
Can black widow or brown recluse spider bite symptoms be the same?,"'Generalized symptoms of bites from black widow and brown recluse spiders may include:''Rarely, black widow spider bites are fatal; however, a few individuals have died from brown recluse spider bites, which are more common in children than in adults.''If a spider was not observed inflicting the bite, it is difficult if not impossible to determine whether a spider bite occurred, since many conditions of the skin may produce the same symptoms as a spider bite. Streptococcal and Staphylococcal infections, early lesions of ''herpes'' simplex or zoster, ''burns'', stings or bites from other arthropods or insects (including fleas, ''bedbugs'', mosquitos, biting flies, ants, and ''ticks''), thorn injury, and early ''Lyme disease'' all may be characterized by skin findings similar to those from a spider bite.''Spiders rarely bite people, and only if threatened. People often thing they have spider bites when the irritation is from another cause.' Fever Nausea Vomiting Headache Abdominal pain Joint pain or stiffness Feelings of malaise Rash Muscle tension or cramping"
Are spider bites dangerous?,"'Most spiders do not have mouthparts strong enough to penetrate human skin, and the majority of spiders found in the U.S. and are actually harmless. There are two notable exceptions, the black widow spider and the brown recluse spider, which are both dangerous to humans. Spider bites are fortunately uncommon. In many cases, presumed spider bites are actually due to another skin condition or an ''insect sting''.''The black widow and brown recluse spiders are more common in the southern states of the U.S. They prefer warm, dry climates and undisturbed areas such as basements, closets, woodpiles, attics, or under sinks. The black widow spider is a small, black, shiny spider with a red hourglass marking on its belly. The brown recluse spider is sometimes termed a ""violin spider."" It is about an inch long and has a marking resembling a violin on the upper part of its back. Bites from both the black widow and brown recluse spiders are dangerous to humans and require prompt emergency medical care.'  "
What should you do if a spider bites you?," Wash the site of the spider bite well with soap and water. Apply a cool compress or ice pack over the spider bite location. Over-the-counter pain relievers may be used to relieve symptoms. (Remember, not to give aspirin to children; use acetaminophen or ibuprofen instead). Call the doctor or seek emergency treatment if the victim is a young child, if you think the bite may have been from a black widow or brown recluse spider, if any signs of an allergic reaction occur, if the bite area becomes infected, or if the victim develops a rash or severe illness. If possible, retrieve the spider and bring it with you to the health care practitioner so that it can be definitively identified. A tetanus booster shot may be necessary, depending upon the date of the patient's last immunization."
What should you do if a black widow or brown recluse spider bites you?,"   Wash the bite area with soap and water. Elevate the area to prevent spread of the venom. Tie a snug bandage above the area (if on an arm or leg) to further reduce spread of the venom, but do not make the bandage too tight that it impairs the blood circulation. Always seek immediate emergency medical care. An anti-venom medication is sometimes given for black widow spider bites. Doctors' use different types of medications to treat spider bites, including pain relievers, muscle relaxants, and/or corticosteroids. Sometimes hospitalization is required after black widow or brown recluse spider bites. If possible, retrieve the spider and bring it with you to the health care practitioner so that it can be definitively identified. A tetanus booster shot may be necessary, depending upon the date of the patient's last immunization. Calling the Poison Control Center (24-hour hotline at 1-800-222-1222 in the U.S.) allows you to reach toxicology experts who can work with a health care provider in establishing the proper diagnosis and management of a spider bite."
Facts you should know about sclerotherapy," During the sclerotherapy procedure, a health care professional injects chemicals into smaller veins, which damage the inner lining and produce a clot. As the clot is reabsorbed, the vessel is permanently obliterated. The choice of the chemical sclerosing agent and its physical form depend on the size of the vessel to be treated. Treatment of the correct vessels can improve the symptoms of venous insufficiency. Small superficial vessels are often destroyed for cosmetic reasons."
What is sclerotherapy?,"'Sclerotherapy is a medical procedure whereby a chemical, the sclerosant, is injected into a vein to entirely obliterate it. The sclerosant damages the innermost lining of the vessel (the endothelium), resulting in a clot that blocks the blood circulation in the vein beyond. Veins carry unoxygenated blood from the peripheral tissues back to the ''heart''. Since the venous ''blood pressure'' in the veins is low, the blood is pumped by forward by contractions of the heart. To prevent back-flow, most veins have valves that only allow blood only to flow in the direction of the heart. When these valves become incompetent, veins become enlarged and bulging (varicose). Smaller veins that feed these ''varicose veins'' can also become enlarged and appear as red or blue ''spider veins'' in the skin. ''Varicose veins'' can lead to a chronic swelling condition of the leg called venous insufficiency. Venous insufficiency predisposes a person to ''leg swelling'', ''blood clots'', and skin ulceration. Even more frequently, damaged veins are manifested as unsightly ''spider veins''. The destruction of these types of veins can be desirable both medically and cosmetically.' "
Is sclerotherapy safe?,"'All medical procedures have risks that should be considered carefully prior to embarking on a particular treatment. Since sclerotherapy is frequently used to treat cosmetic problems, untoward and dangerous side effects ought to be fully explained to the patient.' "
Does sclerotherapy hurt?,"'Because this procedure requires injections through the skin, it is not a painless procedure. Some chemicals that are injected (sclerosants) are more likely to cause ''pain'' than others. If the sclerosant is deposited outside the vein inadvertently, this is often more painful.' "
Is sclerotherapy an effective treatment for varicose veins and spider veins?,"'Sclerotherapy is an effective technique to obliterate or collapse veins. Other techniques include surgical removal of the offending vein, endovenous laser destruction (fiberoptic-transmitted laser light) and, for very small vessels, percutaneous laser light or intense pulsed-light exposure are also effective.'  "
Who is a good candidate for sclerotherapy?,"'Those with venous insufficiency who have disease that is poorly controlled with compression stockings and who are not ''obese'' are ideal candidates for sclerotherapy. To determine if sclerotherapy obliteration is likely to be of benefit, the site of the defective vein is identified as well as the venous drainage pattern. Healthy people who complain of unsightly superficial veins of small caliber (4 mm or less) are also candidates for sclerotherapy.' "
How do people prepare for the sclerotherapy procedure?,"'Patients are screened using special ''ultrasound'' techniques to determine the site of venous disease prior to treatment. In situations where there is only a small area of ''spider veins'', this is rarely done.' "
How does a doctor administer sclerotherapy injections?,"'There are now two FDA-approved sclerosants available, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (a detergent) and polidocanol (Asclera). For small veins, hypertonic saline is occasionally used. Depending on the size of the vein to be treated, the sclerosant may be administered as foam. A needle of the appropriate caliber is inserted into the vessel to be treated, and the chemical is injected.' "
What is the recovery time for sclerotherapy?,'This is an outpatient procedure and the patient leaves the office on the same day of treatment.' 
What aftercare is needed following a sclerotherapy procedure?,'Patients should wear compression dressings for one to three weeks after treatment. A follow-up visit within two weeks to enable the evacuation of blood clots in larger veins can improve the prognosis and the appearance.' 
What are the benefits of sclerotherapy?,"'For patients with venous insufficiency, treatment can be beneficial by improving venous blood flow and limiting chronic swelling. For those with cosmetic complaints, their appearance can be improved.' "
"What are risks, side effects, and complications of sclerotherapy?","'Sclerotherapy risks, side effects, and complications include ''hyperpigmentation'', temporary swelling, capillary dilation (telangiectatic matting), ''pain'' from the injection, localized ''hives'', tape compression ''blister'', tape compression ''folliculitis'', and recurrence, ''vasovagal'' reflex, localized hair growth (hirsutism), skin death (cutaneous necrosis), ''allergic reaction'', superficial ''thrombophlebitis'', arterial injection, ''pulmonary embolism'', ''deep vein thrombosis'', nerve damage, and ''migraine'' ''headaches''.'  "
"Does insurance cover the 
cost of sclerotherapy?","'Although insurance companies differ in their coverage and preapproval is always helpful, the treatment of venous insufficiency is usually covered. The treatment of cosmetic problems including spider veins is rarely covered.' "
What is spina bifida?,"'The human nervous system develops from a small, specialized plate of cells (the neural plate) along the back of an embryo. Early in ''fetal development'', the edges of this plate begin to curl up toward each other, creating the neural tube-a narrow sheath that closes to form the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. As development progresses, the top of the tube becomes the brain and the remainder becomes the spinal cord. This process is usually complete by the 28th day of ''pregnancy''. But if problems occur during this process, the result can be brain disorders called neural tube defects, including spina bifida.' "
What is the definition of spina bifida?,"'Spina bifida, which literally means ""cleft spine,"" is characterized by the incomplete development of the brain, spinal cord, and/or meninges (the protective covering around the brain and spinal cord). It is the most common n eural tube defect in the United States -- affecting 1,500 to 2,000 of the more than 4 million ''babies'' born in the country each year. There are an estimated 166,000 individuals with spina bifida living in the United States.'  "
What are the 4 types of spina bifida?,"'There are four types of spina bifida: occulta, closed neural tube defects, meningocele, and myelomeningocele.' "
What is occulta spina bifida?,"'Occulta is the mildest and most common form in which one or more vertebrae are malformed. The name ""occulta,"" which means ""hidden,"" indicates that the malformation, or opening in the spine, is covered by a layer of skin. This form of spina bifida is present in 10 to 20 percent of the general population and rarely causes disability or symptoms.' "
What is meningocele spina bifida?,'Meningocele spinal fluid and meninges protrude through an abnormal vertebral opening; the malformation contains no neural elements and may or may not be covered by a layer of skin. \xa0 Some individuals with meningocele may have few or no symptoms while others may experience such symptoms as complete ''paralysis'' with bladder and bowel dysfunction.' 
What is myelomeningocele spina bifida?,"'Myelomeningocele is the most severe and occurs when the spinal cord or neural elements are exposed through the opening in the spine, resulting in partial or complete motor paralysis and sensory deficits within the parts of the body below the spinal opening. The paralysis may be so severe that the affected individual is unable to walk and may have urinary and bowel dysfunction.' "
What are closed neural tube defects?,"'Closed neural tube defects. This form consists of a diverse group of spinal defects in which the spinal cord is marked by a malformation of fat, bone, or membranes. In some individuals there are few or no symptoms; in others the malformation causes partial paralysis with urinary and bowel dysfunction.' "
What causes spina bifida?,"""The exact cause of spina bifida remains a mystery. No one knows what disrupts complete closure of the neural tube, causing a malformation to develop. Scientists suspect that the cause is multifactoral: genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors play a role. Research studies indicate that insufficient intake of folic acid -- a common B vitamin -- in the mother's ""'diet'' is a key factor in causing spina bifida and other neural tube defects. ''Prenatal vitamins'' that are prescribed for the ''pregnant'' mother typically contain folic acid as well as other ''vitamins''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of spina bifida?,"'The symptoms of spina bifida vary from person to person, depending on the type and level of involvement. Closed neural tube defects are often recognized or identified early in life due to an abnormal tuft or clump of hair or a small dimple or ''birthmark'' on the skin at the site of the spinal malformation.''Meningocele and myelomeningocele generally involve a fluid-filled sac-visible on the backprotruding from the spinal canal In meningocele, the sac may be covered by a thin layer of skin. In most cases of myelomeningocele, there is no layer of skin covering the sac and an area of abnormally developed spinal cord tissue usually is exposed.' "
What tests (ultrasound) diagnose spina bifida pre-and postnatal?,"'In most cases, spina bifida is diagnosed prenatally, or before birth. However, some mild cases may go unnoticed until after birth (postnatal). Very mild forms (such as spina bifida occulta), in which there may be no symptoms, may never be detected.''The most common screening methods used to look for spina bifida during pregnancy are second trimester (16th to 18th weeks of gestation) maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening and fetal ultrasound. The MSAFP screen measures the level of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is made naturally by the fetus and placenta. During pregnancy, a small amount of AFP normally crosses the placenta and enters the mother\'s bloodstream. Abnormally high levels of this protein in the mother\'s bloodstream may indicate that the fetus has an ""open"" (not skin-covered) neural tube defect. The MSAFP test, however, is not specific for spina bifida and requires correct gestational dates to be most accurate; it cannot definitively determine that there is a problem with the fetus. Ifa high level of AFP is detected, the doctor may request additional testing, such as ultrasound imaging or ''amniocentesis'' to help determine the cause. Amniocentesis 6 is a procedure in which the doctor removes ad examines samples of fluid from the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. Although amniocentesis cannot reveal the severity of spina bifida, finding high levels of AFP may indicate that the disorder is present. The second trimester MSAFP screen described above may be performed alone or as part of a larger, multiple-marker screen. Multiple-marker screens look not only for neural tube defects, but also for other ''birth defects'', including ''Down syndrome'' and other chromosomal abnormalities. ''First trimester'' screens for chromosomal abnormalities also exist but signs of spina bifida are not evident until the second trimester.''Mild cases of spina bifida (occulta; closed) not diagnosed during ''prenatal'' testing may be detected postnatally by X-ray during a routine examination. Doctors may use ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') or a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a clearer view of the spine and vertebrae. Individuals with the more severe forms of spina bifida often have muscle ''weakness'' in their ''feet'', hips, and legs. Ifhydrocephalus is suspected, the doctor may request a ''CT scan'' and/or X-ray of the skull to look for extra cerebrospinal fluid inside the brain.' "
What is the treatment for spina bifida? Is there a cure?,"'There is no cure for spina bifida. The nerve tissue that is damaged or lost cannot be repaired or replaced, nor can function be restored to the damaged nerves. Treatment depends on the type and severity of the disorder. Generally, children with the mild form need no treatment, although some may require surgery as they grow.''The key early priorities for treating myelomeningocele are to prevent infection from developing through the exposed nerves and tissue through the spine defect, and to protect the exposed nerves and structures from additional trauma. Typically, a child born with spina bifida will have surgery to close the defect and minimize the risk of infection or further trauma within the first few days of life.'""Selected medical centers continue to perform fetal surgery for treatment of myelomeningocele through a National Institutes of Health protocol (Management of Myelomeningocele Study, or MOMS). Fetal surgery is performed in utero (within the uterus) and involves opening the mother's abdomen and uterus and sewing shut the abnormal opening over the developing baby's spinal cord. Some doctors believe the earlier the defect is corrected, the better the baby's outcome. Although the procedure cannot restore lost neurological function, it may prevent additional losses from occurring.""'Originally planned to enroll 200 expectant mothers carrying a child with myelomeningocle, the Management of Myelomeningocele Study was stopped after the enrollment of 183 women, because of the benefits demonstrated in the children who underwent prenatal surgery.''There are risks to the fetus as well as to the mother. The major risks to the fetus are those that might occur if the surgery stimulates premature delivery, such as organ immaturity, ''brain hemorrhage'', and death. Risks to the mother include infection, blood loss leading to the need for transfusion, ''gestational diabetes'', and ''weight gain'' due to bed rest.''Still, the benefits of fetal surgery are promising -- including less exposure of the vulnerable ''spinal nerve'' tissue and bones to the intrauterine environment, in particular the ''amniotic fluid'', which is considered toxic. As an added benefit, doctors have discovered that the procedure affects the way the fetal hindbrain develops in the uterus, allowing certain complications -- such as Chiari II and ''hydrocephalus'' -- to correct themselves, thus, reducing or, in some cases, eliminating the need for surgery to implant a shunt.''Twenty to 50 percent of children with myelomeningocele develop a condition called progressive tethering, or tethered cord syndrome. A part of the spinal cord becomes fastened to an immovable structure (such as overlying membranes and vertebrae). This causes the spinal cord to become abnormally stretched and the vertebrae elongated with growth and movement. This condition can cause change in the muscle function of the legs, as well as changes in bowel and bladder function. Early surgery on the spinal cord may allow the child to regain a normal level of functioning and prevent further neurological deterioration.''Some children will need subsequent surgeries to manage problems with the feet, hips, or spine. Individuals with ''hydrocephalus'' generally will require additional surgeries to replace the shunt, which can be outgrown or become clogged.''Some individuals with spina bifida require assistive mobility devices such as ''braces'', crutches, or wheelchairs. The location of the malformation on the spine often indicates the type of assistive devices needed. Children with a defect high on the spine and more extensive paralysis will often require a wheelchair, while those with a defect lower on the spine may be able to use crutches, bladder catherizations, leg ''braces'', or walkers. Beginning special exercises for the legs and feet at an early age may help prepare the child for ''walking'' with braces or crutches when he or she is older.''Treatment of bladder and bowel problems typically begins soon after birth, and may include bladder catheterizations and bowel management regimens.' "
What are the complications of spina bifida?,"'Complications of spina bifida range from minor physical problems to severe physical and mental disabilities. It is important to note, however, that most people with spina bifida have normal intelligence. Children with myelomeningocele and/ or hydrocephalus (excess accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in and around the the brain) may have ''learning disabilities'', including difficulty paying attention, problems with language and reading comprehension, and trouble learning math.'""Spina bifida's impact is determined bythe size and location of the malformation,whether it is covered by skin, and whichspinal nerves are involved. All nerveslocated below the malformation are affectedto some degree. Therefore, the higher themalformation occurs on the back, thegreater the amount of nerve damage andloss of muscle function and sensation.""'In addition to abnormal sensation and paralysis, another neurological complication associated with spina bifida is Chiari II malformation -- a condition common in children with myelomeningocele -- in which the brain stem and the cerebellum (hindbrain) protrude downward into the spinal canal or neck area. This condition can lead to compression of the spinal cord and cause a variety of symptoms, including difficulties with feeding, swallowing, ''breathing'' control, choking, and changes in upper extremity function (''stiffness'', swelling).''Chiari II malformation may also result in a blockage of cerebrospinal fluid, causing hydrocephalus. The buildup of fluid puts damaging pressure on the brain and spinal cord. Hydrocephalus is commonly treated by surgically implanting a shunt-a hollow tube -- in the brain to drain the excess fluid into the abdomen.''Some newborns with myelomeningocele may develop meningitis, an infection in the meninges. Meningitis may cause ''brain injury'' and can be life-threatening.''Additional problems such as ''latex allergies'', skin integrity breakdown, gastrointestinal conditions, disorders of ''sleep'' regulation, and ''depression'' may occur as children with spina bifida get older.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for spina bifida?,"'Children with spina bifida can lead relatively active lives. Prognosis, activity, and participation depends on the number and severity of abnormalities and associated personal and environmental factors. Many children with the disorder have normal intelligence and can walk, usually with assistive devices. If learning problems develop, early educational intervention is helpful.' "
Can spina bifida be prevented?,"'Folic acid, also called folate, is an important vitamin in the development of a healthy fetus. Although taking this vitamin cannot guarantee having a healthy baby, it can help. Studies have shown that by adding folic acid to their diets, women of childbearing age significantly reduce their risk of having a child with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida. Therefore, it is recommended that all women of childbearing age consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Foods high in folic acid include dark green vegetables, egg yolks, and some fruits. Many foods -- such as some breakfast cereals, enriched breads, flours, pastas, rice, and other grain products -- are now fortified with folic acid. Most ''multivitamins'' contain this recommended dosage of folic acid.''Women who have a child with spina bifida, have spina bifida themselves, or have already had a pregnancy affected by any neural tube defect are at greater risk (anywhere from five to 10 percent of the general population) of having a child with spina bifida or another neural tube defect. These women may benefit from taking a higher daily dose of folic acid before they become pregnant.' "
What research is being done on spina bifida?,"'Within the Federal Government, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), supports and conducts research on brain and nervous system disorders, including spina bifida. NINDS conducts research in its laboratories at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, and supports research through grants to medical research institutions across the country.''In one study supported by NINDS, scientists are looking at the hereditary basis of neural tube defects. The goal of this research is to find the genetic factors that make some children more susceptible to neural tube defects than others. Lessons learned from this research may fill in gaps of knowledge about the causes of neural tube defects and may lead to ways to prevent these disorders. These researchers are also studying gene expression during the process of neural tube closure, which will provide information on the human nervous system during development.''In addition, NINDS-supported scientistsare working to identify, characterize, andevaluate genes for neural tube defects. Thegoal is to understand the genetics of neural tube closure, and to develop information that will translate into improved clinical care, treatment, and ''genetic counseling''.''Other scientists are studying genetic risk factors for spina bifida, especially those that diminish or lessen the .function of folic acid in the mother during pregnancy, possibly leading to spina bifida in the fetus. This study will shed light on how folic acid prevents spina bifida and may lead to improved forms of folate ''supplements''.''NINDS also supports and conducts a wide range of basic research studies to understand how the brain and nervous system develop. These studies contribute to a greater understanding of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, and offer hope for new avenues of treatment for and ''prevention'' of these disorders as well as other birth defects.''Another component of the NIH, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development (NICHD), is conducting a school-age follow-up assessment of prenatal vs. postnatal repair of myelomeningocele. The MOMS2 study, a continuation of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study, will better establish which procedure is best for intelligence and bladder and bowel outcome years after the surgery. Researchers hope this study, called the Management of Myelomeningocele Study, or MOMS, will better establish which procedure -- prenatal or postnatal -- is best for the baby.' "
Spinal Cord Injury Facts," The most common cause of spinal cord injury is trauma. Spinal cord injury is most common in young, white men. Spinal cord injury can be either complete or incomplete. In complete injuries there is no function below the level of injury. In incomplete injuries there is some function remaining below the level of injury. Early immobilization and treatment are the most important factors in achieving recovery from spinal cord injury. Aggressive rehabilitation and assistive devices allow even people with severe spinal cord injuries to interact in society and remain productive."
What is the spinal cord injury?,"'The spinal cord is a collection of nerves that travels from the bottom of the brain down your back. There are 31 pairs of nerves that leave the spinal cord and go to your arms, legs, chest and abdomen. These nerves allow your brain to give commands to your muscles and cause movements of your arms and legs. The nerves that control your arms exit from the upper portion of the spinal cord, while the nerves to your legs exit from the lower portion of the spinal cord. The nerves also control the function of your organs including your ''heart'', ''lungs'', bowels, and bladder. For example, signals from the spinal cord control how fast your heart beats and your rate of ''breathing''.''Other nerves travel from your arms and legs back to the spinal cord. These nerves bring back information from your body to your brain including the senses of touch, ''pain'', temperature, and position. The spinal cord runs through the spinal canal. This canal is surrounded by the bones in your neck and back called vertebrae which make up your back bone. The vertebrae are divided into 7 neck (cervical) vertebrae, 12 chest (thoracic) vertebrae and 5 lower back (lumbar) vertebrae. The vertebrae help protect the spinal cord from injury.''The spinal cord is very sensitive to injury. Unlike other parts of your body, the spinal cord does not have the ability to repair itself if it is damaged. A spinal cord injury occurs when there is damage to the spinal cord either from trauma, loss of its normal blood supply, or compression from ''tumor'' or infection. There are approximately 12,000 new cases of spinal cord injury each year in the United States. They are most common in white males.''Spinal cord injuries are described as either complete or incomplete. In a ''complete spinal cord injury'' there is complete loss of sensation and muscle function in the body below the level of the injury. In an ''incomplete spinal cord injury'' there is some remaining function below the level of the injury. In most cases both sides of the body are affected equally.''An injury to the upper portion of the spinal cord in the neck can cause ''quadriplegia''-''paralysis'' of both arms and both legs. If the injury to the spinal cord occurs lower in the back it can cause ''paraplegia''-paralysis of both legs only.' "
What are the causes of spinal cord injury?,"'The most common cause of spinal cord injury is trauma. Nearly half of the injuries are caused by motor vehicle accidents. Other types of trauma include:''Spinal cord injury can also be caused by compression of the cord by a tumor, infection, or inflammation. Some patients have a smaller than normal spinal canal (called spinal stenosis) and are at a higher risk of injury to the spinal cord.''All tissues in your body including the spinal cord require a good blood supply to deliver oxygen and other nutrients. Failure of this blood supply to the spinal cord can cause spinal cord injury. This can be caused by an ''aneurysm'' (ballooning of a blood vessel), compression of a blood vessel or a prolonged drop in ''blood pressure''.'   falls from heights, violence (stabbing or gunshot wounds to the spine), and sporting injuries (diving, football, rugby, equestrian, etc.)."
What are the symptoms of spinal cord injury?,"'The symptoms of spinal cord injury depend on where the spinal cord is injured and whether or not the injury is complete or incomplete. In incomplete injuries, patients have some remaining function of their bodies below the level of injury, while in complete injuries they have no function below the level of injury.''Injuries to the spinal cord can cause ''weakness'' or complete loss of muscle function and loss of sensation in the body below the level of injury, loss of control of the bowels and bladder, and loss of normal sexual function. Spinal cord injuries in the upper neck can cause difficulty breathing and may require the use of a breathing machine, or ventilator.'  "
How is a spinal cord injury diagnosed?,"""The first step in diagnosing a spinal cord injury is a medical history and physical examination. The patient's\xa0 physician will obtain a medical history asking questions about the details surrounding the time of the injury. The amount of time since the injury is important because spinal cord injury is a medical emergency. The quicker the patient obtains treatment, the better the chances for recovery. Other details of the medical history could include details of any prior neck or back injuries or surgeries, the presence of ""'pain'' in the neck or back, any weakness in the arms or legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, loss of sensation in the arms or legs, and other previous medical conditions.''The physical examination will include testing to see if sensation to touch is intact in the arms and legs as well as testing muscle strength and reflexes in the arms and legs. The patient may be kept in a cervical collar or on a backboard to immobilize them until the physician determines whether or not the patient has a spinal cord injury.''The next step is often ''x-rays'' of the neck or back. These can help identify a ''fracture'' or dislocation of the vertebrae. These may or may not be present with a spinal cord injury. It is possible to have a spinal cord injury without an injury to the vertebrae. X-rays can also help identify a tumor or infection or severe ''arthritis'' that could cause spinal cord injury.''A computed tomography (CT) scan is a more advanced imaging test that can give the physician a better view of the vertebrae. CT can identify some injuries to the vertebrae not seen on the plain x-rays. A ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') scan is another more advanced imaging study that can identify a spinal cord injury. The MRI is better at evaluating the soft tissues including the ligaments, intervertebral discs, nerves and spinal cord. The MRI scan also can show evidence of injury within the spinal cord.' "
How is a spinal cord injury treated?,"'The first step in treatment of a suspected spinal cord injury is to verify the patient is breathing and the heart is beating. A spinal cord injury in the upper neck can cause a loss of control of normal breathing. This may require the placement of a ''breathing tube'' and use of a ventilator.''The next step in treatment of a spinal cord injury is immobilization. This often occurs at the time of injury prior to being transported to the hospital. Emergency medical technicians may place the patient in a cervical collar or on a backboard to help prevent the spine from moving. If the patient has a spinal cord injury, further movement of the spine could lead to further damage. '""After a spinal cord injury is diagnosed, the patient might be started on a high dose of steroids. This could help decrease the amount of damage to the spinal cord by reducing inflammation and swelling. There are risks associated with using steroids for spinal cord injury. The patient's doctor can help decide if steroids are appropriate. The use of steroids is only beneficial if they are started within eight hours of the time of injury.""'Next the patient may be placed in traction or a halo device around the head to try to stabilize the spine and prevent further damage. Many cases of spinal cord injury are treated with surgery. There are two major goals of surgery. ''There are many potential complications related to spinal cord injury that may require specific treatment. These complications include:''After the initial treatment and stabilization of patients with a spinal cord injury, much of the treatment is geared toward rehabilitation. This includes methods to help the patient maximize their function through physical and occupational therapy and the use of assistive devices.'   The first goal is to relieve any pressure on the spinal cord. This could involve removing portions of the vertebrae that have broken and are compressing the spinal cord. If the spinal cord is being compressed by tumor, infection or severe arthritis, surgery can be performed to reduce the amount of compression.  The second major goal of surgery for spinal cord injury is to stabilize the spine. If the vertebrae are weakened from fracture, tumor or infection, they may not be capable of supporting the normal weight from the body and protecting the spinal cord. A combination of metal screws, rods and plates may be necessary to help hold the vertebrae together and stabilize them until the bones heal. urinary tract infections or urinary incontinence (inability to control the flow of urine),  bowel incontinence (inability to control bowel movements),  pressure sores,  infections in the lungs (pneumonia),  blood clots,  muscle spasms,  chronic pain, and  depression."
What is the outlook for patients with spinal cord injury?,"'The best chance for recovery of function following spinal cord injury is through prompt treatment. Early surgical decompression and stabilization leads to better recovery. Aggressive physical therapy and rehabilitation after surgery also maximizes recovery. The majority of recovery occurs within the first six months after injury. Any remaining loss of function present after 12 months is much more likely to become permanent.''Maintaining a positive outlook is extremely important for patients with spinal cord injury. The use of assistive devices allows most people with even severe spinal cord injuries to integrate into society and stay productive. Unfortunately, the rate of ''depression'', divorce, and ''substance abuse'' are significantly higher in people with spinal cord injury. There are many support groups and treatments available for people with spinal cord injury as listed below.'  "
Is there a cure for spinal cord injury?,'There is no cure for spinal cord injury at this time. Many physicians and scientists devote their professional lives to this goal. There have been many promising advancements in research into spinal cord injury recently. It is hoped that these advancements will lead to a cure.'

NIH spinal cord injury: treatments and rehabilitation,"'Accounts of spinal cord injuries and their treatment date back to ancient times, even though there was little chance of recovery from such a devastating injury. The earliest is found in an Egyptian papyrus roll manuscript written in approximately 1700 B.C. that describes two spinal cord injuries involving fracture or dislocation of the neck vertebrae accompanied by paralysis.* The description of each was ""an ailment not to be treated."" ''Centuries later in Greece, treatment for spinal cord injuries had changed little. According to the Greek physician Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.) there were no treatment options for spinal cord injuries that resulted in paralysis; unfortunately, those patients were destined to die. But Hippocrates did use rudimentary forms of traction to treat spinal ''fractures'"" without paralysis. The Hippocratic Ladder was a device that required the patient to be bound, tied to the rungs upside-down, and shaken vigorously to reduce spinal curvature. Another invention, the Hippocratic Board, allowed the doctor to apply traction to the immobilized patient's back using either his hands and ""'feet'' or a wheel and axle arrangement. ''Hindu, Arab, and Chinese physicians also developed basic forms of traction to correct spinal deformities. These same principles of traction are still applied today. ''In about 200 A.D., the Roman physician Galen introduced the concept of the central nervous system when he proposed that the spinal cord was an extension of the brain that carried sensation to the limbs and back. By the seventh century A.D., Paulus of Aegina was recommending surgery for spinal column fracture to remove the bone fragments that he was convinced caused paralysis. ''In his influential anatomy textbook published in 1543, the Renaissance physician and teacher Vesalius described and illustrated the spinal cord in all its parts. The illustrations in his books, based on direct observation and dissection of the spine, gave physicians a way to understand the basic structure of the spine and spinal cord and what could happen when it was injured. The words we use today to identify segments of the spine - ''cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal'' - come directly from Vesalius. ''With the widespread use of antiseptics and sterilization in surgical procedures in the late nineteenth century, spinal surgery could finally be done with a much lower risk of infection. The use of X-rays, beginning in the 1920s, gave surgeons a way to precisely locate the injury and also made diagnosis and prediction of outcome more accurate. By the middle of the twentieth century, a standard method of treating spinal cord injuries was established - reposition the spine, fix it in place, and rehabilitate disabilities with ''exercise''. In the 1990s, the discovery that the steroid drug ''methylprednisolone'' could reduce damage to nerve cells if given early enough after injury gave doctors an additional treatment option. ' "
What Is a Spinal Cord Injury?,"'Although the hard bones of the spinal column protect the soft tissues of the spinal cord, vertebrae can still be broken or dislocated in a variety of ways and cause traumatic injury to the spinal cord. Injuries can occur at any level of the spinal cord. The segment of the cord that is injured, and the severity of the injury, will determine which body functions are compromised or lost. Because the spinal cord acts as the main information pathway between the brain and the rest of the body, a spinal cord injury can have significant physiological consequences. ''Catastrophic falls, being thrown from a horse or through a windshield, or any kind of physical trauma that crushes and compresses the vertebrae in the neck can cause irreversible damage at the cervical level of the spinal cord and below. Paralysis of most of the body including the arms and legs, called ''quadriplegia'', is the likely result. Automobile accidents are often responsible for spinal cord damage in the middle back (the thoracic or lumbar area), which can cause paralysis of the lower trunk and lower extremities, called ''paraplegia''.''Other kinds of injuries that directly penetrate the spinal cord, such as gunshot or knife wounds, can either completely or partially sever the spinal cord and create life-long disabilities. '""Most injuries to the spinal cord don't completely sever it. Instead, an injury is more likely to cause fractures and compression of the vertebrae, which then crush and destroy the ""'axons'', extensions of nerve cells that carry signals up and down the spinal cord between the brain and the rest of the body. An injury to the spinal cord can damage a few, many, or almost all of these axons. Some injuries will allow almost complete recovery. Others will result in complete paralysis. ''Until World War II, a serious spinal cord injury usually meant certain death, or at best a lifetime confined to a wheelchair and an ongoing struggle to survive secondary complications such as breathing problems or blood clots. But today, improved emergency care for people with spinal cord injuries and aggressive treatment and rehabilitation can minimize damage to the nervous system and even restore limited abilities. ''Advances in research are giving doctors and patients hope that all spinal cord injuries will eventually be repairable. With new surgical techniques and exciting developments in ''spinal nerve'' ''regeneration'', the future for spinal cord injury survivors looks brighter every day. ''This information has been written to explain what happens to the spinal cord when it is injured, the current treatments for spinal cord injury patients, and the most promising avenues of research currently under investigation. ''Source:'' Facts and Figures at a Glance, May 2001. National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center. ' There are an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 spinal cord injuries every year in the United States. About 200,000 Americans are currently living with spinal cord injuries.  The average cost of managing the care of spinal a cord injury patient is 
between $15,000 and $30,000 per year.  Forty-six percent of all spinal cord injuries happen during car accidents. 
Sixteen percent, are the result of injuries relating to violent encounters. The rest are due to sporting accidents, falls, and work-related accidents.  Fifty to seventy percent of spinal cord injury victims are between 15 and 35 years old.  Eighty  percent of spinal cord injury patients are men"
How Does the Spinal Cord Work?,"'To understand what can happen as the result of a spinal cord injury, it helps to know the anatomy of the spinal cord and its normal functions. ''The soft, jelly-like spinal cord is protected by the spinal column. The spinal column is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae, each with a circular opening similar to the hole in a donut. The bones are stacked one on top of the other and the spinal cord runs through the hollow channel created by the holes in the stacked bones. ''The vertebrae can be organized into sections, and are named and numbered from top to bottom according to their location along the backbone: ''Although the hard vertebrae protect the soft spinal cord from injury most of the time, the spinal column is not all hard bone. Between the vertebrae are ''discs'' of semi-rigid cartilage, and in the narrow spaces between them are passages through which the spinal nerves exit to the rest of the body. These are places where the spinal cord is vulnerable to direct injury. ''The spinal cord is also organized into segments and named and numbered from top to bottom. Each segment marks where spinal nerves emerge from the cord to connect to specific regions of the body. Locations of spinal cord segments do not correspond exactly to vertebral locations, but they are roughly equivalent.''The single ''coccygeal nerve'' carries sensory information from the skin of the lower back. '""The spinal cord has a core of tissue containing nerve cells, surrounded by long tracts of nerve fibers consisting of axons. The tracts extend up and down the spinal cord, carrying signals to and from the brain. The average size of the spinal cord varies in circumference along its length from the width of a thumb to the width of one of the smaller fingers. The spinal cord extends down through the upper two thirds of the vertebral canal, from the base of the brain to the lower back, and is generally 15 to 17 inches long depending on an individual's height. ""'The interior of the spinal cord is made up of neurons, their support cells called ''glia'', and blood vessels. The neurons and their ''dendrites'' (branching projections that help neurons communicate with each other) reside in an H-shaped region called ""grey matter."" ''The H-shaped grey matter of the spinal cord contains motor neurons that control movement, smaller ''interneurons'' that handle communication within and between the segments of the spinal cord, and cells that receive sensory signals and then send information up to centers in the brain. ''Surrounding the grey matter of neurons is white matter. Most axons are covered with an insulating substance called ''myelin'', which allows electrical signals to flow freely and quickly. Myelin has a whitish appearance, which is why this outer section of the spinal cord is called ""white matter."" ''Axons carry signals downward from the brain (along descending pathways) and upward toward the brain (along ascending pathways) within specific tracts. Axons branch at their ends and can make connections with many other nerve cells simultaneously. Some axons extend along the entire length of the spinal cord.'""The descending motor tracts control the smooth muscles of internal organs and the striated (capable of voluntary contractions) muscles of the arms and legs. They also help adjust the autonomic nervous system's regulation of blood pressure, body temperature, and the response to ""'stress''. These pathways begin with neurons in the brain that send electrical signals downward to specific levels of the spinal cord. Neurons in these segments then send the impulses out to the rest of the body or coordinate neural activity within the cord itself.''The ascending sensory tracts transmit sensory signals from the skin, extremities, and internal organs that enter at specific segments of the spinal cord. Most of these signals are then relayed to the brain. The spinal cord also contains neuronal circuits that control reflexes and repetitive movements, such as ''walking'', which can be activated by incoming sensory signals without input from the brain. ''The circumference of the spinal cord varies depending on its location. It is larger in the cervical and lumbar areas because these areas supply the nerves to the arms and upper body and the legs and lower body, which require the most intense muscular control and receive the most sensory signals. ''The ratio of white matter to grey matter also varies at each level of the spinal cord. In the cervical segment, which is located in the neck, there is a large amount of white matter because at this level there are many axons going to and from the brain and the rest of the spinal cord below. In lower segments, such as the sacral, there is less white matter because most ascending axons have not yet entered the cord, and most descending axons have contacted their targets along the way. ''To pass between the vertebrae, the axons that link the spinal cord to the muscles and the rest of the body are bundled into 31 pairs of spinal nerves, each pair with a sensory root and a motor root that make connections within the grey matter. Two pairs of nerves - a sensory and motor pair on either side of the cord - emerge from each segment of the spinal cord. ''The functions of these nerves are determined by their location in the spinal cord. They control everything from body functions such as breathing, ''sweating'', ''digestion'', and elimination, to gross and fine motor skills, as well as sensations in the arms and legs. ''Together, the spinal cord and the brain make up the central nervous system (CNS).''The CNS controls most functions of the body, but it is not the only nervous system in the body. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes the nerves that project to the limbs, heart, skin, and other organs outside the brain. The PNS controls the somatic nervous system, which regulates muscle movements and the response to sensations of touch and pain, and the autonomic nervous system, which provides nerve input to the internal organs and generates automatic reflex responses. The autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system, which mobilizes organs and their functions during times of ''stress'' and arousal, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which conserves energy and resources during times of rest and relaxation. ''The spinal cord acts as the primary information pathway between the brain and all the other nervous systems of the body. It receives sensory information from the skin, joints, and muscles of the trunk, arms, and legs, which it then relays upward to the brain. It carries messages downward from the brain to the PNS, and contains motor neurons, which direct voluntary movements and adjust reflex movements. Because of the central role it plays in coordinating muscle movements and interpreting sensory input, any kind of injury to the spinal cord can cause significant problems throughout the body. ' Cervical vertebrae (1-7) located in the neck  Thoracic vertebrae (1-12) in the upper back (attached to the ribcage) Lumbar vertebrae (1-5) in the lower back  Sacral vertebrae (1-5) in the hip area  Coccygeal vertebrae (1-4 fused) in the tailbone  Cervical spinal nerves (C1 to C8) control signals to the back of the head, the neck and shoulders, the arms and hands, and the diaphragm.  Thoracic spinal nerves (T1 to T12) control signals to the chest muscles, some muscles of the back, and parts of the abdomen.  Lumbar spinal nerves (L1 to L5) control signals to the lower parts of the abdomen and the back, the buttocks, some parts of the external genital organs, and parts of the leg.  Sacral spinal nerves (S1 to S5) control signals to the thighs and lower parts of the legs, the feet, most of the external genital organs, and the area around the anus. "
What Happens When the Spinal Cord Is Injured?,"'A spinal cord injury usually begins with a sudden, traumatic blow to the spine that fractures or dislocates vertebrae. The damage begins at the moment of injury when displaced bone fragments, disc material, or ''ligaments'' bruise or tear into spinal cord tissue. Axons are cut off or damaged beyond repair, and neural cell membranes are broken. Blood vessels may rupture and cause heavy bleeding in the central grey matter, which can spread to other areas of the spinal cord over the next few hours. ''Within minutes, the spinal cord swells to fill the entire ''cavity'' of the spinal canal at the injury level. This swelling ''cuts'' off blood flow, which also cuts off oxygen to spinal cord tissue. Blood pressure drops, sometimes dramatically, as the body loses its ability to self-regulate. As blood pressure lowers even further, it interferes with the electrical activity of neurons and axons. All these changes can cause a condition known as ''spinal ''shock'' that can last from several hours to several days. '""Although there is some controversy among neurologists about the extent and impact of spinal shock, and even its definition in terms of physiological characteristics, it appears to occur in approximately half the cases of spinal cord injury, and it is usually directly related to the size and severity of the injury. During spinal shock, even undamaged portions of the spinal cord become temporarily disabled and can't communicate normally with the brain. Complete paralysis may develop, with loss of reflexes and sensation in the limbs. ""'The crushing and tearing of axons is just the beginning of the devastation that occurs in the injured spinal cord and continues for days. The initial physical trauma sets off a cascade of biochemical and cellular events that kills neurons, strips axons of their myelin insulation, and triggers an inflammatory immune system response. Days or sometimes even weeks later, after this second wave of damage has passed, the area of destruction has increased - sometimes to several segments above and below the original injury - and so has the extent of disability. ''Changes in blood flow in and around the spinal cord begin at the injured area, spread out to adjacent, uninjured areas, and then set off problems throughout the body.''Immediately after the injury, there is a major reduction in blood flow to the site, which can last for as long as 24 hours and becomes progressively worse if untreated. Because of differences in tissue composition, the impact is greater on the interior grey matter of the spinal cord than on the outlying white matter.'""Blood vessels in the grey matter also begin to leak, sometimes as early as 5 minutes after injury. Cells that line the still-intact blood vessels in the spinal cord begin to swell, for reasons that aren't yet clearly understood, and this continues to reduce blood flow to the injured area. The combination of leaking, swelling, and sluggish blood flow prevents the normal delivery of oxygen and nutrients to neurons, causing many of them to die.""'The body continues to regulate blood pressure and heart rate during the first hour to hour-and-a-half after the injury, but as the reduction in the rate of blood flow becomes more widespread, self-regulation begins to turn off. Blood pressure and heart rate drop.''After the injury, an excessive release of neurotransmitters (chemicals that allow neurons to signal each other) can cause additional damage by overexciting nerve cells.''Glutamate'' is an excitatory neurotransmitter, commonly used by nerve cells in the spinal cord to stimulate activity in neurons. But when spinal cells are injured, neurons flood the area with glutamate for reasons that are not yet well understood. Excessive glutamate triggers a destructive process called excitotoxicity, which disrupts normal processes and kills neurons and other cells called oligodendrocytes that surround and protect axons.''Under normal conditions, the blood-brain barrier (which tightly controls the passage of cells and large molecules between the circulatory and central nervous systems) keeps immune system cells from entering the brain or spinal cord. But when the blood-brain barrier is broken by blood vessels bursting and leaking into spinal cord tissue, immune system cells that normally circulate in the blood - primarily white blood cells - can invade the surrounding tissue and trigger an inflammatory response. This inflammation is characterized by fluid accumulation and the influx of immune cells - neutrophils,T-cells, macrophages, and monocytes.''Neutrophils are the first to enter, within about 12 hours of injury, and they remain for about a day. Three days after the injury, T-cells arrive. Their function in the injured spinal cord is not clearly understood, but in the healthy spinal cord they kill infected cells and regulate the immune response. Macrophages and monocytes enter after the T-cells and scavenge cellular debris.''The up side of this immune system response is that it helps fight infection and cleans up debris. But the down side is that it sets off the release of cytokines - a group of immune system messenger molecules that exert a malign influence on the activities of nerve cells.''For example, microglial cells, which normally function as a kind of on-site immune cell in the spinal cord, begin to respond to signals from these cytokines. They transform into macrophage-like cells, engulf cell debris, and start to produce their own pro-inflammatory cytokines, which then stimulate and recruit other microglia to respond.''Injury also stimulates resting astrocytes to express cytokines. These ""reactive"" astrocytes may ultimately participate in the formation of ''scar tissue'' within the spinal cord.''Whether or not the immune response is protective or destructive is controversial among researchers. Some speculate that certain types of injury might evoke a protective immune response that actually reduces the loss of neurons.'""Another consequence of the immune system's entry into the CNS is that inflammation accelerates the production of highly reactive forms of oxygen molecules called free radicals.""'Free radicals are produced as a by-product of normal cell metabolism. In the healthy spinal cord their numbers are small enough that they cause no harm. But injury to the spinal cord, and the subsequent wave of inflammation that sweeps through spinal cord tissue, signals particular cells to overproduce free radicals.''Free radicals then attack and disable molecules that are crucial for cell function - for example, those found in cell membranes - by modifying their chemical structure. Free radicals can also change how cells respond to natural growth and survival factors, and turn these protective factors into agents of destruction.''Researchers used to think that the only way in which cells died during spinal cord injury was as a direct result of trauma. But recent findings have revealed that cells in the injured spinal cord also die from a kind of programmed cell death called apoptosis, often described as cellular ''suicide'', that happens days or weeks after the injury.''Apoptosis is a normal cellular event that occurs in a variety of tissues and cellular systems. It helps the body get rid of old and unhealthy cells by causing them to shrink and implode. Nearby scavenger cells then gobble up the debris. Apoptosis seems to be regulated by specific molecules that have the ability to either start or stop the process.'""For reasons that are still unclear, spinal cord injury sets off apoptosis, which kills oligodendrocytes in damaged areas of the spinal cord days to weeks after the injury. The death of oligodendrocytes is another blow to the damaged spinal cord, since these are the cells that form the myelin that wraps around axons and speeds the conduction of nerve impulses. Apoptosis strips myelin from intact axons in adjacent ascending and descending pathways, which further impairs the spinal cord's ability to communicate with the brain.""'All of these mechanisms of secondary damage - restricted blood flow, excitotoxicity, inflammation, free radical release, and apoptosis - increase the area of damage in the injured spinal cord. Damaged axons become dysfunctional, either because they are stripped of their myelin or because they are disconnected from the brain. Glial cells cluster to form a ''scar'', which creates a barrier to any axons that could potentially regenerate and reconnect. A few whole axons may remain, but not enough to convey any meaningful information to the brain.''Researchers are especially interested in studying the mechanisms of this wave of secondary damage because finding ways to stop it could save axons and reduce disabilities. This could make a big difference in the potential for recovery.' "
What Are the Immediate Treatments for Spinal Cord Injury?,"'The outcome of any injury to the spinal cord depends upon the number of axons that survive: the higher the number of normally functioning axons, the less the amount of disability. Consequently, the most important consideration when moving people to a hospital or trauma center is preventing further injury to the spine and spinal cord. '""Spinal cord injury isn't always obvious. Any injury that involves the head (especially with trauma to the front of the face), pelvic fractures, penetrating injuries in the area of the spine, or injuries that result from falling from heights should be suspect for spinal cord damage. ""'Until imaging of the spine is done at an emergency or trauma center, people who might have spinal cord injury should be cared for as if any significant movement of the spine could cause further damage. They are usually transported in a recumbent (lying down) position, with a rigid collar and backboard immobilizing the spine. ''Respiratory complications are often an indication of the severity of spinal cord injury. About one third of those with injury to the neck area will need help with breathing and require respiratory support via ''intubation'', which involves inserting a tube connected to an oxygen tank through the nose or throat and into the ''airway''. ''Methylprednisolone, a steroid drug, became standard treatment for acute spinal cord injury in 1990 when a large-scale clinical trial supported by the national Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' showed significantly better recovery in patients who were given the drug within the first 8 hours after their injury. Methylprednisolone appears to reduce the damage to nerve cells and decreases inflammation near the injury site by suppressing activities of immune cells. ''Realignment of the spine using a rigid brace or axial traction is usually done as soon as possible to stabilize the spine and prevent additional damage.''On about the third day after the injury, doctors give patients a complete neurological examination to diagnose the severity of the injury and predict the likely extent of recovery. The ASIA Impairment Scale is the standard diagnostic tool used by doctors. X-rays, ''MRIs'', or more advanced imaging techniques are also used to visualize the entire length of the spine. ''Spinal cord injuries are classified as either complete or incomplete, depending on how much cord width is injured. An incomplete injury means that the ability of the spinal cord to convey messages to or from the brain is not completely lost. People with incomplete injuries retain some motor or sensory function below the injury. ''A complete injury is indicated by a total lack of sensory and motor function below the level of injury.' "
How Does a Spinal Cord Injury Affect the Rest of the Body?,"'People who survive a spinal cord injury will most likely have medical complications such as ''chronic pain'' and bladder and bowel dysfunction, along with an increased susceptibility to respiratory and heart problems. Successful recovery depends upon how well these chronic conditions are handled day to day.''Any injury to the spinal cord at or above the C3, C4, and C5 segments, which supply the phrenic nerves leading to the diaphragm, can stop breathing. People with these injuries need immediate ventilatory support. When injuries are at the C5 level and below, diaphragm function is preserved, but breathing tends to be rapid and shallow and people have trouble ''coughing'' and clearing secretions from their lungs because of weak thoracic muscles. Once pulmonary function improves, a large percentage of those with C4 injuries can be weaned from mechanical ventilation in the weeks following the injury.''Respiratory complications, primarily as a result of ''pneumonia'', are a leading cause of death in people with spinal cord injury. In fact, intubation increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated ''pneumonia'' (VAP) by 1 to 3 percent per day of intubation. More than a quarter of the deaths caused by spinal cord injury are the result of VAP. Spinal cord injury patients who are intubated have to be carefully monitored for VAP and treated with antibiotics if symptoms appear.''Spinal cord injuries in the cervical region are often accompanied by blood pressure instability and heart arrhythmias. Because of interruptions to the cardiac accelerator nerves, the heart can beat at a dangerously slow pace, or it can pound rapidly and irregularly. Arrhythmias usually appear in the first 2 weeks after injury and are more common and severe in the most serious injuries.''Low blood pressure'' also often occurs due to loss of tone in blood vessels, which widen and cause blood to pool in the small arteries far away from the heart. This is usually treated with an intravenous infusion to build up blood volume.''People with spinal cord injuries are at triple the usual risk for blood clots. The risk for clots is low in the first 72 hours, but afterwards anticoagulation drug therapy can be used as a preventive measure.''Many of our reflex movements are controlled by the spinal cord but regulated by the brain. When the spinal cord is damaged, information from the brain can no longer regulate reflex activity. Reflexes may become exaggerated over time, causing ''spasticity''. If spasms become severe enough, they may require medical treatment. For some, spasms can be as much of a help as they are a hindrance, since spasms can tone muscles that would otherwise waste away. Some people can even learn to use the increased tone in their legs to help them turn over in bed, propel them into and out of a wheelchair, or stand.''Autonomic dysreflexia'"" is a life-threatening reflex action that primarily affects those with injuries to the neck or upper back. It happens when there is an irritation, pain, or stimulus to the nervous system below the level of injury. The irritated area tries to send a signal to the brain, but since the signal isn't able to get through, a reflex action occurs without the brain's regulation. Unlike spasms that affect muscles, autonomic dysreflexia affects vascular and organ systems controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.""'Anything that causes pain or irritation can set off autonomic dysreflexia: the urge to urinate or defecate, pressure sores, cuts, ''burns'', ''bruises'', ''sunburn'', pressure of any kind on the body, ''ingrown toenails'', or tight clothing. For example, the impulse to urinate can set off ''high blood pressure'' or ''rapid heart beat'' that, if uncontrolled, can cause ''stroke'', ''seizures'', or death. Symptoms such as flushing or ''sweating'', a pounding ''headache'', ''anxiety'', sudden ''high blood pressure'', vision changes, or goosebumps on the arms and legs can signal the onset of autonomic dysreflexia. Treatment should be swift. Changing position, emptying the bladder or bowels, and removing or loosening tight clothing are just a few of the possibilities that should be tried to relieve whatever is causing the irritation.'""Pressure sores are areas of skin tissue that have broken down because of continuous pressure on the skin. People with paraplegia and quadriplegia are susceptible to pressure sores because they can't move easily on their own.""'Places that support weight when someone is seated or recumbent are vulnerable areas. When these areas press against a surface for a long period of time, the skin compresses and reduces the flow of blood to the area. When the blood supply is blocked for too long, the skin will begin to break down.''Since spinal cord injury reduces or eliminates sensation below the level of injury, people may not be aware of the normal signals to change position, and must be shifted periodically by a ''caregiver''. Good ''nutrition'' and hygiene can also help prevent pressure sores by encouraging healthy skin.''People who are paralyzed often have what is called neurogenic pain resulting from damage to nerves in the spinal cord. For some survivors of spinal cord injury, pain or an intense burning or stinging sensation is unremitting due to hypersensitivity in some parts of the body. Others are prone to normal ''musculoskeletal pain'' as well, such as ''shoulder pain'' due to overuse of the shoulder joint from pushing a wheelchair and using the arms for transfers. Treatments for ''chronic pain'' include medications, ''acupuncture'', spinal or brain electrical stimulation, and surgery.'""Most spinal cord injuries affect bladder and bowel functions because the nerves that control the involved organs originate in the segments near the lower termination of the spinal cord and are cut off from brain input. Without coordination from the brain, the muscles of the bladder and urethra can't work together effectively, and urination becomes abnormal. The bladder can empty suddenly without warning, or become over-full without releasing. In some cases the bladder releases, but urine backs up into the kidneys because it isn't able to get past the urethral sphincter. Most people with spinal cord injuries use either intermittent catheterization or an indwelling catheter to empty their bladders.""'Bowel function is similarly affected. The anal sphincter muscle can remain tight, so that bowel movements happen on a reflex basis whenever the bowel is full. Or the muscle can be permanently relaxed, which is called a ""flaccid bowel,"" and result in an inability to have a bowel movement. This requires more frequent attempts to empty the bowel and manual removal of ''stool'' to prevent fecal impaction. People with spinal cord injuries are usually put on a regularly scheduled bowel program to prevent accidents.''Spinal cord injury has a greater impact on sexual and reproductive function in men than it does in women. Most spinal cord injured women remain ''fertile'' and can conceive and bear children. Even those with severe injury may well retain orgasmic function, although many lose some if not all of their ability to reach satisfaction.''Depending on the level of injury, men may have problems with erections and ejaculation, and most will have compromised ''fertility'' due to decreased motility of their sperm. Treatments for men include vibratory or electrical stimulation and ''drugs'' such as ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''). Many couples may also need assisted fertility treatments to allow a spinal cord injured man to father children.''Once someone has survived the injury and begun to psychologically and emotionally cope with the nature of his or her situation, the next concern will be how to live with disabilities. Doctors are now able to predict with reasonable accuracy the likely long-term outcome of spinal cord injuries. This helps patients set achievable goals for themselves, and gives families and loved ones a realistic set of expectations for the future. ' "
How Does Rehabilitation Help People Recover From Spinal Cord Injuries?,"""No two people will experience the same emotions after surviving a spinal cord injury, but almost everyone will feel frightened, anxious, or confused about what has happened. It's common for people to have very mixed feelings: relief that they are still alive, but disbelief at the nature of their disabilities.""'Rehabilitation programs combine physical therapies with skill-building activities and counseling to provide social and emotional support. The education and active involvement of the newly injured person and his or her family and friends is crucial. ''A rehabilitation team is usually led by a doctor specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation (called a physiatrist), and often includes social workers, physical and occupational therapists, recreational therapists, rehabilitation nurses, rehabilitation psychologists, vocational counselors, nutritionists, and other specialists. A case-worker or program manager coordinates care. ''In the initial phase of rehabilitation, therapists emphasize regaining leg and arm strength since mobility and communication are the two most important areas of function. For some, mobility will only be possible with the assistance of devices such as a walker, leg ''braces'', or a wheelchair. Communication skills, such as writing, typing, and using the telephone, may also require adaptive devices. ''Physical therapy includes ''exercise'' programs geared toward muscle strengthening. Occupational therapy helps redevelop fine motor skills. Bladder and bowel management programs teach basic toileting routines, and patients also learn techniques for self-grooming. People acquire coping strategies for recurring episodes of spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, and neurogenic pain.''Vocational rehabilitation begins with an assessment of basic work skills, current dexterity, and physical and cognitive capabilities to determine the likelihood for employment. A vocational rehabilitation specialist then identifies potential work places, determines the type of assistive equipment that will be needed, and helps arrange for a user-friendly workplace. For those whose disabilities prevent them from returning to the workplace, therapists focus on encouraging productivity through participation in activities that provide a sense of satisfaction and self-esteem. This could include educational classes, hobbies, memberships in special interest groups, and participation in family and community events. ''Recreation therapy encourages patients to build on their abilities so that they can participate in recreational or athletic activities at their level of mobility. Engaging in recreational outlets and athletics helps those with spinal cord injuries achieve a more balanced and normal lifestyle and also provides opportunities for socialization and self-expression. ' "
How Is Research Helping Spinal Cord Injury Patients?,"'Can an injured spinal cord be rebuilt? This is the question that drives basic research in the field of spinal cord injury. As investigators try to understand the underlying biological mechanisms that either inhibit or promote new growth in the spinal cord, they are making surprising discoveries, not just about how neurons and their axons grow in the CNS, but also about why they fail to regenerate after injury in the adult CNS. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in both the working and the damaged spinal cord could point the way to therapies that might prevent secondary damage, encourage axons to grow past injured areas, and reconnect vital neural circuits within the spinal cord and CNS. ''There has been successful research in a number of fields that may someday help people with spinal cord injuries. Genetic studies have revealed a number of molecules that encourage axon growth in the developing CNS but prevent it in the adult. Research into embryonic and adult stem cell biology has furthered knowledge about how cells communicate with each other. ''Basic research has helped describe the mechanisms involved in the mysterious process of apoptosis, in which large groups of seemingly healthy cells self-destruct. New rehabilitation therapies that retrain neural circuits through forced motion and electrical stimulation of muscle groups are helping injured patients regain lost function. ''Researchers, many of whom are supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), are focused on advancing our understanding of the four key principles of spinal cord repair: ''A spinal cord injury is complex. Repairing it has to take into account all of the different kinds of damage that occur during and after the injury. Because the molecular and cellular environment of the spinal cord is constantly changing from the moment of injury until several weeks or even months later, combination therapies will have to be designed to address specific types of damage at different points in time. ''A decade ago, researchers demonstrated a small but significant neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect from an adrenal ''corticosteroid'' drug called methylprednisolone if it was given within 8 hours of injury. It is the only treatment currently available to limit the extent of spinal cord injury and its risks are relatively low. Researchers continue to search for additional anti-inflammatory treatments that might prove even more effective. ''Preliminary ''clinical trials'' of another compound, ''GM-1 ganglioside'', indicate that it could be useful in preventing secondary damage in acute spinal cord injury. A large, randomized clinical trial suggested that it might also improve neurological recovery from spinal cord injury during rehabilitation. ''These observations and others have led to optimism that recovery can be improved by altering cellular responses immediately after injury. Using what they know about the mechanisms that cause secondary damage - excitotoxicity, inflammation, and cell ''suicide'' (apoptosis) - researchers are creating and testing additional neuroprotective therapies to prevent the spread of post-injury damage and preserve surrounding tissue. ''Some of the findings in these three different areas follow:''When nerve cells die, they release excessive amounts of a neurotransmitter called glutamate. Since surviving nerve cells also release glutamate as part of their normal communication process, excess glutamate floods the cellular environment, which pushes cells into overdrive and self-destruction. Researchers are investigating compounds that could keep nerve cells from responding to glutamate, potentially minimizing the extent of secondary damage. ''Recently, investigators tested agents called receptor antagonists that selectively block a specific type of glutamate receptor that is abundant on oligodendrocytes and neurons. These agents appear to be effective at limiting damage. Some of these receptor antagonists have already been tested in human trials as a therapy for ''stroke''. Similar agents could enter clinical trials within several years for patients with spinal cord injury. ''Some time within the first 12 hours after injury, the first wave of immune cells enters the damaged spinal cord to protect it from infection and clean up dead nerve cells. Other types of immune cells enter afterwards. The actions of these immune cells and the messenger molecules they release, called cytokines, are the hallmarks of inflammation in the spinal cord.'""Researchers have discovered that these inflammatory processes aren't entirely bad for the injured spinal cord. Although cytokines can be toxic to nerve cells because they stimulate the production of free radicals, nitric oxide, and other inflammatory substances that cause cell death, they also stimulate the production of neurotrophic factors, which are beneficial to cell repair.""'Currently researchers are looking for ways to control these immune system cells and the molecules they produce by encouraging their potential for neuroprotection and reining in their neurotoxic effects. One approach being tested clinically is to exploit the ability of the PNS to mount a healing response in macrophages by injecting macrophages already stimulated by injured peripheral nerves into injured spinal cords. Recent experiments have indicated that selectively boosting the T-cell response to spinal cord injury could reduce secondary damage. Because of the possibility that these cells can also damage tissue, they must be very carefully controlled if they are to be used therapeutically.''Clinical investigators are also looking at how cooling the body protects surviving spinal cord tissue and nerve cells. Experiments have shown that cooling the body to a state of mild ''hypothermia'"" (about 92° F) for several hours immediately following the injury limits damage and promotes functional recovery. Researchers aren't yet sure why mild hypothermia is neuroprotective, but the ability of body temperature to affect many different kinds of physiological mechanisms may be one of the reasons.""""Days to weeks after the initial injury, apoptosis sweeps through oligodendrocytes in damaged and nearby tissue, causing the cells to self-destruct. Although genes have been identified that appear to regulate apoptosis, researchers still don't know enough to be able to specify the exact biochemical events that cause a cell to switch it on - or turn it off. Further studies are aimed at understanding these cellular mechanisms more fully. These studies will provide an opportunity to develop neural protective strategies to combat apoptotic cell death.""'By understanding the process of apoptosis, researchers have been able to develop and test apoptosis-inhibiting drugs. In rodent models, animals given a drug that blocks a known apoptotic mechanism retained more ambulatory ability after traumatic spinal cord injury than did untreated animals.''Once the secondary wave of damage ends, the spinal cord is left with areas of scar tissue and fluid-filled gaps, or ''cysts'"", that axons can't penetrate or ""'bridge''. Unless these areas are reconnected by functioning nerve cells, the spinal cord remains disabled. Discovering how to bridge the gap between functioning axons and figuring out how to encourage axons to grow and make new connections could be the key to spinal cord repair.''Researchers are experimenting with cell grafts transplanted into the injured spinal cord that act as ''bridges'' across injured areas to reconnect cut axons, or that supply nerve cells to act as relays. Several types of cells have been studied for their potential to promote regeneration and repair, including Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing glia, fetal spinal cord cells, and embryonic ''stem cells''. In one group of experiments, investigators have implanted tubes packed with Schwann cells into the damaged spinal cords of rodents and observed axons growing into the tubes.'""One of the limitations of cell transplants, however, is that the growth environment within the transplant is so favorable that most axons don't leave and extend into the spinal cord. By using olfactory ensheathing glia cells, which are natural migrators in the PNS, researchers have gotten axons to extend out of the initial transplant region and into the spinal cord. But it remains to be seen whether or not regenerated axons are fully functional.""'Fetal spinal cord tissue implants have also yielded success in animal trials, giving rise to new neurons, which, when stimulated by growth-promoting factors (neurotrophins), extend axons that stretch up and down several segments in the spinal cord. Animals treated in these trials have regained some function in their limbs. Some patients with long-term spinal cord injuries have received fetal tissue transplants but the results have been inconclusive. In animal models, these transplants appear to be more effective in the immature spinal cord than in the adult spinal cord.''Stem cells are capable of dividing and yielding almost all the cell types of the body, including those of the spinal cord. Their potential to treat spinal cord injury is being investigated eagerly, but there are many things about stem cells that researchers still need to understand. For example, researchers know there are many different kinds of chemical signals that tell a stem cell what to do. Some of these are internal to the stem cell, but many others are external - within the cellular environment - and will have to be recreated in the transplant region to encourage proper growth and differentiation. Because of the complexities involved in stem cell treatment, researchers expect these kinds of therapies to be possible only after much more research is done.''Researchers are also looking at ways to compensate for axons that, having lost their myelin sheaths, have a decreased ability to conduct the electrical impulses essential for axonal communication. Preliminary studies with compounds known as potassium channel blockers, which block the flow of ions through the demyelinated membrane and increase the potential for messages to get through, have shown some success, but mostly in terms of reducing spasticity in muscles. Further studies might show how remyelinating axons could also improve function.''Stimulating the regeneration of axons is a key component of spinal cord repair because every axon in the injured spinal cord that can be reconnected increases the chances for recovery of function.''Research on many fronts reveals that getting axons to grow after injury is a complicated task. CNS neurons have the capacity to regenerate, but the environment in the adult spinal cord does not encourage growth. Not only does it lack the growth-promoting molecules that are present in the developing CNS, it also contains substances that actively inhibit axon extension. For axon regeneration to be successful, the environment has to be changed to turn off the inhibitors and turn on the promoters.''Investigators are looking for ways to take advantage of the chemicals that drive or halt axon growth: growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting substances, neurotrophic factors, and guidance molecules.''In the developing CNS, thread-like axons grow and lengthen behind the axonal growth cone, an active tip only a few thousandths of a millimeter in diameter, which interacts with chemical signals that encourage growth and direct movement. But the environment of the adult CNS is hostile to axon growth, primarily because growth-inhibiting proteins are embedded in myelin, the insulating material around axons. These proteins appear to preserve neural circuits in the healthy spinal cord and keep intact axons from growing inappropriately. But when the spinal cord is injured, these proteins prevent regeneration.''At least three growth-inhibitory proteins operating within the axonal tract have been identified. The task of researchers is to understand how these inhibitory proteins do their job, and then discover ways to remove or block them, or change how the growth cone responds to them.''Growth-inhibiting proteins also block the glial scar near the injury site. To get past, an axon has to advance between the tangles of long, branching molecules that form the extracellular matrix. A recent experiment successfully used a bacterial enzyme to clear away this underbrush so that axons could grow.''A treatment that combines both these approaches - turning off growth-inhibiting proteins and using enzymes to clear the way - could create an encouraging environment for axon regeneration. But before trials of such a treatment can be attempted in patients, researchers must be sure that it could be controlled well enough to prevent dangerous miswiring of regenerating axons.''Neurotrophic factors (or neurotrophins) are key nervous system regulatory proteins that prime cells to produce the molecular machinery necessary for growth. Some prevent oligodendrocyte death, others promote axon regrowth and survival, and still others serve multiple functions. Unfortunately, the natural production of neurotrophins in the spinal cord falls instead of rises during the weeks after injury. Researchers have tested whether artificially raising the levels post-injury can enhance regeneration. Some of these investigations have been successful. Infusion pumps and gene therapy techniques have been used to deliver growth factors to injured neurons, but they appear to encourage sprouting more than they stimulate regeneration for long distances.'""Axonal growth isn't enough for functional recovery. Axons have to make the proper connections and re-establish functioning synapses. Guidance molecules, proteins that rest on or are released from the surfaces of neurons or glia, act as chemical road signs, beckoning axons to grow in some directions and repelling growth in others.""""Supplying a particular combination of guidance molecules or administering compounds that induce surviving cells to produce or use guidance molecules might encourage regeneration. But at the moment, researchers don't understand enough about guidance molecules to know which to supply and when.""'Researchers hope that combining these strategies to encourage growth, clear away debris, and target axon connections could reconnect the spinal cord. Of course, all these therapies would have to be provided in the right amounts, in the right places, and at the right times. As researchers learn more and understand more about the intricacies of axon growth and regeneration, combining therapies could become a powerful treatment for spinal cord injury. ''Advances in basic research are also being matched by progress in clinical research, especially in understanding the kinds of physical rehabilitation that work best to restore function. Some of the more promising rehabilitation techniques are helping spinal cord injury patients become more mobile. ''While basic scientists strive to develop strategies to restore neurological connections between the brain and body of spinal cord injured persons, bioengineers are working to restore functional connections via advanced computer modeling systems and neural prostheses. Discovering ways to integrate devices that could mobilize paralyzed limbs requires a unique interface between electronics technology and neurobiology. A functional electrical stimulation (FES) system is one example of this kind of innovative research.''FES systems use electrical stimulators to control muscles of the legs and arms to encourage functional walking and to stimulate reaching and gripping. Electrodes are taped to the skin over nerves or surgically implanted and then controlled by a computer system under the command of the user. For example, to assist reaching, electrodes can be placed in the shoulder and upper arm and controlled by movements of the opposite shoulder. Through a computer interface, the spinal cord injured person can then trigger hand and arm movements in one arm by shrugging the opposite shoulder.''These systems are useful not just for restoring functional movements. They also help people exercise paralyzed muscle systems, which can provide significant cardiovascular benefits. So far, relatively few people utilize them because the movements are so robotic, they require extensive surgery and electrode placement, and the computer interface systems are still limited. Bioengineers are working to develop more natural interfaces.'""Because the brain plans voluntary movements several seconds before the command is sent out to the muscles, people whose spinal cords no longer carry signals to their limbs might still be able to complete the planning phase in their brains but use a robotic device to carry out the command. A recent experiment used microwires implanted in the motor cortex area of the brain (in this case a monkey's brain) to record brain-wave activity, which was then relayed to a computer that analyzed the data, predicted the movement, and sent the command to a robotic arm. A device such as this could be used to control a wheelchair, a prosthetic limb, or even a patient's own arms and legs.""'In the future, researchers expect that these kinds of brain-machine interfaces could be planted directly into the brain using microchips that would do the processing and transmit the results without wires. Work is already being done with hybrid neural interfaces, implantable electronic devices with a biological component that encourages cells to integrate into the host nervous system.'""Scientists have known for years that animals' spinal cords contain networks of neurons called central pattern generators (CPG) that produce rhythmic flexing and extension of the muscles used in walking. They assumed, however, that the bipedal walking of humans was more dependent on voluntary control than on CPG activation. Therefore, scientists thought that without control from the brain, movements produced by a spinal CPG weren't likely to be useful in restoring successful walking without regulation from the brain. Current research is showing, however, that these networks can be retrained after spinal cord injury to restore limited mobility to the legs.""""Using a technique called sensory patterned feedback, researchers are attempting to retrain CPG networks in spinal cord injured patients with special programs that break down walking movements into their component patterns and force paralyzed limbs to repeat them over and over again. In one of these programs, the patient is partially supported by a harness above a moving treadmill while a therapist moves the patient's legs in a stepping motion. Other researchers are experimenting with combining body weight support and electrical stimulation with actual walking rather than treadmill training.""'Another technique uses an FES bicycle in which electrodes are attached to hamstrings, ''quadriceps'', and gluteal muscles to stimulate the pedaling motion. Several studies have shown that these exercises can improve gait and balance, and increase walking speed. NINDS is currently funding a clinical trial with paraplegic and quadriplegic subjects to test the benefits of partial weight-supported walking.'""The timing of surgical decompression (alleviating pressure on the spinal cord from fractured or dislocated vertebrae or disks) is a controversial topic. Animal studies have shown that early decompression can reduce secondary damage, but similar results haven't been reliably reproduced in human trials. Other studies have shown neurological improvement without decompression surgery, which has led some to believe that either avoiding or delaying surgery, and using pharmacologic interventions instead, is a reasonable (and non-invasive) treatment for spinal cord injuries. Additional research is needed to determine if early surgical intervention is sufficiently beneficial to offset the risk of major surgery in acute trauma.""'Two thirds of people with spinal cord injury report pain and a third of those rate their pain as severe. Nonetheless, both diagnosis and treatment of post-injury pain still remain a clinical challenge. There is no universally recognized scheme for classifying pain from spinal cord injury, nor is there a uniformly successful medical or surgical treatment to prevent or reduce it. The mainstays of ''neuropathic pain'' treatment are ''antidepressants'' and anticonvulsants, even though they are not uniformly effective.''Research suggests that spinal cord pain syndromes stem from the spread of secondary damage to spinal cord segments above and below the injury site. Pain can be at the level of the injury or below the level of the injury, even in areas where sensation is limited or absent. Findings indicate that at-level (junctional) pain probably results from damage to grey and white matter one or more segments above the injury site, whereas pain below the injury results from the interruption of axon pathways and the formation of abnormal connections within the spinal cord near the site of injury.''Studies suggest that functional changes in neurons, which make them hyperexcitable, could be a cause of chronic pain syndromes. Consequently, giving more aggressive treatment for spinal cord injury in the first few hours after injury could limit secondary damage and prevent or reduce the development of chronic pain afterwards.''Investigators are currently testing neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory strategies to calm overexcited neurons. Other studies are also looking at pharmacological options, including sodium channel blockers (such as ''lidocaine'' and ''mexiletine''), opioids (such as alfentanil and ketamine), and a combination of morphine andclonidine. Drugs that interfere with neurotransmitters involved in pain syndromes, such as glutamate, are also being investigated. Other researchers are exploring the use of genetically engineered cells to deliver pain-relieving neurotransmitters. These treatments appear to alleviate pain in animal models and in preliminary clinical studies with terminally ill ''cancer'' patients. ''The mechanisms of muscle spasticity after spinal cord injury are not well understood. Recent studies indicate that the loss of particular descending axonal pathways most likely results in the decreased activity of inhibitory interneurons, which causes the overreaction of motor neurons to excitatory stimuli.''Unlike treatments for post-injury pain, medical and surgical treatments for spasticity are established and highly successful. These include oral medications that act within the central nervous system (''baclofen'' and ''diazepam'') and one that acts directly on skeletal muscle (''dantrolene''). For spasticity that is resistant to drug interventions, surgical rhizotomy or myelotomy is sometimes performed to sever reflex pathways.''Investigators are currently exploring neuromodulation procedures based on preliminary results showing that electrical spinal cord stimulation below the injury can modulate spasms. Other techniques used clinically and experimentally involve implanting pump systems that continuously supply antispasmodic drugs such as baclofen.''A promising area of research on treatments for bladder dysfunction involves using electrical stimulation and neuromodulation to achieve bladder control. The current treatment for reflex ''incontinence'' includes a surgical procedure that cuts the sacral sensory nerve roots from S2 to S4. With the hope that a cure for spinal cord injury could be imminent, and the reluctance among men to lose any of their already compromised sexual function, few patients are willing to have these nerves cut.''Development of a sacral posterior and anterior root stimulator implant is being explored to better coordinate bladder and sphincter contractions. In preliminary studies people were able to achieve suppression of reflex incontinence and clinically useful increases in bladder volume with the use of the implanted stimulator.''Researchers hope that by combining neuromodulation for reflex incontinence with neurostimulation for bladder emptying, the bladder could be completely controlled without having to cut any sacral sensory nerves.''Sperm count in men may or may not change due to spinal cord injury, but sperm motility often does. Researchers are investigating whether or not spinal cord injury causes changes in the chemical composition of semen that make it hostile to sperm viability. Preliminary studies show that the semen of men with spinal cord injury contains abnormally high levels of immunologically active leukocytes, which appear to have a negative impact on sperm motility.''Recent animal studies have revealed what appears to be a neural circuit within the spinal cord that is critical for triggering ejaculation in animal models and may play the same role in humans. Triggering ejaculation by stimulating these cells might be a better option than some of the current, more invasive methods, such as electroejaculation.

The Future of Spinal Cord Research,"'Fueled by significant federal and private funding, the past decade of spinal cord injury research has produced a wealth of discoveries that are making the repair of injured spinal cords a reachable goal. This is good news for the 10,000 to 12,000 Americans every year who sustain these traumatic injuries. ''Because spinal cord injuries happen predominantly to people under the age of 30, the human cost is high. Major improvements in emergency and acute care have improved survival rates but have also increased the numbers of individuals who have to cope with severe disabilities for the rest of their lives. The cost to society, in terms of health care costs, disability payments, and lost income, is disproportionately high compared to other medical conditions. ''Considering the biological complexity of spinal cord injury, discovering successful ways to repair injuries and create rehabilitative strategies that significantly reduce disabilities is not an easy task. Researchers, many of them supported by the NINDS, are actively developing innovative research strategies aimed at making the kinds of exciting new discoveries that will translate into better clinical care and better lives for all.

What functions do the different parts of the brain control?,"'The brain has three major parts:''The spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body.''The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch.' The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). It controls movement, balance, and posture. The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord. It is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). The brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used to see, hear, walk, talk, and eat."
What is brain tumor? What is a spinal cord tumor?,"'An adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and/or spinal cord.''There are many types of brain and spinal cord tumors. The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord. Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS).''The tumors may be either benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer):''When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors cause signs and symptoms and need treatment.''Brain and spinal cord tumors can occur in both adults and children. However, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults.' Benign brain and spinal cord tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other tissues and may recur (come back). Malignant brain and spinal cord tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue."
Signs and symptoms of brain and spinal cord tumors in adults,"'The signs and symptoms of adult brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every person.''Signs and symptoms depend on the following:''Signs and symptoms may be caused by CNS tumors or by other conditions, including cancer that has spread to the brain. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'  Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord. What the affected part of the brain controls. The size of the tumor. Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting. Seizures. Vision, hearing, and speech problems. Loss of appetite. Frequent nausea and vomiting. Changes in personality, mood, ability to focus, or behavior. Loss of balance and trouble walking. Weakness. Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level. Back pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs. A change in bowel habits or trouble urinating. Weakness or numbness in the arms or legs. Trouble walking."
Metastatic brain and spinal cord tumors in adults,"'Tumors that start in the brain are called primary brain tumors. Primary brain tumors may spread to other parts of the brain or to the spine. They rarely spread to other parts of the body.''Often, tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain. These are called metastatic brain tumors (or brain metastases). Metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors.''Up to half of metastatic brain tumors are from ''lung cancer''. Other types of cancer that commonly spread to the brain include:''Cancer may spread to the leptomeninges (the two innermost membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). This is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The most common cancers that spread to the leptomeninges include:' Melanoma Breast cancer Colon cancer Kidney cancer Nasopharyngeal cancer Cancer of unknown primary site Breast cancer Lung cancer Leukemia Lymphoma"
WHO Tumor Grading System," Grade I (low-grade) — The tumor cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than grade II, III, and IV tumor cells. They rarely spread into nearby tissues. Grade I brain tumors may be cured if they are completely removed by surgery. Grade II - The tumor cells grow and spread more slowly than grade III and IV tumor cells. They may spread into nearby tissue and may recur (come back). Some tumors may become a higher-grade tumor. Grade III - The tumor cells look very different from normal cells under a microscope and grow more quickly than grade I and II tumor cells. They are likely to spread into nearby tissue. Grade IV (high-grade) - The tumor cells do not look like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread very quickly. There may be areas of dead cells in the tumor. Grade IV tumors usually cannot be cured."
Genetic syndromes and risks,"'Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. There are few known risk factors for brain tumors. The following conditions may increase the risk of certain types of brain tumors:''The cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known.' Being exposed to vinyl chloride may increase the risk of glioma. Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, having AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), or receiving an organ transplant may increase the risk of primary CNS lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma for more information.) Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk brain tumors:Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or 2 (NF2)von Hippel-Lindau diseaseTuberous sclerosisLi-Fraumeni syndromeTurcot syndrome type 1 or 2Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or 2 (NF2) von Hippel-Lindau disease Tuberous sclerosis Li-Fraumeni syndrome Turcot syndrome type 1 or 2 Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome"
Types of brain tumors in adults,"'An astrocytic tumor begins in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An astrocyte is a type of glial cell. Glial cells sometimes form tumors called gliomas. Astrocytic tumors include:''An oligodendroglial tumor begins in brain cells called oligodendrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An oligodendrocyte is a type of glial cell. Oligodendrocytes sometimes form tumors called oligodendrogliomas. Grades of oligodendroglial tumors include the following:''A mixed glioma is a brain tumor that has two types of tumor cells in it — oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This type of mixed tumor is called an oligoastrocytoma.''An ependymal tumor usually begins in cells that line the fluid-filled spaces in the brain and around the spinal cord. An ependymal tumor may also be called an ependymoma. Grades of ependymomas include the following:''A medulloblastoma is a type of embryonal tumor. Medulloblastomas are most common in children or young adults.''A pineal parenchymal tumor forms in parenchymal cells or pineocytes, which are the cells that make up most of the pineal gland. These tumors are different from pineal astrocytic tumors. Grades of pineal parenchymal tumors include the following:''A meningeal tumor, also called a meningioma, forms in the meninges (thin layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord). It can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells. Meningiomas are most common in adults. Types of meningeal tumors include the following:''A hemangiopericytoma is not a meningeal tumor but is treated like a grade II or III meningioma. A hemangiopericytoma usually forms in the dura mater. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery.''A germ cell tumor forms in germ cells, which are the cells that develop into sperm in men or ova (eggs) in women. There are different types of germ cell tumors. These include germinomas, teratomas, embryonal yolk sac carcinomas, and choriocarcinomas. Germ cell tumors can be either benign or malignant.''A craniopharyngioma is a rare tumor that usually forms in the center of the brain just above the ''pituitary gland'' (a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands). Craniopharyngiomas can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells.' Brain stem glioma (usually high grade): A brain stem glioma forms in the brain stem, which is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord. It is often a high-grade tumor, which spreads widely through the brain stem and is hard to cure. Brain stem gliomas are rare in adults. Pineal astrocytic tumor (any grade): A pineal astrocytic tumor forms in tissue around the pineal gland and may be any grade. The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the brain that makes melatonin, a hormone that helps control the sleeping and waking cycle. Pilocytic astrocytoma (grade I): A pilocytic astrocytoma grows slowly in the brain or spinal cord. It may be in the form of a cyst and rarely spreads into nearby tissues. Pilocytic astrocytomas can often be cured. Diffuse astrocytoma (grade II): A diffuse astrocytoma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, a diffuse astrocytoma can be cured. It is also called a low-grade diffuse astrocytoma. Anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic astrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. An anaplastic astrocytoma is also called a malignant astrocytoma or high-grade astrocytoma. Glioblastoma (grade IV): A glioblastoma grows and spreads very quickly. The tumor cells look very different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. It is also called glioblastoma multiforme. Oligodendroglioma (grade II): An oligodendroglioma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligodendroglioma can be cured. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade III): An anaplastic oligodendroglioma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. Oligoastrocytoma (grade II): An oligoastrocytoma is a slow-growing tumor. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligoastrocytoma can be cured. Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor has a worse prognosis than oligoastrocytoma (grade II). Ependymoma (grade I or II): A grade I or II ependymoma grows slowly and has cells that look something like normal cells. There are two types of grade I ependymoma - myxopapillary ependymoma and subependymoma. A grade II ependymoma grows in a ventricle (fluid-filled space in the brain) and its connecting paths or in the spinal cord. In some cases, a grade I or II ependymoma can be cured. Anaplastic ependymoma (grade III): An anaplastic ependymoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually has a worse prognosis than a grade I or II ependymoma. Pineocytoma (grade II): A pineocytoma is a slow-growing pineal tumor. Pineoblastoma (grade IV): A pineoblastoma is a rare tumor that is very likely to spread. Meningioma (grade I): A grade I meningioma is the most common type of meningeal tumor. A grade I meningioma is a slow-growing tumor. It forms most often in the dura mater. A grade I meningioma can be cured if it is completely removed by surgery. Meningioma (grade II and III): This is a rare meningeal tumor. It grows quickly and is likely to spread within the brain and spinal cord. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery."
How are brain and spinal cord tumors diagnosed?,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Neurological exam: A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a person’s mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. Visual field exam: An exam to check a person’s field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight. Tumor marker test: A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. This test may be done to diagnose a germ cell tumor. Gene testing: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for changes in a chromosome that has been linked with a certain type of brain tumor. This test may be done to diagnose an inherited syndrome. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). MRI is often used to diagnose tumors in the spinal cord. Sometimes a procedure called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is done during the MRI scan. An MRS is used to diagnose tumors, based on their chemical make-up. SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the brain. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan. SPECT is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. PET is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body."
Brain and spinal cord biopsy,"'The pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and grade of brain tumor. The grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.''The following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed:''For some tumors, a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. These tumors are diagnosed and treated based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures.''Sometimes the results of imaging tests and other procedures show that the tumor is very likely to be benign and a biopsy is not done.' Stereotactic biopsy: When imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place, a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done. This kind of biopsy uses a computer and a 3-dimensional (3-D) scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the tissue. A small incision is made in the scalp and a small hole is drilled through the skull. A biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Open biopsy: When imaging tests show that there may be a tumor that can be removed by surgery, an open biopsy may be done. A part of the skull is removed in an operation called a craniotomy. A sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. If cancer cells are found, some or all of the tumor may be removed during the same surgery. Tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function. There are also ways to test brain function during surgery. The doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain. Immunohistochemistry: A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. Light and electron microscopy: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells. Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes."
What are the treatment options for brain and spinal cord tumors in adults?,"'Five types of standard treatment are used to treat adult brain and spinal cord tumors.''Active surveillance is closely watching a patient’s condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery, which can cause side effects or other problems. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule. Active surveillance may be used for very slow-growing tumors that do not cause symptoms.''Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat adult brain and spinal cord tumors. Removing tumor tissue helps decrease pressure of the tumor on nearby parts of the brain. See the General Information section of this summary.''Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include:''Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.''Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain or spinal cord. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult central nervous system tumors.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. To treat brain tumors, a wafer that dissolves may be used to deliver an anticancer drug directly to the brain tumor site after the tumor has been removed by surgery. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain.''Anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Instead, an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill cancer cells there. This is called ''intrathecal chemotherapy''.''Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.''Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.''Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Bevacizumab is used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.''Other types of targeted therapies are being studied for adult brain tumors, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and new VEGF inhibitors.''Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.''This therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment and improves quality of life. For brain tumors, supportive care includes drugs to control seizures and fluid buildup or swelling in the brain.'  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. Stereotactic radiosurgery: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor. This procedure does not involve surgery. It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery."
New types of clinical trial treatments for brain and spinal cord tumors in adults,"'This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied.''Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged pieces of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues. It is used to treat cancers of the head, neck, and spine and organs such as the brain, eye, lung, and prostate. Proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation.''Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called ''biotherapy'' or immunotherapy.''Biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors. Treatments may include:''Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.''For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.''Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' Dendritic cell vaccine therapy. Gene therapy."
Follow-up tests,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.''The following tests and procedures may be used to check whether a brain tumor has come back after treatment:' SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the brain. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do."

Introduction to Spinal Headaches,"'A ''spinal headache'' can occur as a result of a procedure such as a ''spinal tap'' (''lumbar puncture'"") or epidural block (such as that performed during a woman's ""'labor and delivery''). In these procedures, a needle is placed within the fluid-filled space surrounding the spinal cord. This creates a passage for the spinal fluid to leak out, changing the fluid pressure around the brain and spinal cord. If enough of the fluid leaks out, a spinal ''headache'' may develop.''Because the design of spinal needles has been improved, spinal ''headaches'' after a spinal tap or administration of spinal anesthesia are rare. When epidural anesthetics are placed with a larger needle than that used for spinal anesthetics, however, the likelihood of ''headache'' is higher if the epidural needle should inadvertently pass through the dura matter (covering of the spinal cord).''A spinal ''headache'' may occur up to five days after the procedure is performed. Such a ''headache'' may be prevented with bed rest after a procedure.' "
What Are the Symptoms of a Spinal Headache?,"'The spinal headache often is described as ""a headache like no other."" Spinal ''headaches'' are much more severe when the person is in an upright position; they improve when the person lies down.' "
How Are Spinal Headaches Treated?,"'The first course of treatment for spinal ''headaches'' involves supplying adequate hydration to try to increase cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Sometimes intravenous fluids (fluids administered into the veins) are given; other times the person is advised to drink a beverage high in ''caffeine''. Strict bed rest for 24-48 hours is also recommended.'""In addition, if a person develops a spinal headache following a procedure, the anesthesiologist can create a blood patch with the person's blood to seal the leak. To administer a blood patch, the anesthesiologist inserts a needle into the same space as, or right next to, the area in which the anesthetic was injected. The doctor then takes a small amount of blood from the patient and injects it into the epidural space. The ""'blood clots'' and seals the hole that caused the leak.' "
What is spinal muscular atrophy?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of several hereditary diseases that progressively destroy lower motor neurons-nerve cells in the brain stem and spinal cord that control essential voluntary muscle activity such as speaking, walking, breathing, and swallowing. Lower motor neurons control movement in the arms, legs, chest, face, throat, and tongue.''When there are disruptions in the signals between lower motor neurons and muscles, the muscles gradually weaken and may begin wasting away and develop uncontrollable twitching (called fasciculations). When there are disruptions in the signals between the upper motor neurons (located in the brain) and the lower motor neurons, the limb muscles develop ''stiffness'' (called ''spasticity''), movements become slow and effortful, and tendon reflexes such as knee and ankle jerks become overactive. Over time, the ability to control voluntary movement can be lost.' "
What are the types and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy in children is classified into three types, based on ages of onset, severity, and progression of symptoms. All three types are caused by defects in the SMN1 gene.''Other forms of spinal muscular atrophy include:'  Spinal muscular atrophy type I, also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease or infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy, is evident by the time a child is 6 months old. Symptoms may include hypotonia (severely reduced muscle tone), diminished limb movements, lack of tendon reflexes, fasciculations, tremors, swallowing and feeding difficulties, and impaired breathing. Some children also develop scoliosis (curvature of the spine) or other skeletal abnormalities. Affected children never sit or stand and the vast majority usually die of respiratory failure before the age of 2. However, the survival rate in individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type I has increased in recent years, in relation to the growing trend toward more proactive clinical care. Symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy type II, the intermediate form, usually begin between 6 and 18 months of age. Children may be able to sit without support but are unable to stand or walk unaided, and may have respiratory difficulties, including an increased risk of respiratory infections. The progression of disease is variable. Life expectancy is reduced but some individuals live into adolescence or young adulthood. Symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy type III (Kugelberg-Welander disease) appear between 2 and 17 years of age and include abnormal gait; difficulty running, climbing steps, or rising from a chair; and a fine tremor of the fingers. The lower extremities are most often affected. Complications include scoliosis and joint contractures-chronic shortening of muscles or tendons around joints, caused by abnormal muscle tone and weakness, which prevents the joints from moving freely. Individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type III may be prone to respiratory infections, but with care may have a normal lifespan. Congenital spinal muscular atrophy with arthrogryposis (persistent contracture of joints with fixed abnormal posture of the limb) is a rare disorder. Manifestations include severe contractures, scoliosis, chest deformity, respiratory problems, unusually spinal muscular small jaws, and drooping of the upper eyelids. Kennedy's disease, also known as progressive spinobulbar muscular atrophy, may first be recognized between 15 and 60 years of age. The onset of symptoms varies and includes weakness and atrophy of the facial, jaw, and tongue muscles, leading to problems with chewing, swallowing, and changes in speech. Early symptoms may include muscle pain and fatigue. Weakness in arm and leg muscles closest to the trunk of the body develops over time, with muscle atrophy and fasciculations. Individuals with Kennedy's disease also develop sensory loss in the feet and hands. Nerve conduction studies confirm that nearly all individuals have a sensory neuropathy (pain from sensory nerve inflammation or degeneration). Affected individuals may have enlargement of the male breasts or develop noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."
What causes spinal muscular atrophy?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by defects in the gene SMN1, which makes a protein that is important for the survival of motor neurons (SMN protein). In spinal muscular atrophy, insufficient levels of the SMN protein lead to degeneration of the lower motor neurons, producing ''weakness'' and wasting of the skeletal muscles. This weakness is often more severe in the trunk and upper leg and arm muscles than in muscles of the hands and ''feet''.' "
How is spinal muscular atrophy inherited?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy disorders in children are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal recessive means the child must inherit a copy of the defective gene from both parents. These parents are likely to be asymptomatic (without symptoms of the disease). Autosomal recessive diseases often affect more than one person in the same generation (siblings or cousins).'""Kennedy's disease, an adult form of spinal muscular atrophy is X-linked inherited, which means the mother carries the defective gene on one of her X chromosomes and passes the disorder along to her sons. Males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father, while females inherit an X chromosome from each parent. Daughters have a 50 percent chance of inheriting their mother's faulty X chromosome and a safe X chromosome from their father, which would make them asymptomatic carriers of the mutation."" "
How is spinal muscular atrophy diagnosed?,"""A test is available that can indicate whether there are deletions or mutations of the SMN1 gene. This test identifies at least 95 percent of spinal muscular atrophy Types I, II, and III. Other diagnostic tests may include electromyography (which records the electrical activity from the brain and/or spinal cord to a peripheral nerve root found in the arms and legs that controls muscles during contraction and at rest), nerve conduction velocity studies (which measure electrical energy by assessing the nerve's ability to send a signal), muscle biopsy (used to diagnose neuromuscular disorders and may also reveal if a person is a carrier of a defective gene that could be passed on to children), and laboratory tests of blood, urine, and other substances."" "
What drugs and lifestyle changes help manage spinal muscular atrophy symptoms and signs? Can it be cured?,"'There is no cure for spinal muscular atrophy. Treatment consists of managing the symptoms and preventing complications.''Muscle relaxants such as ''baclofen'', ''tizanidine'', and the ''benzodiazepines'' may reduce spasticity. Botulinum toxin may be used to treat jaw spasms or ''drooling''. Excessive saliva can be treated with ''amitriptyline'', ''glycopyrrolate'', and ''atropine'' or by botulinum injections into the salivary glands. ''Antidepressants'' may be helpful in treating ''depression''.''Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation may help to improve posture, prevent joint immobility, and slow muscle weakness and atrophy. Stretching and strengthening exercises may help reduce spasticity, increase range of motion, and keeps circulation flowing. Some individuals require additional therapy for speech, chewing, and swallowing difficulties. Applying heat may relieve muscle ''pain''. Assistive devices such as supports or ''braces'', orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs may help some people retain independence.''Proper ''nutrition'' and a balanced ''diet'' are essential to maintaining weight and strength. People who cannot chew or swallow may require insertion of a feeding tube. Non-invasive ventilation at night can prevent apnea in ''sleep'', and some individuals may also require assisted ventilation due to muscle weakness in the neck, throat, and chest during daytime.' "
What is the prognosis and lifespan for spinal muscular atrophy?," The prognosis varies depending on the type of spinal muscular atrophy. Some forms of spinal muscular atrophy are fatal. The course of Kennedy's disease varies but is generally slowly progressive. Individuals tend to remain ambulatory until late in the disease. The life expectancy for individuals with Kennedy disease is usually normal. People with spinal muscular atrophy may appear to be stable for long periods, but improvement should not be expected."
What research is being done on spinal muscular atrophy?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducts basic, translational, and clinical research on spinal muscular atrophy in laboratories at the NIH and also supports research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.''Cellular and molecular studies seek to understand the mechanisms that trigger motor neurons to degenerate.''Scientists are developing a broad range of model systems in animals and cells to investigate disease processes and expedite the testing of potential therapies. Among these efforts:''NINDS has established the NeuroNext ''clinical trials'' network to promote the rapid development and implementation of trials for neurological disorders that affect adults and/or children. Among its goals, the network is designed to develop early-phase trials aimed at identifying biomarkers-usually a physical trait or substance in the blood or other bodily fluids that can be measured to determine the presence and severity of a disease-and testing promising, emerging therapies. One of the first projects in this new network will hope to identify biomarkers for spinal muscular atrophy, which could speed the development of effective treatments for the disease.' Scientists have used gene therapy to halt motor neuron destruction and slow disease progression in mouse models of spinal muscular atrophy. The NINDS supports research to further explore this method and to provide a path toward clinical tests in patients. Scientists have found that a specific class of compounds referred to as anti-sense oligonucleotides can either block or correct the processing of RNA molecules, which are the intermediates between genes and proteins. These compounds have shown therapeutic promise in model systems of spinal muscular atrophy. Animal models of spinal muscular atrophy represent critical tools in discovering and developing new therapies for spinal muscular atrophy. Scientists have developed new zebrafish, mouse, and pig models, including models of less severe spinal muscular atrophy types 2 and 3, which may greatly facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets and candidate therapies."
What is a lumbar puncture (LP)?,"'A lumbar puncture (LP) is the insertion of a needle into the spinal canal to collect and examine the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebral spinal fluid).

What type of pain does an enlarged spleen cause? Where is the pain located?," Because of its location, should it enlarge, the spleen can irritate the diaphragm and cause hiccups and perhaps some pain in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Because its location adjacent to the diaphragm, pain from the spleen may radiate to the back and be felt in the shoulder blade. If the enlarged spleen compresses the stomach, the person may feel full after eating a small amount, and therefore are unable to eat large meals."

   Often, an enlarged spleen causes no symptoms or signs itself, but they are due to an underlying illness that causes splenomegaly. However, those people who do have symptoms of an enlarged spleen may experience:Indigestion and a feeling of fullness because the enlarged spleen can compress the stomach.Hiccups because of diaphragm irritation.Pain in the upper abdomen that may radiate to the back or shoulder blade. Indigestion and a feeling of fullness because the enlarged spleen can compress the stomach. Hiccups because of diaphragm irritation. Pain in the upper abdomen that may radiate to the back or shoulder blade.

Signs and symptoms of a low platelet count includeFatigue,Excessive bleedingProlonged bleeding from cutsSpontaneous bleeding from the gums or noseYellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) Fatigue, Excessive bleeding Prolonged bleeding from cuts Spontaneous bleeding from the gums or nose Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) Liver disease (cirrhosis), which causes symptoms and signs that may include:JaundiceFatigueWeaknessItchingLoss of appetiteEasy bruising Jaundice Fatigue Weakness Itching Loss of appetite Easy bruising Ineffective white blood cell function may cause infections more often. Heavy periods (menstrual) that are unusual. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT, blood clot in the leg) Bleeding that will not stop."
What causes an enlarged spleen?,"'The spleen will enlarge when it performs more of its duties to filter blood or to manufacture blood cells. Therefore, any disease or condition that damages red blood cells, and requires them to be filtered and removed from the blood stream, will cause the spleen to become larger.''Conditions such as hemolytic ''anemia'', where red blood cells are damaged and broken down (hemolyzed) can cause the spleen to enlarge. Misshapen red blood cells, like those found in ''sickle cell disease'', ''thalassemia'', and spherocytosis, may be damaged when they try to squeeze through small capillary blood vessels. These damaged red blood cells need to be culled from the bloodstream and are filtered out by the spleen.''The spleen will enlarge if there is a decrease in blood flow through the splenic vein. This may cause spleen ''congestion'' and enlargement. This situation may be associated with ''liver disease'' and ''portal hypertension''. Damage to ''liver'' cells makes it difficult for blood to flow normally, and as blood backs up in the portal vein system, it may affect pressure in the splenic vein. The decreased ability of blood to drain from the spleen causes it to become congested and grow larger. People with ''congestive heart failure'' may have an ''enlarged liver'' and spleen because of poor blood flow to and from the ''heart''.''Leukemia'' and lymphoma may be associated with abnormal white cells that can invade the spleen and increase its size.''Other cancers can spread or ''metastasize'' to the spleen and cause it to enlarge.''Certain metabolic diseases may cause the spleen to enlarge, including Hurler Syndrome, ''Gaucher'' disease and ''Niemann-Pick Disease''.''In ''sarcoidosis'' and ''amyloidosis'' the spleen can be involved and become enlarged with the abnormal protein deposits.''Some infections may cause splenomegaly including:''Trauma, for example, from a car accident, can damage the spleen.'

What tests diagnose an enlarged spleen?,"'An enlarged spleen is most often found on physical examination. Either the health care practitioner is looking for an enlarged spleen because of a diagnosis that has already been made, or it is found incidentally when initially examining a patient (and it then serves as a clue to an underlying diagnosis).''With its location protected beneath the left lower ribs, a normal spleen is usually not felt on physical exam, except in some unusually thin individuals. As it enlarges, the spleen grows from the left upper quadrant of the abdomen towards the umbilicus (the ''belly button''). Sometimes the doctor will ask the patient to roll on their right side to better attempt to feel the spleen. An enlarged spleen may not be felt in ''obese'' patients.''On occasion, an enlarged spleen may be diagnosed by plain X-ray, ''ultrasound'', abdominal ''CT scan'', or ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'').' "
What is the treatment for an enlarged spleen? Are there natural treatments?,"'Because splenomegaly is due to an underlying illness, treatment will depend upon the primary cause. In some situations, removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may be part of the treatment. For example, in hereditary spherocytosis, a condition in which red blood cells are abnormal and shaped like a sphere instead of the concave disk shape. These abnormal red blood cells are filtered from the blood stream, which causes ''anemia'' and an enlarged spleen. Splenectomy limits the number of red blood cells destroyed and helps treat the disease.''There are no natural treatments for an enlarged spleen.'  "
What complications are associated with an enlarged spleen?,"'Perhaps the most important worry with an enlarged spleen is the risk of injury as it grows beyond the protection of the rib cage. A minor injury may cause it to rupture and bleed. Spleen injuries are often treated by observation, but on occasion, the spleen can rupture causing life threatening ''internal bleeding'' requiring surgery for to remove the spleen. This is the reason that teenagers and young adults diagnosed with ''infectious mononucleosis'' need to wait until the spleen returns to its normal size, and is protected by the rib cage, before participating in activities where the enlarged spleen could be damaged.''All types of blood cells may become trapped in a large spleen. Anemia (''low red blood cell count'') may cause''Low platelet count'' (''thrombocytopenia'') may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.''Leukopenia'' (low white blood cell count) may be associated with an increased risk of infection.''Should the spleen need to be removed surgically (''splenectomy''), the risk of certain infections increases, and the patient will need to make certain that their immunizations are up to date, especially against ''pneumococcus'', ''meningococcus'' and ''haemophilus influenzae''.'   weakness, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest pain."
What is the prognosis for an enlarged spleen? Can you live without it?,"'Often, the prognosis for an enlarged spleen depends entirely upon the underlying illness. For example, in patients with ''infectious mononucleosis'', the spleen will return to its normal size once the infection resolves.''In some instances, the spleen may need to be removed and the risk of infection may increase. In other cases, the spleen will remain enlarged and leave the patient at an increased risk for bleeding, spleen rupture, and infection.' "
Can an enlarged spleen be prevented?,"'An enlarged spleen is the consequence of an underlying illnesses, many of which may not be anticipated or prevented.''Finally, certain infectious diseases such as ''HIV'', ''malaria'', ''tuberculosis'', and anaplasmosis can be prevented if the appropriate measures are taken to minimize the risks of acquiring the disease.' Liver disease due to alcohol abuse, which causes cirrhosis and portal hypertension, can be prevented. With alcohol use, moderation is the key, and excessive drinking has very dangerous consequences both in the short and long term. Certain causes of viral hepatitis (for example, hepatitis B and hepatitis C), which can lead to cirrhosis also can be prevented by avoiding contact with body fluids from infected individuals. Hepatitis B can also be prevented through vaccination."
What is spleen removal?,"'The ''spleen ''is a small organ located on the left side of the abdomen under the rib cage. The spleen is part of the immune system and plays an important role in fighting infections. The spleen also filters damaged and old cells out of the bloodstream, for example, old or damaged blood cells.''Surgical removal of the spleen is called ''splenectomy. ''The most common reasons to do a splenectomy are to treat a ruptured spleen, an ''enlarged spleen'' or other disorders of the spleen and ''blood disorders''.\xa0' "
Why is a splenectomy done?,"'A splenectomy may be indicated in the following conditions\xa0' Ruptured spleen: The spleen may rupture due to a severe abdominal injury or because of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). This causes severe internal bleeding and can be life threatening. Enlarged spleen or splenomegaly: Splenomegaly causes symptoms such as pain and a feeling of fullness. Splenectomy can help resolve these symptoms. Cancer: Cancers that may be treated with splenectomy are usually cancers of the blood and lymph system, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or hairy cell leukemia. Blood disorders: Blood disorders that may be treated with splenectomy include thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and  polycythemia vera.  Infection: A severe infection or the development of a large abscess (collection of pus) with surrounding inflammation in the spleen may require splenectomy if other treatments fail. Storage disorders: Some children born with genetic defects may have diseases called “metabolic disorders” such as Gaucher’s disease. These may cause the spleen to become enlarged. Cyst or tumor: Noncancerous cysts or tumors inside the spleen may require splenectomy if they are too large that the tumor alone can’t be removed, indicating the removal of the entire spleen."
Is splenectomy safe?,"'Splenectomy is a relatively safe procedure. But as with any major surgery, splenectomy has a risk of complications, including:''Long-term complications of splenectomy include the risk of infection.Since the spleen plays an important role in the body’s immune system, splenectomy tends to compromise the body’s immunity. Hence, post surgery the patient is prone to develop frequent infections, many of which can be life threatening. The doctor may recommend ''vaccines'' to prevent ''pneumonia'', ''influenza'', Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and meningococci. Preventive antibiotics may be prescribed, especially if there are other coexisting conditions that increase the risk of serious infections, such as ''diabetes'' and ''HIV''.' Bleeding Hematoma (blood clots) Infection Injury to nearby organs, including the stomach, pancreas and colon"
How is a splenectomy performed?,"'Before surgery''During surgery''Surgery is performed under general anesthesia.\xa0''There are two surgical techniques''Laparoscopic splenectomy:\xa0''Four small incisions are made in the abdomen through which a tube with a camera and light (scope) and surgical instruments are inserted to perform surgery.\xa0''Open splenectomy:\xa0''Laparoscopic splenectomy, though less invasive, may not always be possible, such as in the case of a ruptured spleen or in the presence of dense ''scar tissue'' from a previous surgery. During open splenectomy, the surgeon makes an incision in the middle of the abdomen and then performs surgery.''After the procedure' Patients may have to temporarily stop taking certain medications and supplements as advised by the doctor. Patients may receive blood transfusions prior to surgery to ensure sufficient levels of blood cells after the spleen is removed. Vaccines against preventive infections would be administered.  Painkillers and antibiotics would be administered.  In case of laparoscopic surgery, patients may be discharged in 24 to 48 hours. In open surgery, patients are discharged after two to six days. Recovery after laparoscopic surgery is about two weeks and recovery after open surgery takes six weeks."
Can a patient live without a spleen?,"'After splenectomy, other organs in the body take over most of the functions previously performed by the spleen. Patients can be active and live a normal life without a spleen, but there is an increased risk of acquiring serious infections, which can be managed medically.\xa0''The patient may only need to stay in the hospital for a few days following the surgery. The surgeon or doctor will tell the patient when they can return to their normal activities.' "
Facts you should know about Gaucher disease,"  Gaucher disease is an inherited (genetic) condition that is due to a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Gaucher disease leads to the accumulation of fatty substances in certain organs. Signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease includeenlarged liver and spleen,fatigue,anemia,bone pain and fractures, andeasy bruising and bleeding. enlarged liver and spleen, fatigue, anemia, bone pain and fractures, and easy bruising and bleeding. Signs and symptoms vary among people with Gaucher disease. There are several types of Gaucher disease including type 1, 2, 3 Gaucher disease; perinatal lethal Gaucher disease, and cardiovascular Gaucher disease. The most common type of Gaucher disease is type 1, and this type typically does not affect the nervous system. Type 2 Gaucher disease and perinatal lethal Gaucher disease are rare and severe forms of the disease. Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Gaucher disease is most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, affecting about 1 out of every 855 people. In the non-Jewish population, Gaucher disease affects 1 out of every 40,000 people. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the main treatment for Gaucher disease. Those with family members affected with Gaucher disease may want to consider genetic counseling and screening for the genetic mutation."
What is Gaucher disease?,"""Gaucher disease (sometimes called Gaucher's disease) is an inherited condition that results in the abnormal accumulation of fatty substances known as glycolipids in different body tissues due to a deficiency of an enzyme known as glucocerebrosidase. There are several different types of the condition, and the signs and symptoms that arise due to the sphingolipid accumulation vary widely. Gaucher disease is due to a genetic defect in a gene known as GBA1. Gaucher disease belongs to a class of diseases called lysosomal storage diseases, named after a type of cell that is affected by the buildup of glycolipids."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease?,"'The main signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease include the following:''People with type 1 Gaucher disease usually first notice painless enlargement of the spleen, anemia, or bleeding and ''bruising'' due to low ''platelet count'"". The enlargement of the spleen may become severe and may limit a child's growth due to the energy required to sustain the enlarging spleen. An enlarged liver and abnormal ""'liver function'' tests are also characteristic signs. Skeletal involvement by Gaucher disease is common and can take the form of bone pain, fractures of bone, and a defect of the thigh bone (femur).'   Anemia (low red blood cell count) Fatigue(tiredness) Low platelet count, that can lead to easy bruising Enlarged spleen and liver (hepatosplenomegaly) Easy bleeding that is difficult to stop Bone pain, bone crisis (severe bone pain often accompanied by fever), and the chance of easily broken bones"
How is Gaucher disease inherited?,"'Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both parents must carry a copy of the defective gene in order for a child to be affected.' "
How common is Gaucher disease?,"'In people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent Type 1 Gaucher disease (see below) is more common, and affects 1 out of every 855 people. About 1 out of every 15 people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are thought to be carriers of the genetic mutation responsible for Gaucher disease. The other types of Gaucher disease do not occur more frequently in people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. In the non-Jewish population, Gaucher disease affects 1 out of every 40,000 people. ' "
What are the types of Gaucher disease?,"'The most common form of the condition is type 1 Gaucher disease. About 90% of people with the condition have this type. The signs and symptoms of this type can vary in their extent of severity. The symptoms can appear in childhood or may be delayed until adulthood. The brain and spinal cord, or central nervous system (CNS), are typically not affected by the disease, so this type is sometimes referred to as non-neuronopathic, meaning that the condition does not affect nerve cells.''This rare type of Gaucher disease affects the nervous system and is termed neuronopathic Gaucher disease. Signs and symptoms include ''seizures'', eye movement problems, and ''brain damage''. Type 2 Gaucher disease is very severe and typically leads to life-threatening medical problems that begin in infancy.''Like Type 2 Gaucher disease, type 3 Gaucher is a neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease that affects the nervous system, but symptoms do not progress as rapidly as in Type 2. The signs and symptoms may appear in infancy or later in childhood.''Perinatal lethal Gaucher disease is the most severe form of the condition. With this type, the life-threatening conditions can appear before birth. There may be excessive swelling and fluid accumulation in the fetus (hydrops fetalis) prior to birth. Other features can include severe neurological disturbances, abnormal facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, and dry or scaly skin. Most infants with this form of the condition survive only a few days after birth.''This type of Gaucher disease, considered a rare subgroup of type 3 disease, primarily affects the ''heart'', leading to calcification or hardening of the heart valves. Sometimes, symptoms and signs of other types of Gaucher disease may also be present.' "
What causes Gaucher disease?,"'All of the types of Gaucher disease are caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, leading to an abnormal buildup of fatty substances, glycolipids, in the body cells. Mutations in the gene known as GBA1 are the cause of the deficient enzyme, and over 300 different GBA1 mutations have been identified in people with Gaucher disease. The mutations are inherited (passed from parent to offspring) in an autosomal recessive manner (see above). The four most common mutations of GBA1 gene are N370S, L444P, 84gg and IVS2[+1]. DNA analysis for these 4 mutations can detect 90%-95% of the mutations associated with Gaucher Disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, and 50%-75% of the associated mutations in the general population.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat Gaucher disease?,"'Patients with Gaucher disease may be treated by a number of different medical specialists, depending on the type of the disease and the specific symptoms and signs of the condition they experience. These may include pediatricians, neonatologists, internists, geneticists, neurologists, orthopedists, critical care specialists, cardiologists, and hematologists. Most patients who are treated with enzyme replacement therapy will have their treatment plan managed by a geneticist and/or hematologist.' "
Is there a test to diagnose Gaucher disease?,'A blood test is used to make the diagnosis of Gaucher disease. The enzyme assay test measures the activity of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme in certain white blood cells. Having less than 15% of normal enzyme activity is diagnostic for Gaucher disease. Genetic analysis is also done to establish the specific type of mutations in the GBA1 gene.' 
What is the treatment for Gaucher disease?,"'There is no cure for Gaucher disease, but medical treatments are available. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the primary form of treatment for people with type 1 and Gaucher disease and for the non-neurologic symptoms of type 3 Gaucher disease. The drug is given intravenously, generally at 2-week intervals. There are three ERT ''drugs'' available, imiglucerase (''Cerezyme''), velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV), and taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso).''Other medications available to treat Gaucher disease include drugs that block the production of the sphingolipids that accumulate in cells and cause symptoms. These drugs are known as glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors and are taken by mouth. Two drugs in this class are miglustat (Zavesca) and eliglustat (Cerdelga). ''Formerly, the condition was often treated by surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy). However, this is typically not necessary given the availability of ERT.'  "
"What is the prognosis, or life expectancy, for someone with Gaucher disease?","'The prognosis for people with type 1 or type 3 Gaucher disease who receive treatment is very good. Many people with Gaucher disease have few symptoms and can expect a normal lifespan even without treatment. One study estimated life expectancy at birth for people with type 1 Gaucher disease to be 68 years, compared with 77 years in the general population. Type 2 Gaucher disease usually results in death within the first few years of life.' "
Should I talk to my family about Gaucher disease?,"'As with any ''inherited disease'', sharing information with family members is important. If Gaucher disease is identified within a family, other family members may wish to be tested to find out if they are carriers for the gene mutation. Carrier testing is simple and can be performed on a sample of blood or saliva. Your health-care professional can help you decide if carrier testing is appropriate and may refer you to a genetic counselor for more information.' "
"What help is available for patients and their families living with Gaucher 
disease?","'Living with Gaucher disease or any chronic illness is stressful for both patient and family. Getting help and support are important for achieving the best quality of life possible while facing the challenges and that the illness brings. The National Gaucher Foundation (800-504-3189) offers educational and support services for affected families, including a mentor program, an electronic pen pal program for young adults, real-life patient stories, and numerous educational programs.'

What other names are used to refer to Gaucher disease?,'Gaucher disease has been referred to in the medical literature by a number of different names. These include:' cerebroside lipidosis syndrome Gaucher splenomegaly Gaucher syndrome Gaucher's disease Gauchers disease GD glucocerebrosidase deficiency glucocerebrosidosis glucosyl cerebroside lipidosis glucosylceramidase deficiency glucosylceramide beta-glucosidase deficiency glucosylceramide lipidosis kerasin histiocytosis kerasin lipoidosis kerasin thesaurismosis lipoid histiocytosis (kerasin type)
What is spina bifida?,"'The human nervous system develops from a small, specialized plate of cells (the neural plate) along the back of an embryo. Early in ''fetal development'', the edges of this plate begin to curl up toward each other, creating the neural tube-a narrow sheath that closes to form the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. As development progresses, the top of the tube becomes the brain and the remainder becomes the spinal cord. This process is usually complete by the 28th day of ''pregnancy''. But if problems occur during this process, the result can be brain disorders called neural tube defects, including spina bifida.' "
What is the definition of spina bifida?,"'Spina bifida, which literally means ""cleft spine,"" is characterized by the incomplete development of the brain, spinal cord, and/or meninges (the protective covering around the brain and spinal cord). It is the most common n eural tube defect in the United States -- affecting 1,500 to 2,000 of the more than 4 million ''babies'' born in the country each year. There are an estimated 166,000 individuals with spina bifida living in the United States.'  "
What are the 4 types of spina bifida?,"'There are four types of spina bifida: occulta, closed neural tube defects, meningocele, and myelomeningocele.' "
What is occulta spina bifida?,"'Occulta is the mildest and most common form in which one or more vertebrae are malformed. The name ""occulta,"" which means ""hidden,"" indicates that the malformation, or opening in the spine, is covered by a layer of skin. This form of spina bifida is present in 10 to 20 percent of the general population and rarely causes disability or symptoms.' "
What is meningocele spina bifida?,'Meningocele spinal fluid and meninges protrude through an abnormal vertebral opening; the malformation contains no neural elements and may or may not be covered by a layer of skin. \xa0 Some individuals with meningocele may have few or no symptoms while others may experience such symptoms as complete ''paralysis'' with bladder and bowel dysfunction.' 
What is myelomeningocele spina bifida?,"'Myelomeningocele is the most severe and occurs when the spinal cord or neural elements are exposed through the opening in the spine, resulting in partial or complete motor paralysis and sensory deficits within the parts of the body below the spinal opening. The paralysis may be so severe that the affected individual is unable to walk and may have urinary and bowel dysfunction.' "
What are closed neural tube defects?,"'Closed neural tube defects. This form consists of a diverse group of spinal defects in which the spinal cord is marked by a malformation of fat, bone, or membranes. In some individuals there are few or no symptoms; in others the malformation causes partial paralysis with urinary and bowel dysfunction.' "
What causes spina bifida?,"""The exact cause of spina bifida remains a mystery. No one knows what disrupts complete closure of the neural tube, causing a malformation to develop. Scientists suspect that the cause is multifactoral: genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors play a role. Research studies indicate that insufficient intake of folic acid -- a common B vitamin -- in the mother's ""'diet'' is a key factor in causing spina bifida and other neural tube defects. ''Prenatal vitamins'' that are prescribed for the ''pregnant'' mother typically contain folic acid as well as other ''vitamins''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of spina bifida?,"'The symptoms of spina bifida vary from person to person, depending on the type and level of involvement. Closed neural tube defects are often recognized or identified early in life due to an abnormal tuft or clump of hair or a small dimple or ''birthmark'' on the skin at the site of the spinal malformation.''Meningocele and myelomeningocele generally involve a fluid-filled sac-visible on the backprotruding from the spinal canal In meningocele, the sac may be covered by a thin layer of skin. In most cases of myelomeningocele, there is no layer of skin covering the sac and an area of abnormally developed spinal cord tissue usually is exposed.' "
What tests (ultrasound) diagnose spina bifida pre-and postnatal?,"'In most cases, spina bifida is diagnosed prenatally, or before birth. However, some mild cases may go unnoticed until after birth (postnatal). Very mild forms (such as spina bifida occulta), in which there may be no symptoms, may never be detected.''The most common screening methods used to look for spina bifida during pregnancy are second trimester (16th to 18th weeks of gestation) maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening and fetal ultrasound. The MSAFP screen measures the level of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is made naturally by the fetus and placenta. During pregnancy, a small amount of AFP normally crosses the placenta and enters the mother\'s bloodstream. Abnormally high levels of this protein in the mother\'s bloodstream may indicate that the fetus has an ""open"" (not skin-covered) neural tube defect. The MSAFP test, however, is not specific for spina bifida and requires correct gestational dates to be most accurate; it cannot definitively determine that there is a problem with the fetus. Ifa high level of AFP is detected, the doctor may request additional testing, such as ultrasound imaging or ''amniocentesis'' to help determine the cause. Amniocentesis 6 is a procedure in which the doctor removes ad examines samples of fluid from the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. Although amniocentesis cannot reveal the severity of spina bifida, finding high levels of AFP may indicate that the disorder is present. The second trimester MSAFP screen described above may be performed alone or as part of a larger, multiple-marker screen. Multiple-marker screens look not only for neural tube defects, but also for other ''birth defects'', including ''Down syndrome'' and other chromosomal abnormalities. ''First trimester'' screens for chromosomal abnormalities also exist but signs of spina bifida are not evident until the second trimester.''Mild cases of spina bifida (occulta; closed) not diagnosed during ''prenatal'' testing may be detected postnatally by X-ray during a routine examination. Doctors may use ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') or a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a clearer view of the spine and vertebrae. Individuals with the more severe forms of spina bifida often have muscle ''weakness'' in their ''feet'', hips, and legs. Ifhydrocephalus is suspected, the doctor may request a ''CT scan'' and/or X-ray of the skull to look for extra cerebrospinal fluid inside the brain.' "
What is the treatment for spina bifida? Is there a cure?,"'There is no cure for spina bifida. The nerve tissue that is damaged or lost cannot be repaired or replaced, nor can function be restored to the damaged nerves. Treatment depends on the type and severity of the disorder. Generally, children with the mild form need no treatment, although some may require surgery as they grow.''The key early priorities for treating myelomeningocele are to prevent infection from developing through the exposed nerves and tissue through the spine defect, and to protect the exposed nerves and structures from additional trauma. Typically, a child born with spina bifida will have surgery to close the defect and minimize the risk of infection or further trauma within the first few days of life.'""Selected medical centers continue to perform fetal surgery for treatment of myelomeningocele through a National Institutes of Health protocol (Management of Myelomeningocele Study, or MOMS). Fetal surgery is performed in utero (within the uterus) and involves opening the mother's abdomen and uterus and sewing shut the abnormal opening over the developing baby's spinal cord. Some doctors believe the earlier the defect is corrected, the better the baby's outcome. Although the procedure cannot restore lost neurological function, it may prevent additional losses from occurring.""'Originally planned to enroll 200 expectant mothers carrying a child with myelomeningocle, the Management of Myelomeningocele Study was stopped after the enrollment of 183 women, because of the benefits demonstrated in the children who underwent prenatal surgery.''There are risks to the fetus as well as to the mother. The major risks to the fetus are those that might occur if the surgery stimulates premature delivery, such as organ immaturity, ''brain hemorrhage'', and death. Risks to the mother include infection, blood loss leading to the need for transfusion, ''gestational diabetes'', and ''weight gain'' due to bed rest.''Still, the benefits of fetal surgery are promising -- including less exposure of the vulnerable ''spinal nerve'' tissue and bones to the intrauterine environment, in particular the ''amniotic fluid'', which is considered toxic. As an added benefit, doctors have discovered that the procedure affects the way the fetal hindbrain develops in the uterus, allowing certain complications -- such as Chiari II and ''hydrocephalus'' -- to correct themselves, thus, reducing or, in some cases, eliminating the need for surgery to implant a shunt.''Twenty to 50 percent of children with myelomeningocele develop a condition called progressive tethering, or tethered cord syndrome. A part of the spinal cord becomes fastened to an immovable structure (such as overlying membranes and vertebrae). This causes the spinal cord to become abnormally stretched and the vertebrae elongated with growth and movement. This condition can cause change in the muscle function of the legs, as well as changes in bowel and bladder function. Early surgery on the spinal cord may allow the child to regain a normal level of functioning and prevent further neurological deterioration.''Some children will need subsequent surgeries to manage problems with the feet, hips, or spine. Individuals with ''hydrocephalus'' generally will require additional surgeries to replace the shunt, which can be outgrown or become clogged.''Some individuals with spina bifida require assistive mobility devices such as ''braces'', crutches, or wheelchairs. The location of the malformation on the spine often indicates the type of assistive devices needed. Children with a defect high on the spine and more extensive paralysis will often require a wheelchair, while those with a defect lower on the spine may be able to use crutches, bladder catherizations, leg ''braces'', or walkers. Beginning special exercises for the legs and feet at an early age may help prepare the child for ''walking'' with braces or crutches when he or she is older.''Treatment of bladder and bowel problems typically begins soon after birth, and may include bladder catheterizations and bowel management regimens.' "
What are the complications of spina bifida?,"'Complications of spina bifida range from minor physical problems to severe physical and mental disabilities. It is important to note, however, that most people with spina bifida have normal intelligence. Children with myelomeningocele and/ or hydrocephalus (excess accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in and around the the brain) may have ''learning disabilities'', including difficulty paying attention, problems with language and reading comprehension, and trouble learning math.'""Spina bifida's impact is determined bythe size and location of the malformation,whether it is covered by skin, and whichspinal nerves are involved. All nerveslocated below the malformation are affectedto some degree. Therefore, the higher themalformation occurs on the back, thegreater the amount of nerve damage andloss of muscle function and sensation.""'In addition to abnormal sensation and paralysis, another neurological complication associated with spina bifida is Chiari II malformation -- a condition common in children with myelomeningocele -- in which the brain stem and the cerebellum (hindbrain) protrude downward into the spinal canal or neck area. This condition can lead to compression of the spinal cord and cause a variety of symptoms, including difficulties with feeding, swallowing, ''breathing'' control, choking, and changes in upper extremity function (''stiffness'', swelling).''Chiari II malformation may also result in a blockage of cerebrospinal fluid, causing hydrocephalus. The buildup of fluid puts damaging pressure on the brain and spinal cord. Hydrocephalus is commonly treated by surgically implanting a shunt-a hollow tube -- in the brain to drain the excess fluid into the abdomen.''Some newborns with myelomeningocele may develop meningitis, an infection in the meninges. Meningitis may cause ''brain injury'' and can be life-threatening.''Additional problems such as ''latex allergies'', skin integrity breakdown, gastrointestinal conditions, disorders of ''sleep'' regulation, and ''depression'' may occur as children with spina bifida get older.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for spina bifida?,"'Children with spina bifida can lead relatively active lives. Prognosis, activity, and participation depends on the number and severity of abnormalities and associated personal and environmental factors. Many children with the disorder have normal intelligence and can walk, usually with assistive devices. If learning problems develop, early educational intervention is helpful.' "
Can spina bifida be prevented?,"'Folic acid, also called folate, is an important vitamin in the development of a healthy fetus. Although taking this vitamin cannot guarantee having a healthy baby, it can help. Studies have shown that by adding folic acid to their diets, women of childbearing age significantly reduce their risk of having a child with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida. Therefore, it is recommended that all women of childbearing age consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Foods high in folic acid include dark green vegetables, egg yolks, and some fruits. Many foods -- such as some breakfast cereals, enriched breads, flours, pastas, rice, and other grain products -- are now fortified with folic acid. Most ''multivitamins'' contain this recommended dosage of folic acid.''Women who have a child with spina bifida, have spina bifida themselves, or have already had a pregnancy affected by any neural tube defect are at greater risk (anywhere from five to 10 percent of the general population) of having a child with spina bifida or another neural tube defect. These women may benefit from taking a higher daily dose of folic acid before they become pregnant.' "
What research is being done on spina bifida?,"'Within the Federal Government, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), supports and conducts research on brain and nervous system disorders, including spina bifida. NINDS conducts research in its laboratories at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, and supports research through grants to medical research institutions across the country.''In one study supported by NINDS, scientists are looking at the hereditary basis of neural tube defects. The goal of this research is to find the genetic factors that make some children more susceptible to neural tube defects than others. Lessons learned from this research may fill in gaps of knowledge about the causes of neural tube defects and may lead to ways to prevent these disorders. These researchers are also studying gene expression during the process of neural tube closure, which will provide information on the human nervous system during development.''In addition, NINDS-supported scientistsare working to identify, characterize, andevaluate genes for neural tube defects. Thegoal is to understand the genetics of neural tube closure, and to develop information that will translate into improved clinical care, treatment, and ''genetic counseling''.''Other scientists are studying genetic risk factors for spina bifida, especially those that diminish or lessen the .function of folic acid in the mother during pregnancy, possibly leading to spina bifida in the fetus. This study will shed light on how folic acid prevents spina bifida and may lead to improved forms of folate ''supplements''.''NINDS also supports and conducts a wide range of basic research studies to understand how the brain and nervous system develop. These studies contribute to a greater understanding of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, and offer hope for new avenues of treatment for and ''prevention'' of these disorders as well as other birth defects.''Another component of the NIH, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development (NICHD), is conducting a school-age follow-up assessment of prenatal vs. postnatal repair of myelomeningocele. The MOMS2 study, a continuation of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study, will better establish which procedure is best for intelligence and bladder and bowel outcome years after the surgery. Researchers hope this study, called the Management of Myelomeningocele Study, or MOMS, will better establish which procedure -- prenatal or postnatal -- is best for the baby.' "
Facts you should know about spondylolisthesis," Spondylolisthesis is a forward or backward slippage of one vertebra on an adjacent vertebra. Causes of spondylolisthesis include trauma, degenerative, tumor, and birth defects. Symptoms of spondylolisthesis includelower back or leg pain,hamstring tightness, andnumbness and tingling in the legs. lower back or leg pain, hamstring tightness, and numbness and tingling in the legs. The diagnosis of spondylolisthesis is based on imaging. Most people with spondylolisthesis can be treated conservatively, without the need for surgery. Patients who fail to improve with conservative treatment may be a candidate for surgery."
What is spondylolisthesis?,"'Spondylolisthesis (spon + dee + lo + lis + thee + sis) is a condition of the spine whereby one of the vertebra slips forward or backward in relation to the next vertebra. Forward slippage of an upper vertebra on a lower vertebra is referred to as anterolisthesis, while backward slippage is referred to as retrolisthesis. Spondylolisthesis can lead to a deformity of the spine as well as a narrowing of the spinal canal (central spinal stenosis) or compression of the exiting nerve roots (foraminal stenosis). Spondylolisthesis is most common in the low back (lumbar spine) but can also occur in the mid to upper back (thoracic spine) and neck (cervical spine).' "
What causes spondylolisthesis?,"'There are five major types of lumbar spondylolisthesis.'   Dysplastic spondylolisthesis: Dysplastic spondylolisthesis is caused by a defect in the formation of part of the vertebra called the facet that allows it to slip forward. This is a condition that a patient is born with (congenital). Isthmic spondylolisthesis: In isthmic spondylolisthesis, there is a defect in a portion of the vertebra called the pars interarticularis. If there is a defect without a slip, the condition is called spondylolysis. Isthmic spondylolisthesis can be caused by repetitive trauma and is more common in athletes exposed to hyperextension motions, including gymnasts and football linemen. Degenerative spondylolisthesis: Degenerative spondylolisthesis occurs due to arthritic changes in the joints of the vertebrae due to cartilage degeneration and is acquired later in life. Degenerative spondylolisthesis is more common in older patients. Traumatic spondylolisthesis: Traumatic spondylolisthesis is due to direct trauma or injury to the vertebrae. This can be caused by a fracture of the pedicle, lamina, or facet joints that allows the front portion of the vertebra to slip forward with respect to the back portion of the vertebra. Pathologic spondylolisthesis: Pathologic spondylolisthesis is caused by a defect in the bone caused by abnormal bone, such as from a tumor."
What are the risk factors for spondylolisthesis?,"'Risk factors for spondylolisthesis include a family history of back problems. People who are born with a defect in the pars interarticularis bone in the spine (a condition called spondylolysis) are at increased risk of isthmic spondylolisthesis. Other risk factors include a history of repetitive trauma or hyperextension of the lower back or lumbar spine. Athletes such as gymnasts, weight lifters, and football linemen who have large forces applied to the spine during extension are at greater risk for developing isthmic spondylolisthesis.' "
What are spondylolisthesis symptoms?,"'The most common symptom of spondylolisthesis is ''lower back pain''. This is often worse after ''exercise'' especially with extension of the lumbar spine. Other symptoms include tightness of the hamstrings, and ''stiffness'' and decreased range of motion of the lower back. ''Pain'' in the legs, thighs, and buttocks may worsen with standing. Some patients can develop ''pain'', numbness, tingling, or ''weakness'' in the legs due to ''nerve compression''. Severe compression of the nerves can cause loss of control of bowel or bladder function, or ''cauda equina syndrome''.'  "
What types of doctors treat spondylolisthesis?,"'Radiologists diagnose spondylolisthesis using ''X-rays'', CAT scans, or ''MRI'' scans. Orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons specializing in the spine, physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors, neurologists, internists, primary-care providers, and ''rheumatologists'' commonly treat spondylolisthesis. Chiropractors and physical therapists also frequently treat patients with spondylolisthesis.' "
How do doctors diagnose spondylolisthesis? How is the grading determined for spondylolisthesis?,"'Usually, it is not possible to see visible signs of spondylolisthesis by examining a patient. Patients typically have complaints of pain in the back with intermittent pain to the legs. Spondylolisthesis can often cause ''muscle spasms'', or tightness in the hamstrings.''The diagnosis of spondylolisthesis is easily made using plain radiographs. A lateral X-ray (from the side) will show if one of the vertebra has slipped forward compared to the adjacent vertebrae. Spondylolisthesis is graded according the percentage of slip of the vertebra compared to the neighboring vertebra.''If the patient has complaints of pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs, additional studies may be ordered. These symptoms could be caused by stenosis, or narrowing of the space for the nerve roots to the legs. A ''CT scan'' or MRI scan can help identify compression of the nerves associated with spondylolisthesis. Occasionally, a PET scan can help determine if the bone at the site of the defect is active. This can play a role in treatment options for spondylolisthesis as described below.' Grade I is a slip of up to 25%. Grade II is between 26%-50%. Grade III is between 51%-75%. Grade IV is between 76%-100%. Grade V, or spondyloptosis, occurs when the vertebra has completely fallen off the next vertebra."
What is the treatment for spondylolisthesis? What type of surgery treats spondylolisthesis?,"'The initial treatment for spondylolisthesis is conservative and based on the symptoms.''For those whose symptoms fail to improve with conservative treatment, surgery may be an option. The type of surgery is based on the type of spondylolisthesis. Patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis may benefit from a repair of the defective portion of the vertebra, or a pars repair. If an MRI scan or PET scan shows that the bone is active at the site of the defect, it is more likely to heal with a pars repair. This involves removing any ''scar tissue'' from the defect and placing some bone graft in the area followed by placement of screws across the defect.''If there are symptoms in the legs, the surgery may include a decompression to create more room for the exiting nerve roots. This is often combined with a fusion that may be performed either with or without screws to hold the bone together. In some cases, the vertebrae are moved back to the normal position prior to performing the fusion, and in others the vertebrae are fused where they are after the slip. There is some increased risk of injury to the nerve with moving the vertebra back to the normal position. Outcomes and recovery after surgery are improved with physical therapy rehabilitation.'   A short period of rest or avoiding activities such as lifting and bending and athletics may help reduce symptoms. Physical therapy can help to increase range of motion of the lumbar spine and hamstrings as well as strengthen the core abdominal muscles. Anti-inflammatory medications can help reduce pain by decreasing the inflammation of the muscles and nerves. Patients with pain, numbness, and tingling in the legs may benefit from an epidural steroid (cortisone) injection. Patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis may benefit from a hyperextension brace. This extends the lumbar spine, bringing the two portions of the bone at the defect closer together, and may allow for healing to occur. Home remedies for spondylolisthesis are similar to those for low back pain and include ice, heat, and over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and anti-inflammatory medications."
What are the complications of spondylolisthesis?,"'Complications of spondylolisthesis include ''chronic pain'' in the lower back or legs, as well as numbness, tingling or weakness in the legs. Severe compression of the nerve can cause problems with bowel or bladder control, but this is very uncommon.' "
"What is the 
prognosis for spondylolisthesis?","'The prognosis for patients with spondylolisthesis is good. Most patients respond well to a conservative treatment plan. For those with continued severe symptoms, surgery can help alleviate the leg symptoms by creating more space for the nerve roots. The ''back pain'' can be helped through a lumbar fusion.' "
Is it possible to prevent spondylolisthesis?,"'Spondylolisthesis cannot be completely prevented. Certain activities, such as gymnastics, weight-lifting, and football, are known to increase the ''stress'' on the vertebrae and increase the risk of developing spondylolisthesis.' "
Definition of Sporotrichosis,"'Sporotrichosis is an infection caused by a fungus called ''Sporothrix schenckii''. The fungus lives throughout the world in soil, plants, and decaying vegetation. Cutaneous (skin) infection is the most common form of infection, although pulmonary infection can occur if a person inhales the microscopic, airborne fungal spores. Most cases of sporotrichosis are sporadic and are associated with minor skin ''trauma'' like cuts and scrapes; however, outbreaks have been linked to activities that involve handling contaminated vegetation such as moss, hay, or wood.'  "
Symptoms of Sporotrichosis,"'The first symptom is usually a small painless nodule (bump) resembling an ''insect bite''. The first nodule may appear any time from 1 to 12 weeks after exposure to the fungus. The nodule can be red, pink, or purple in color, and it usually appears on the finger, hand, or arm where the fungus has entered through a break in the skin. The nodule will eventually become larger in size and may look like an open sore or ulcer that is very slow to heal. Additional ''bumps'' or nodules may appear later near the original lesion.''Most ''Sporothrix'' infections only involve the skin. However, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, including the bones, joints, and the central nervous system. Usually, these types of disseminated infections only occur in people with weakened immune systems. In rare cases, a ''pneumonia''-like illness can occur after inhaling ''Sporothrix'' spores, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, ''cough'', and ''fever''.''If you think you have sporotrichosis, you should see a healthcare provider.'  "
Who Gets Sporotrichosis?,"'People who handle thorny plants, sphagnum moss, or bales of hay are at increased risk of getting sporotrichosis. The infection is more common among people with weakened immune systems, but it can also occur in otherwise healthy people. Outbreaks have occurred among florists, plant nursery workers who have handled sphagnum moss, rose gardeners, children who have played on bales of hay, and greenhouse workers who have handled thorns contaminated by the fungus.' "
How Can I Prevent Sporotrichosis?,"'There is no vaccine to prevent sporotrichosis. You can reduce your risk of sporotrichosis by wearing protective clothing such as gloves and long sleeves when handling wires, rose bushes, bales of hay, pine seedlings, or other materials that may cause minor cuts or punctures in the skin. It is also advisable to avoid skin contact with sphagnum moss.' "
Sources,"'The fungus lives in sphagnum moss, hay, other plant materials, and soil. The fungus can enter the skin through small cuts or punctures from thorns, barbs, pine needles, or wires. In rare cases, inhalation of the fungus can cause pulmonary infection. Sporotrichosis is not spread from person to person; however, a small number of human cases have been caused by scratches or bites from infected animals such as cats.' "
Diagnosis and Testing,'Sporotrichosis is typically diagnosed when your doctor obtains a swab or a biopsy of the infected site and sends the sample to a laboratory for a fungal culture. Serological tests are not always useful in the diagnosis of sporotrichosis due to limitations in sensitivity and specificity.'  
Treatment and Outcomes,"'Most cases of sporotrichosis only involve the skin and/or subcutaneous tissues and are non-life-threatening, but the infection requires treatment with prescription antifungal medication for several months. The most common treatment for this type of sporotrichosis is oral itraconazole for 3 to 6 months. Itraconazole may also be used to treat bone and joint infections, but treatment should continue for at least 12 months.''For patients with severe disease, and/ or an infection that has spread throughout the body, a ''lipid'' formulation of amphotericin B should be used. Itraconazole can be used for step-down therapy once the patient has stabilized. Supersaturated potassium iodide (SSKI) is another treatment option for cutaneous or lymphocutaneous disease. SSKI and azole ''drugs'' like itraconazole should not be used during ''pregnancy''. Treatment recommendations may differ for children.'  "
Statistics,"'The exact incidence of sporotrichosis is unknown, but people at increased risk for sporotrichosis usually have occupational or recreational exposures related to agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or gardening.''Sporothrix schenckii'' can be found throughout the world in soil and plant matter. Peru is suspected to be an area where ''S. schenckii'' is extremely common in the environment. Outbreaks of sporotrichosis have been documented in the United States, Western Australia, and Brazil.' "
Spotting vs. period differences, Spotting refers to very light vaginal bleeding or brown discharge that occurs mid-cycle between menstrual periods. Menstrual periods are the monthly bleeding that occur in women of reproductive age. Spotting may be due to a number of causes. You should call your doctor or other health care professional if you are pregnant and experience spotting or bleeding of any kind. Implantation bleeding in early pregnancy is a common cause of spotting and is not abnormal.
How to tell if it is your period vs. spotting (symptoms and signs),"'Menstruation'' or the ''menstrual period'' refers to the monthly ''vaginal bleeding'' that is experienced by women of reproductive age. Most women recognize their ''menstrual period''. The typical ''menstrual cycle'' lasts 28 days. The menstrual bleeding is heavy enough to require the use of a pad or tampon and lasts for 3-5 days on average. ''Menstruation'' stops during ''pregnancy''.''Spotting usually is much lighter bleeding than normal menstrual bleeding. Unlike a normal period, it usually is so light that a pad or tampon is not required. Spotting may be red or brown in color and occurs when you are not having your regular period. Spotting may not have any symptoms associated with it, but if it happens as a result of a medical condition, you may have other symptoms like:' Cramps in the abdomen, pelvis, or lower back Bloating or slight weight gain Tender, sore breasts Mood swings Headache Fatigue Heavy bleeding during the menstrual period Irregular periods Abdominal pain Burning or pain during urination Pain or burning during sexual intercourse Vaginal discharge, redness, or itching"
What causes spotting? Is it serious?,"'If you have continuous spotting or abnormal ''vaginal bleeding'', or spotting ''postmenopausal'' you need to be evaluated by doctor or other health care professional.' Implantation bleeding: Many women experience spotting in the early weeks (first trimester) of pregnancy. Implantation bleeding is a common cause of spotting. This occurs early in pregnancy, when a fertilized egg attaches to the wall of the uterus (known as implantation). A woman may mistake this light implantation bleeding for a menstrual period and therefore not realize she is pregnant. Birth control: Certain birth control methods can cause spotting, including birth control pills, especially when they are first used. Switching birth control pills or using continuous birth control pills can also cause spotting. Some women with an IUD (intrauterine device) for birth control also report spotting. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition in which multiple cysts form in the ovaries. It can make it difficult to get pregnant and can cause irregular periods and bleeding. Benign growths in the uterus or cervix, like fibroids or cervical polyps, can cause irregular bleeding and spotting. Infections, including sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are another possible cause of spotting or breakthrough bleeding in between periods. The menopausal transition is a time when women’s hormone levels can vary widely, sometimes causing spotting or irregular periods. Trauma of any kind, including assault or rough sex, can injure the vagina and lead to bleeding or spotting. While the vast majority of spotting in pregnant women is not due to serious causes, spotting and bleeding in early pregnancy is sometimes related to miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that has implanted outside the womb or uterus, most commonly in the Fallopian tube)."
What are the risk factors for spotting?,"'Spotting is more likely to occur in certain women who:' Are approaching menopause Are pregnant Have switched birth control methods, including having a new IUD in place or having recently started taking birth control pills Have infections of the sex organs including STDs and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Have fibroid tumors of the uterus or cervical polyps Have polycystic ovary syndrome"
How do doctors diagnose the cause of spotting?,"'The cause of ''vaginal bleeding'' or spotting requires a thorough history of the symptoms (when the bleeding or spotting is occurring and any associated symptoms, ''birth control'' methods, and history of any medical conditions or infections).' A pelvic examination is usually a first step to diagnosis. A pregnancy test is performed for women of reproductive age. Special tests like a Pap smear or cultures may be ordered. In some cases, blood or urine tests are ordered. Imaging studies such as vaginal or abdominal ultrasound may be useful in diagnosing the cause of spotting or bleeding."
What are the treatments for spotting?,"'Treatments for spotting depend on the underlying cause of the spotting. Many causes of spotting are not serious, and there is no treatment required. For infections, antibiotic therapy is indicated. Women with ''PCOS'' who desire to become pregnant can be treated with ''fertility''-enhancing ''drugs'' or assisted reproductive technologies. Surgery can be required in some cases to remove cervical polyps or ''uterine fibroids'' that are causing bleeding. For women who desire a more regular ''menstrual cycle'', sometimes ''birth control pills'' or hormonal treatments can be helpful.' "
What to do if you are not sure if you are spotting or having your period,"'Talk to your doctor or other health care professional if you are not sure if it is your period, or if you are spotting.''Remember, spotting is light bleeding that does not get heavier like a typical menstrual period. The normal menstrual period usually is associated with some other symptoms like breast tenderness or cramps as described previously, and often is accompanied by heavy flow. During the first day of your period bleeding may be light, but it typically becomes heavier over the next few days.''Light bleeding that does not worsen and is not associated with the symptoms of a your period is likely to be spotting.''A home ''pregnancy test'' can be helpful if you believe you are spotting due to early pregnancy, or you may experience early signs and ''symptoms of pregnancy''.''You should always contact your doctor or other health care professional if you experience any vaginal bleeding, spotting if you are pregnant or if you have reached ''menopause'', or any time you have unusual bleeding that concerns you.'

Facts you should know about whiplash injuries, Whiplash is a relatively common injury that is often ignored or mistreated due to lack of understanding of the condition. Whiplash is usually the result of a rear impact while in a stationary position. Early range of motion and exercises lead to a more rapid recovery than prolonged immobilization or use of a cervical collar. Failure to properly educate and treat patients with whiplash can lead to chronic psychosocial symptoms including depression and anxiety.
What is whiplash?,"'Whiplash is a relatively common injury that occurs to a person\'s neck following a sudden acceleration-deceleration force that causes unrestrained, rapid forward and backward movement of the head and neck, most commonly from motor vehicle accidents. The term ""whiplash"" was first used in 1928. The term ""railway spine"" was used to describe a similar condition that was common in persons involved in train accidents prior to 1928. The term ""whiplash injury"" describes damage to both the bone structures and soft tissues, while ""whiplash associated disorders"" describes a more severe and chronic condition.''Fortunately, whiplash is typically not a life threatening injury, but it can lead to a prolonged period of partial disability. There are significant economic expenses related to whiplash that can reach 30 billion dollars a year in the United States, including:''While most people involved in minor motor vehicle accidents recover quickly without any chronic symptoms, some continue to experience symptoms for years after the injury. This wide variation in symptoms after relatively minor injuries has led some to suggest that, in many cases, whiplash is not so much a real physiologic injury, but that symptoms are more created as a result of potential economic gain. Many clinical studies have investigated this issue. Unfortunately, while there will always be people willing to attempt to mislead the system for personal gain, whiplash is a real condition with real symptoms.'   medical care,  disability,  sick leave,  lost productivity, and litigation."
What causes whiplash?,"""Whiplash is most commonly caused by a motor vehicle accident in which the person is in a car that is not moving, and is struck by another vehicle from behind. It is commonly thought the rear impact causes the head and neck to be forced into hyperextended (backward) position as the seat pushes the person's torso forward - and the unrestrained head and neck fall backwards. After a short delay the head and neck then recover and are thrown into a hyperflexed (forward) position.""'More recent studies investigating high-speed cameras and sophisticated crash dummies have determined that after the rear impact the lower cervical vertebrae (lower bones in the neck) are forced into a position of ''hyperextension'' while the upper cervical vertebrae (upper bones in the neck) are in a ''hyperflexed'' position. This leads to an abnormal S-shape in the cervical spine after the rear impact that is different from the normal motion. It is thought that this abnormal motion causes damage to the soft tissues that hold the cervical vertebrae together (ligaments, facet capsules, muscles). ' "
What are the symptoms of whiplash?,"'Common symptoms related to whiplash may include:''In a more severe and chronic case of ""whiplash associated disorder"" symptoms may include:''Patients with whiplash injuries may enter into litigation and ''social isolation'' may occur as a result of their symptoms.'   neck pain and stiffness, headache,  shoulder pain and stiffness,  dizziness,  fatigue,  jaw pain (temporomandibular joint symptoms),  arm pain,  arm weakness,  visual disturbances,  ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and  back pain.  depression,  anger,  frustration,  anxiety,  stress,  drug dependency,  post-traumatic stress syndrome,  sleep disturbance (insomnia), "
How do medical professionals diagnose whiplash?,"""After an accident the patient may be taken to the hospital or a doctor's office to be examined. The doctor will examine the patient to determine if they have any injuries that require treatment. Based on the symptoms and examination findings the doctor may place a collar on the neck for additional support. The doctor may also obtain ""'X-rays'' of the neck to check for more serious injury. The most important first step is to make sure there is no major injury to the neck, head or the rest of the body requiring immediate treatment.''If the X-rays are normal but the patient continues to have ''neck pain'', the doctor may keep the cervical collar in place and see the patient back in the office in about a week for an additional examination. At that time, the doctor may obtain new X-rays to see if there have been any changes. If the doctor is still concerned about soft tissue injuries, he or she may obtain either X-rays with the head leaning forward and backward\xa0(dynamic X-rays) or obtain an ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'' study). These dynamic X-rays or MRI scans are better able to detect injuries to the soft tissues of the neck, especially instability, that may not been seen with normal X-rays of the neck.' "
What is the treatment for whiplash?,"'Treatment of whiplash depends on the wide variety of symptoms present. Unfortunately, most treatments of whiplash have not been well tested to determine their effectiveness.''The most important issue in the management of whiplash is optimal education of the patient about their injury. This includes information on the cause, potential treatments, and likely outcomes. Patients should understand that this is a real injury, but that nearly all patients have the ability to fully recover. Patients that do not receive this information are much more likely to develop the more chronic ""whiplash associated disorder.""''In the past, the initial treatment for whiplash was often a soft cervical collar for several weeks. The goal of the collar was intended to reduce the range of motion of the neck and to prevent any additional injuries. More recent studies have shown that this prolonged immobilization actually slows the healing process. If there is no evidence of abnormal spinal alignment, early range of motion is advised.''Patients involved in early range of motion exercises have been shown to have a more reliable and rapid improvement in their symptoms. This treatment typically involves rotational exercises performed 10 times per hour as soon as symptoms allow within the first four days of the accident.''It seems that excessive rest and immobilization have been shown to have greater chances of chronic symptoms. This is explained by loss of range of motion leading to increased ''pain'' and stiffness. Immobilization also causes muscle atrophy (muscle wasting), decreased blood flow to the injured soft tissues, and healing of damaged muscles in shortened position that renders them less flexible.''Physical therapy can be useful in helping to wean a patient from a cervical collar as well as to help strengthen muscles and reduce painful motions. Occupational therapy can be used to help return the patient to the work environment.''If the patient begins to develop psychological symptoms including anger, ''anxiety'' or ''depression'' following an injury, prompt treatment of the emotional condition is recommended. This can help the patient better understand the good chances for successful recovery and reduce the chances of chronic symptoms.'  "
What can people do to prevent whiplash?,"'While it is not always possible to prevent accidents, advances in automobile safety have attempted to reduce the associated risks. Many advances in seat belts and head restraints have been able to reduce the risk of whiplash injury. The proper use of these devices is crucial to their success in preventing injury. Head restraints are designed to prevent the head from moving into hyperextension when struck from behind. In order for this to work properly, the head restraint should be optimally positioned directly behind the head. If the head restraint is lowered below the level of the head it could actually force the head into further hyperextension after an impact. Many automobiles have additional safety equipment including air ''bags'' and air curtains to further protect drivers and passengers from injury.' "
What is the difference between a sprain and a strain?,"'The soft tissues of the body include the muscles, tendons, and ligaments that help the body move but are not part of the bony skeleton. Sprains and strains are considered soft tissue injuries.''The purpose of the musculoskeletal system is to allow the body to move. A muscle attaches to bone on each side of a joint, either directly or by way of a tendon. When the muscle contracts, the joint moves through its range of motion. The muscle that you can feel moving underneath your skin is really made up of many smaller bundles of muscle fibers called fascicles. These, in turn, are made up of individual muscle fibers that are crosslinked to allow them to slide back and forth within the fascicle. Sliding together causes the muscle fibers to shorten and the muscle to contract and move the joint. When the muscle relaxes, the muscle fibers return to their resting position and as the fibers elongate, the joint may return to its previous position.''The transition of muscle to tendon happens gradually as muscle fibers give way to tendon fibers before the bony attachment occurs. The anatomy of each tendon is different and depending upon their location in the body, the tendon portion may be very short or very long. A strain is damage caused by an overstretched muscle or tendon, causing their fibers to be pulled apart, losing the ability to adequately contract. The severity of injury depends upon the amount of tissue that is damaged. The muscle ''fiber'' may be just stretched, partially torn, or completely torn apart.''The most common cause of a muscle or tendon strain is overuse, which weakens the tissue fibers. Muscles and joints may also be forced to perform movements for which they are not prepared or designed, stretching and potentially damaging the surrounding muscle or tendon. An injury can occur from a single stressful incident, or it may gradually arise after many repetitions of a motion (overuse). The damage can occur in three areas: the muscle itself, the muscle tendon intersection where the muscle fibers transition to tendon fibers, or the tendon itself.''Strains are described by the severity of damage in three grades:''Joints are stabilized by thick bands of tissue called ligaments that allow the joint to move only in specific directions. Some joints move in multiple planes. Therefore, they need more than one group of ligaments to hold the joint in proper alignment. The ligaments are anchored to bone on each side of the joint. If a ligament is stretched or torn, the injury is called a sprain.''The grading system for sprain injury is similar to that of strains.' A sprain is an injury to a ligament. A strain is an injury to muscle or tendon tissue. Grade 1 strain usually causes stretching of a few of the muscle fibers. Grade 2 strain has more significant damage, and some muscle fibers are damaged or torn. Grade 3 strain is a complete rupture of the muscle. Grade 1 sprains occur when fibers of the ligament are stretched but not torn. Grade 2 sprains are injuries where the ligament is partially torn. Grade 3 sprains occur when the ligament is completely torn or ruptured."
What causes a sprain or strain?,"'Sprains and strains occur when the body is put under physical ''stress''. In these situations, muscles and joints are forced to perform movements for which they are not prepared or designed. An injury can occur from a single stressful incident, contact sports, or it may gradually arise after many repetitions of a motion. Usually, the mechanism of injury involves placing the muscle tendon unit or the ligament under excessive stretching, causing damage to the muscle, tendon, or ligament fibers.'  "
Where do sprains and strains usually occur?,"'An ''ankle sprain'' is one of the most common injuries of a joint. Usually, the mechanism of injury is a rapid ""rolling"" or ""twisting"" of the ankle and turning it inward (inversion) so that the sole of the foot starts to point upward (supination). This causes stretching and damage to the ligaments on the outside or lateral part of the ankle that hold the joint stable. While common and many are mild sprains, some ankle sprains can be severe.'""Knee sprains are common sports injuries and often make headlines because of their potential for ending professional athletes' playing careers. There are four ligaments of the knee that allow it to act as a hinge joint, flexing (bending) or extending (straightening). The medial and lateral collateral ligaments and the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments keep the knee in alignment and are assisted by the ""'quadriceps'' and hamstring muscles. When a player completely tears the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee, it is described as a grade 3 injury of that cruciate ligament.''Neck injuries are common, for example, after a car accident. While ''whiplash'' is a nonmedical term, it accurately describes the head and neck movement when violently flexed forward and backward as the car abruptly stops. While the rest of the body is held in place with a seat belt and/or air bag, the head is like a bobble head and can continue moving. Both muscles and ligaments hold the neck bones (cervical vertebrae) in place, and the stresses placed on those structures can cause severe pain and damage. Sometimes, the vertebrae are not damaged, but the ligaments that support and stabilize the bones are torn, causing significant pain and swelling. On occasion, these injuries can cause the neck to become unstable and put the spinal cord at risk for injury.''Wrist injuries are common because we use our hands to perform many tasks. Usually, the wrist is damaged because of a fall, but repetitive tasks and a single aggressive move may also cause pain. Some sports are more prone to wrist injuries than others because of the forces that are placed on the joint. Sports injuries from throwing motions can occur in baseball, football, bowling, and tennis. Sports injuries from falling on an outstretched hand may happen with skateboarding, snowboarding, and skiing.'""The thumb and fingers can also be injured. Skier's or gamekeeper's thumb is a sprain at the base of the thumb where the ulnar collateral ligament spans the metacarpophalageal joint, where the thumb attaches to the hand. This ligament holds the thumb stable during grasping and pinching motions. It is most often injured in a fall where the thumb is forced away from the palm of the hand, like when a skier falls and the ski pole pushes the thumb in an awkward direction.""'Muscles strains may involve any body area that is required to perform work. ''Lower back pain'' and spasm is a common result of repetitive lifting injuries, but it only takes one twist or turn at the wrong time or in the wrong position to cause muscle fibers in the back to stretch and develop spasms. Low back strain is the most common work-related injury.''Muscles need to be well-balanced around the joints they move. For example, muscles can be damaged from overuse or imbalance. The quadriceps muscle in the front of the thigh extends the knee and is balanced by the hamstring muscles of the back of the thigh, which flex the knee. Excess bending or straightening can cause the muscle fibers to tear. Muscles that move and stabilize the hip are prone to injury. Groin injuries or groin pulls are strains of the hip muscles that normally move the thigh inward to the middle of the body. When the leg is pulled away from the body like doing the splits, the adductors are stretched and potentially damaged.''We use our arms and hands for a variety of activities, and the arm muscles (biceps and triceps muscles) and the forearm muscles may be strained by aggressive lifting, pushing, pulling grabbing, twisting, or any other activity that you can imagine the arm and hand trying to accomplish.''Chest wall muscles can be pulled or strained because of activities as aggressive as lifting or as seemingly harmless as ''sneezing'' or ''coughing''. Acute strains of the large muscles on the outside of the chest (pectoralis muscles) or the muscles between the ribs (intercostal muscles) can cause severe pain and can mimic the pain of a ''broken rib''.''The core muscles of the torso of the body, including the abdominal wall muscles and those of the back, lend stability to the trunk and are often the source of power for the arms and legs to lift and push. These muscles can be strained from many different activities that require the torso to bend, stretch, or twist.' "
What are sprain symptoms and signs?,"'The first symptom of a sprain or strain injury is usually pain, though there may be a delay in onset of the symptom until there is some onset of ''muscle spasm''. The person who is injured may not recall the specific event that caused the injury of the affected area. For example, a person who paints a room may develop ''shoulder pain'' the day after the repetitive effort of brushing overhead. This is because inflammation, swelling, and spasm can take time (from minutes to hours) to develop.''Pain is always a symptom that indicates that there is something wrong with the body. It is the message to the brain that warns that a muscle or joint should be protected from further harm. In work, ''exercise'', or sport, the pain may develop after a specific incident, or it may gradually progress after many repetitions of a motion.''Swelling almost always occurs with injury, but it may take from minutes to hours to be noticed. Anytime fibers of a ligament, muscle, or tendon are damaged, some inflammation and bleeding occurs. The bleeding (such as ''bruising'' on the surface of the skin) may take time to be noticed.''Because of pain and swelling, the body starts to favor the injured part. This may cause the muscles that surround the injured area to go into spasm or cramp. Hard knots of muscle might be felt near the site of the injury.''The combination of pain, swelling, and spasm causes the body to further protect the injured part, which results in difficulty with use. ''Limping'' is an example of the body trying to protect an injured leg from weight-bearing.'

How do health care professionals diagnose sprains and strains?,"'The diagnosis of a muscle strain or joint sprain is usually made by history and physical examination. The health care professional may want to know the circumstances of the injury and whether the body sustained damage other than the sprain or strain that initially causes the patient to seek care. For example, if a person was involved in a significant fall or car accident, the strain or sprain may not be a priority in caring for the patient with potential ''internal bleeding'' or ''head injury''.''Physical examination may focus on the part of the body that is injured: the tender muscle or the swollen joint. It is important to know whether or not there may be broken bones (''fractures'') or other associated injuries with the sprain or strain. The health care professional may evaluate the pulses and sensation beyond the injury site to be certain that there is no associated artery or nerve damage.''X-ray tests may be used to detect broken bones. CT scan or MRI are used to evaluate bone and can also help detect damage to muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and other structures. Usually, physical examination is adequate to make the diagnosis, but if surgery is suggested, imaging might be considered to help plan the operation. Most often CT and MRI tests are performed electively and scheduled to be done at a future time.''Sometimes X-rays are not recommended. For example, patients with ''low back pain'' who have not had a significant fall, car accident, or injuries (and there is little concern that a ''broken bone'' exists) do not particularly require X-rays since ''fracture'' is unlikely. The health care professional may wish to minimize the exposure to ''radiation'' by avoiding these. For ankle and knee sprains, guidelines (like the Ottawa ankle and knee rules) exist to help decide when X-rays of those joints might be helpful in finding an accompanying fracture. Usually, though, physical examination is enough to clinically assess the presence or absence of a bony injury.' "
What is the treatment for sprains and strains?,"'When muscle, tendon, or ligament fibers are damaged, the body will heal that area by producing ''scar tissue''. The area that is injured needs to be kept relatively rested while healing.''First aid'"" continues afterward with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). These are the keys elements in the treatment of both sprains and strains. More intense treatment may be required depending upon the location and severity of injury and the patient's level of function. For example, an athlete who sprains the ACL of their knee may need to have surgery to reconstruct the ligament, but an elderly patient who is less active may not need such an aggressive approach and physical therapy may be all that is needed to return to their previous level of activity.""'Depending upon the extent and location of the injury, it may take many weeks to return to normal function. That does not mean that all activity must stop; instead there needs to be a gradual return to function that is guided by the body\'s response to activity. Most often, the patient can ""listen"" to their body\'s response to activity and increase or decrease the amount and intensity of activity. There is a balance between resting a part of the body enough to help with healing and resting it too much so that strength and range of motion are lost. For example, when the ''rotator cuff'' is strained, it may take a significant amount of time for the shoulder to return to full function. Resting the arm for a prolonged period of time in a sling to rest the muscle group may lead to ''stiffness'' in the shoulder joint and loss of range of motion. The health care professional and patient must appreciate that balance and minimize the loss of function while maximizing the rate of healing.''Muscle, tendon, and ligaments heal themselves naturally by repairing the fibers or filling in the damaged area with ''scar'' tissue. Full muscle and joint mobility may take time to return, and gradual stretching may be required to return the injured area to normal. Additionally, depending upon the area of the body that is injured, the damage sustained, and the amount of loss of function, physical therapy may be suggested. A variety of treatment modalities may be considered, including ''ultrasound'' and ''massage'', to encourage healing and preserve range of motion and function.''If the muscle or tendon is ruptured or severely torn (grade 3 strain), surgery may be required to repair the damage. Some common sites of this injury include the''Physical therapists may be an important part of the treatment team to help with recovery. Their skills in teaching and monitoring range of motion and strengthening exercises allow recovery from their injury in a controlled way. It may be only one visit for an ankle sprain, or there may need to be multiple visits to help with post operative care. Physical therapy can also involve other treatment options like ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and muscle massage.''Certified athletic trainers work with athletes, especially in organized sports, and are involved in the treatment of acute and chronic sprains and strains. They are skilled in taping and using compression bandages (ace wraps) to support and protect injured muscles and joint, as well as implementing treatment plans as part of the sports medicine team.'""Surgery is a consideration for certain sprains and strains. The decision to offer surgical operations to repair muscle, tendons, or ligaments depends upon the patient's underlying function before the injury and their expectations for activity after recovery. Not all structures need repair, even if completely torn. For example, a professional athlete may continue to perform at a high level even with a torn posterior cruciate ligament in the knee but cannot easily return to the field of play with a ""'torn anterior cruciate ligament''.''Anti-inflammatory medications like ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') and ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') are often suggested to help decrease inflammation and relieve pain. Before taking any ''over-the-counter'' medication, it is important to appreciate that side effects and medication interactions exist and it is wise to ask a health care professional or pharmacist for advice and direction for their use.''New treatments are being developed to help with recovery For example, platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections may help in speeding recovery and may be useful in some patient treatment plans.''For more significant pain, prescription pain medications, muscle relaxants, and/or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed for a short period of time.'   quadriceps (front of the thigh) muscle or its tendon, either the quadriceps or patellar, that allows the knee to extend or straighten tendon; hamstring muscle located in the back of the thigh and flexes the knee; Achilles tendon which attached the calf muscle to the calcaneus (heel) and allows the ankle to flex; biceps muscle or tendon, which flexes the elbow."
What is the recovery time for sprains and strains?,"'The goal of treatment after a sprain or strain is to return the patient to their previous level of function before the injury. The duration of recovery depends upon the extent of injury and what part of the body is damaged. The most important therapy for all injuries is allowing time to recover and heal. Rehabilitating an injury may involve a home ''exercise'' program or it may be a formal physical therapy program. Regardless, it takes time and effort to repair the body and the patient should have a clear understanding of what is expected to rehabilitate the injury. Some questions that may be helpful include the following:''While it may take weeks for a sprain or strain to be completely healed, the time to return to activity may be much shorter. Many minor muscle strains resolve themselves in a few days. While the injured person can return to full activity relatively quickly, the muscle may not be completely healed and is less able to withstand excessive ''stress'' and may still be more prone to future recurrent injury. Similarly, sprained joints may be functional in a couple of weeks but might take months to heal completely and return to full strength and stability.''Some muscle strains take longer to heal than others due to their location and function.''The muscles that help us to breathe operate much like a bellows. The chest wall expands to suck air into the ''lungs''. When injuries occur to the muscles of the chest wall, healing time may be measured in weeks, not days. The muscles are unable to rest since they are involved in taking in a breath every five to six seconds. When there is a chest wall injury, the pectoralis muscles that cover the front part of the chest and help the arms with lifting, the intercostal muscles that are located between the ribs, and the upper back muscles can all go into spasm. Regardless of whether there is a broken or bruised rib or a strained muscle, attempts to take a deep breath may cause sharp pain as the chest wall moves and the damaged muscle is stretched. While an injured arm can be rested in a sling, or crutches can be used to rest an injured leg, it is difficult to stop ''breathing''. It means that 12-14 times a minute, the injured muscle is required to work and stretch. Each breath is painful and delays healing. Chest wall muscles strains may take weeks to heal.''While wrapping the chest with an ace bandage might help with the discomfort, that treatment option is not recommended. It is important to take deep breaths and expand the lung completely to prevent the most common complication of a chest wall injury, which is ''pneumonia'', an infection of the lung.''Numerous muscles are required to keep the head optimally stable on the shoulders and to allow it to swivel in many directions. Injuries are common to the trapezius and sternomastoid muscles, the large muscles that do the major the work of neck turning. Smaller muscles that attach to the bony prominences of the neck can also be strained. Depending upon the injury, significant pain and spasm can occur that is long-lasting. Whiplash is a nonmedical term that describes strains and sprains of the neck that occur with violent flexion-extension injuries. Many structures can be the source of pain, and treatment results depend upon which structure, from muscle to tendon to ligament to nerve, is involved.' Are there work or activity restrictions or limitations that need to be observed? When can I expect to be able to return to normal daily activities? When can I expect to be fully recovered? Do I need to be reevaluated, and if so, when?"
Is it possible to prevent sprains and strains?,"'Putting the body to work requires that it be prepared for a specific activity. Athletes routinely warm up before practice and competition, and that same philosophy of injury ''prevention'' can be applied to regular daily activities. Stretching before work and gradually increasing the amount of effort and exertion may help prevent injured joints and muscles. Everybody is an athlete in their own way, and it is just as important to warm up before shoveling snow, mowing the grass, or vacuuming, as it is before playing basketball or golf. Moreover, exercises and stretches that strengthen the muscles that are used in routine activities can help maximize flexibility and minimize the risk of future injury.''A previous sprain or strain is a risk factor for another future injury to that particular area. Being certain that an injured body part is completely healed before stressing it again is essential to minimize that risk.'

What is the prognosis of sprains and strains?,"'The goal for treating a strain or sprain is to return the patient to their normal level of physical activity. When that can be accomplished and the time frame for recovery depends upon the specific injury. An arm muscle strain may resolve with rest, ice, compression, and elevation in one to two days, and a ''sprained ankle'' may take two to four weeks. However, a torn knee ACL, which is really a grade 3 sprain, may need surgery and months of physical therapy and rehabilitation.''It is important to discuss with a health care professional or therapist their expectations as to how long they think a specific injury will take to get better and what the goal is for recovery. An athlete being cared for in a sports medicine clinic may have different expectations for activities and return to play than a sedentary patient whose goal is to be able to perform basic functions of daily life.' "
Where can people find more information about sprains and strains?,"'A health care professional can be an important resource for information regarding muscle and joint injuries. Physical therapists and chiropractors can help rehabilitate people with these injuries.''Local hospitals, county health departments, and health clubs will have literature and information about injury prevention and healthy lifestyles that may minimize the risk of a strain or sprain. They may also have exercise and stretching classes, including ''yoga'' and ''Pilates'', to help with injury prevention.' "
What is Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)?,'Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a form of blood vessel inflammation or ''vasculitis''. There are many different conditions that feature vasculitis. Each of the forms of vasculitis tends to involve certain characteristic blood vessels. HSP affects the small vessels called capillaries in the skin and frequently the kidneys. HSP results in a purplish skin ''rash'' (most prominent over the buttocks and behind the lower extremities) associated with joint inflammation (arthritis) and sometimes cramping ''pain'' in the abdomen. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is also referred to as anaphylactoid purpura.'  
What causes HSP?,"""HSP occurs most often in the spring season and frequently follows an infection of the throat or breathing passages. HSP seems to represent an unusual reaction of the body's immune system that is in response to this infection (either bacteria or virus). Aside from infection, ""'drugs'' can also trigger the condition. HSP occurs most commonly in children, but people of all age groups can be affected, including adults.' "
What are risk factors for HSP?,"'The only known risk factors for HSP are exposure to certain ''viruses'' and drugs. The reaction to these agents that leads to HSP is not, however, predictable.' "
"What are HSP symptoms and 
signs?","'Classically, HSP causes a purple-appearing skin rash, pain in the abdomen, and joint inflammation (arthritis). Not all features need be present for the diagnosis. The rash of skin lesions appears in gravity-dependent areas, such as the legs. The joints most frequently affected with pain and swelling are the ankles and the knees. Patients with HSP can develop ''fever''. Inflammation of the blood vessels in the kidneys (nephritis) can cause blood and/or ''protein in the urine''. ''Abdominal pain'' and gastrointestinal bleeding is more common in children than in adults. Serious kidney complications are infrequent but can occur.''Symptoms usually last approximately a month. Recurrences are not frequent but do occur.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose Henoch-Schonlein purpura?,"'HSP is usually diagnosed based on the typical skin, joint, and kidney findings. Throat culture, ''urinalysis'', and blood tests for inflammation and kidney function are used to suggest the diagnosis. A biopsy of the skin, and less commonly kidneys, can be used to demonstrate vasculitis. Special staining techniques (direct immunofluorescence) of the biopsy specimen can be used with microscopic examination to document antibody deposits of IgA in the blood vessels of involved tissue.' "
What is the treatment for HSP?,"'While HSP is generally a mild illness that resolves spontaneously, it can cause serious problems in the kidneys and bowels. The rash can be very prominent, especially on the lower extremities.''The treatment of HSP is directed toward the most significant area of involvement. ''Joint pain'' can be relieved by anti-inflammatory medications such as ''aspirin'' or ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''). Some patients can require cortisone medications, such as ''prednisone'' or ''prednisolone'', especially those with significant ''abdominal pain'' or ''kidney disease''. With more severe kidney disease, involvement called glomerulonephritis or nephritis, ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), or ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''Cellcept'') have been used to suppress the immune system. Infection, if present, can require antibiotics.' "
What are complications of HSP?,"'HSP can have complications, which generally occur more frequently in children than in adults. These complications include severe ''abdominal pain'' and gastrointestinal bleeding. Adults can have extended kidney problems.' "
What is the prognosis for patients with HSP?,"'The prognosis (outlook) for patients with HSP is generally excellent. Nearly all patients have no long-term problems. The kidney is the most serious organ involved when it is affected. Rarely, patients can have serious long-term kidney damage or an abnormal bowel folding called ''intussusception''. Some patients have recurrences of symptoms, particularly skin rash, for months to a year after the onset of the illness.' "
Is it possible to prevent Henoch-Schonlein purpura?,"'HSP can be prevented only to the extent that one minimizes exposure to viruses and certain drugs that could cause the abnormal immune response. As it is impossible to know who will get HSP, it is not possible to actually prevent it.' "
What is a heel spur? What are heel spur symptoms?,"'A heel spur is a pointed bony outgrowth of the bone of the heel (the calcaneus bone). Chronic local inflammation at the insertion of soft-tissue tendons or plantar fascia is a common cause of ''bone spurs'' (''osteophytes''). Heel spurs can be located at the back of the heel or under the heel, beneath the arch of the foot. Heel spurs at the back of the heel are frequently associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (tendinitis) and cause tenderness and heel ''pain'' made worse while pushing off the ball of the foot.'  "
How do heel spurs relate to plantar fasciitis? What causes heel spurs?,"'Heel spurs under the sole of the foot (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (plantar fasciitis), the ""bowstring-like"" ligament stretching underneath the sole that attaches at the heel. Plantar heel spurs cause localized tenderness and heel\xa0''pain'' made worse when stepping down on the heel.''Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases that cause ''arthritis'' (inflammation of the joints), such as ''reactive arthritis'"" (formerly called Reiter's disease), ""'ankylosing spondylitis'', and ''diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis'' (DISH). It is important to note that heel spurs may cause no symptoms at all and may be incidentally discovered during X-ray exams taken for other purposes.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose heel spurs?,"'Heel spurs are diagnosed based on the history of heel pain and tenderness localized to the area of bony involvement. They are specifically identified when there is point tenderness at the bottom of the heel, which makes it difficult to walk barefoot on hard surfaces, like tile or wood floors. X-ray examination of the foot is used to identify the bony prominence (spur) of the heel bone (calcaneus).' "
What are heel spur treatment options? Are there any home remedies for heel spurs?,"'Heel spurs are treated by measures that decrease the associated inflammation and avoid reinjury. Local ice applications both reduce pain and inflammation. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') and\xa0''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''), or injections of cortisone, are often helpful.''Orthotic devices or shoe inserts are used to take pressure off plantar spurs (donut-shaped insert), and heel lifts can reduce ''stress'' on the Achilles tendon to relieve painful bone spurs at the back of the heel. Similarly, sports ''running'' shoes with soft, cushioned soles can be helpful in reducing irritation of inflamed tissues from heel spurs. Infrequently, surgery is performed on chronically inflamed spurs.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) of heel spurs?,"'The long-term outlook is generally good. The inflammation usually responds to conservative, nonsurgical treatments, like anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' and orthotics. Infrequently, surgical intervention is necessary.' "
Is it possible to prevent heel spurs?,'Treating any underlying associated inflammatory disease can prevent heel spurs.' 
Facts you should know about cervical dysplasia," Cervical dysplasia is precancerous change in the lining cells of the cervix of the uterus. Cervical dysplasia is caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), but other factors also play a role. HPV infection is common in the general population. It is unclear why some women develop dysplasia and cervical cancer related to HPV infection while others do not. Typically, cervical dysplasia does not produce any signs or symptoms. Cervical dysplasia is diagnosed by tissue biopsy from the cervix, vagina, or vulva. Treatment, when necessary, involves ablation (destruction) or resection (removal) of the abnormal area. A vaccine is available against nine common HPV types associated with the development of dysplasia and cervical cancer"
What is cervical dysplasia?,"'Cervical dysplasia refers to the presence of precancerous changes of the cells that make up the surface of the cervix, the opening to the womb (uterus). The term dysplasia refers to the abnormal appearance of the cells when viewed under the microscope. The degree and extent of abnormality seen on a tissue sample biopsy was formerly referred to as mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia. In recent years, this nomenclature has been replaced by a newer system. These systems are based upon changes in the appearance of cells visualized when smears of individual cells (cytological changes) or tissue biopsies (histological changes) are reviewed under a microscope. Pap smears obtain samples of the surface cells to determine if they are normal or abnormal and do not provide a diagnosis, which can only be done by a tissue biopsy.''These classification systems will be further discussed below.'   Pap smears are described according to the degree of abnormality: ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance), LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and HSIL (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Cells from glandular rather than squamous epithelium may also be described. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)  is cervical dysplasia that is a pathological diagnosis based on a cervical biopsy or surgically removed cervix. This is indicated by CIN1 (mild), CIN2 (moderate), CIN III (severe). These are all precancerous conditions."
What causes cervical dysplasia?,"'Cervical dysplasia generally develops after infection of the cervix with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Although there are over 100 HPV types, a subgroup of ''HPVs'' have been found to infect the lining cells of the genital tract in women. HPV is a very common infection and is transmitted most often through sexual contact. Most infections occur in young women, do not produce symptoms, and resolve spontaneously without any long-term consequences. The average length of new HPV infections in young women is 8-13 months. However, it is possible to become re-infected with a different HPV type.''Some HPV infections persist over time rather than resolve, and the reason why the infection persists in these women is not fully understood. Factors that may influence persistence of the infection include:''Persistent HPV infection has been shown to play a causal role in the development of ''genital warts'' and precancerous changes (dysplasia) of the uterine cervix as well as cervical ''cancer''. Even though HPV infection appears to be necessary for the development of cervical dysplasia and ''cancer'', not all women who have HPV infection develop dysplasia or ''cancer of the cervix''. Additional, yet uncharacterized, factors must also be important in causing cervical dysplasia and ''cancer''. Since HPV infections are transmitted primarily by sexual intimacy, the risk of infection increases as the number of sexual partners increases.''Among the HPVs that infect the genital tract, certain types typically cause ''warts'' or mild dysplasia (""low-risk"" types; HPV-6, HPV-11), while other types (known as ""high-risk"" HPV types) are more strongly associated with severe dysplasia and cervical cancer (HPV-16, HPV-18). ''Cigarette smoking'' and suppression of the immune system (such as with concurrent ''HIV'' infection) have been shown to increase the risk for HPV-induced dysplasia and cancer of the cervix.''The HPV types that cause cervical cancer also have been linked with both anal and ''penile cancer'' in men as well as a subgroup of head and neck ''cancers'' in both women and men.' advancing age, duration of the infection, and being infected with a ""high-risk"" HPV type (see below)."
Are there signs and symptoms of cervical dysplasia?,"'Typically, cervical dysplasia does not produce any signs or symptoms. So regular  ''Pap smear'' screening is important for early diagnosis and treatment.' "
"How 
do medical professionals diagnose cervical dysplasia?","'Cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer generally develop over a period of years, so regular screening is essential to detect and treat early precancerous changes and prevent cervical cancer. Historically, the Papanicolaou test (''Pap test'' or Pap smear) was the screening method of choice. To perform the Pap smear, the health care practitioner removes a swab or brush sample of cells from the outside of the cervix during a pelvic examination using a speculum in the vagina for visualization. The cells are smeared onto a glass slide, stained, and observed under the microscope for any evidence of abnormal cells.''Newer, liquid-based systems to screen samples of cervical cells became much more common and are effective screening tools for detection of abnormal cells. The samples for this test are obtained the same way as for the conventional Pap smear, but the sample is placed in a vial of liquid that is later used to prepare a microscope slide for examination as with the Pap smear.''HPV testing to detect human papillomavirus infection has replaced the Pap smear as an accepted or preferred form of screening. According the American Cancer Society, ""Those aged 25 to 65 should have a primary ''HPV test'' every 5 years. If primary HPV testing is not available, screening may be done with either a co-test that combines an HPV test with a Papanicolaou (Pap) test every 5 years or a Pap test alone every 3 years.""''Further, the ACS recommends that women over age 65 who have had regular screening in the past 10 years with normal results and no history of CIN2 or more serious diagnosis within the past 25 years stop cervical ''cancer screening''.''The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends ""screening for cervical cancer every 3 years with cervical cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years. For women aged 30 to 65 years, the USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing alone, or every 5 years with hrHPV testing in combination with cytology (cotesting).""''For women whose initial screening result is unclear or abnormal, other diagnostic tests are used:'   Colposcopy is a gynecological procedure that illuminates and magnifies the vulva, vaginal walls, and uterine cervix in order to detect and examine abnormalities of these structures. A colposcope is a microscope that resembles a pair of binoculars. The instrument has a range of magnification lenses. It also has color filters that allow the physician to detect surface abnormalities of the cervix, vagina and vulva. A Biopsy is a tissue sample obtained for examination under the microscope. A biopsy is taken from suspicious surface areas seen during colposcopy. A diagnosis can only be made from a tissue biopsy."
How do medical professionals classify cervical dysplasia?,"'Pap smear reports are based on a medical terminology system called The Bethesda System that was developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland in 1988 and modified in 2001. The major categories for abnormal Pap smears reported in the Bethesda Systems are as follows:''When precancerous changes are seen in tissue biopsies of the cervix, the term cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is used. ""Intraepithelial"" refers to the fact that the abnormal cells are present within the lining, or epithelial, tissue of the cervix. ""Neoplasia"" refers to the abnormal growth of cells.''CIN is classified according to the extent to which the abnormal, or dysplastic, cells are seen in the cervical lining tissue:' ASC-US: This abbreviation stands for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. The word ""squamous"" describes the thin, flat cells that lie on the surface of the cervix. One of two choices are added at the end of ASC: ASC-US, which means undetermined significance, or ASC-H, which means cannot exclude HSIL (see below). LSIL: This abbreviation stands for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. This means changes characteristic of mild dysplasia are observed in the cervical cells. HSIL: This abbreviation stands for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. And refers to the fact that cells with a moderate to severe degree of dysplasia are seen. CIN 1 refers to the presence of dysplasia confined to the basal third of the cervical lining, or epithelium (formerly called mild dysplasia). This is considered to be a low-grade lesion. CIN 2 is considered to be a high-grade lesion. It refers to dysplastic cellular changes confined to the basal two-thirds of the lining tissue (formerly called moderate dysplasia). CIN 3 is also a high grade lesion. It refers to precancerous changes in the cells encompassing greater than two-thirds of the cervical lining thickness, including full-thickness lesions that were formerly referred to as severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ."
What are treatments for cervical dysplasia?,"'(These treatments are for CIN precancerous conditions only and are not appropriate for invasive cancer conditions.)''Most women with low grade (mild) dysplasia (CIN1 when the diagnosis is confirmed and all abnormal areas have been visualized), will frequently undergo spontaneous regression of the mild dysplasia without treatment. In others, it will persist, and in some, it will progress. Therefore, monitoring without specific treatment is often indicated in this group. Treatment is appropriate for women diagnosed with high-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN II and CIN III).''Treatments for cervical dysplasia fall into two general categories: destruction (ablation) of the abnormal area and removal (resection). Both types of treatment are equally effective.''The destruction (ablation) procedures are carbon dioxide laser, electrocautery, and ''cryotherapy''. The removal (resection) procedures are ''loop electrosurgical excision procedure'' (''LEEP''), ''cold'' knife conization, and ''hysterectomy''. Treatment is not done at the time of the initial colposcopy, since the treatment depends on the subsequent diagnosis of the biopsies obtained.'  "
Carbon dioxide laser photoablation,"'This procedure, which is also known as CO2 laser, uses an invisible beam of coherent light to vaporize the abnormal area. A local anesthetic may be given to numb the area prior to the laser treatment. A clear ''vaginal discharge'' and ''spotting'' of blood may occur for a few weeks after the procedure. The complication rate of this procedure is very low. The most common complications are narrowing (stenosis) of the cervical opening and delayed bleeding. This treatment destroys the abnormal area.' "
Cryotherapy,"'Like the laser treatment, cryotherapy is an ablation therapy. It uses nitrous oxide to freeze the abnormal area. This technique, however, is not optimal for large areas or areas where abnormalities are already advanced or severe. After the procedure, women may experience a significant watery vaginal discharge for several weeks. As with laser ablation, significant complications of this procedure are rare. They include narrowing (stenosis) of the cervix and delayed bleeding. Cryotherapy also destroys the abnormal area and is generally felt to be inappropriate for women with advanced cervical disease.' "
Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP),"'Loop electrosurgical excision procedure, also known as LEEP, is an inexpensive, simple technique that uses a radio-frequency current to remove abnormal areas. It is similar, but less extensive than a cone biopsy. It has an advantage over the destructive techniques in that an intact tissue sample for analysis can be obtained for pathologic study. Vaginal discharge and spotting may occur after this procedure. Complications rarely occur in women undergoing LEEP, and include cervical narrowing (stenosis) that may interfere with ''fertility'' and potentially cause premature ''labor'' in a subsequent ''pregnancy''.' "
Cold knife cone biopsy (conization),"'Cone biopsy (conization) was once the primary procedure used to treat cervical dysplasia, but the other methods have now replaced it for this purpose. However, when a physician cannot view the entire area that needs to be seen during colposcopy, a cone biopsy is typically recommended. It is also recommended if additional tissue sampling is needed to obtain more information regarding the diagnosis. This technique allows the size and shape of the sample to be tailored to the condition. Cone biopsy has a slightly higher risk of cervical complications than the other treatments, which can include postoperative bleeding and cervical narrowing (stenosis) that may interfere with fertility and also premature ''labor''. ' "
Hysterectomy,'Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. Hysterectomy may be used if dysplasia recurs after any of the other treatment procedures.' 
What is the prognosis (outlook) for cervical dysplasia?,"'Low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN1) often spontaneously resolves without treatment, but careful monitoring and follow-up testing is required. Both ablation and resection of cervical dysplasia are effective for a majority of women with dysplasia. However, there is a chance of recurrence in some women after treatment, requiring additional treatment. Therefore, monitoring is necessary. When untreated, high grade cervical dysplasia may progress to cervical cancer over time.'  "
Is it possible to prevent cervical dysplasia?,"'A vaccine is available against nine common HPV types associated with the development of dysplasia and cervical cancer. This vaccine (''Gardasil'' 9) has received FDA approval for use in women between 9 and 26 years of age and confers immunity against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.''Abstinence from sexual activity can prevent the spread of HPVs that are transmitted via sexual contact. HPV infection can be transmitted from the mother to infant in the birth canal, since some studies have identified genital HPV infection in populations of young children. Hand-genital and oral-genital transmission of HPV has also been documented and is another means of transmission.''HPV is transmitted by direct genital or skin contact. The virus is not found in or spread by bodily fluids, and HPV is not found in blood or organs harvested for transplantation. ''Condom'' use seems to decrease the risk of transmission of HPV during sexual activity but does not completely prevent HPV infection. ''Spermicides'' and hormonal ''birth control methods'' do not prevent the spread of HPV infection.' "
The five Tanner stages of puberty,"'The\xa0Tanner scale\xa0(also known as the\xa0Tanner stages\xa0or\xa0Sexual Maturity Rating (SMR)) is a scale of\xa0physical development in children,\xa0adolescents, and\xa0adults. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external\xa0primary\xa0and\xa0secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the\xa0breasts,\xa0genitals, testicular volume, and development of\xa0pubic hair.''Tanner stage 1'': In Tanner stage 1, there aren’t any obvious physical changes, but it describes the child’s appearance before any physical signs of puberty appear. These initial signs, although not visible, usually begin around the age of 8 years in girls and around 10 years in boys. The brain starts sending signals to the body, getting the body ready for physical changes. The hypothalamus is a gland that releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH stimulates the ''pituitary gland'', a small gland under the brain that secretes hormones that regulate other glands in the body and body functions, such as growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and ''follicle-stimulating hormone'' (FSH).''Tanner stage 2'': In Tanner stage 2, the early physical changes of puberty begin to appear.''Girls:'' The physical changes of puberty begin between the ages of 9 and 11 years. The signs include:''Some girls may have their first period during this stage. Girls with higher body mass index may experience an earlier onset of puberty.\xa0''Boys:'' Puberty usually starts around the age of 11 years in boys.''Tanner stage 3'': Physical changes are becoming more obvious and visible.''Girls'': Physical changes in girls begin after the age of 12 years. These changes include:''Boys'': Physical changes in boys usually start around the age of 13 years. These changes include:''Tanner stage 4'': In stage 4, puberty is in full swing. Both boys and girls notice many visible and internal changes.\xa0''Girls'': Puberty begins after the age of 13 years. Changes include:\xa0''Boys'': Usually, puberty begins around the age of 14 years. Changes include:\xa0''Tanner stage 5'': This final phase marks the end of physical maturation.\xa0''Girls'': Usually, puberty occurs around the age of 15 years. Changes include:\xa0''Boys'': Usually, puberty starts around the age of 15 years, and most boys reach full growth by the age of 18 years. Changes include:' Breast “buds” form under the nipple. Itching and tenderness are felt over and around the nipples. Breast buds may be of different sizes and grow at different rates. The areola (the darker area around the nipple) becomes larger. Small amounts of pubic hair start appearing. The size of the uterus increases. The testicles begin to enlarge. Small amount of pubic hair forms at the base of the penis. Breast “buds” continue to grow. Pubic hair becomes thicker and curly. Hair starts forming under the armpits. Acne may appear on the face, upper chest, and back. The growth rate is the highest during this stage (around 3.2 inches per year). Fat builds up in the hips and thighs. Body odor may develop at this stage or earlier. The penis and testicles continue to grow bigger. Some breast tissue may develop under the nipples, which usually disappears after a few years. Boys may have wet dreams (ejaculation at night). Voice begins to change; it may “crack”. Muscles get larger. Height increases at the rate of 2-3.2 inches per year. Body odor may develop at this stage or earlier. Breasts appear larger and fuller in shape. Pubic hair becomes thicker. Many girls get their first period between the ages of 12 and 14 years, but it can start earlier, especially if the body mass index is high. Height growth begins to slow down to about 2-3 inches per year. The testicles, penis, and scrotum continue to grow and become bigger. Scrotum darkens in color. Armpit hair starts to grow. A deep voice becomes permanent.  Acne may appear on the face, back, or upper chest.  Breasts reach approximate adult size and shape, although breasts may change till the age of 18 years. Periods become regular after six months to two years of onset. Girls reach adult height; a minor increase may occur until 18 years. Pubic hair fills out, reaching the inner thighs. Reproductive organs and genitals are fully developed. Hips, thighs, and buttocks fill out in shape. Penis, testicles, and scrotum reach adult size. Pubic hair fills out, reaching the inner thighs. Facial hair starts growing, and some may need to shave. Growth in height slows down but continues. Muscles continue to grow. "
What is Staphylococcus? What causes a staph infection?,"'Staphylococcus'' is a group of bacteria (microbe or germ) that can cause a number of infectious diseases in various tissues of the body. ''Staphylococcus'' is more familiarly known as staph (pronounced ""staff""). Staph-related illness can range from mild and requiring no treatment to severe and potentially fatal.''The name ''Staphylococcus'' comes from the Greek ''staphyle'', meaning a bunch of grapes, and ''kokkos'', meaning berry, and that is what staph bacteria look like under the microscope, like a bunch of grapes or little round berries. (In technical terms, these are gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, usually unencapsulated ''cocci''.)''Over 30 different types of staphylococci can infect humans, but most infections are caused by ''Staphylococcus aureus''. Staphylococci can be found normally in the nose and on the skin (and less commonly in other locations) of around 25%-30% of healthy adults and in 25% of hospital or medical workers. In the majority of cases, the bacteria do not cause disease. However, a cut, ''abrasion'', or other damage to the skin or other injury may allow the bacteria to overcome the natural protective mechanisms of the body, leading to infection.'  "
Who is at risk for staph infections?,"'Anyone can develop a staph infection, although certain groups of people are at greater risk, including ''newborn'' infants, ''breastfeeding'' women, and people with chronic conditions such as ''diabetes'', ''cancer'', ''vascular disease'', and lung disease. Injecting drug users, those with skin injuries or disorders, intravenous catheters, surgical incisions, and those with a weakened immune system due either to disease or a result of immune suppressing medications all have an increased risk of developing staph infections.' "
Is a staph infection contagious?,"'Staph infections are ''contagious'' until the infection has resolved. Direct contact with an infected sore or ''wound'', or with personal care items such as razors, bandages, etc., are common routes of transmission. Casual contact such as kissing or hugging does not pose a great risk for transmission if there is no direct contact with the infected area.''Certain kinds of staph infection (see below) involve staph organisms that cause ''food poisoning'' or ''toxic shock syndrome''. These particular staph bacteria cause disease by producing a toxin. The toxin is not contagious, however, food poisoning may affect groups of people who eat the same contaminated food.' "
How long is a staph infection contagious?,'A staph infection is contagious as long as the infected person has an active (ongoing) infection.' 
What is the incubation period for a staph infection?,"'Many staph infections arise from bacteria that are already naturally present on the skin and/or mucous membranes of the individual. So there is no true incubation period for these cases. However, for staph infections contracted from another person, the incubation period usually ranges from about four to 10 days.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of a staph infection?,"'Staphylococcal disease of the skin usually results in a localized collection of pus, known as an abscess, boil, or furuncle, depending upon the exact type of lesion that is present. Staph infection symptoms may include an area of skin that appears''Drainage or pus is common. When staph is in the blood (''bacteremia'' or ''sepsis''), it can cause high ''fevers'', ''chills'', and ''low blood pressure''.'   red, swollen, and tender or painful."
What types of diseases are caused by staph? What are the different types of staph infections?,"'Skin infections (see above) are the most common type of disease produced by ''Staphylococcus''. Staph infections of the skin can progress to ''impetigo'' (a crusting of the skin) or cellulitis (inflammation of the deeper layers of skin and connective tissue under the skin, leading to swelling and redness of the area). In rare situations, a serious complication known as scalded skin syndrome (see below) can develop. In breastfeeding women, staph can result in ''mastitis'"" (inflammation of the breast) or in abscess of the breast. Staphylococcal breast abscesses can release bacteria into the mother's milk."" "
What types of diseases are caused by staph? (continued),"'When the bacteria enter the bloodstream and spread to other organs, a number of serious infections can occur. Spread of the organisms to the bloodstream is known as bacteremia or ''sepsis''. When staph bacteria are present in the blood (infection of the bloodstream), the condition is known as staphylococcal bacteremia. Staphylococcal sepsis, characterized by ''low blood pressure'', ''fever'', and chills is caused by staphylococcal bacteremia. Staphylococcal sepsis is a leading cause of ''shock'', circulatory collapse, and death in people with severe ''burns'' over large areas of the body. When untreated, ''S. aureus'' sepsis carries a mortality (death) rate of over 80%. Although not common, ''S. aureus'' has been reported as a cause of chorioamnionitis and ''neonatal'' sepsis in ''pregnancy'', but group B streptococci are the most common bacterial cause of this life-threatening condition for the fetus.'' When the Staph bacteria spread to other organs, they may cause various conditions:''Staphylococcal infections are contagious and can be transmitted from person to person. Since pus from infected wounds may contain the bacteria, proper hygiene and hand washing is required when caring for staph-infected wounds.''Staphylococcal food poisoning is an illness of the bowels that causes ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and ''dehydration''. It is caused by eating foods contaminated with toxins produced by ''Staphylococcus aureus'' rather than a true infection with the bacteria. Symptoms usually develop within one to six hours after eating contaminated food. The illness usually lasts for one to three days and resolves on its own. Patients with this illness are not contagious since toxins are not transmitted from one person to another.''Toxic shock syndrome is an illness caused by toxins secreted by ''S. aureus'' bacteria growing under conditions in which there is little or no oxygen. Toxic shock syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of high ''fever'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and muscle aches, followed by ''low blood pressure'' (''hypotension''), which can lead to shock and death. There is often a ''rash'' resembling ''sunburn'', with peeling of skin. Toxic shock syndrome was originally described and still occurs especially in menstruating women using tampons. ' Staphylococcal pneumonia predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease and can lead to abscess formation within the lungs. Infection of the heart valves (endocarditis) can lead to heart failure. Spread of staphylococci to the bones can result in severe inflammation of the bones known as osteomyelitis. Septic arthritis occurs when staphylococci infect a joint space. Thrombophlebitis occurs when the bacteria infect a vein. Thrombophlebitis from staphylococci most frequently occurs in hospitalized patients at the site of a venous catheter. "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose a staph infection?,"'In cases of minor skin infections, health care providers commonly diagnose staphylococcal infections are commonly diagnosed by their appearance without the need for laboratory testing. More serious staphylococcal infections such as infection of the bloodstream, ''pneumonia'', and endocarditis require culturing of samples of blood or infected body fluids or tissues. The laboratory establishes the diagnosis and performs special tests to determine which antibiotics are effective against the bacteria.' "
What is the treatment for staph infections?,"'Minor skin infections are usually treated with an antibiotic ointment such as a nonprescription triple-antibiotic mixture. In some cases, oral antibiotics may be given for skin infections. Additionally, if abscesses are present, they are surgically drained. More serious and life-threatening infections are treated with intravenous antibiotics and supportive medical care in the hospital.''Doctors use several different types of antibiotics have been used to treat staph infections. The choice of antibiotic depends on the type and severity of the infection as well as drug-resistance patterns of the particular bacterial type. Some of the antibiotics that have been used to treat staph infections are cefazolin, ''cefuroxime'', ''cephalexin'', nafcillin (Nallpen), oxacillin (Bactocill), dicloxacillin, ''vancomycin'', ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin''), rifampin, and telavancin (Vibativ). Combinations of antibiotics and other antibiotics can also be used. Some staph ''strains'', such as ''MRSA'' (see next section), are resistant to many antibiotics.' "
What types of health care professionals treat staph infections?,"'Staph infections may initially be treated by primary care practitioners including pediatricians, internists, and family medicine doctors. An ''emergency medicine'' specialist may treat the patient if he or she seeks care in an emergency department or urgent care center. Sometimes with skin infections, people seek treatment from a dermatologist. For more severe infections, bloodstream infections, or infections of the internal organs, a number of medical specialists may be required, including infectious disease specialists, cardiologists, critical care specialists, pulmonologists, and surgeons.' "
What is antibiotic-resistant S. aureus?,"'Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', known as ''MRSA'', is a type of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' that is resistant to the antibiotic methicillin and other drugs in the same class, including ''penicillin'', ''amoxicillin'', and oxacillin. MRSA is one example of a so-called ""''superbug'',"" an informal term used to describe a strain of bacteria that has become resistant to the antibiotics usually used to treat it. MRSA first appeared in patients in hospitals and other health facilities, especially among the elderly, the very sick, and those with an ''open wound'' (such as a bedsore) or catheter in the body. In these settings, MRSA is referred to as health-care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA).''MRSA has since been found to cause illness in the community outside of hospitals and other health facilities and is known as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) in this setting. MRSA in the community is associated with recent antibiotic use, sharing contaminated items, having active skin diseases or injuries, ''poor hygiene'', and living in crowded settings. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) estimates that about 12% of MRSA infections are now community-associated, but this percentage can vary by community and patient population.''MRSA infections are usually mild superficial infections of the skin that can be treated successfully with proper ''skin care'' and antibiotics. MRSA, however, can be difficult to treat and can progress to life-threatening blood or bone infections because there are fewer effective antibiotics available for treatment.''The transmission of MRSA is largely from people with active MRSA skin infections. MRSA is almost always spread by direct physical contact and not through the air. Spread may also occur through indirect contact by touching objects (such as towels, sheets, wound dressings, clothes, workout areas, sports equipment) contaminated by the infected skin of a person with MRSA. Just as ''S. aureus'' can be carried on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease, MRSA can be carried in this way also. In contrast to the relatively high (25%-30%) percentage of adults who are colonized by ''S. aureus'' in the nose (these people have staph bacteria present that do not cause illness), only about 2% of healthy people carry MRSA in the nose. There are no symptoms associated with carrying staph in general or MRSA in the nose.''A drug known as ''mupirocin'' (Bactroban) has been shown to be sometimes effective for treating and eliminating MRSA from the nose of healthy carriers, but decolonization (treating of carriers to remove the bacteria) is usually not recommended unless there has been an outbreak of MRSA or evidence that an individual or group of people may be the source of the outbreak.''More recently, strains of ''S. aureus'' have been identified that are resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin (''Vancocin''), which is normally effective in treating staph infections. These bacteria are referred to as vancomycin-intermediate-resistance ''S. aureus'' (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'' (VRSA). '  "
What are complications of staph infections?,"'Scalded skin syndrome is a potentially serious side effect of infection with staph bacteria that produce a specific protein that loosens the ""cement"" holding the various layers of the skin together. This allows ''blister'' formation and sloughing of the top layer of skin. If it occurs over large body regions, it can be deadly, similar to a large surface area of the body having been burned. It is necessary to treat scalded skin syndrome with intravenous antibiotics and to protect the skin from allowing ''dehydration'' to occur if large areas peel off. The disease occurs predominantly in children but can occur in anyone. It is known formally as ''staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome''.' "
Is it possible to prevent staph infections?,"'No ''vaccine'' is available to prevent a\xa0''Staphylococcus aureus''\xa0infection. Since the bacteria are so widespread and cause so many different diseases, prevention of staph infections requires attention to the risk factors that may increase the likelihood of getting a particular type of staph infection. For example, it is possible for menstruating women reduce the risk of toxic shock syndrome by frequently changing tampons (at least every four to eight hours), using low-absorbency tampons, and alternating sanitary pad and tampon use. Careful attention to food-handling and food-preparation practices can decrease the risk of staphylococcal food poisoning. Prevention of staph infections can be aided by proper hygiene when caring for skin wounds. Careful hand washing, avoiding close skin contact with possible infected individuals, and proper hygienic care of skin ''scrapes'', ''cuts'', and wounds can all reduce the likelihood of skin infections due to staph, including community-acquired MRSA.' "
What is the prognosis for staph infections?,"'The prognosis or outcome of staph infections depends upon the type of infection that is present as well as other factors such as the extent to which the infection has spread and the underlying medical condition of the patient. Skin infections and superficial infections, in general, are readily cured with antibiotics. In rare cases, these infections may spread and cause complications, including sepsis (spread of infection to the bloodstream). It is important to remember that even after taking antibiotics for a staph infection you can still develop a repeat infection.''Widespread infections such as sepsis have a more guarded prognosis; mortality (death) rates range from 20%-40% in cases of ''Staph aureus'' infection of the bloodstream. Before antibiotics were available, about 80% of people with ''S. aureus'' sepsis died from complications of the condition. People with suppressed immune systems (those taking immune-suppressing medications or with immune deficiencies) are at increased risk for developing more serious infections.''Staphylococcal food poisoning typically resolves on its own without long-term complications.' "
What are the causes of staph infections?,"'Staph'' or ''Staphylococcus'' is a group of bacteria that is found over the skin of most individuals. Staph bacteria usually live inside the nose, but they do not cause an infection. Staph infections may turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into the body, entering the bloodstream, joints, bones, ''lungs'', or ''heart''. The causes of staph infections are as follows:' Skin breaks: If an individual has a cut or wound, the bacteria may enter the body or blood and may cause an infection.  Daily objects: They usually enter the body through daily used objects such as towels, clothing, door handles, equipment, remotes, and utensils. Direct contact with an infected sore or wound, or with personal care items such as razors, bandages, etc., are common routes of transmission.  Food poisoning: Certain types of staph bacteria may also cause food poisoning by producing a toxin. The toxin is not contagious; however, food poisoning may affect groups of people who eat the same contaminated food. Food poisoning is one of the common causes of staph infections. Medical devices: Catheters, dialysis tubes, and feeding tubes can be contaminated in hospital settings, causing infections. Tampons: These when left in the body for a long time can increase the risk of Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)."
What are the common types of infections that staph bacteria may cause?,"'Staph bacteria may cause many types of infections, including:' Skin infections: These are the most common causes of infection by staph bacteria. They may look like pimples or boils. They may be red, swollen, and painful. Sometimes, there may be pus or other drainages. They can also turn into impetigo (a crust on the skin) or into a swollen, red area of the skin that may feel hot called cellulitis. Bacteremia: It is an infection of the bloodstream. This may lead to sepsis, which is a very serious immune response to an infection. Bone and joint infections: They can cause pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the infected area. Patients may also have chills and a fever. Pneumonia: Staph may infect the lungs and can cause pneumonia. Symptoms include a high fever, chills, and cough that doesn’t get better. Patients may also have chest pain and shortness of breath. Endocarditis: It is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. It causes flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, and fatigue. It also causes symptoms such as a rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and fluid buildup in the arms or legs. Food poisoning or toxic shock syndrome (TSS): TSS is a life-threatening condition caused by toxins from certain types of bacteria. Food poisoning typically causes nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Patients may lose too many fluids and may become dehydrated. TSS causes high fever, sudden low blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion. Patients may have a sunburn-like rash somewhere on the body. TSS can lead to organ failure."
What is MRSA?,"'Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus'' (''MRSA'') is the most dangerous type of staph bacteria. ''MRSA'' is resistant to most prescription antibiotics that are usually given to patients, including methicillin, which is one of the strongest antibiotics available. If not treated, ''MRSA'"" may spread rapidly throughout the body, and if it remains out of control, it may damage a person's lungs, heart, and joints. Some patients develop severe ""'breathing'' disorders, endocarditis, and difficulty moving from the damage to their joints.\xa0' "
How staph infections are usually treated?,"'Antibiotics that may be used to treat staph infections are cefazolin,\xa0''cefuroxime'',\xa0''cephalexin'', Nallpen (nafcillin), Bactocill (oxacillin), dicloxacillin,\xa0''vancomycin'',\xa0''Cleocin'' (''clindamycin''), rifampin, and Vibativ (telavancin).' Depending on the type of infection, patients may get a cream, an ointment, oral medicines, or intravenous (IV) doses.  Sometimes, an infected wound may be drained by the doctor. Surgery may be required for severe bone infections.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are resistant to many antibiotics but may be treated successfully with proper skincare and antibiotics. MRSA can progress to life-threatening infections.  A drug known as Bactroban (mupirocin) has been shown to be sometimes effective for treating and eliminating MRSA from the nose. It is applied inside the nostrils to kill the bacteria that stay there and eventually transfer to other parts through the fingers."
How to prevent staph infections?,"'The best way to avoid ''staph infection'' is to maintain good hygiene.' Regularly washing of hands, particularly after working in the soil, is important. Preparing food with hygiene is important because food gets exposed to staph and a person may develop poisoning. Skin cuts should be treated immediately with soap, water, and a bandage. Menstruating women may reduce the risk of staph infections by frequently changing tampons (at least every four to eight hours) and using low-absorbency tampons and alternating sanitary pad and tampon use."
What is staph?,"'Staph'' is a term that is used to substitute for the genus name ''Staphylococcus''; it is a general term that refers to all the various species and subtypes of these gram-positive, coccal-shaped (round) bacteria. The organisms, depending on the species, cause skin infections, (for example, ''cellulitis'', ''boils'', and ''wound'' infections), ''pneumonia'', ''food poisoning'', ''endocarditis'', ''toxic shock syndrome'', and many other illnesses. ''MRSA'' (methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'') can be difficult to treat since it is resistant to several antibiotics.'  "
Is staph contagious?,"'Because many people carry several types and/or species of ''staph'' on their bodies, some researchers question whether or not some staph infections are truly ''contagious'"" or if they arise from overgrowth of these organisms usually present on a person's skin and/or mucous membranes. However, it is known that given the right circumstances, even if the ""'staph infection'"" arises from organisms present on one's body, if another person has direct contact with the infectious staph bacteria and has a break in the skin or mucous membranes, the organisms and potentially the disease can be ""'contagious''. Casual contact, such as hugging or kissing an infected person, usually does not transfer the organisms. However, those staph organisms that cause ''food poisoning'' do so by producing a toxin; the toxin is not contagious but may occur in groups of people who eat the same contaminated food. Similarly, individuals who develop ''toxic shock syndrome'' have staph-produced toxins that are secreted from the infection site into the body.' "
What is the incubation period for a staph infection?,"'The incubation period for staph infections unfortunately is variable and considered to be indefinite. This is because many staph infections arise from bacteria that are already present on the skin and/or mucous membranes. However, for most staph infections, the incubation period commonly ranges from about four to 10 days.' "
How will I know if I have a staph infection?,"'The most common staph infections (for example, ''boils'', ''impetigo'', and ''MRSA'') occur in the skin.''Staphylococcal ''food poisoning'' produces symptoms of''These symptoms usually come on quickly (from about one to six hours after eating the contaminated food) and usually resolve in one to three days.''Toxic shock syndrome'', originally described in menstruating women using tampons, occurs rapidly with''Although the majority of staph infections are fairly benign in the skin, some can become severe. Although usually a physician will not need to run laboratory tests for a diagnosis, if ''MRSA'', ''food poisoning'', or toxic shock syndrome is suspected, samples from blood and tissue can be examined and cultures may be performed to identify the specific type of staph.' Common features include redness and swelling of the skin; there may be abscess formation and/or pus production. More serious infections may develop if staph infections spread (pneumonia, heart failure, organ infections, and sepsis); serious infections can causehigh fever,chills,low blood pressure,shock, andeven death. high fever, chills, low blood pressure, shock, and even death. Staph infections may occur in individuals of any age group. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle aches. Patients often develop a skin rash and peeling skin with this syndrome. Patients can also develop hypotension (low blood pressure) and shock and may even die."
What is the mode of transmission for staph infections?," Most staph infections are spread by direct person-to-person contact, usually requiring some break in the skin or mucous membranes to allow transfer of the bacteria. This can occur in direct contact like wrestling, through gym clothing, or depending on the activity, through sexual contact. Staph spread by other mechanisms, such as droplets or indirect contact such as clothing or other objects, is less frequent. The toxins that cause food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome are not spread from person to person. Staph infections are infrequently or rarely spread by airborne droplets, in swimming pools or by saliva, although it is possible."
When will I know I am cured of a staph infection? How long is the contagious period for a staph infection?," Most staph skin infections are cured with antibiotics; with antibiotic treatment, many skin infections are no longer contagious after about 24-48 hours of appropriate therapy. Some skin infections, such as those due to MRSA, may require longer treatment. For more complicated infections caused by staph, in general, when the symptoms resolve, the patient is usually cured of staph infection."
When should I contact a medical caregiver about a staph infection?,"'Although many minor staph infections, especially on the skin, may not require a physician to treat, there are other instances in which it is advisable to contact a physician about possible staph infections. A person should contact a physician if they develop the following:''If any of the above symptoms or signs are severe, the person should be brought to an emergency department.'   An area of red, irritated, and/or painful skin Pus-filled structures like blisters, boils, abscesses, or wounds that leak pus Skin infections that fail to respond to topical antibiotics Fever Reddish skin areas that are peeling Skin infections or other infections after close association with someone infected with MRSA Infections associated with tampon use or surgical or other wounds that require treatment with gauze packing Dehydration associated with food poisoning"
What is Staphylococcus? What causes a staph infection?,"'Staphylococcus'' is a group of bacteria (microbe or germ) that can cause a number of infectious diseases in various tissues of the body. ''Staphylococcus'' is more familiarly known as staph (pronounced ""staff""). Staph-related illness can range from mild and requiring no treatment to severe and potentially fatal.''The name ''Staphylococcus'' comes from the Greek ''staphyle'', meaning a bunch of grapes, and ''kokkos'', meaning berry, and that is what staph bacteria look like under the microscope, like a bunch of grapes or little round berries. (In technical terms, these are gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, usually unencapsulated ''cocci''.)''Over 30 different types of staphylococci can infect humans, but most infections are caused by ''Staphylococcus aureus''. Staphylococci can be found normally in the nose and on the skin (and less commonly in other locations) of around 25%-30% of healthy adults and in 25% of hospital or medical workers. In the majority of cases, the bacteria do not cause disease. However, a cut, ''abrasion'', or other damage to the skin or other injury may allow the bacteria to overcome the natural protective mechanisms of the body, leading to infection.'  "
Who is at risk for staph infections?,"'Anyone can develop a staph infection, although certain groups of people are at greater risk, including ''newborn'' infants, ''breastfeeding'' women, and people with chronic conditions such as ''diabetes'', ''cancer'', ''vascular disease'', and lung disease. Injecting drug users, those with skin injuries or disorders, intravenous catheters, surgical incisions, and those with a weakened immune system due either to disease or a result of immune suppressing medications all have an increased risk of developing staph infections.' "
Is a staph infection contagious?,"'Staph infections are ''contagious'' until the infection has resolved. Direct contact with an infected sore or ''wound'', or with personal care items such as razors, bandages, etc., are common routes of transmission. Casual contact such as kissing or hugging does not pose a great risk for transmission if there is no direct contact with the infected area.''Certain kinds of staph infection (see below) involve staph organisms that cause ''food poisoning'' or ''toxic shock syndrome''. These particular staph bacteria cause disease by producing a toxin. The toxin is not contagious, however, food poisoning may affect groups of people who eat the same contaminated food.' "
How long is a staph infection contagious?,'A staph infection is contagious as long as the infected person has an active (ongoing) infection.' 
What is the incubation period for a staph infection?,"'Many staph infections arise from bacteria that are already naturally present on the skin and/or mucous membranes of the individual. So there is no true incubation period for these cases. However, for staph infections contracted from another person, the incubation period usually ranges from about four to 10 days.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of a staph infection?,"'Staphylococcal disease of the skin usually results in a localized collection of pus, known as an abscess, boil, or furuncle, depending upon the exact type of lesion that is present. Staph infection symptoms may include an area of skin that appears''Drainage or pus is common. When staph is in the blood (''bacteremia'' or ''sepsis''), it can cause high ''fevers'', ''chills'', and ''low blood pressure''.'   red, swollen, and tender or painful."
What types of diseases are caused by staph? What are the different types of staph infections?,"'Skin infections (see above) are the most common type of disease produced by ''Staphylococcus''. Staph infections of the skin can progress to ''impetigo'' (a crusting of the skin) or cellulitis (inflammation of the deeper layers of skin and connective tissue under the skin, leading to swelling and redness of the area). In rare situations, a serious complication known as scalded skin syndrome (see below) can develop. In breastfeeding women, staph can result in ''mastitis'"" (inflammation of the breast) or in abscess of the breast. Staphylococcal breast abscesses can release bacteria into the mother's milk."" "
What types of diseases are caused by staph? (continued),"'When the bacteria enter the bloodstream and spread to other organs, a number of serious infections can occur. Spread of the organisms to the bloodstream is known as bacteremia or ''sepsis''. When staph bacteria are present in the blood (infection of the bloodstream), the condition is known as staphylococcal bacteremia. Staphylococcal sepsis, characterized by ''low blood pressure'', ''fever'', and chills is caused by staphylococcal bacteremia. Staphylococcal sepsis is a leading cause of ''shock'', circulatory collapse, and death in people with severe ''burns'' over large areas of the body. When untreated, ''S. aureus'' sepsis carries a mortality (death) rate of over 80%. Although not common, ''S. aureus'' has been reported as a cause of chorioamnionitis and ''neonatal'' sepsis in ''pregnancy'', but group B streptococci are the most common bacterial cause of this life-threatening condition for the fetus.'' When the Staph bacteria spread to other organs, they may cause various conditions:''Staphylococcal infections are contagious and can be transmitted from person to person. Since pus from infected wounds may contain the bacteria, proper hygiene and hand washing is required when caring for staph-infected wounds.''Staphylococcal food poisoning is an illness of the bowels that causes ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and ''dehydration''. It is caused by eating foods contaminated with toxins produced by ''Staphylococcus aureus'' rather than a true infection with the bacteria. Symptoms usually develop within one to six hours after eating contaminated food. The illness usually lasts for one to three days and resolves on its own. Patients with this illness are not contagious since toxins are not transmitted from one person to another.''Toxic shock syndrome is an illness caused by toxins secreted by ''S. aureus'' bacteria growing under conditions in which there is little or no oxygen. Toxic shock syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of high ''fever'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and muscle aches, followed by ''low blood pressure'' (''hypotension''), which can lead to shock and death. There is often a ''rash'' resembling ''sunburn'', with peeling of skin. Toxic shock syndrome was originally described and still occurs especially in menstruating women using tampons. ' Staphylococcal pneumonia predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease and can lead to abscess formation within the lungs. Infection of the heart valves (endocarditis) can lead to heart failure. Spread of staphylococci to the bones can result in severe inflammation of the bones known as osteomyelitis. Septic arthritis occurs when staphylococci infect a joint space. Thrombophlebitis occurs when the bacteria infect a vein. Thrombophlebitis from staphylococci most frequently occurs in hospitalized patients at the site of a venous catheter. "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose a staph infection?,"'In cases of minor skin infections, health care providers commonly diagnose staphylococcal infections are commonly diagnosed by their appearance without the need for laboratory testing. More serious staphylococcal infections such as infection of the bloodstream, ''pneumonia'', and endocarditis require culturing of samples of blood or infected body fluids or tissues. The laboratory establishes the diagnosis and performs special tests to determine which antibiotics are effective against the bacteria.' "
What is the treatment for staph infections?,"'Minor skin infections are usually treated with an antibiotic ointment such as a nonprescription triple-antibiotic mixture. In some cases, oral antibiotics may be given for skin infections. Additionally, if abscesses are present, they are surgically drained. More serious and life-threatening infections are treated with intravenous antibiotics and supportive medical care in the hospital.''Doctors use several different types of antibiotics have been used to treat staph infections. The choice of antibiotic depends on the type and severity of the infection as well as drug-resistance patterns of the particular bacterial type. Some of the antibiotics that have been used to treat staph infections are cefazolin, ''cefuroxime'', ''cephalexin'', nafcillin (Nallpen), oxacillin (Bactocill), dicloxacillin, ''vancomycin'', ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin''), rifampin, and telavancin (Vibativ). Combinations of antibiotics and other antibiotics can also be used. Some staph ''strains'', such as ''MRSA'' (see next section), are resistant to many antibiotics.' "
What types of health care professionals treat staph infections?,"'Staph infections may initially be treated by primary care practitioners including pediatricians, internists, and family medicine doctors. An ''emergency medicine'' specialist may treat the patient if he or she seeks care in an emergency department or urgent care center. Sometimes with skin infections, people seek treatment from a dermatologist. For more severe infections, bloodstream infections, or infections of the internal organs, a number of medical specialists may be required, including infectious disease specialists, cardiologists, critical care specialists, pulmonologists, and surgeons.' "
What is antibiotic-resistant S. aureus?,"'Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', known as ''MRSA'', is a type of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' that is resistant to the antibiotic methicillin and other drugs in the same class, including ''penicillin'', ''amoxicillin'', and oxacillin. MRSA is one example of a so-called ""''superbug'',"" an informal term used to describe a strain of bacteria that has become resistant to the antibiotics usually used to treat it. MRSA first appeared in patients in hospitals and other health facilities, especially among the elderly, the very sick, and those with an ''open wound'' (such as a bedsore) or catheter in the body. In these settings, MRSA is referred to as health-care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA).''MRSA has since been found to cause illness in the community outside of hospitals and other health facilities and is known as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) in this setting. MRSA in the community is associated with recent antibiotic use, sharing contaminated items, having active skin diseases or injuries, ''poor hygiene'', and living in crowded settings. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) estimates that about 12% of MRSA infections are now community-associated, but this percentage can vary by community and patient population.''MRSA infections are usually mild superficial infections of the skin that can be treated successfully with proper ''skin care'' and antibiotics. MRSA, however, can be difficult to treat and can progress to life-threatening blood or bone infections because there are fewer effective antibiotics available for treatment.''The transmission of MRSA is largely from people with active MRSA skin infections. MRSA is almost always spread by direct physical contact and not through the air. Spread may also occur through indirect contact by touching objects (such as towels, sheets, wound dressings, clothes, workout areas, sports equipment) contaminated by the infected skin of a person with MRSA. Just as ''S. aureus'' can be carried on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease, MRSA can be carried in this way also. In contrast to the relatively high (25%-30%) percentage of adults who are colonized by ''S. aureus'' in the nose (these people have staph bacteria present that do not cause illness), only about 2% of healthy people carry MRSA in the nose. There are no symptoms associated with carrying staph in general or MRSA in the nose.''A drug known as ''mupirocin'' (Bactroban) has been shown to be sometimes effective for treating and eliminating MRSA from the nose of healthy carriers, but decolonization (treating of carriers to remove the bacteria) is usually not recommended unless there has been an outbreak of MRSA or evidence that an individual or group of people may be the source of the outbreak.''More recently, strains of ''S. aureus'' have been identified that are resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin (''Vancocin''), which is normally effective in treating staph infections. These bacteria are referred to as vancomycin-intermediate-resistance ''S. aureus'' (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'' (VRSA). '  "
What are complications of staph infections?,"'Scalded skin syndrome is a potentially serious side effect of infection with staph bacteria that produce a specific protein that loosens the ""cement"" holding the various layers of the skin together. This allows ''blister'' formation and sloughing of the top layer of skin. If it occurs over large body regions, it can be deadly, similar to a large surface area of the body having been burned. It is necessary to treat scalded skin syndrome with intravenous antibiotics and to protect the skin from allowing ''dehydration'' to occur if large areas peel off. The disease occurs predominantly in children but can occur in anyone. It is known formally as ''staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome''.' "
Is it possible to prevent staph infections?,"'No ''vaccine'' is available to prevent a\xa0''Staphylococcus aureus''\xa0infection. Since the bacteria are so widespread and cause so many different diseases, prevention of staph infections requires attention to the risk factors that may increase the likelihood of getting a particular type of staph infection. For example, it is possible for menstruating women reduce the risk of toxic shock syndrome by frequently changing tampons (at least every four to eight hours), using low-absorbency tampons, and alternating sanitary pad and tampon use. Careful attention to food-handling and food-preparation practices can decrease the risk of staphylococcal food poisoning. Prevention of staph infections can be aided by proper hygiene when caring for skin wounds. Careful hand washing, avoiding close skin contact with possible infected individuals, and proper hygienic care of skin ''scrapes'', ''cuts'', and wounds can all reduce the likelihood of skin infections due to staph, including community-acquired MRSA.' "
What is the prognosis for staph infections?,"'The prognosis or outcome of staph infections depends upon the type of infection that is present as well as other factors such as the extent to which the infection has spread and the underlying medical condition of the patient. Skin infections and superficial infections, in general, are readily cured with antibiotics. In rare cases, these infections may spread and cause complications, including sepsis (spread of infection to the bloodstream). It is important to remember that even after taking antibiotics for a staph infection you can still develop a repeat infection.''Widespread infections such as sepsis have a more guarded prognosis; mortality (death) rates range from 20%-40% in cases of ''Staph aureus'' infection of the bloodstream. Before antibiotics were available, about 80% of people with ''S. aureus'' sepsis died from complications of the condition. People with suppressed immune systems (those taking immune-suppressing medications or with immune deficiencies) are at increased risk for developing more serious infections.''Staphylococcal food poisoning typically resolves on its own without long-term complications.' "
What are hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids'' are defined as an abnormally enlarged vein, mainly due to persistent increase in venous pressure, occurring within or just outside the anal sphincter of the rectum. The anal canal is the last four centimeters through which ''stool'' passes as it goes from the rectum to the outside world. The anus is the opening of the anal canal to the outside world.''Although most people think ''hemorrhoids'' are abnormal, they are present in everyone. It is only when the hemorrhoidal cushions enlarge that ''hemorrhoids'' can cause problems and be considered abnormal or a disease.''Although ''hemorrhoids'' occur in everyone, they become large and cause problems in only 4% of the general population. Hemorrhoids that cause problems occur equally in men and women, and their prevalence peaks between 45 and 65 years of age.' "
What is stapled hemorrhoidectomy?,"'Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is surgical technique for treating hemorrhoids, and is the treatment of choice for third-degree hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids that protrude with straining and can be seen on physical exam outside the anal verge. Persistent or intermittent manual reduction is necessary). Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is a misnomer since the surgery does not remove the hemorrhoids but, rather, the abnormally lax and expanded hemorrhoidal supporting tissue that has allowed the hemorrhoids to prolapse downward.''For stapled hemorrhoidectomy, a circular, hollow tube is inserted into the anal canal. Through this tube, a suture (a long thread) is placed, actually woven, circumferentially within the anal canal above the internal hemorrhoids. The ends of the suture are brought out of the anus through the hollow tube. The stapler (a disposable instrument with a circular stapling device at the end) is placed through the first hollow tube and the ends of the suture are pulled. Pulling the suture pulls the expanded hemorrhoidal supporting tissue into the jaws of the stapler. The hemorrhoidal cushions are pulled back up into their normal position within the anal canal. The stapler then is fired. When it fires, the stapler ''cuts'' off the circumferential ring of expanded hemorrhoidal tissue trapped within the stapler and at the same time staples together the upper and lower edges of the cut tissue.'  "
Who is a good candidate for stapled hemorrhoidectomy?,"'Stapled hemorrhoidectomy, although it can be used to treat second degree hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids that extend outside the anus after a bowel movement or straining, but return inside by themselves), usually is reserved for higher grades of hemorrhoids - third and fourth degree. Third degree hemorrhoids can be pushed back into the anus with a finger after a bowel movement. Fourth degree hemorrhoids are always outside. If in addition to internal hemorrhoids there are small external hemorrhoids that are causing a problem, the external hemorrhoids may become less problematic after the stapled hemorrhoidectomy. Another alternative is to do a stapled hemorrhoidectomy and a simple excision of the external hemorrhoids. If the external hemorrhoids are large, a standard surgical hemorrhoidectomy may need to be done to remove both the internal and external hemorrhoids.' "
Pictures of stapled hemorrhoidectomy procedure, 
What happens to the staples from a stapled hemorrhoidectomy?,"'During stapled hemorrhoidectomy, the arterial blood vessels that travel within the expanded hemorrhoidal tissue and feed the hemorrhoidal vessels are cut, thereby reducing the blood flow to the hemorrhoidal vessels and reducing the size of the hemorrhoids. During the healing of the cut tissues around the staples, ''scar tissue'' forms, and this ''scar'' tissue anchors the hemorrhoidal cushions in their normal position higher in the anal canal. The staples are needed only until the tissue heals. After several weeks, they then fall off and pass in the ''stool'' unnoticed. Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is designed primarily to treat internal hemorrhoids, but if external hemorrhoids are present, they may be reduced as well.' "
How long does stapled hemorrhoidectomy take?,"'Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is faster than traditional hemorrhoidectomy, taking approximately 30 minutes. It is associated with much less ''pain'' than traditional hemorrhoidectomy and patients usually return earlier to work. Patients often sense a fullness or pressure within the rectum as if they need to defecate, but this usually resolves within several days. The risks of stapled hemorrhoidectomy include bleeding, infection, anal fissuring (tearing of the lining of the anal canal), narrowing of the anal or rectal wall due to scarring, persistence of internal or external hemorrhoids, and, rarely, ''trauma'' to the rectal wall.''Stapled hemorrhoidectomy may be used to treat patients who have both internal and external hemorrhoids; however, it also is an option to combine a stapled hemorrhoidectomy to treat the internal hemorrhoids and a simple resection of the external hemorrhoids.' "
What are hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids'' are swollen veins in the lowest part of the rectum and anus. They are also called ''piles''.\xa0 ''The most accurate explanation for the development of ''hemorrhoids'' is that they appear due to the abnormal sliding of the veins at your bottom because of sustained straining during passing stools along with irregular bowel habits.\xa0''Hard, bulky stools (as in long-term ''constipation'') promote straining, which is more likely to push the cushions of the blood vessels out of the anus. The straining may also cause ''congestion'' or engorgement of the cushions during passing stools, making their displacement more likely.\xa0''Because of prolonged strain and pressure, the walls of these blood vessels may stretch so thin that the veins bulge and get irritated, leading to swelling and bleeding.''The symptoms of ''hemorrhoids'' include''The treatment options for ''hemorrhoids'' include' Bleeding, Itching, Pain, Swelling or lump around the anus, Burning sensation and Sticky discharge from the anus. Conservative management (lifestyle modifications, home remedies, and medications), Office-based treatments (sclerotherapy, rubber band ligation, and infrared coagulation) and Operative treatments (excisional hemorrhoidectomy, stapled hemorrhoidopexy, and hemorrhoid artery ligation (HAL))."
What are the differences between stapled hemorrhoidopexy and hemorrhoidectomy?,"'The differences are as follows:''In the cases of prolapsed hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids that have slipped down out of the anus)' A hemorrhoidectomy is a procedure for the surgical removal (excision) of hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy involves stapling the last section of the large bowel, which reduces the supply of blood to the hemorrhoids and causes them to gradually shrink. A hemorrhoidectomy may be performed under local or general anesthesia. In stapled hemorrhoidopexy, general anesthesia is usually used, though the procedure may be performed with monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and local anesthesia. Hemorrhoidectomy: Pain is usually mild during the initial days after the procedure but is exacerbated by bowel movements. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy: Pain is usually most severe in the first 72 hours. Bowel movements do not increase the pain. Hemorrhoidectomy can treat both prolapsed and non-prolapsed hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy cannot be used to treat prolapsed hemorrhoids. Success rate is similar for both the procedures. Postoperative complications are similar for both the procedures."
What are the complications of a hemorrhoid surgery?,"'The complications of a ''hemorrhoid'' surgery include' Pain, Bleeding, Infection, Urine retention, Abscess (a localized collection of pus), Fistula formation (an abnormal communication path between the anus and rectum), Loss of bowel control and Anal stenosis (abnormal narrowing of the anus)."
What are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?,"'Sexually transmitted diseases'' (STDs) are infections that can be transferred from one person to another through any type of sexual contact. STDs are sometimes referred to as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since they involve the transmission of a disease-causing organism from one person to another during sexual activity. It is important to realize that sexual contact includes more than just sexual intercourse (vaginal and anal). Sexual contact includes kissing, oral-genital contact, and the use of sexual ""toys,"" such as vibrators. STDs probably have been around for thousands of years, but the most dangerous of these conditions, the ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS'' or ''HIV'' disease), has only been recognized since 1984.''Many STDs are treatable, but effective cures are lacking for others, such as ''HIV'', ''HPV'', and ''hepatitis B'' and ''hepatitis C''. Even gonorrhea, once easily cured, has become resistant to many of the older traditional antibiotics. Many STDs can be present in, and spread by, people who do not have any symptoms of the condition and have not yet been diagnosed with an ''STD''. Therefore, public awareness and education about these infections and the methods of preventing them is important.''There really is no such thing as ""safe"" sex. The only truly effective way to prevent STDs is abstinence. Sex in the context of a monogamous relationship wherein neither party is infected with an STD also is considered ""safe."" Most people think that kissing is a safe activity. But unfortunately, ''syphilis'', ''herpes'', and other infections can be contracted through this relatively simple and apparently harmless act. All other forms of sexual contact carry some risk. Condoms are commonly thought to protect against STDs. Condoms are useful in decreasing the spread of certain infections, such as ''chlamydia'' and gonorrhea; however, they do not fully protect against other infections such as genital herpes, ''genital warts'', syphilis, and ''AIDS''. ''Prevention'' of the spread of STDs is dependent upon the counseling of at-risk individuals and the early diagnosis and treatment of infections.' "
What are the most common STDs in women?,"'Common STDs in women include Chlamydia, genital herpes, ''human papillomavirus'' (HPV) infection, syphilis, and gonorrhea. In 2019 the ''Sexually Transmitted Disease'' Surveillance Report released US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that the three most common reportable STDs- syphilis, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia- were on the rise. The numbers of syphilis and gonorrhea cases reported from 2017-2018 were higher than any point since 1991, and the number of Chlamydia cases reported (almost 1.7 million cases) was the highest ever recorded.''A serious consequence of the increase in syphilis is a dramatic increase in the number of newborns affected by syphilis. Congenital syphilis is passed from a mother the baby during ''pregnancy'' is a serious condition that can lead to ''miscarriage'', ''stillbirth'', ''newborn'' death, and severe medical and neurological problems.' "
1. Gonorrhea,"'Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection caused by the organism ''Neisseria gonorrheae'' (also known as gonococcus bacteriae) that is transmitted by sexual contact. Gonorrhea is one of the oldest known sexually transmitted diseases. It is estimated that over one million women are currently infected with gonorrhea. Among women who are infected, a significant percentage also will be infected with chlamydia, another type of bacteria that causes another STD. (Chlamydia infection is discussed later in this article.)''Contrary to popular belief, gonorrhea cannot be transmitted from toilet seats or door handles. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea requires very specific conditions for growth and reproduction. It cannot live outside the body for longer than a few minutes, nor can it live on the skin of the hands, arms, or legs. It survives only on moist surfaces within the body and is found most commonly in the vagina, and, more commonly, the cervix. (The cervix is the end of the uterus that protrudes into the vagina.) It can also live in the tube (urethra) through which urine drains from the bladder. Gonorrhea can also exist in the back of the throat (from oral-genital contact) and in the rectum.''A majority of infected women have no symptoms, especially in the early stages of the infection. When women do experience signs and symptoms gonorrhea they include''If untreated, gonorrhea can lead to a severe pelvic infection with inflammation of the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. Gonorrhea can also spread through the body to infect joints to cause gonococcal ''arthritis''. Gonorrheal infection of the Fallopian tubes can lead to a serious, painful infection of the pelvis known as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' or PID. PID occurs in a significant portion of women with gonorrheal infection of the uterine cervix. Symptoms of pelvic infection include ''fever'', pelvic cramping, ''abdominal pain'', or ''pain'' with intercourse. Pelvic infection can lead to difficulty in ''becoming pregnant'' or even sterility. Occasionally, if the infection is severe enough, a localized area of infection and pus (an ''abscess'') forms, and major surgery may be necessary and even lifesaving. Gonorrhea infection in people with conditions causing serious abnormal immune function, such as ''AIDS'', can also be more serious.''Testing for gonorrhea is done by swabbing the infected site (rectum, throat, cervix) and identifying the bacteria in the laboratory either through culturing of the material from the swab (growing the bacteria) or identification of the genetic material from the bacteria. Sometimes the tests do not show bacteria because of sampling errors (the sampled area does not contain bacteria) or other technical difficulties, even when the woman has an infection. Newer tests to diagnose gonorrhea involve the use of DNA probes or amplification techniques (for example, ''polymerase chain reaction'', or ''PCR'') to identify the genetic material of the bacteria. These tests are more expensive than cultures but typically yield more rapid results.''In the past, the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea was fairly simple. A single injection of ''penicillin'' cured almost every infected person. Unfortunately, there are new ''strains'' of gonorrhea that have become resistant to various antibiotics, including ''penicillins'', and are therefore more difficult to treat. Fortunately, gonorrhea can still be treated by other injectable or oral medications.''Uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum, are usually treated by a single injection of ceftriaxone or by oral ''cefixime'' (''Suprax''). For uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the pharynx, the recommended treatment is ceftriaxone in a single IM dose.''Alternative regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum include spectinomycin in nonpregnant women (not available in the United States) or single doses of other cephalosporins such as ceftizoxime or cefoxitin, administered with ''probenecid'' (Benemid), 1 g orally; or cefotaxime.''Treatment for gonorrhea should always include medication that will treat chlamydia [for example, ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'', ''Zmax'') or ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox'' and others)] as well as gonorrhea, because gonorrhea and chlamydia frequently exist together in the same person. The sexual partners of women who have had either gonorrhea or chlamydia must receive treatment for both infections since their partners may be infected as well. Treating the partners also prevents reinfection of the woman. Women suffering from PID or gonococcal arthritis require more aggressive treatment that is effective against the bacteria that cause gonorrhea as well as against other organisms. These women often require intravenous administration of antibiotics.''It is important to note that doxycycline, one of the recommended ''drugs'' for treatment of PID, is not recommended for use in ''pregnant'' women.''Gonorrhea is one of the easier STDs to prevent because the bacterium that causes the infection can survive only under certain conditions. The use of condoms protects against gonorrhea infection. Since the organism can live in the throat, condoms should be used during oral-genital contact as well.'  burning during urination, frequent urination, a yellowish vaginal discharge, redness and swelling of the genitals, and vaginal itching or burning."
2. Chlamydia,"'Chlamydia (''Chlamydia trachomatis'') is a bacterium that causes an infection that is very similar to gonorrhea in the way that it is spread and the symptoms it produces. It is common; estimates indicate 2.9 million infections occur annually in the U.S. Like gonorrhea, the chlamydia bacterium is found in the cervix and urethra and can live in the throat or rectum. Both infected men and infected women frequently lack ''symptoms of chlamydia'' infection. Thus, these individuals can unknowingly spread the infection to others. Another strain (type) of ''Chlamydia trachomatis'',, which can be distinguished in specialized laboratories, causes the STD known as ''lymphogranuloma venereum'' (''LGV''; see below).''The majority of women with chlamydia do not have symptoms. Cervicitis (infection of the uterine cervix) is the most common manifestation of the infection. While about half of women with chlamydial cervicitis have no symptoms, others may experience vaginal discharge or ''abdominal pain''. Infection of the urethra is often associated with chlamydial infection of the cervix. Women with infection of the urethra (''urethritis'') have the typical symptoms of a ''urinary tract infection'', including ''pain'' upon urination and the frequent and urgent need to urinate.''Chlamydia is very destructive to the Fallopian tubes. It can also cause severe pelvic infection. If untreated, some women with chlamydia will develop ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID; see above). Because it is common for infected women to have no symptoms, chlamydial infection is often untreated and results in extensive destruction of the Fallopian tubes, ''fertility'' problems and ''tubal pregnancy''.''Chlamydial infection, like gonorrhea, is associated with an increased incidence of premature births. In addition, the infant can acquire the infection during passage through the infected birth canal, leading to serious eye damage or ''pneumonia''. For this reason, all newborns are treated with eye drops containing an antibiotic that kills chlamydia. Treatment of all newborns is routine because of the large number of infected women without symptoms and the dire consequences of chlamydial eye infection to the newborn.''Chlamydia can be detected on material collected by swabbing the cervix during a traditional examination using a speculum, but noninvasive screening tests done on urine or on self-collected vaginal swabs are less expensive and sometimes more acceptable to patients. While culturing of the organism can confirm the diagnosis, this method is limited to research laboratories and forensic investigations. For routine diagnostic use, newer and inexpensive diagnostic tests that depend upon identification and amplification of the genetic material of the organism have replaced the older, time-consuming culture methods.''Treatment of chlamydia involves antibiotics. A convenient single-dose therapy for chlamydia is oral azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax). Alternative treatments are often used, however, because of the high cost of this medication. The most common alternative treatment is doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox, and others). Unlike gonorrhea, there has been little, if any, resistance of chlamydia to current antibiotics. There are many other antibiotics that also have been effective against chlamydia. As with gonorrhea, a ''condom'' or other protective barrier prevents the spread of the infection.' "
4. Syphilis,"'Syphilis is an STD that has been around for centuries. It is caused by a bacterial organism called a spirochete. The scientific name for the organism is ''Treponema pallidum''. The spirochete is a wormlike, spiral-shaped organism that wiggles vigorously when viewed under a microscope. It infects the person by burrowing into the moist, mucous-covered lining of the mouth or genitals. The spirochete produces a classic, painless ulcer known as a ''chancre''.''There are three stages of syphilis, along with an inactive (latent) stage. ''Formation of an ulcer (chancre) is the first stage.'' The chancre develops any time from 10 to 90 days after infection, with an average time of 21 days following infection until the first symptoms develop. Syphilis is highly ''contagious'' when the ulcer is present.'""The infection can be transmitted from contact with the ulcer that teems with spirochetes. If the ulcer is outside of the vagina or on the male's scrotum, condoms may not prevent transmission of the infection by contact. Similarly, if the ulcer is in the mouth, merely kissing the infected individual can spread the infection. The ulcer can resolve without treatment after three to six weeks, but the disease can recur months later as secondary syphilis if the primary stage is not treated.""'In most women, an early infection resolves on its own, even without treatment. However, some will proceed to the ''second stage of the infection called ""secondary"" syphilis'', which develops weeks to months after the primary stage and lasts from four to six weeks. Secondary syphilis is a systemic stage of the disease, meaning that it can involve various organ systems of the body. In this stage, patients can initially experience many different symptoms, but most commonly they develop a skin ''rash'', typically appearing on the palms of the hands or the bottoms of the ''feet'', that does not ''itch''. Sometimes the skin ''rash'' of secondary syphilis is very faint and hard to recognize; it may not even be noticed in all cases. This secondary stage can also include ''hair loss'', ''sore throat'', ''fever'', ''headaches'', and white patches in the nose, mouth, and vagina. There can be lesions on the genitals that look like ''genital warts'' but are caused by spirochetes rather than the wart virus. These wart-like lesions, as well as the skin rash, are highly contagious. The rash can occur on the palms of the hands, and the infection can be transmitted by casual contact.''Subsequent to secondary syphilis, some patients will continue to carry the infection in their body without symptoms. ''This is the so-called latent stage of the infection.'' Then, with or without a latent stage, which can last as long as 20 or more years, the third (tertiary) stage of the disease can develop. At this stage, syphilis usually is no longer contagious. Tertiary syphilis is also a systemic stage of the disease and can cause a variety of problems throughout the body including:''Syphilis can be diagnosed by scraping the base of the ulcer and looking under a special type of microscope (dark field microscope) for the spirochetes. However, because these spirochetes are rarely detected, the diagnosis is most often made and treatment is prescribed based upon the appearance of the chancre. Diagnosis of syphilis is complicated by the fact that the causative organism cannot be grown in the laboratory. Therefore, cultures of affected areas cannot be used for diagnosis.''Special blood tests can also be used to diagnose syphilis. The standard screening blood tests for syphilis are called the ''Venereal Disease'"" Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Rapid Plasminogen Reagent (RPR) tests. These tests detect the body's response to the infection, but not to the actual ""'Treponema'' organism that causes the infection. These tests are thus referred to as non-treponemal tests. Although the non-treponemal tests are very effective in detecting evidence of infection, they can also produce a positive result when no infection is actually present (so-called false-positive results for syphilis). Consequently, any positive non-treponemal test must be confirmed by a treponemal test specific for the organism causing syphilis, such as the microhemagglutination assay for ''T. pallidum'"" (MHA-TP) and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-ABS). These treponemal tests directly detect the body's response to ""'Treponema pallidum''.''Depending on the stage of disease and the clinical manifestations, the treatment options for syphilis vary. Long-acting penicillin injections have been very effective in treating both early and late stage syphilis. The treatment of neurosyphilis requires the intravenous administration of penicillin. Alternative treatments include oral doxycycline or ''tetracycline''.''Women who are infected during pregnancy can pass on the infection to the fetus through the placenta. Penicillin must be used in pregnant patients with syphilis since other antibiotics do not effectively cross the placenta to treat the infected fetus. Left untreated, syphilis can lead to ''blindness'' or even death of the infant.'

 abnormal bulging of the large vessel leaving the heart (the aorta), resulting in heart problems; the development of large nodules (gummas) in various organs of the body; infection of the brain, causing a stroke, mental confusion, meningitis (type of brain infection), problems with sensation, or weakness (neurosyphilis); involvement of the eyes leading to sight deterioration; or involvement of the ears resulting in deafness. The damage sustained by the body during the tertiary stage of syphilis is severe and can even be fatal."
5. Genital herpes,"'Genital herpes, also commonly called ""herpes,"" is a viral infection by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that is transmitted through intimate contact with the mucous-covered linings of the mouth or the vagina or the genital skin. The virus enters the linings or skin through microscopic tears. Once inside, the virus travels to the nerve roots near the spinal cord and settles there permanently.''When an infected person has a herpes outbreak, the virus travels down the nerve fibers to the site of the original infection. When it reaches the skin, the typical redness and ''blisters'' occur. After the initial outbreak, subsequent outbreaks tend to be sporadic. They may occur weekly or even years apart.''Two types of herpes ''viruses'' are associated with genital lesions: herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more often causes blisters of the mouth area while HSV-2 more often causes genital sores or lesions in the area around the anus. The outbreak of herpes is closely related to the functioning of the immune system. Women who have suppressed immune systems, because of ''stress'', infection, or medications, have more frequent and longer-lasting outbreaks.''Genital herpes is spread only by direct person-to-person contact. It is believed that a majority of sexually active adults carry the herpes virus. Part of the reason for the continued high infection rate is that most women infected with the herpes virus do not know that they are infected because they have few or no symptoms. In many women, there are ""atypical"" outbreaks where the only symptom may be mild ''itching'' or minimal discomfort. Moreover, the longer the woman has had the virus, the fewer the symptoms they have with their outbreaks. Finally, the virus can shed from the cervix into the vagina in women who are not experiencing any symptoms.''Once exposed to the virus, there is an incubation period that generally lasts 3 to 7 days before a lesion develops. During this time, there are no symptoms and the virus cannot be transmitted to others. An outbreak usually begins within two weeks of initial infection and manifests as an ''itching'' or tingling sensation followed by redness of the skin. Finally, a ''blister'' forms. The blisters and subsequent ulcers that form when the blisters break, are usually very painful to touch and may last from 7 days to 2 weeks. The infection is definitely contagious from the time of itching to the time of complete healing of the ulcer, usually within 2 to 4 weeks. However, as noted above, infected individuals can also transmit the virus to their sex partners in the absence of a recognized outbreak.''Genital herpes is suspected when multiple painful blisters occur in a sexually exposed area. During the initial outbreak, fluid from the blisters may be sent to the laboratory to try and culture the virus, but cultures only return a positive result in about 50% of those infected. In other words, a negative test result from a blister is not as helpful as a positive test result, because the test may be a false-negative test. However, if a sample of a fluid-filled blister (in the early stage before it dries up and crusts) tests positive for herpes, the test result is very reliable. Cultures taken during an initial outbreak of the condition are more likely to be positive for the presence of HSV than cultures from subsequent outbreaks.''There are also blood tests that can detect antibodies to the herpes viruses that can be useful in some situations. These tests are specific for HSV-1 or HSV-2 and are able to demonstrate that a person has been infected at some point in time with the virus, and they may be useful in identifying infection that does not produce characteristic symptoms. However, because false-positive results can occur and because the test results are not always clear-cut, they are not recommended for routine use in screening low-risk populations for HSV infection.''Other diagnostic tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the genetic material of the virus and rapid fluorescent antibody screening tests are used to identify HSV in some laboratories.''Although there is no known cure for herpes, there are treatments for the outbreaks. There are oral medications, such as ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax''), ''famciclovir'' (''Famvir''), or ''valacyclovir'' (''Valtrex'') that prevent the virus from multiplying and even shorten the length of the eruption. Although topical (applied directly on the lesions) agents exist, they are generally less effective than other medications and are not routinely used. Medication that is taken by mouth, or in severe cases intravenously, is more effective. It is important to remember that there is still no cure for genital herpes and that these treatments only reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks.''Since the initial infection with HSV tends to be the most severe episode, an antiviral medication usually is warranted. These medications can significantly reduce pain and decrease the length of time until the sores heal, but treatment of the first infection does not appear to reduce the frequency of recurrent episodes.''In contrast to a new outbreak of genital herpes, recurrent herpes episodes tend to be mild, and the benefit of antiviral medications is only derived if therapy is started immediately prior to the outbreak or within the first 24 hours of the outbreak. Thus, the antiviral drug must be provided for the patient in advance. The patient is instructed to begin treatment as soon as the familiar pre-outbreak ""tingling"" sensation occurs or at the very onset of blister formation.''Finally, suppressive therapy to prevent frequent recurrences may be indicated for those with more than six outbreaks in a given year. Acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex) may all be given as suppressive therapies.''Herpes can be spread from one part of the body to another during an outbreak.' Therefore, it is important not to touch the eyes or mouth after touching the blisters or ulcers. Thorough hand washing is a must during outbreaks. Clothing that comes in contact with ulcers should not be shared with others. Couples that want to minimize the risk of transmission should always use condoms if a partner is infected. Unfortunately, even when an infected partner isn't currently having an outbreak, herpes can be spread. Couples may also want to consider avoiding all sexual contact, including kissing, during an outbreak of herpes. Since an active genital herpes outbreak (with blisters) during labor and delivery can be harmful to the infant, pregnant women who suspect that they have genital herpes should tell their doctor. Women who have herpes and are pregnant can have a vaginal delivery as long as they are not experiencing symptoms or actually having an outbreak while in labor."
6. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and genital warts,"'More than 40 types of HPV, which are the cause of genital ''warts'' (also known as condylomata acuminata or venereal ''warts''), can infect the genital tract of men and women. These warts are primarily transmitted during sexual contact. Other, different HPV types generally cause ''common warts'' elsewhere on the body. HPV infection has long been known to be a cause of ''cervical cancer'' and other anogenital ''cancers'' in women, and it has also been linked with both anal and ''penile cancer'' in men.''HPV infection is now considered to be the most common ''sexually transmitted infection'' in the US, and it is believed that at a majority of the reproductive-age population has been infected with sexually transmitted HPV at some point in life.''HPV infection is common and does not usually lead to the development of warts, cancers, or specific symptoms. In fact, the majority of people infected with HPV have no symptoms or lesions at all. The ultimate test to detect HPV involves identification of the genetic material (DNA) of the virus.''Of note, it has not been definitively established whether the immune system is able to permanently clear the body of an HPV infection. For this reason, it is impossible to predict exactly how common HPV infection is in the general population.''Asymptomatic people (those without HPV-induced warts or lesions) who have HPV infections are still able to spread the infections to others through sexual contact.''A typical appearance of a genital lesion may prompt the physician to treat without further testing, especially in someone who has had prior outbreaks of genital warts. Genital warts usually appear as small, fleshy, raised ''bumps'', but they can sometimes be extensive and have a cauliflower-like appearance. They may occur on any sexually-exposed area. In many cases genital warts do not cause any symptoms, but they are sometimes associated with itching, burning, or tenderness.''HPV can sometimes be suspected by changes that appear on a ''Pap smear'', although Pap smears were not really designed to detect HPV. In the case of an abnormal Pap smear, the clinician will often do advanced testing on the material to determine if, and which kind, of HPV may be present. HPV can also be detected if a biopsy (for example, from a ''genital wart'' or from the uterine cervix) is sent to the laboratory for analysis.''There is no cure or treatment that can eradicate HPV infection, so the only treatment is to remove the lesions caused by the virus. Unfortunately, even removal of the warts does not necessarily prevent the spread of the virus, and genital warts frequently recur. None of the available treatments are ideal or clearly superior to others.'""A treatment that can be administered by the patient is a 0.5% solution or gel of podofilox (podophyllotoxin). The medication is applied to the warts twice per day for three days followed by 4 days without treatment. Treatment should be continued up to three to four weeks or until the lesions are gone. Podofilox may also be applied every other day for a total of three weeks. Alternatively, a 5% cream of imiquimod (a substance that stimulates the body's production of cytokines, chemicals that direct and strengthen the immune response) is likewise applied by the patient three times a week at bedtime, and then washed off with mild soap and water 6-10 hours later. The applications are repeated for up to 16 weeks or until the lesions are gone. Sinecatechin 15% ointment, a green-tea extract with an active product (catechins), is another topical treatment that can be applied by the patient. This drug should be applied three times daily until complete clearance of warts, for up to 16 weeks.""'Only an experienced physician can perform some of the treatments for genital warts. These include, for example, placing a small amount of a 10% to 25% solution of podophyllin resin on the lesions, and then, after a period of hours, washing off the podophyllin. The treatments are repeated weekly until the genital warts are gone. An 80% to 90% solution of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloracetic acid (BCA) can also be applied weekly by a physician to the lesions. Injection of 5-fluorouracil epinephrine gel into the lesions has also been shown to be effective in treating genital warts.''Alternative methods include ''cryotherapy'' (freezing the genital warts with liquid nitrogen) every one to two weeks, surgical removal of the lesions, or laser surgery. Laser surgery and surgical excision both require a local or general anesthetic, depending upon the extent of the lesions.''Women who have evidence of moderate to severe ''precancerous'' changes in the uterine cervix require treatment to ensure that these cells do not become invasive ''cancer''. In this case, treatment usually involves surgical removal or destruction of the involved tissue. Conization is a procedure that removes the precancerous area of the cervix using a knife, a laser, or a procedure known as ''LEEP'' (''loop electrosurgical excision procedure'', which uses an electric current passing through a thin wire that acts as a knife). Cryotherapy (freezing) or laser therapy may be used to destroy tissue areas that contain potentially precancerous changes.''Both people with HPV infection and their partners need to be counseled about the risk of spreading HPV and the appearance of the lesions. They should understand that the absence of lesions does not exclude the possibility of transmission and that condoms are not completely effective in preventing the spread of the infection. It is important to note that it is not known whether treatment decreases infectivity. Finally, female partners of men with genital warts should be reminded of the importance of regular Pap smears to screen for ''cervical cancer'"" and precancerous changes in the cervix, since precancerous changes can be treated and reduce a woman's risk of developing cervical ""'cancer''. Similarly, men should be informed of the potential risk of anal cancers, although it is not yet been determined how to best screen for or manage early ''anal cancer''.''A ''vaccine'' available against four common HPV types associated with the development of genital warts and cervical and anogenital carcinomas. This vaccine (''Gardasil'') has received FDA approval for use in males and females between 9 and 26 years of age.' "
7. Chancroid,"'Chancroid'' is an infection caused by the bacterium ''Hemophilus ducreyi'', which is passed from one sexual partner to another. It begins in a sexually exposed area of the genital skin, most commonly the penis and vulva (the female external genital organs including the labia, clitoris, and entrance to the vagina). Chancroid starts out as a tender bump that emerges 3 to10 days (the incubation period) after the sexual exposure. The cells that form the bump then begin to die, and the bump becomes an ulcer (an open sore) that is usually painful. Often, there is an associated tenderness and swelling of the glands (''lymph nodes'') in the groin that normally drain lymph (tissue fluid) from the genital area; however, the painful ulcer and tender lymph nodes occur together in only about one-third of infections. Chancroid is common in developing countries but is a relatively rare cause of genital ulcers in the U.S.''A clinical diagnosis of chancroid (which is made from the medical history and physical examination) can be made if the patient has one or more painful ulcers in the genital area and tests are negative for syphilis or herpes. (The word ''chancroid'' means resembling a chancre, the genital ulcer that is caused by syphilis. Chancroid sometimes is called soft chancre to distinguish it from the chancre of syphilis that feels hard to the touch. The ulcer of chancroid also is painful, unlike the ulcer of syphilis that is painless.) The diagnosis of chancroid can be confirmed by a culture of the material from within the ulcer for the bacterium ''Hemophilus ducreyi''. The clinical diagnosis justifies the treatment of chancroid even if cultures are not available.''Chancroid is almost always cured with a single oral dose of azithromycin (Zithromax) or a single injection of ceftriaxone (Rocephin). Alternative medications are ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'') or ''erythromycin''. Whichever treatment is used, the ulcers should improve within seven days. If no improvement is seen after treatment, the patient should be reevaluated for causes of ulcers other than chancroid. HIV-infected individuals are at an increased risk for failing treatment for chancroid and should be observed closely to assure that the treatment has been effective.'""A health care professional should evaluate anyone who has had sexual contact with a person with chancroid. Whether or not exposed individuals have an ulcer, they should be treated. Moreover, if the contact was 10 days or less before the onset of their partner's ulcer, they should be treated."" "
8. Pubic lice and scabies (ectoparasitic infections),"'Ectoparasitic infections are infections that are caused by tiny parasitic bugs, such as ''lice'' or mites. They are transmitted by close physical contact, including sexual contact. The parasites affect the skin or hair and cause itching.''Pediculosis'' pubis is an infection of the genital area caused by the crab louse (Phthirus pubis). The lice (commonly called ''crabs'') are small bugs that are visible to the naked eye without the aid of a magnifying glass or microscope. The lice live on pubic hair (or any other hair) and are associated with itching.''The treatment for ''pubic lice'"" is usually with a 1% cream rinse of permethrin that is applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes. Alternative treatments include pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide applied for 10 minutes before washing off. None of these treatments should be used for involvement near the eyes because they can be very irritating. The patient's bedding and clothing should be machine-washed with hot water. All sexual partners within the preceding month should be treated for ""'pubic lice'' and evaluated for other STDs.''Scabies'' is an ectoparasitic infection caused by a ''mite'' (known as Sarcoptes scabiei) that is not visible with the naked eye but can be seen with a magnifying glass or microscope. The parasites live on the skin and cause itching over the hands, arms, trunk, legs, and buttocks. The itching usually starts several weeks after exposure to a person with ''scabies'' and is often associated with small bumps over the area of itching. The itching from ''scabies'' is usually worse at night.''The standard treatment for scabies is a 5% cream of permethrin (''Elimite''), which is applied to the entire body from the neck down and then washed off after 8 to 14 hours. Treatment is repeated in one week.''Ivermectin'' (''Stromectol'') is a drug taken by mouth that has also been successfully used to treat scabies. The CDC recommends taking this drug at a dosage of 200 micrograms per kilogram body weight as a single dose, followed by a repeat dose two weeks later. While a patient my find that taking a drug by mouth is more convenient than application of the cream, ivermectin has a greater risk of toxic side effects than permethrin and has not been shown to be superior to permethrin in eradicating scabies.''An alternative treatment is 1 ounce of a 1% lotion or 30 grams of cream of lindane, applied from the neck down and washed off after approximately eight hours. Unfortunately, itching may persist for up to two months after successful therapy. Since lindane can cause ''seizures'' when it is absorbed through the skin, it should not be used if skin is significantly irritated or wet, such as with extensive skin disease, rash, or after a bath. As an additional precaution, lindane should not be used in pregnant or ''nursing'' women or children younger than 2 years old.''As with pubic lice infection, both the bedding and clothing of an infected individual should be machine-washed in hot water. Finally, all sexual and close personal and household contacts within the month before the infection should be examined and treated if infection is found.' "
9. HIV and AIDS,"'Infection with the ''human immunodeficiency virus'"" (HIV) weakens the body's immune system and increases the body's vulnerability to many different infections, as well as the development of certain cancers.""'HIV is a viral infection that is primarily transmitted by sexual contact or sharing needles, or from an infected pregnant woman to her newborn. Negative antibody tests do not rule out recent infection. Most people who are infected will have a positive HIV antibody test within 12 weeks of exposure.''Although there are no specific symptoms or signs that confirm HIV infection, many people will develop a nonspecific illness two to four weeks after they have been infected. This initial illness may be characterized by fever, ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', muscle and ''joint pains'', ''headache'', ''sore throat'', and/or painful lymph nodes. On average, people are ill for up to two weeks with the initial illness. In rare cases, the initial illness has occurred up to 10 months after infection. It is also possible to become infected with the HIV virus without having recognized the initial illness.''The average time from infection to the development of symptoms related to immunosuppression (decreased functioning of the immune system) is 10 years. Serious complications include unusual infections or cancers, ''weight loss'', intellectual deterioration (''dementia''), and death. When the symptoms of HIV are severe, the disease is referred to as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Numerous treatment options now available for HIV-infected individuals allow many patients to control their infection and delay the progression of their disease to AIDS.' "
How can women prevent from getting STDs?,"'The most important fact to remember about sexually transmitted infections is that all of them are preventable. However, the risks of these infections are often downplayed and thus forgotten by many. The use of condoms can help decrease the risk of transmission of certain infections, but they do not prevent the transmission of many infections. There is truly no such thing as ''safe sex''. Sex in the context of a monogamous relationship wherein neither party is infected with a STD is, however, considered safe.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat STDs in women?,"'STDs in women can be treated by primary care providers, including internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians. In many cases, obstetrician-gynecologists treat STDs in women. For certain STDs, like HIV and ''hepatitis'', other specialists including immunologists, hepatologists, and gastroenterologists may be consulted.' "
What is syphilis?,"'Syphilis'' is a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'') caused by an infection with bacteria known as ''Treponema pallidum''. Like other ''STDs'', syphilis can be spread by any type of sexual contact. Syphilis can also be spread from an infected mother to the fetus during ''pregnancy'' or to the baby at the time of birth.''Syphilis has been described for centuries. It can cause long-term damage to different organs if not properly treated.' "
What causes syphillis?,"'The bacteria that cause syphilis, ''Treponema pallidum'', are referred to as spirochetes due to their spiral shape. The organisms penetrate into the lining of the mouth or genital area. ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of syphilis?,"'Syphilis infection, when untreated, progresses through different clinical stages with characteristic signs and symptoms. After the first infection, symptoms typically develop at around 21 days after the infection, but they may appear anywhere from 10 to 90 days following infection.''Primary syphilis''The first, or primary, stage of syphilis is characterized by the formation of a painless ulcer known as a ''chancre''. This sore develops at the site of infection and is usually solitary. A chancre is usually firm and round in shape. Sometimes, multiple chancres may be present. The chancre contains the infectious bacteria and while the sore is present, the condition is highly ''contagious''. Any contact with the chancre can spread the infection. If the chancre is located in the mouth, for example, even kissing can spread the disease. The chancre lasts for about 3 to 6 weeks and typically then goes away on its own. The use of ''condoms'' may also not prevent spread of the illness if the chancre is located on an area of the body not covered by the ''condom''.''Secondary syphilis''If primary syphilis is left untreated, secondary syphilis may develop. This stage of the illness usually occurs weeks to months after the primary stage. Secondary syphilis is characterized by a skin ''rash'' that typically does not ''itch'' and may easily be mistaken for ''rashes'' caused by other illnesses. It may appear on almost any part of the body, including sores inside the mouth, vagina, or anus. The ''rash'' of secondary syphilis is often found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the ''feet'', which is unusual for most ''rashes''. In some people, the rash may be mild and not noticed. Raised gray or whitish patches of skin, known as condyloma lata, may also develop, particularly in warm and moist areas of the body such as the armpits, mouth, or groin.''In secondary syphilis, the infection has spread throughout the body, so other symptoms may be associated with the skin manifestations. ''Fever'', ''enlarged lymph nodes'', ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'', ''hair loss'', ''headaches'', and muscle aches have all been reported in the secondary stage of syphilis. These symptoms will eventually subside, but if this secondary stage of the infection is not treated, the infection can progress to tertiary syphilis.''Tertiary syphilis''After the symptoms of secondary syphilis go away, the infection remains latent in the body if untreated. About 15% of infected and untreated people will go on to develop the third stage of syphilis, which can occur as much as 10 to 20 years after the initial infection. Tertiary syphilis is characterized by damage to any number of organ systems and can even be fatal. Tertiary syphilis can cause damage to the brain, nerves, eyes, ''heart'', blood vessels, ''liver'', bones, and joints. Symptoms that can result from the late stage of syphilis include problems with movement, gradual loss of sight, ''dementia'', ''paralysis'', and numbness. Neurosyphilis is the term used to refer to the involvement of the central nervous system and alterations in neurologic function.''Neonatal'' or congenital syphilis''Untreated syphilis in a ''pregnant'' women results in death of the fetus in up to 40% of infected pregnant women (''stillbirth'' or death shortly after birth), so all pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at their first ''prenatal'' visit. The screening test is usually repeated in the ''third trimester'' of pregnancy as well. If infected ''babies'' are born and survive, they are at risk for serious problems including ''seizures'' and developmental delays. Fortunately, syphilis in pregnancy is treatable.' "
What tests are used to diagnose syphilis?,"""There are two types of tests used to diagnose syphilis: treponemal tests (that identify antibodies to the causative organism) and non-treponemal tests (that identify the body's response to the infection but not to the organism itself). ""'The blood tests used to screen for syphilis are called the ''Venereal Disease'"" Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Rapid Plasminogen Reagent (RPR) tests. These tests detect the body's response to the infection, but not to the actual Treponema organism. While these are good screening tests, they are not specific enough to establish the diagnosis. These tests can give false-positive results, so a positive screening VDRL or RPR test must be followed by a treponemal test to detect the organism.""'A number of different tests are available that detect antibodies to ''Treponema pallidum'' bacteria. Examples include the microhemagglutination assay for ''T. pallidum'' (MHA-TP) and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-ABS). These tests can confirm the diagnosis of syphilis if a nontreponemal test such as VDRL or RPR is positive.' "
What is the treatment for syphilis?,"'Penicillin'' is the treatment of choice for syphilis in all stages. One intramuscular injection of long-acting benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units) is sufficient for a person who has primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. Three doses of this drug at weekly intervals are recommended for individuals with late latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration. While treatment kills the bacteria and prevents further organ damage, it will not reverse damage to the organs that has already occurred. Treatment with penicillin is safe during pregnancy.' "
What are the potential complications of syphilis?,"'As mentioned, untreated syphilis spreads throughout the body and causes complications with various organ systems. Some of the better known complications of late syphilis include ''blindness'', ''dementia'', ''aortic aneurysm'', deafness, ''stroke'', and other complications related to spread of the infection to the brain. Late stage syphilis can cause fatal complications.' "
What is the prognosis for syphilis?,"'Syphilis infection can be cured in any stage by the administration of penicillin. However, in later stages, damage already done to organs is not reversible.' "
Can syphilis be prevented?,"'There is no ''vaccine'' available to prevent syphilis. The use of ''safe sex'' practices, including condom use, can only prevent syphilis if the infectious chancre is located in a body area protected by a condom. Washing or ''douching'' after sexual activity cannot prevent the infection. It is not always possible to know whether a sex partner is infected with syphilis because the chancre (ulcer) may be located inside the vagina or rectum. Neonatal syphilis is preventable by treating the mother early in her pregnancy.' "
What are the most common STDs in women?,"'Common ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (STDs) in women include''HPV'' is the most common STD in women, which is also the main cause of ''cervical cancer''. There are ''vaccines'' available against cervical ''cancer'' for ''prevention''.''Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital ''herpes'' are common STDs. Chlamydia is the most commonly reported STD in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 50% of new chlamydia and gonorrhea cases occur in women between the ages of 15 and 24. A total of 20 million new STD cases are reported every year in the United States alone and approximately 357 million new infections of ''syphilis'', chlamydia, gonorrhea, and ''trichomoniasis'' are reported every year worldwide.\xa0' Human papillomavirus (HPV) Gonorrhea Chlamydia Genital herpes Bacterial vaginosis"
How can you prevent yourself and your partner from STDs?,"'Everyone should take certain precautionary steps to avoid getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as follows' Regular testing: Get a Papanicolaou (PAP) smear test every three to five years. Vaccination: Ask the gynecologist about getting tested for any other STDs and whether human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination can be suggested. Protection during sex: Use of female condoms and dental dams can provide a certain level of protection. It can help to protect both a woman and her partner from STDs. Spermicides, birth control pills, and other forms of contraception may protect a woman against pregnancy but not from STDs. Communication: A woman should honestly communicate with the gynecologist and her partner about their sexual history."
What if you get STDs during pregnancy?,"'Because there are no symptoms of this infection, many women remain unaware of their infection. Therefore, the gynecologist may ask for a full ''sexually transmitted disease'' (STD) panel test at the beginning of a woman’s pregnancy.''These infections can be dangerous to a woman and her baby. It may pass on to the baby during pregnancy and result in ''birth defects''; therefore, a woman must seek treatment. If a woman has any bacterial STD, then the gynecologist may prescribe antibiotics. If a woman has a viral STD, she may receive antivirals that are clinically tested as “SAFE” during pregnancy.' "
What if you contracted an STD during a sexual assault?,"'Sexual assault could be the direct cause of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in women. If a woman has been sexually assaulted, she must immediately see a gynecologist or doctor.''To prevent further infection, looking at a woman’s risk factors and medical history, the doctor/gynecologist may prescribe any of the following''Follow-up with the doctor at the recommended time is important for effective treatment of STD infections.' The doctor may try to capture DNA and evaluate a woman’s injuries. The doctor also checks for any potential STD infection while examining a woman. Even if some time has passed since a sexual assault, a woman should still seek medical care. The doctor/gynecologist may discuss possibly reporting the event along with health-related problems. Antibiotics Hepatitis vaccine Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antiviral medication"
Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) Introduction,"'Sexually transmitted diseases'', commonly called ''STDs'', are infections that are spread by having sex with someone who has a ''STD''. You can get a ''sexually transmitted disease'' from sexual activity that involves the mouth, anus, or vagina.''''STDs'' are serious illnesses that require treatment, regardless of whether or not you are ''pregnant''. But, when you are pregnant, you are not the only one at risk; many STDs can be especially harmful to you and your baby. Some STDs, like ''HIV/AIDS'', cannot be cured and may be deadly.''Your health care provider will likely screen for some STDs at your first ''prenatal'' visit, but if you have sex with someone who might be infected, you will need to be screened at subsequent appointments and treated. If you suspect you have been exposed to a STD, be sure to tell your doctor immediately. Fast treatment is the best way to protect you and your baby.' "
STDs include:," Herpes HIV/AIDS Genital warts (caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV) Hepatitis B Chlamydia Syphilis Gonorrhea Trichomoniasis"
What Are the Symptoms of STDs?,"'Sometimes, there are no symptoms of a STD. If symptoms are present, they may include:' Bumps, sores, or warts near the mouth, anus, penis, or vagina Swelling or redness near the penis or vagina Skin rash with or without pain Painful urination Weight loss, loose stool, night sweats Aches, pains, fever, and chills Yellowing of the skin (jaundice) Discharge from the penis or vagina (vaginal discharge may have an odor) Bleeding from the vagina other than during a monthly period Painful sex Severe itching near the penis or vagina"
How Can STDs Affect My Pregnancy?,"'STDs in ''pregnancy'' can harm you and your developing baby depending on the type of infection.' HIV/AIDS: Thanks to the creation of powerful medications, transmission of HIV infection to your infant is almost completely preventable. But, when the disease is passed on, the results are catastrophic -- the baby may develop HIV infection. Herpes: Herpes infection in a pregnant woman is relatively safe until she gets ready to deliver. Active herpes lesions on the genitals are highly contagious and can infect the infant as he or she is being born. Also, the virus may begin multiplying and become infectious before any skin symptoms appear. Therefore, many women with herpes have a cesarean section to prevent the transmission of herpes to the newborn. Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a very common STD, usually diagnosed by performing a test on a swab of vaginal fluid. If contracted during pregnancy, the infection can cause vaginal discharge, burning while emptying the bladder, or abdominal pain. A pregnant woman with untreated gonorrhea has an increased risk of miscarriage or preterm delivery. A baby that is born while the mother has an active infection can develop blindness, joint infection, or a life threatening blood infection. HPV (Genital Warts): This is a very common STD. The genital warts often appear as small cauliflower-like clusters which may burn or itch. If you contract genital warts during pregnancy, treatment may be delayed until after you deliver. Sometimes the hormones from pregnancy can make them grow larger. If they grow large enough to block the birth canal, the baby may need to be delivered by a cesarean section. Chlamydia: Chlamydia may cause an increased risk of miscarriage and preterm delivery. Newborns who are exposed can get severe eye infections and pneumonia. Syphilis: Syphilis is most often diagnosed with a blood test, although a syphilitic skin lesion can also be tested. Syphilis is easily passed on to your unborn child. It is likely to cause a very serious infection to your baby that can be fatal. The infants are often premature. Untreated infants that survive tend to develop problems in multiple organs including the brain, eyes, ears, heart, skin, teeth, and bones. Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. If a pregnant woman is infected with hepatitis B, she can transmit the infection to her baby through the placenta. Also, her newborn can become infected. In addition, women with hepatitis B are more likely to have a premature delivery. Luckily, early screening and the more widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine can prevent infection. Trichomoniasis: Trichomoniasis is an infection that can cause yellow-green vaginal discharge and pain with sex or when emptying the bladder. It can increase the risk of having a preterm baby. Rarely, the new baby can get the infection during delivery and have a vaginal discharge after birth."
How Can I Find Out If I Have an STD?,"'At your prenatal visit, your health care provider will screen for a number of STDs. But, if you think you have a STD, tell your provider. He or she can examine you and perform other tests to determine if you have a sexually transmitted disease. Be especially vigilant if you have a new sexual partner during pregnancy.' "
How Are STDs Treated During Pregnancy?,"'Treatment of a STD during pregnancy depends on how far the infection has progressed and how far along you are in your pregnancy. Many bacterial STDs like syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia are treated with antibiotics given as a shot or taken by mouth. Below are common treatments for STDs in pregnant women and newsborns.'""If you are given an antibiotic to treat a STD, it's important that you take all of your medicine, even if the symptoms go away. Also never take someone else's medicine to treat your illness. By doing so, you may make it more difficult to treat the infection. Likewise, you should not share your medicine with others."" HIV/AIDS: Although an incurable disease, you can prevent transmitting the virus to your baby by taking a multitude of medication. Herpes: Your doctor can prescribe antiviral pills to treat these lesions. Women with active herpes lesions at delivery will likely have a cesarean section to prevent transmitting the infection to the baby. Gonorrhea: Pregnant women with the infection can be treated with antibiotics. Because gonorrhea is often without symptoms, all newborn babies are given medications in their eyes at birth to prevent development of the gonorrhea eye infection. HPV (Genital Warts): If you contract genital warts during pregnancy, treatment may be delayed until after you deliver. Chlamydia: Mothers with chlamydia are treated with antibiotics. The drug used on all newborns to prevent a gonorrhea eye infection also prevents chlamydia from infecting the eye, but it can't prevent the pneumonia that may develop later. Syphilis: Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics during your pregnancy to decrease risk of transmitting the infection to your baby and stop the syphilis from progressing in you. Hepatitis B: If you have hepatitis B, your doctor will give your newborn an injection of antibodies to prevent him or her from becoming infected. Trichomoniasis: Pregnant women can be treated with medication to cure the infection. 
"
How Can I Protect Myself From STDs?,"'Here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting STDs:' Consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent STDs. Use a latex condom every time you have sex, particularly if you have more than one sex partner. (If you use a lubricant, make sure it is water-based.) Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to catch a STD. Practice monogamy. This means having sex with only one person. That person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk. Choose your sex partners with care. Don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have a STD or who has many sexual partners. Get checked for STDs. Don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. Just because you've been screened for STDs early on in your pregnancy, does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. If you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last STD screen, you need another set of screening tests. Also, you should be concerned if your partner may be having unprotected sex with other people. Don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. Plus, alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby. Know the signs and symptoms of STDs. Look for them in yourself and your sex partners. Learn about STDs. The more you know about STDs, the better you can protect yourself."
How Can I Avoid Spreading a STD?,"'WebMD Medical Reference' Stop having sex until you see a health care provider and are treated. Follow your health care provider's instructions for treatment. Use condoms whenever you have sex, especially with new partners. Don't resume having sex unless your health care provider says it's OK. Return to your health care provider to get rechecked. Be sure your sex partner or partners are also treated."
What should you know about STDS in men?,"'Common types of ''STDs'' in men include ''Chlamydia'', ''gonorrhea'', ''Trichomoniasis'', and ''genital herpes''. Some of the most common ''STDs'' in men may not produce signs or symptoms.''Early and later signs and symptoms of STDs include genital lesions or sores (as with ''herpes'' or ''HPV''), ''urethritis'' (with ''gonorrhea'' or ''Chlamydia''), systemic symptoms that affect the entire body (such as ''HIV''), and bacteria, ''viruses'', or parasites.''What is the treatment for STDs?''Treatment for STDs in men is generally directed toward eradicating the viral, fungi, or bacteria virus.''STDs caused by bacteria are typically curable with antibiotics while some STDs, like herpes and ''HIV'' infection, are not curable and persist for life.''Early tests to diagnose STDs as well as ''STD'' counseling in regard to the risks of spreading the infection, and how to avoid spreading it to others. ''Zika virus'' is a more recent infection that also can be transmitted through sexual contact.' "
What are warning symptoms and signs of STDs in men?,"'In men, STDs can be grouped into three categories:''Some of the STDs that cause local lesions or urethritis, including gonorrhea and ''syphilis'', can also cause damage to other organs and spread within the body if not treated.''Depending upon the exact infection, STDs that cause genital lesions may cause ''genital warts'', painful ''blisters'', or ulcers. STDs that cause urethritis cause early signs and symptoms often associated with a ''urinary tract infection'', including a painful or burning sensation during urination and discharge from the urethra.''The section below reviews the specific signs and symptoms of eight common STDs.'  STDs that predominantly cause genital lesions (sores or abnormalities on the genital organs) STDs that predominantly cause inflammation of the urethra (urethritis) STDs that cause symptoms and signs throughout the body (systemic STDs)"
What are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?,"'Sexually transmitted diseases'' (STDs) are infections transmitted during sexual contact. STDs are often referred to as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). STDs can be transmitted during any type of sexual activity. Some STDs can be cured with a course of antibiotics, while others persist and are not curable. Some STDs may cause debilitating signs and symptoms, while others may be present without causing symptoms at all. Many STDs do not cause notable signs or symptoms so person can have an STD and not know it, and consequently, spread the infection to others.' "
How do men get STDs?," STDs can be caused by different kinds of microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Sexually transmitted viral infections include human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis B and C, and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). Sexually transmitted bacterial infections include syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Trichomonas is an example of a sexually transmitted infection caused by a parasite. Infestations with parasitic bugs, such as lice or scabies, can also be transmitted by close contact and may be acquired during sexual activity. Humans contract the Zika virus through the bite of an infected vector mosquito, and the Zika virus can be transmitted to others through sexual contact."
Who is at risk for contracting an STD?,"'Anyone who engages in any kind of sexual activity is at risk for STDs. The only way to eliminate the risk of acquiring an STD is abstinence from sexual activity. The use of latex ''condoms'' during sexual contact can greatly reduce the chances of contracting many STDs, but no method is completely safe.''The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) have released a report that estimates that 20 million new STD infections occur each year. People aged 15 to 24 account for about half of those newly infected. Young men and young women are about equally affected. According to the CDC, sexually active gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (''MSM'') are at greater risk for acquiring STDs. In addition to an increased risk of syphilis, over 50% of all new HIV infections occur in MSM.' "
1. Chlamydia,"'Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that is common in young adults who are sexually active. It is caused by the bacterium ''Chlamydia trachomatis''. Both men and women can be infected, and many of those infected do not have any signs or symptoms. When it does cause symptoms in men, symptoms of urethritis are the most common. It can also cause infection of the epididymis and testes. Chlamydia infection can be cured with antibiotics such as ''azithromycin''. However, reinfection can occur, especially when sex partners of an infected person are not treated.' "
2. Gonorrhea,"'Like Chlamydia, gonorrhea is a bacterial infection that may not always cause signs and symptoms and can remain undiagnosed. Also similar to Chlamydia, gonorrhea can cause urethritis in men, leading to burning or ''pain'' on urination and discharge from the urethra. Gonorrhea is caused by ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' bacteria, and when symptoms do occur, they develop about 4 to 8 days after contracting the infection. Gonorrhea can also cause infection in the rectum and in the throat. Moreover, it is possible for gonorrhea to spread within the body, causing symptoms like ''rash'' and ''joint pain''. Antibiotics, such as ''cefixime'' (''Suprax'') are typically used to treat gonorrhea, although other antibiotics have also been used. Treatment is often given that is also curative for Chlamydia infection, since these two infections frequently occur together.' "
4. HIV,"'The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is perhaps the most feared STD. Infection with the HIV virus can occur during sexual contact, by sharing needles, or from an infected ''pregnant'"" woman to her baby. The virus ultimately causes dysfunction of the body's immune system at a later time point. The average time from infection to immune suppression is 10 years. No specific symptoms signal HIV infection, but some people develop ""'fever'' and a ''flu-like'' illness 2 to 4 weeks after they have contracted the virus. Once immune suppression is present, serious complications like unusual infections, certain ''cancers'', and ''dementia'' may develop. Numerous medications are available to help affected people manage the infection and delay or prevent progression of the illness.' "
3. Trichomoniasis,"'Trichomoniasis'' is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the ''Trichomonas vaginalis'' parasite. Most women and men who are infected do not have symptoms, and as with chlamydia and gonorrhea, may not know they are infected. When the infection does cause symptoms, it typically results in urethritis, with ''itching'' or burning and discharge from the urethra. Trichomonas infection can be cured with a single dose of antibiotic medication. ''Metronidazole'' and tinidazole are antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of trichomonas infection.' "
5. Genital herpes,"'The herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) cause painful ''blistering'' sores on sexually exposed areas of the body. They can be transmitted during any type of sexual contact. Typically, the HSV type 1 (HSV-1) causes ''cold sores'' around the mouth, while the HSV type 2 (HSV-2) causes genital herpes, but both types of HSV are capable of infecting the genital area. Like some other STDs, it is possible to become infected with HSV and have very mild symptoms or none at all. Even when symptoms have occurred in the past, it is possible to transmit the infection during any period in which symptoms are not present.''The lesions caused by HSV typically take the form of painful blisters that eventually open, forming ulcers, and then crust over. In men, the sores can be found on the penis, scrotum, buttocks, anus, inside the urethra, or on the skin of the thighs. The first outbreak of HSV infection may be more severe than subsequent outbreaks and can be accompanied by ''fever'' and ''swollen lymph nodes''.' "
7. Hepatitis B and C,"'Hepatitis'' is inflammation of the ''liver''. ''Hepatitis B'' and ''hepatitis C'' are two viral diseases that can be transmitted by sexual contact. Both the ''hepatitis B'' virus (''HBV'') and ''hepatitis C'' virus (''HCV'') are transmitted by contact with the blood of an infected individual or by sexual activity, similar to the HIV virus. HBV may not cause symptoms, but it causes symptoms of acute ''hepatitis'' in about 50% of infections. The primary danger with HPV infection is that around 5% of those infected progress to have long-term liver damage, or chronic hepatitis B. People with chronic hepatitis B are at increased risk for the development of ''liver cancer''. There is a very effective ''vaccine'' available for the prevention of hepatitis B. Treatment of acute hepatitis involves supportive care and rest, although those with chronic hepatitis may be treated with ''interferon'' or antiviral medications.''Unlike HBV, HCV is rarely transmitted by sexual contact and is usually spread by contact with the blood of an infected person. Still, it is possible to transmit this virus as a result of sexual contact. Most people infected with HCV have no symptoms, so a delayed or missed diagnosis is common. In contrast to hepatitis B, most people with HCV infection (75% to 85% of people infected) develop chronic infection with the possibility of liver damage. There is also no vaccine available against HCV.' "
6. Genital warts (HPV),"'Human papillomavirus infection (HPV) is a very common STD. Different types of HPV exist and cause different conditions. Some ''HPVs'' cause ''common warts'' that are not STDs, and other types are spread during sexual activity and cause ''genital warts''. Still other types are the cause of ''precancerous'' chances and cancers of the cervix in women. Most people with HPV infection do not develop genital ''warts'' or cancers, and the body is often able to clear the infection on its own. It is currently believed that over 75% of sexually active people have been infected at some point in life. When HPV causes ''genital warts in men'', the lesions appear as soft, fleshy, raised ''bumps'' on the penis or anal area. Sometimes they may be larger and take on a cauliflower-like appearance.''There is no cure for HPV infection, but it often resolves on its own. Treatments to destroy or remove genital ''warts'' are also available. ''Vaccines'' are available for boys and girls that confer immunity to the most common HPV types.' "
8. Syphilis,"'Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by ''Treponema pallidum'' bacteria. If not treated, the disease progresses through three phases and can also persist in a latent state. The initial manifestation is a painless ulcer known as a ''chancre'' at the site of sexual contact. The chancre develops 10 to 90 days after infection and resolves after 3 to 6 weeks. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, but if this first stage is untreated, secondary syphilis can develop. In secondary syphilis, there is spread of the disease to other organs, causing various symptoms that can include skin ''rash'', ''swollen lymph nodes'', ''arthritis'', ''kidney disease'', or liver problems. After this stage, some people will have a latent infection for years, after which tertiary syphilis develops. Tertiary syphilis can cause different conditions including brain infection, the development of nodules known as gummas, ''aortic aneurysm'', loss of sight, and deafness. Fortunately, syphilis is curable with proper antibiotic treatment.' "
9. Zika virus,"'The ''Zika'' virus has been associated with ''birth defects'' in ''babies'' born to infected mothers. Transmission of ''Zika'' virus occurs among humans by the bite of an infected vector mosquito. However, sexual transmission of the ''Zika'' virus is also possible, and an infected individual may spread the virus to his or her sex partners.' "
What tests diagnose STDs in men?,'Many STDs are diagnosed based upon the clinical history and characteristic physical findings. Herpes and syphilis are two conditions that can produce identifiable signs and symptoms. Often the diagnosis of an infection depends upon identification of the organism. A number of different tests are available for STDs in men that are based either upon detection of the surface proteins of the organism or of the genetic material of the organism. These methods are more commonly used than the culture to identify sexually transmitted infections.' 
What is the treatment for STDs in men?,"'STDs caused by bacteria -- Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis -- are typically curable with antibiotics. ''Trichomoniasis'' can be cured with effective medications that eliminate the parasite.''Viral STDs may resolve on their own, such as HPV infection. There is no treatment for HPV infection, although it commonly does not cause problems. Genital warts can be treated by destruction and removal. HBV and, to a greater extent, HCV infections may persist and develop into chronic infection. Antiviral ''drugs'' and interferon may be used to manage these long-term infections, but they do not cure the infection. Likewise, HIV treatment drugs can manage the infection, but they do not cure the it. HSV infection persists for life, although antiviral drugs can help reduce the severity and frequency of outbreaks.' "
Can you die from an STD?,"'When untreated, some treatable STDs can spread throughout the body, causing serious consequences.' Gonorrhea and syphilis are examples of treatable conditions that can cause serious consequences if not treated. HIV infection causes immune suppression that can lead to death from cancers or rare infections, although treatments are available to postpone or delay the immunosuppressive actions of the virus. Both hepatitis B and C can cause liver damage; however, it may cause liver damage that sometimes progresses to liver failure. Herpes (HPV) infection persists throughout life, with the possibility of future outbreaks of the illness; however, there is no cure. Herpes (HPV) infection persists throughout life. There is no cure."
How can you prevent getting an STD?,"'Using condoms can help prevent the transmission of many STDs, but no method of prevention is 100% safe. Sometimes, STDs may affect areas not ordinarily covered by a ''condom'' during sexual activity. Prevention can also be difficult because many people will not show specific signs or symptoms of an STD even though they may be infected. While abstinence from sexual activity is the only absolute way to prevent STDs, limiting the number of sexual partners can help reduce risk of exposure to infections. Early diagnosis and recognition of infections as well as counseling about STDs and risk can help avoid further spread of infections.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat STDs in Men?,"'STDs in men may be treated by primary care practitioners, including internists and family practitioners. Urologists are physicians with specialized training in conditions involving the male reproductive system, and they may be involved in the care of STDs in men. For certain STDs, other specialists, including gastroenterologists (hepatitis) or immunologists (HIV) may be consulted.' "
What are STDs?,"'Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are diseases that a person can get by having sex with someone who has an ''STD''.''The most common STDs are as follows:' STDs are the second most common infections seen in the United States, with about one million people being affected yearly. STDs can be transmitted from any sexual activity, whether it involves the mouth, anus, vagina, or penis; some are acquired simply by skin-to-skin contact. Almost half of the people with STDs are aged between 15 and 24 years. Many STDs show few symptoms, especially in women. STDs can cause severe organ damage and infertility. Although STDs respond well to treatment, some can be treated but not cured. Chlamydia: This is the most common STD in the United States and is caused by a bacterial infection. It often does not have symptoms, but it is easy to treat once it’s diagnosed. Untreated infections may cause infertility in the long run. Gonorrhea: It is another very common STD caused by a bacterial infection. It doesn’t have symptoms but can be treated. Syphilis: It is caused by a bacterium. It can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Without treatment, it can hurt your body's organs, leading to severe illness and even death. Pregnant women can pass syphilis to their babies during pregnancy and childbirth, so it is important that pregnant women get tested for syphilis. Genital herpes: It is a common STD that infects your mouth and/or genitals. It causes blistery sores. There’s no cure, but symptoms are treatable. Human papillomavirus (HPV): It causes warts (growths) on the genital area and around the anus. It is caused by certain types of HPV. It is a super common STD. It is usually harmless and goes away by itself, but some types can lead to cancer. Trichomoniasis: It is caused by a single-celled germ called protozoa. It is a common cause of foul-smelling discharge from the vagina with intense itching. Trichomoniasis can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): It is an infection that breaks down the immune system and can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There’s no cure, but treatment can help you stay healthy. Hepatitis: A virus can cause liver disease, which is spread through sex or sharing personal hygiene items such as razors or toothbrushes. Hepatitis can be may be passed through contact with contaminated blood and most commonly through needles shared during illegal drug use. It is important that both partners need to be treated for STDs to be cured."
What should I know about STD?,"'Many STDs do not have symptoms.' It is important for you to get tested regularly for STDs if you are sexually active, having sex with more than one partner, or if the partner is having sex with multiple individuals. Both partners need to be treated for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). There are many sexually transmitted infections that can be cured with treatment. Some, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes, cannot be cured but can be managed. Many can cause serious health and fertility problems, or even death, if left untreated. Practicing safer sex can protect you from many, but not all, STDs. Even if the symptoms go away, patients may still need to finish treatment. If symptoms continue even after treatment, the doctor should be notified, and the treatment may need to be modified."
What is peripheral blood stem cell transplantation?,"'Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is a treatment which involve first harvesting specific cells called\xa0''stem cells'""\xa0from the peripheral blood of the donor. These cells are harvested by a type of filtration and then preserved, usually by freezing, and finally given to the recipient after he or she has received intensive treatment. The stem cells are usually given instead of bone marrow cells. They go to the recipient's bone marrow spaces and rebuild the bone marrow after the intensive treatment is over. The treatment does not involve surgery, but is nevertheless a form of transplantation."" "
What are stem cells?,"'Stem cells are small, round cells with a squat nucleus and scant surrounding cytoplasm. Although unremarkable in appearance, stem cells can perform what have been called ""acts of biological resurrection."" ' "
What do stem cells do?,"'Whereas other types of cells in the body have a limited lifespan and die after dividing their predetermined number of times, a stem cell can reproduce forever. The stem cell is immortal (in cellular terms). A stem cell can forgo immortality and differentiate. By doing so, it can turn into an ordinary blood cell, like a red blood cell (an erythrocyte), a white blood cell (a leukocyte), or a large cell (a megakaryocyte) that fragments into the platelets needed for blood to clot.'

What is the value of stem cells for transplantation?,"'A relatively small number of stem cells can miraculously repopulate the whole bone marrow, provide an endless supply of stem cells, reconstitute the entire repertoire of blood cells, and restore that portion of the immune system.' "
Where do the stem cells come from for transplantation?,"'Under normal circumstances, stem cells are rarely seen in the blood stream. To recruit enough stem cells into the blood, stem cells are lured out of the bone marrow by a special regimen of ''drugs'' and thereby coaxed into entering the peripheral blood (the blood stream).' "
How are the stem cells removed from the blood?,"'The blood is filtered through a machine and the stem cells are skimmed off. The removal of the cells is termed ''pheresis'' or ''apheresis'' (from the Greek ""aphairesis"" for removal). The stem cells then may be used right away for the transplant or stored suspended in DMSO and frozen in liquid nitrogen until needed.' "
"How is the patient ""prepared""  for the transplantation?","'Before the transplant is done, the patient receives high-dose ''chemotherapy'' and/or ''radiation therapy'' over several days to destroy diseased cells (the leukemic cells, ''lymphoma'' cells, solid ''tumor'' cells, the diseased immune system cells in ''scleroderma'', etc.)' "
How is the transplantation actually done?,"'Once the chemotherapy is gone, the stem cells are defrosted and returned to the patient as a ''blood transfusion''. They are already biologically programmed to migrate to the bone marrow, where they can produce new blood and immune cells and replace the cells destroyed by the treatment.''The stem-cell preparation is infused into a vein and, once there in the blood stream, the stem cells act like homing pigeons and head straight for the bone marrow space.' "
What are stem cells?,"'Stem cells are cells that have the potential to develop into many different or specialized cell types. Stem cells can be thought of as primitive, ""unspecialized"" cells that are able to divide and become specialized cells of the body such as ''liver'' cells, muscle cells, blood cells, and other cells with specific functions. Stem cells are referred to as ""undifferentiated"" cells because they have not yet committed to a developmental path that will form a specific tissue or organ. The process of changing into a specific cell type is known as ''differentiation''. In some areas of the body, stem cells divide regularly to renew and repair the existing tissue. The bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract are examples of areas in which stem cells function to renew and repair tissue.''The best and most readily understood example of a stem cell in humans is that of the fertilized egg, or zygote. A zygote is a single cell that is formed by the union of a sperm and ovum. The sperm and the ovum each carry half of the genetic material required to form a new individual. Once that single cell or zygote starts dividing, it is known as an embryo. One cell becomes two, two become four, four become eight, eight become sixteen, and so on, doubling rapidly until it ultimately grows into an entire sophisticated organism composed of many different kinds of specialized cells. That organism, a person, is an immensely complicated structure consisting of many, many, billions of cells with functions as diverse as those of your eyes, your ''heart'', your immune system, the color of your skin, your brain, etc. All of the specialized cells that make up these body systems are descendants of the original zygote, a stem cell with the potential to ultimately develop into all kinds of body cells. The cells of a zygote are ''totipotent'', meaning that they have the capacity to develop into any type of cell in the body.''The process by which stem cells commit to become differentiated, or specialized, cells is complex and involves the regulation of gene expression. Research is ongoing to further understand the molecular events and controls necessary for stem cells to become specialized cell types.'  "
Why are stem cells important?,"'Stem cells represent an exciting area in medicine because of their potential to regenerate and repair damaged tissue. Some current therapies, such as bone marrow transplantation, already make use of stem cells and their potential for regeneration of damaged tissues. Other therapies that are under investigation involve transplanting stem cells into a damaged body part and directing them to grow and differentiate into healthy tissue.' "
Embryonic stem cells,"'During the early stages of embryonic development the cells remain relatively undifferentiated (immature) and appear to possess the ability to become, or differentiate, into almost any tissue within the body. For example, cells taken from one section of an embryo that might have become part of the eye can be transferred into another section of the embryo and could develop into blood, muscle, nerve, or ''liver'' cells.''Cells in the early embryonic stage are totipotent (see above) and can differentiate to become any type of body cell. After about seven days, the zygote forms a structure known as a blastocyst, which contains a mass of cells that eventually become the fetus, as well as trophoblastic tissue that eventually becomes the placenta. If cells are taken from the blastocyst at this stage, they are known as ''pluripotent'', meaning that they have the capacity to become many different types of human cells. Cells at this stage are often referred to as blastocyst embryonic stem cells. When any type of embryonic stem cells is grown in culture in the laboratory, they can divide and grow indefinitely. These cells are then known as embryonic stem cell lines.' "
Fetal stem cells,'The embryo is referred to as a fetus after the eighth week of development. The fetus contains stem cells that are pluripotent and eventually develop into the different body tissues in the fetus.' 
Adult stem cells,"'Adult stem cells are present in all humans in small numbers. The adult stem cell is one of the class of cells that we have been able to manipulate quite effectively in the ''bone marrow transplant'' arena over the past 30 years. These are stem cells that are largely tissue-specific in their location. Rather than typically giving rise to all of the cells of the body, these cells are capable of giving rise only to a few types of cells that develop into a specific tissue or organ. They are therefore known as ''multipotent'' stem cells. Adult stem cells are sometimes referred to as somatic stem cells.''The best characterized example of an adult stem cell is the blood stem cell (the hematopoietic stem cell). When we refer to a ''bone marrow transplant'', a stem cell transplant, or a blood transplant, the cell being transplanted is the hematopoietic stem cell, or blood stem cell. This cell is a very rare cell that is found primarily within the bone marrow of the adult.''One of the exciting discoveries of the last years has been the overturning of a long-held scientific belief that an adult stem cell was a completely committed stem cell. It was previously believed that a hematopoietic, or blood-forming stem cell, could only create other blood cells and could never become another type of stem cell. There is now evidence that some of these apparently committed adult stem cells are able to change direction to become a stem cell in a different organ. For example, there are some models of bone marrow transplantation in rats with damaged livers in which the liver partially re-grows with cells that are derived from transplanted bone marrow. Similar studies can be done showing that many different cell types can be derived from each other. It appears that heart cells can be grown from bone marrow stem cells, that bone marrow cells can be grown from stem cells derived from muscle, and that brain stem cells can turn into many types of cells.' "
Peripheral blood stem cells,"'Most blood stem cells are present in the bone marrow, but a few are present in the bloodstream. This means that these so-called peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) can be isolated from a drawn blood sample. The blood stem cell is capable of giving rise to a very large number of very different cells that make up the blood and immune system, including ''red blood cells'', platelets, granulocytes, and lymphocytes.''All of these very different cells with very different functions are derived from a common, ancestral, committed blood-forming (hematopoietic), stem cell.' Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body and give the blood its color. Platelets are cell fragments that stop a person from bleeding and help the body to clot and heal when it is cut. Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell that helps fight bacterial infection. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system, help fight other infections, and also may be involved in protection against cancer."
Umbilical cord stem cells,"'Blood from the umbilical cord contains some stem cells that are genetically identical to the ''newborn''. Like adult stem cells, these are multipotent stem cells that are able to differentiate into certain, but not all, cell types. For this reason, umbilical cord blood is often banked, or stored, for possible future use should the individual require stem cell therapy.'  "
Induced pluripotent stem cells,"'Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were first created from human cells in 2007. These are adult cells that have been genetically converted to an embryonic stem cell–like state. In animal studies, iPSCs have been shown to possess characteristics of pluripotent stem cells. Human iPSCs can differentiate and become multiple different fetal cell types. iPSCs are valuable aids in the study of disease development and drug treatment, and they may have future uses in transplantation medicine. Further research is needed regarding the development and use of these cells.' "
Why is there controversy surrounding the use of stem cells?,"'Embryonic stem cells and embryonic stem cell lines have received much public attention concerning the ethics of their use or non-use. Clearly, there is hope that a large number of treatment advances could occur as a result of growing and differentiating these embryonic stem cells in the laboratory. It is equally clear that each embryonic stem cell line has been derived from a human embryo created through in-vitro ''fertilization'' (''IVF'"") or through cloning technologies, with all the attendant ethical, religious, and philosophical problems, depending upon one's perspective."" "
What are some stem cell therapies that are currently available?,"'Routine use of stem cells in therapy has been limited to blood-forming stem cells (hematopoietic stem cells) derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. Bone marrow transplantation is the most familiar form of stem cell therapy and the only instance of stem cell therapy in common use. It is used to treat ''cancers'' of the blood cells (leukemias) and other disorders of the blood and bone marrow.'""In bone marrow transplantation, the patient's existing white blood cells and bone marrow are destroyed using ""'chemotherapy'' and ''radiation therapy'"". Then, a sample of bone marrow (containing stem cells) from a healthy, immunologically matched donor is injected into the patient. The transplanted stem cells populate the recipient's bone marrow and begin producing new, healthy blood cells.""'Umbilical cord blood stem cells and peripheral blood stem cells can also be used instead of bone marrow samples to repopulate the bone marrow in the process of bone marrow transplantation.''In 2009, the California-based company Geron received clearance from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin the first human clinical trial of cells derived from human embryonic stem cells in the treatment of patients with acute ''spinal cord injury''.' "
What are experimental treatments using stem cells and possible future directions for stem cell therapy?,"'Stem cell therapy is an exciting and active field of biomedical research. Scientists and physicians are investigating the use of stem cells in therapies to treat a wide variety of diseases and injuries. For a stem cell therapy to be successful, a number of factors must be considered. The appropriate type of stem cell must be chosen, and the stem cells must be matched to the recipient so that they are not destroyed by the recipient\'s immune system. It is also critical to develop a system for effective delivery of the stem cells to the desired location in the body. Finally, devising methods to ""switch on"" and control the differentiation of stem cells and ensure that they develop into the desired tissue type is critical for the success of any stem cell therapy. ''Researchers are currently examining the use of stem cells to regenerate damaged or diseased tissue in many conditions, including those listed below.

"What is the lumbar spine, and what is lumbar spinal stenosis?","'The lumbar spine is made up of five vertebral bodies in the lower back. Nerves coming off the spinal cord travel though the spinal canal and exit the canal through small openings on the sides of the vertebrae called foramina (singular = foramen). These nerves transmit sensations from the buttocks and lower extremities through the spinal cord to the brain and transmit motor signals from the brain to the lower extremities to produce movement of the legs, toes, and joints of the lower extremities.''Lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition whereby either the spinal canal (central stenosis) or one or more of the vertebral foramina (foraminal stenosis) becomes narrowed. If the narrowing is substantial, it causes compression of the spinal cord or spinal nerves, which causes the painful symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis, including ''low back pain'', ''buttock pain'', and ''leg pain'' and numbness that is made worse with ''walking'' and relieved by resting.'  "
What causes lumbar spinal stenosis?,"'The most common cause of lumbar spinal stenosis is degenerative ''arthritis'' and ''degenerative disc disease''. As with other joints in the body, arthritis commonly occurs in the spine as part of the normal ''aging'' process and as a result of ''osteoarthritis''. This can lead to loss of the cartilage between the bones at the joints, formation of ''bone spurs'' (''osteophytes''), loss of the normal height of the discs between the vertebrae of the spine (degenerative disc disease, also known as spondylosis), and overgrowth (hypertrophy) of the ligamentous structures. Further degeneration of the lumbar discs can lead to slippage of one vertebra on another, a process referred to as ''spondylolisthesis''. Each of these processes can reduce the normal space available for the nerves in the spinal canal and result in direct pressure on nerve tissues to cause the symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis.''Lumbar spinal stenosis can also be caused by other conditions that decrease the space of the spinal canal or vertebral foramen. These can include''These causes, however, are much less common than degenerative arthritis.' tumor of the local structures or metastatic tumors (tumors that originated in another part of the body and spread to this location), infection, various metabolic bone disorders that cause bone growth, such as Paget's disease of bone."
What are risk factors for lumbar spinal stenosis?,'The major risk factor for lumbar spinal stenosis is ''aging'' because it is associated with degeneration of the spine. Another less common risk factor is ''osteoporosis'' as it can lead to compression ''fracture'' of the ''lumbar vertebrae'' that results in lumbar spinal stenosis.' 
What are lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms?,"'Lumbar spinal stenosis can cause''In most situations, the symptoms improve when the patient is sitting or leaning forward. Typically, painful sensations shoot down the legs with continued walking and diminish with resting. These leg sensations sometimes mimic ''sciatica''. This particular activity-related symptom is sometimes referred to as pseudoclaudication (or neurogenic ''claudication'') because it mimics the true claudication of poor circulation from the narrowed blood vessels of ''peripheral vascular disease''. Standing and bending backward can make the symptoms worse. This is because bending forward increases the space in the spinal canal and vertebral foramina, while bending backward decreases this space. It is therefore more comfortable for patients to sit or lean forward. Patients are frequently unable to walk for long distances and often state that their symptoms are improved when bending forward while walking with the support of a walker or shopping cart.''The symptoms commonly worsen with time. This is because degenerative arthritis is a progressive disease that gradually becomes more severe with time. If left untreated, the compression on the nerves from lumbar spinal stenosis can lead to increasing weakness and loss of function of the legs. It can also lead to loss of bowel and bladder control and loss of sexual function.'""A doctor can help determine if one's symptoms are from lumbar spinal stenosis or a different condition. Many other disorders can cause similar symptoms that mimic lumbar spinal stenosis including""   low back pain, weakness, numbness, pain, loss of sensation in the legs and feet. diabetic neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, vascular claudication."
How do health care professionals diagnose lumbar spinal stenosis?,"'The medical evaluation begins with a complete medical history and physical examination to get clues to the diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis. During the medical history, the patient will be asked questions regarding symptoms, including how long they have been present, what makes them better or worse, what prior treatment the patient has had, and what other medical conditions they have. These questions can also help the doctor distinguish lumbar spinal stenosis from other disorders that may produce similar symptoms.''The physical examination often consists of testing the range of motion in the back and feeling for areas of tenderness in the back. The legs may be examined for range of motion, strength, sensation, reflexes, and pulses. The hips and knees may also be examined because problems with these joints can often causes symptoms similar to those of lumbar spinal stenosis.''After the examination, the physician may order imaging studies to detect anatomic signs of lumbar spinal stenosis. This often begins with plain ''X-rays'"" of the spine. The doctors may also order an X-ray of the patient's pelvis and hips, depending on findings from the physical examination. The X-rays can show the doctor various signs associated with spinal stenosis, including loss of the normal intervertebral disc height, the presence of bone spurs (osteophytes), and spinal instability (abnormal motion between the vertebrae). The ultimate diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis is made by an ""'MRI'' scan (magnetic resonance imagining scan) or ''CT scan'' (CAT scan or computerized axial tomography). These are more advanced tests that are used to visualize the nerves in the lower back and detect if they are being compressed from lumbar spinal stenosis.''Sometimes, special nerve tests, including ''electromyogram'' (''EMG'') or nerve conduction studies, may be ordered. These tests can identify damage to or irritation of the nerves caused by long-term compression from lumbar spinal stenosis. These tests can also help determine exactly which nerves are involved.' "
What is the treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis?,"'In most situations, the treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis begins with conservative (nonoperative) treatments. This can include medications to reduce inflammation, even short courses of oral cortisone medication, and pain medications. There are also several medications directed specifically at ''nerve pain'' that are helpful in lumbar spinal stenosis, including ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin'') and ''pregabalin'' (''Lyrica''). Physical therapy can help for many. Cortisone (steroid) injections in the lumbar spine, referred to as epidural injections, can also reduce the symptoms by decreasing inflammation and swelling around the nerve tissue. These are sometimes repeated up to three times per year.''Surgery may be indicated for those who do not improve with the above treatments or if there is severe or progressive weakness or loss of bowel or bladder function (''cauda equina syndrome''). Depending on the examination findings and imaging studies, there are various surgical procedures available to treat lumbar spinal stenosis, ranging from laminectomy to fusion procedures.''The main goal of surgery is to remove the structures that are compressing the nerves in the spinal canal or vertebral foramen. This is referred to as lumbar decompression surgery (laminectomy, laminotomy, foraminotomy). In some patients, this can be performed alone, but in other patients, it must be combined with lumbar fusion. If too much of the compressive structures need to be removed to free the nerve, the vertebrae may become unstable (spinal instability). This leaves the vertebrae with abnormal motion. If this occurs, a ''spinal fusion'' can be performed to attach the vertebrae together and eliminate the motion at that level. Sometimes this requires metallic hardware to be installed in the vertebrae to adequately support and fix the involved bone.''Surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis can be very successful in most patients in relieving the leg symptoms of ambulatory pain, ''sciatica'', and numbness. However, depending on the severity of the ''nerve compression'' and the length of time the nerve have been compressed, there may be some permanent damage that is not relieved with surgery. The success for ''back pain'' relief is less reliable with surgery than the relief of leg symptoms.''More recently, surgical procedures that are somewhat less invasive than traditional lumbar decompression have become available. Interspinous devices that have been used in certain patients for this purpose include X-Stop and Coflex devices.'  "
Is it possible to prevent lumbar spinal stenosis?,"'Unfortunately, the degenerative changes responsible for lumbar spinal stenosis can occur as part of the normal aging process. There is little that can be done to prevent lumbar spinal stenosis. For some patients, exercises and/or physical therapy can prevent aggravation of symptoms.' "
What is the prognosis for lumbar spinal stenosis?,"""The outlook for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis varies and depends on the severity and duration of symptoms at the time of initiation of treatment.

What is balloon angioplasty?,"'Balloon angioplasty'' of the coronary artery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), was introduced in the late 1970s. PTCA is a nonsurgical procedure that relieves narrowing and obstruction of the arteries to the muscle of the heart (coronary arteries). This allows more blood and oxygen to be delivered to the heart muscle. PTCA is now referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, as this term includes the use of balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices. Percutaneous coronary intervention is accomplished with a small balloon catheter inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist, and advanced to the narrowing in the coronary artery. The balloon is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. When successful, percutaneous coronary intervention can relieve ''chest pain'' of ''angina'', improve the prognosis of individuals with unstable angina, and minimize or stop a ''heart attack'' without having the patient undergo open heart ''coronary artery bypass graft'' (''CABG'') surgery.''In addition to the use of simple balloon angioplasty, the availability of stents, in a wire-mesh design, have expanded the spectrum of people suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention, as well as enhanced the safety and long-term results of the procedure. Since the early 1990\'s, more and more patients are treated with stents, which are delivered with a percutaneous coronary intervention balloon, but remain in the artery as a ""scaffold"". This procedure has markedly reduced the numbers of patients needing emergency CABG to below 1%, and particularly with the use of the new ""medicated"" stents (stents coated with medications that help prevent recurrence due to ''scar tissue''), has reduced the rate of recurrence of the blockage in the coronary artery (""restenosis"") to well below 10%. At present, the only patients treated with just balloon angioplasty are those with vessels less than 2mm (the smallest diameter stent), certain types of lesions involving branches of coronary arteries, those with ''scar'' tissue in old stents, or those who cannot take the antiplatelet blood thinners after the procedure.''Various ""atherectomy"" (plaque removal) devices were initially developed as adjuncts to percutaneous coronary intervention. These include''Such devices were initially thought to decrease the incidence of restenosis, but in ''clinical trials'' were shown to be of little additional benefit, and now are only used in selective cases as an adjunct to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (percutaneous artery intervention).' the use of the excimer laser for photoablation of plaque, rotational atherectomy (use of a high-speed diamond-encrusted drill) for mechanical ablation of plaque, and directional atherectomy for cutting and removal of plaque."
What causes a coronary artery disease?,"'Arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscles are called coronary arteries. ''Coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') occurs when cholesterol plaque (a hard, thick substance comprised of varying amounts of cholesterol, calcium, muscle cells, and connective tissue, which accumulates locally in the artery walls) builds up in the walls of these arteries, a process called arteriosclerosis.''The arteriosclerotic process can be accelerated by ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', elevated ''cholesterol levels'', and ''diabetes''. Individuals are also at higher risk for arteriosclerosis if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women) or if they have a positive family history of coronary ''heart disease''.' Over time, arteriosclerosis causes significant narrowing of one or more coronary arteries. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50% to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle during exercise. Lack of oxygen (ischemia) in the heart muscle causes chest pain (angina) in most people. However, some 25% of those with significant coronary artery narrowing experience no chest pain at all despite documented ischemia, or may only develop episodic shortness of breath instead of chest pain. These people are said to have ""silent angina"" and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina. When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90% to 99%, people often have angina at rest (unstable angina). When a blood clot (thrombus) forms on the plaque, the artery may become completely blocked, causing death of a part of the heart muscles (heart attack, or myocardial infarction)."
How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"'The resting ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ECC)'' is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and can show changes indicative of ischemia or heart attack. Often, the EKG in individuals with coronary artery disease is normal at rest, and only becomes abnormal when heart muscle ischemia is brought on by exertion. Therefore, ''exercise'' treadmill or bicycle testing (''stress'' tests) are useful screening tests for those with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and a normal resting EKG. These ''stress'' tests are 60% to 70% accurate in diagnosing significant coronary artery disease.''If the stress tests are not diagnostic, a nuclear agent (Cardiolite or ''thallium'') can be given intravenously during stress tests. Addition of one of these agents allows imaging of the blood flow to different regions of the heart, using an external camera. An area of the heart with reduced blood flow during exercise, but normal blood flow at rest, signifies substantial artery narrowing in that region.''Stress ''echocardiography'' combines echocardiography (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart muscle) with exercise stress testing. It is also an accurate technique for detecting coronary artery disease. When a significant narrowing exists, the heart muscle supplied by the narrowed artery does not contract as well as the rest of the heart muscle. Stress echocardiography and thallium stress tests are 80% to 85% accurate in detecting significant coronary artery disease.''When a person cannot undergo an ''exercise stress test'' because of neurological or arthritic difficulties, medications can be injected intravenously to simulate the stress on the heart normally brought on by exercise. Heart imaging can be performed with either a nuclear camera or echocardiography.''Cardiac catheterization'' with ''angiography'' (coronary arteriography) is a technique that allows X-ray pictures to be taken of the coronary arteries. ''It is the most accurate test to detect coronary artery narrowing''. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the openings of coronary arteries. ''Iodine'' contrast ""dye"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded. Coronary arteriography gives the doctor a picture of the location and severity of narrowed artery segments. This information is important in helping the doctor select medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, or ''coronary artery bypass'' graft surgery (CABG) as the preferred treatment option.''A newer, less invasive technique is the availability of high speed '' CT ''coronary angiography''. While it still involves ''radiation'' and dye exposure, no catheters are needed in the arterial system, which does decrease the risk of the procedure somewhat. This modality has a more limited role, in that, it is less questionable than conventional angiography and cannot allow PCF to be done the same time. It is important to remember that the risk of serious complications from conventional coronary angiography is very low (well under 1%).'  "
What medications treat coronary artery disease?,"""Angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply, and also may partially dilate the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. Three commonly used classes of ""'drugs'' are the ''nitrates'', ''beta blockers'', and calcium blockers.''Examples of nitrates include:''Examples of beta blockers include:''Examples of calcium blockers include:''A newer fourth agent, ranolazine (Ranexa) is of value.''Many people benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. When significant ischemia still occurs, either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing, coronary arteriography is usually performed, often followed by either percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Individuals with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of heart attack. In addition to angina medications, they are given ''aspirin'' and the intravenous blood thinner, ''heparin''. A form of heparin, ''enoxaparin'' (''Lovenox''), may be administered subcutaneously, and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in those with unstable angina. Aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets, while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. Potent IV antiplatelet agents (""super aspirins"") are also available to help initially stabilize such individuals. While people with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications, they are often at risk for the development of ''heart attacks''. For this reason, many people with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography, and possible percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation, stenting, or atherectomy. During percutaneous coronary intervention, a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or wrist. The artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. Under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy), a long, thin plastic tube, called a guiding catheter, is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the ''aorta''. A contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that X-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. A small diameter guide wire (0.014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. A balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. This balloon is then inflated for about one minute, compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. Balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure, to as much as 20 atmospheres. Finally, the balloon is deflated and removed from the body.''Intracoronary stents are deployed in either a self-expanding fashion, or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the stent is expanded and deployed, and the balloon is removed. The stent remains in place in the artery.''CABG surgery is performed to relieve angina in those whose illness has not responded to medications and are not good candidates for PCI.' isosorbide (Isordil), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), and transdermal nitrate patches. propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and metoprolol (Lopressor). nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Verelan PM, Isoptin, Isoptin SR, Covera-HS), diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac), and amlodipine (Norvasc). Atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire, and then activated in varying fashion, depending on the device chosen. CABG is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations, or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments which are not well-suited for percutaneous coronary intervention. CABG is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. CABG surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in people with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and in those with significant narrowing in multiple arteries, especially in cases of decreased heart muscle pump function."
What are the complications of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention, using balloons, stents, and/or atherectomy can achieve effective relief of coronary arterial obstruction in 90% to 95% of patients.''When stents are placed patients are started on aspirin as well as a second agent for up to a year or more depending on the type of stent. These agents are clopidogrel (''Plavix''), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) may be given as an IV agent when the stent is placed for patients who cant take pills.''To help prevent the process of thrombosis during or after percutaneous coronary intervention, aspirin is given to prevent platelets from adhering to the artery wall and stimulating the formation of ''blood clots''. Intravenous heparin or synthetic analogues of part of the heparin molecule is given to further prevent blood clotting; and combinations of nitrates and calcium blockers are used to minimize vessel spasm. Individuals at an increased risk for abrupt closure include:''The incidence of abrupt occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention has declined dramatically with the introduction of coronary stents, which essentially eliminate the problem of flow-limiting arterial dissections, elastic recoil, and spasm. The use of new intravenous ""super aspirins"", which alter platelet function at a site different from the site of aspirin-inhibition, have dramatically reduced the incidence of thrombosis after balloon angioplasty and stenting.''When despite these measures, a coronary artery cannot be ""kept open"" during percutaneous coronary intervention, emergency CABG surgery may be necessary. Before the advent of stents and advanced anti-thrombotic strategies, emergency CABG following a failed percutaneous coronary intervention was required in as many as 5% of patients. In the current era, the need for emergent CABG following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than 1% The overall acute mortality risk following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than one percent; the risk of a heart attack following percutaneous coronary intervention is only about 1% to 2%. The degree of risk is dependent on the number of diseased vessels treated, the function of the heart muscle, and the age and clinical condition of the patient.'   In a very small percentage of individuals, percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed because of technical difficulties. These difficulties usually involve the inability to pass the guide wire or the balloon catheter across the narrowed artery segments. The most serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention results when there is an abrupt closure of the dilated coronary artery within the first few hours after the procedure. Abrupt coronary artery closure occurs in 5% of patients after simple balloon angioplasty, and is responsible for most of the serious complications related to percutaneous coronary intervention. Abrupt closure is due to a combination of tearing (dissection) of the inner lining of the artery, blood clotting (thrombosis) at the balloon site, and constriction (spasm) or elastic recoil of the artery at the balloon site. women, individuals with unstable angina, and individuals having heart attacks."
How long is the recovery time after percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention is performed in a special room fitted with computerized X-ray equipment called a cardiac catheterization laboratory.''Patients are then brought to a monitored bed for observation.''Most patients are discharged home the day after percutaneous coronary intervention.''Patients are maintained on aspirin indefinitely after percutaneous coronary intervention to prevent future thrombotic events (for example, unstable angina or heart attack).''Exercise stress testing is sometimes done several weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention and signals the beginning of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation can involve a 12-week program of gradually increasing monitored exercise lasting one hour three times a week. Lifestyle changes can help to lower the chance of developing further coronary artery disease. These include:''Cholesterol reduction is often aided by the addition of medications which may not only lower cholesterol levels, but may offer protection against future ''heart attacks''.' Patients are mildly sedated with small amounts of diazepam (Valium), midazolam (Versed), morphine, and other sedative narcotics given intravenously. Patients may experience minor discomfort at the site of the puncture in the groin or the arm. Patients also may experience brief episodes of angina while the balloon is inflated, briefly blocking the flow of blood in the coronary artery. The percutaneous coronary intervention procedure can last from 30 minutes to two hours, but is usually completed within 60 minutes. The plastic catheters left in the artery are removed from the groin after four to 12 hours depending on how long blood thinning is needed to stabilize the opened artery. When these catheters are removed, the area is compressed by hand or with the aid of a mechanical clamp for about 20 minutes to prevent bleeding. In many instances, the artery in the groin may be sutured or ""sealed"" in the catheterization laboratory, and the catheters are immediately removed. This enables the patient to sit up in bed within a few hours after the procedure. Patients are advised not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds or perform vigorous exertion for the first one to two weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention. This allows the area in the coronary artery as well as the groin or arm arteries to heal. Patients may return to normal work and sexual activity two or three days after percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients who receive stents, an additional anti-platelet agent [in most instances clopidogrel (Plavix)] is given in conjunction with aspirin for one year; this is because the metal in the stents may promote the formation of blood clots after the stent is inserted. stopping smoking, reducing weight and dietary fat, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and lowering blood cholesterol levels."
What are the long-term results of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Long-term benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention depend on the maintenance of the newly-opened coronary artery(ies).''Restenosis can simply be observed or treated with medications if the narrowing is not critical and the patient is not symptomatic.'   Thirty percent to 50% of patients with successful balloon angioplasty (no stent) may develop recurrent narrowing (restenosis) at the site of the balloon inflation, usually within six months following percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients may complain of recurrence of angina or may have no symptoms. Restenosis is often detected by exercise stress tests performed at 4 to 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Restenosis occurs with a significantly higher frequency in people with diabetes. The rate of restenosis is greater in vein grafts, at the origins of vessels, in the beginning part of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and in those with suboptimal initial results. The widespread use of intracoronary stents has reduced the incidence of restenosis by as much as 50% or more; this is due to prevention of ""elastic recoil"" in the artery, as well as providing a larger initial channel in the treated artery. With the newer medicated stents, the restenosis rate is well under 10%. Some patients undergo a repeat percutaneous coronary intervention to increase coronary artery blood flow. Second percutaneous coronary intervention procedures have similar initial and long-term results as first procedures, although certain patterns of restenosis have a very high repeat recurrence rate. Sometimes, CABG surgeries are recommended for those patients who have developed more extensive disease in the restenosed artery as well as in the other coronary arteries. Patients may also choose CABG surgery to avoid the uncertainty of restenosis after the second percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients with restenosis after balloon angioplasty or stents, the use of intracoronary radiation (brachytherapy) may reduce the risk of future restenosis. If no evidence of restenosis is observed after 6 to 9 months, studies have demonstrated that the treated arterial segment is likely to remain open for many years. ""Late restenosis"" after 1 year or more is very uncommon. Symptoms developing more than 1 year after successful percutaneous coronary intervention are usually due to blockage in a different segment of the artery or in a different artery from that which was treated in the initial percutaneous coronary intervention."

What is an epidural steroid injection?,"'An epidural steroid injection is a common procedure to treat ''spinal nerve'' irritation that is most often caused by tissues next to the nerve pressing against it. The beginning of the nerve (nerve root) may be irritated by a bulging intervertebral disc, disc contents (""''ruptured disc''"") or bone spur, directly touching the spinal nerve.''An epidural steroid injection involves bathing an inflamed nerve root in steroids (potent anti-inflammation medicine) in order to decrease the irritation of the nerve root that is causing ''pain''.' "
What specialties of doctors administer epidural steroid injections?,'Specialists who administer epidural steroid injections include anesthesiologists and ''pain''-management specialists.' 
How is an epidural steroid injection performed?,"'The epidural steroid injection procedure is quick and simple. While it is common for people to be concerned prior to the procedure, it is actually frequent to hear from patients afterwards: ""Is that all?""''The spinal cord rests in the spinal canal. The nerve roots branch out from the spinal cord at each level of a spinal vertebra (the bony building blocks of the spine). The cord is protected by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which serves as a ''shock'' absorber for the cord. The CSF is held in place by a membrane with several layers, one of which is called the dura, from the Greek for tough (think of ""durable""). The Greek word ""epi"" means ""outside of."" So, the epidural space is outside of this tough membrane. During an epidural steroid injection, a needle and syringe are used to enter the epidural space and deposit small amounts of long-lasting steroids around the inflamed spinal nerve. A fluoroscope (a viewing instrument using ''X-rays'') is used to visualize the local anatomy during the injection. The epidural steroid injection specifically targets the locally inflamed area and treats it with a maximal amount of steroids, thereby minimizing exposure of the rest of the body to the steroids.' "
When are epidural steroid injections used?,"'Epidural steroid injections are most commonly used in situations of radicular pain, which is a radiating pain that is transmitted away from the spine by an irritated spinal nerve. Irritation of a spinal nerve in the low back (''lumbar radiculopathy''), such as from ''lumbar spinal stenosis'', cervical spinal stenosis, ''herniated disc'', and foraminal encroachment, causes ''back pain'' that goes down the leg. Epidural injection is also used as a minimally invasive procedure to treat ''nerve compression'' in the neck (cervical spine), referred to as cervical ''radiculopathy'', which causes pain.'  "
What complications or side effects may be associated with epidural steroid injections?,"'Complications of epidural steroid injections include elevation of blood ''sugar'' (glucose), ''insomnia'', bleeding into the spinal canal, and rarely, bacterial or fungal infection in the spinal canal.' "
What is the recovery time for an epidural steroid injection?,"'Recovery from an epidural steroid injection is typically within hours of the injection. If anesthetic is administered with the steroid, there can be hours of residual numbness of the nerves that were anesthetized.' "
Are steroids anti-inflammatories?,"'Research conducted by Edward Calvin Kendall at the Mayo Clinic in the medical use of cortisone led to a Nobel Prize in 1950. The drug simulated cortisol, a naturally occurring, anti-inflammatory hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Such synthetic corticosteroid drugs (prednisone, prednisolone, and many others) have since benefited patients and are commonly used to treat many conditions, including:''However, there are serious side effects.\xa0There are two concerns with steroid side effects. Continuous, long-term steroid treatment are drug side effects, and symptoms due to changes in the balance of normal hormone secretion.'""Symptoms from an imbalance of hormone secretion typically results from taking doses greater than our body's natural production (about the equivalent of 7.5 mg of prednisone per day). Once patients begin to decrease or discontinue the dose, withdrawal symptoms may occur. Thus, steroids are typically given for the shortest possible time possible.""'Short-term steroid use is commonly without significant side effects and is often a crucial treatment for a variety of issues, including:''Moreover, short-term use does not induce steroid withdrawal.' allergic reactions, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. eczema, allergies, and asthma."
What are steroid withdrawal symptoms and signs?,"'Withdrawal symptoms usually appear after extended use of steroids with rapid/sudden stopping of the drug. These steroids include glucocorticoids, ''anabolic steroids'' in topical, injectable, and transdermal forms. The following symptoms and signs may occur in individuals who are withdrawing from taking steroids:''Less often, ''joint pain'', skin changes, muscle aches, ''fever'', mental changes, or elevations of calcium may be noted. ''Dehydration'' and ''electrolyte'' imbalances may occur. Decrease in gastrointestinal contractions can occur, leading to dilation of the intestine (ileus). Steroid withdrawal symptoms mimic many other medical problems.'   Weakness Fatigue Decreased appetite Weight loss Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal pain Low blood pressure (hypotension) Dizziness or fainting Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Menstrual changes"
How do you taper off  steroids? Do they affect your adrenal glands?,"'Over the years, researchers began to learn why some patients develop symptoms of decreased adrenal function, while others never do. The production of corticosteroids is controlled by a ""feedback mechanism,"" involving the adrenal glands, the pituitary gland, and brain, known as the ""Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis"" (HPAA). The continuous administration of corticosteroids inhibits this mechanism, causing the HPAA to ""hibernate.""''We now know that the amount of the drug needed to suppress the HPAA varies from person to person. As a general rule, using large doses for a few days, or smaller doses for more than two weeks, leads to a prolonged decrease in HPAA function. Typically, there are no withdrawal symptoms with a 5-day moderately high dose burst of steroids.''Thus, steroid use cannot be stopped abruptly. Tapering the drug gives the adrenal glands time to return to their normal patterns of secretion. (It may take a period of time for things to get completely back to normal). How quickly steroids can be tapered depends on continued control of the underlying disease with decreasing doses, and on how quickly our body adjusts to the need to produce its own hormones. If things go well, 4 to 6 weeks (or longer) is a reasonable period.'""Unfortunately, tapering may not always completely prevent withdrawal symptoms. Present thinking suggests that steroid withdrawal may involve many factors, including a true physiological dependence on corticosteroids. Further, tests of HPAA function do not always correlate with a patient's symptoms, and these tests are of no value while taking steroids. Therefore, it can be difficult to determine the true cause of a patient's symptoms or reaction to ""'stress'' (for example, from a disease flare-up, procedure, or surgery). Restarting or increasing dosage may be the only solution.''Taking steroids every other morning gives the body a better chance to recover function. The day without the hormone allows natural stimulation of the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. Thus, alternate-day therapy is ideal, if possible, once the disease is under control. It is still not clear whether new steroids being developed will be available to decrease the risks of side effects and HPAA suppression.''We must assume that all patients exposed to steroid therapy for even a short time have diminished HPAA function. Patients who have taken steroids noticing any of the above or other unusual symptoms should notify their doctor. Keep in mind that some medications or ''alcohol'' can increase the need for larger steroid doses. You should carry a list of all your medications in your wallet to alert medical personnel in case of emergency. This is especially important if you are receiving steroid therapy or have recently stopped taking steroids. Supplementation may be needed during periods of stress, even up to a year after discontinuing corticosteroid therapy.' "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose withdrawal from steroids?,"'Because the symptoms of steroid withdrawal are varied and nonspecific, health care professionals may have some difficulty diagnosing this problem. However, the best way to diagnose steroid withdrawal is to have a good history and physical examination from the patient, with emphasis on medications such as steroid usage in the recent past that have been discontinued. Patients can help if they indicate to their doctors they have stopped steroids recently. Other tests that may aid in the diagnosis are the cortisol level, serum calcium level, ''CBC'', electrolyte levels, BUN level, and ''creatinine'' level.' "
Which types of specialists treat steroid withdrawal symptoms?,"'In addition to primary care physicians, internal-medicine specialists, endocrinologists, ''addiction'' specialists, emergency physicians, hospitalists, and hospital-based pharmacists can participate in treating steroid withdrawal.' "
What is the treatment for steroid withdrawal?,"""In general, steroid withdrawal is treated by administering steroids to decrease or eliminate withdrawal symptoms, then gradually decreasing the amount of steroids given so the body can adjust to synthesizing steroids normally. Each individual patient is different, so the physicians will take into account the patient's symptoms, steroid type (for example, hormonal steroids can be reduced faster than other steroid medications), and the patient's compliance. The weaning time is highly variable and may take a few weeks to up to a year or so depending on the patient's dependency, the strength and type of steroid administered, and underlying medical problems.""'Some patients may require increases in their steroids during withdrawal with stressful conditions such as emergency surgery. Such increases are usually very short-term increases.'  "
What is the prognosis of steroid withdrawal?,"'The prognosis of steroid withdrawal, if quickly recognized and treated, is usually good. The prognosis begins to decline if the steroid withdrawal goes unrecognized and complications such as electrolyte abnormalities, ''dehydration'', and other signs and symptoms lead to further health problems, or if the patient becomes noncompliant with treatment protocols.' "
Can you prevent steroid withdrawal?,"'Yes, it is possible to prevent steroid withdrawal. The best way to prevent steroid withdrawal is to be sure to use steroids conservatively and for the shortest period possible. Short-term use of steroids (time period varies with the type of steroid and its amount administered -- usually days to weeks) usually does not trigger steroid withdrawal. However, with both short- and longer-term use of steroids, steroid withdrawal may be avoided in most patients by tapering the dose over time. This method may also prevent steroid withdrawal in the majority of patients.' "
Are steroids anti-inflammatories?,"'Research conducted by Edward Calvin Kendall at the Mayo Clinic in the medical use of cortisone led to a Nobel Prize in 1950. The drug simulated cortisol, a naturally occurring, anti-inflammatory hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Such synthetic corticosteroid drugs (prednisone, prednisolone, and many others) have since benefited patients and are commonly used to treat many conditions, including:''However, there are serious side effects.\xa0There are two concerns with steroid side effects. Continuous, long-term steroid treatment are drug side effects, and symptoms due to changes in the balance of normal hormone secretion.'""Symptoms from an imbalance of hormone secretion typically results from taking doses greater than our body's natural production (about the equivalent of 7.5 mg of prednisone per day). Once patients begin to decrease or discontinue the dose, withdrawal symptoms may occur. Thus, steroids are typically given for the shortest possible time possible.""'Short-term steroid use is commonly without significant side effects and is often a crucial treatment for a variety of issues, including:''Moreover, short-term use does not induce steroid withdrawal.' allergic reactions, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. eczema, allergies, and asthma."
What are steroid withdrawal symptoms and signs?,"'Withdrawal symptoms usually appear after extended use of steroids with rapid/sudden stopping of the drug. These steroids include glucocorticoids, ''anabolic steroids'' in topical, injectable, and transdermal forms. The following symptoms and signs may occur in individuals who are withdrawing from taking steroids:''Less often, ''joint pain'', skin changes, muscle aches, ''fever'', mental changes, or elevations of calcium may be noted. ''Dehydration'' and ''electrolyte'' imbalances may occur. Decrease in gastrointestinal contractions can occur, leading to dilation of the intestine (ileus). Steroid withdrawal symptoms mimic many other medical problems.'   Weakness Fatigue Decreased appetite Weight loss Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal pain Low blood pressure (hypotension) Dizziness or fainting Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Menstrual changes"
How do you taper off  steroids? Do they affect your adrenal glands?,"'Over the years, researchers began to learn why some patients develop symptoms of decreased adrenal function, while others never do. The production of corticosteroids is controlled by a ""feedback mechanism,"" involving the adrenal glands, the pituitary gland, and brain, known as the ""Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis"" (HPAA). The continuous administration of corticosteroids inhibits this mechanism, causing the HPAA to ""hibernate.""''We now know that the amount of the drug needed to suppress the HPAA varies from person to person. As a general rule, using large doses for a few days, or smaller doses for more than two weeks, leads to a prolonged decrease in HPAA function. Typically, there are no withdrawal symptoms with a 5-day moderately high dose burst of steroids.''Thus, steroid use cannot be stopped abruptly. Tapering the drug gives the adrenal glands time to return to their normal patterns of secretion. (It may take a period of time for things to get completely back to normal). How quickly steroids can be tapered depends on continued control of the underlying disease with decreasing doses, and on how quickly our body adjusts to the need to produce its own hormones. If things go well, 4 to 6 weeks (or longer) is a reasonable period.'""Unfortunately, tapering may not always completely prevent withdrawal symptoms. Present thinking suggests that steroid withdrawal may involve many factors, including a true physiological dependence on corticosteroids. Further, tests of HPAA function do not always correlate with a patient's symptoms, and these tests are of no value while taking steroids. Therefore, it can be difficult to determine the true cause of a patient's symptoms or reaction to ""'stress'' (for example, from a disease flare-up, procedure, or surgery). Restarting or increasing dosage may be the only solution.''Taking steroids every other morning gives the body a better chance to recover function. The day without the hormone allows natural stimulation of the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. Thus, alternate-day therapy is ideal, if possible, once the disease is under control. It is still not clear whether new steroids being developed will be available to decrease the risks of side effects and HPAA suppression.''We must assume that all patients exposed to steroid therapy for even a short time have diminished HPAA function. Patients who have taken steroids noticing any of the above or other unusual symptoms should notify their doctor. Keep in mind that some medications or ''alcohol'' can increase the need for larger steroid doses. You should carry a list of all your medications in your wallet to alert medical personnel in case of emergency. This is especially important if you are receiving steroid therapy or have recently stopped taking steroids. Supplementation may be needed during periods of stress, even up to a year after discontinuing corticosteroid therapy.' "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose withdrawal from steroids?,"'Because the symptoms of steroid withdrawal are varied and nonspecific, health care professionals may have some difficulty diagnosing this problem. However, the best way to diagnose steroid withdrawal is to have a good history and physical examination from the patient, with emphasis on medications such as steroid usage in the recent past that have been discontinued. Patients can help if they indicate to their doctors they have stopped steroids recently.

What are steroids?,"'Steroids (short for ''corticosteroids'') are synthetic ''drugs'' that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone that your body produces naturally. Steroids work by decreasing inflammation and reducing the activity of the immune system. They are used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases and conditions.''Corticosteroids are different from ''anabolic steroids'', which some athletes use to build bigger muscles. Examples of ''corticosteroid'' medications include triamcinolone, cortisone, ''prednisone'', and ''methylprednisolone''.'  "
How do steroids work?,"""Steroids decrease inflammation and reduce the activity of the immune system. Inflammation is a process by which the body's white blood cells and chemicals protect the body against infection and foreign organisms such as bacteria and ""'viruses''.'""In certain diseases, however, the body's defense system (immune system) doesn't function properly and is overactive. This may cause inflammation to work against the body's own tissues and cause tissue damage. Inflammation is characterized by redness, warmth, swelling and ""'pain''.''Steroids reduce the production of inflammatory chemicals in order to minimize tissue damage. Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system by affecting the function of white blood cells. ' "
Do steroids work?,"'When inflammation threatens to damage critical body organs, steroids can be organ saving and, in many instances, life-saving. For example, they may help prevent the progression of kidney inflammation, which can lead to ''kidney failure'' in people who have ''lupus'' or ''vasculitis''. For these people, steroid therapy may eliminate the need for ''kidney dialysis'' or transplant.''Low doses of steroids may provide significant relief from ''pain'' and ''stiffness'' for people with conditions including ''rheumatoid arthritis''. Temporary use of higher doses of steroids may help a person recover from a severe flare-up of ''arthritis''.' "
What are steroid injections used for?,"'Steroids often are injected directly into joints to treat conditions such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''gout'', or other inflammatory diseases. They also can be injected into an inflamed bursa or around tendons near most joints in the body.''Some people report relief from ''osteoarthritis'' when steroids are injected directly into swollen or ''painful joints''.' "
Why are steroids injected?,"'Injecting steroids into one or two areas of inflammation allows doctors to deliver a high dose of the drug directly to the problem area. When doctors give steroids by mouth or IV, they cannot be sure an adequate amount will eventually reach the problem area. In addition, the risk of side effects is much higher with oral or IV steroids. ' "
What are the benefits of steroid injections?,"'Steroid injections into a specific area are generally well tolerated and are less likely than other forms of steroid drugs to produce serious side effects. Also, the injections may help avoid the need for oral steroids or increased doses of oral steroids, which could have greater side effects.' "
How are steroids administered? What forms of steroids are available?," Steroids can be given topically (cream or ointment), by mouth (orally), or by injection. Steroids injection can be given into a vein or muscle, directly into a joint or bursa (lubricating sac between certain tendons and the bones beneath them) or around tendons and other soft tissue areas. Steroid shot can offer fast-acting relief of inflamed muscles, joints, tendons, and bursa."
What are steroids used to treat?,"""Steroids are used to treat a variety of conditions in which the body's defense system malfunctions and causes tissue damage. Steroids are used as the main treatment for certain inflammatory conditions, such as systemic ""'vasculitis'' (inflammation of blood vessels) and ''myositis'' (inflammation of muscle). They may also be used selectively to treat inflammatory conditions such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''lupus'"", Sjögren's syndrome, or ""'gout''.' "
What are the side effects of steroid injections?,"'Steroid injections are one of the most effective ways to decrease pain and improve function, yet they generally do not cure the illness.''In rare instances, the following side effects might occur:''Not everyone will develop side effects and side effects vary from person to person. If steroid injections are infrequent (less than every three to four months), it is possible that none of the listed side effects will occur.'   Infection Allergic reactions Bleeding into the joint Rupture of a tendon Skin discoloration Weakening of bone, ligaments, and tendons (from frequent, repeated injections into the same area)"
What are the side effects of oral steroids?,"'Side effects are more common with a higher dose and longer treatment. Side effects are much more common with oral drugs. Some side effects are more serious than others. Common side effects of oral steroids include:''Please note'': The side effects listed are the most common side effects. All possible side effects are not included. Always contact your doctor if you have questions about your personal situation.' Acne Blurred vision Cataracts or glaucoma Easy bruising Difficulty sleeping High blood pressure Increased appetite, weight gain Increased growth of body hair Insomnia Lower resistance to infection Muscle weakness Nervousness, restlessness Osteoporosis Stomach irritation or bleeding Sudden mood swings Swollen, puffy face Water retention, swelling Worsening of diabetes"
How can steroid side effects be minimized?,"'To minimize the side effects of steroids, doctors follow these guidelines:' Use steroids only when necessary. Monitor closely to detect the development of serious side effects. If possible, use steroid injections for problems in a specific area. Use the minimal dose required to gain control of the disease. Reduce the dose gradually if the disease remains under control. Monitor blood pressure often and treat if necessary. Recommend calcium supplements, vitamin D, and bone-building prescription medications to help maintain bone strength (this is done especially if steroids will be taken for a long period of time). Have your bone density checked every one to two years."
Does everyone develop side effects of steroids?,"'No. How often any side effect occurs varies from person to person. If steroid use is brief (from a few days to a few weeks), it is possible that none of the listed side effects will occur. The side effects listed generally do not occur when occasional steroid injections are given for arthritis, tendinitis, or ''bursitis''.''However, if steroid use involves high doses and is prolonged (for a few months to several years), an increase in the number of side effects may occur.' "
What role do steroid injections play in an overall treatment program?,"'Steroid injections can be added to a treatment program that may already include anti-inflammatory pain medications (''NSAIDs''), physical therapy, occupational therapy, or supportive devices such as canes and ''braces''. Whether one or more of these treatment methods are used depends on the nature of the problem.''For example, in an otherwise healthy person, tendinitis may be adequately treated with only a steroid injection into the inflamed area. However, in a person with ''rheumatoid arthritis'', injections are generally a small part of a multifaceted treatment approach.' "
When should steroid injections not be used?,"'Steroids should not be injected when there is infection in the area to be targeted or even elsewhere in the body because they could inhibit the natural infection-fighting immune response. Also, if a joint is already severely destroyed, injections are not likely to provide any benefit.''If someone has a potential bleeding problem or is taking ''anticoagulants'' (often referred to as blood thinners), steroid injections may cause bleeding at the site. For these people, injections are given with caution.''Frequent steroid injections, more often than every three or four months, are not recommended because of an increased risk of weakening tissues in the treated area. ' "
Who should not take steroids?,"'Steroids, as with other drugs, are not recommended for everyone. In general, people with the following conditions should not take steroids:' Infection Uncontrolled diabetes Uncontrolled high blood pressure or congestive heart failure Peptic ulcer Osteoporosis (bone thinning) Glaucoma"
 How do you know if steroid treatment is right for you?,"'The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, your overall health, and other drugs you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.' "
What is Stiff-Person syndrome?,'Stiff-person syndrome (''SPS'') is a rare neurological disorder with features of an autoimmune disease. ' 
What are the signs and symptoms of Stiff-Person syndrome?,"'Stiff-Person syndrome is characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress, which can set off ''muscle spasms''. Abnormal postures, often hunched over and stiffened, are characteristic of the disorder. People with Stiff-Person syndrome can be too disabled to walk or move, or they are afraid to leave the house because street noises, such as the sound of a horn, can trigger spasms and falls. '  "
"Who is affected by, and what causes Stiff-Person syndrome?","'Stiff-Person syndrome affects twice as many women as men. It is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases such as ''diabetes'', ''thyroiditis'', ''vitiligo'', and ''pernicious anemia'"". Scientists don't yet understand what causes Stiff-Person syndrome, but research indicates that it is the result of an autoimmune response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord. "" "
How is Stiff-Person syndrome diagnosed?,"'The disorder is often misdiagnosed as '""Parkinson's disease""', ''multiple sclerosis'', ''fibromyalgia'', psychosomatic illness, or ''anxiety'' and ''phobia''. A definitive diagnosis can be made with a blood test that measures the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase (''GAD'') antibodies in the blood. People with Stiff-Person syndrome have elevated levels of GAD, an antibody that works against an enzyme involved in the synthesis of an important neurotransmitter in the brain.'  "
Is there any treatment for Stiff-Person syndrome?,"'People with Stiff-Person syndrome respond to high doses of ''diazepam'' and several anti-convulsants, ''gabapentin'' and ''tiagabine''. A study funded by the NINDS demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in reducing stiffness and lowering sensitivity to noise, touch, and ''stress'' in people with Stiff-Person syndrome. '  "
What is the prognosis for Stiff-Person syndrome?,"'Treatment with IVIg, anti-''anxiety'' ''drugs'', muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, and ''pain'' relievers will improve the symptoms of Stiff-Person syndrome, but will not cure the disorder. Most individuals with Stiff-Person syndrome have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe. With appropriate treatment, the symptoms are usually well controlled.' "
What research is being done for Stiff-Person syndrome?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) conducts research related to Stiff-Person syndrome in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. A study using the drug ''rituximab'' proved ineffective in treating individuals with the disorder. Current research is focused on understanding the cause of the disease and the role of the anti-GAD antibodies. ' "
What is Still's disease?,"""Still's disease, a disorder featuring inflammation, is characterized by high spiking ""'fevers'"", salmon-colored rash that comes and goes, and arthritis. Still's disease is also referred to as systemic-onset ""'juvenile idiopathic arthritis'"". Still's disease was first described in children, but it is now known to occur, much less commonly, in adults (in whom it is referred to as adult-onset Still's disease or AOSD). Still's disease is named after the English physician Sir George F. Still (1861-1941)."" "
What causes Still's disease?,"""There have been a number of schools of thought regarding the cause (or causes) of Still's disease. One concept is that Still's disease is due to infection with a microbe. Another idea is that Still's disease is an autoimmune disorder. In fact, the precise cause of Still's disease is not yet known."" "
What are risk factors for Still's disease?,"""There are no specific known risk factors for the development of Still's disease."" "
How does Still's disease relate to juvenile idiopathic arthritis?,"""Still's disease is one type of ""'juvenile idiopathic arthritis'' (''JIA'') and is also known as systemic-onset ''JIA''. It is referred to as ""juvenile"" because it typically affects children under 16 years of age. By systemic, it is meant that along with joint inflammation it typically begins with symptoms and signs of systemic (body-wide) illness, such as high ''fevers'', gland swelling, and internal organ involvement. By idiopathic, it is meant that the disease has no known cause.''Systemic-onset JIA was formerly known as ''systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis'' (''JRA'') and is the same disease. Several years ago, the naming system for all types of ''JRA'' changed, and JRA is now called juvenile idiopathic arthritis or JIA.' "
What are Still's disease symptoms and signs?,"""Still's disease usually begins with systemic (body-wide) symptoms.""""Other Still's disease symptoms.are:""   Extreme fatigue can accompany waves of high fevers that rise daily to 102 F (39 C) or even higher and rapidly return to normal levels or below. Fever spikes often occur at approximately the same time every day. A faint salmon-colored skin rash characteristically comes and goes and does not itch. Poor appetite, nausea, and weight loss are common There is also commonly swelling of the lymph glands, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and sore throat. Some patients develop inflammation around the heart (pericarditis) and lungs (pleuritis), with occasional fluid accumulation around the heart (pericardial effusion) and lungs (pleural effusion). Arthritis, with joint swelling, often occurs after rash and fevers have been present for some time. Although arthritis may initially be overlooked because of the impressive nature of the systemic symptoms, everyone with Still's disease eventually develops joint pain and swollen joints. This usually involves many joints (polyarticular arthritis). Any joint can be affected, although there are preferential patterns of joint involvement in Still's disease."
How do health care professionals diagnose Still's disease?,"""Still's disease is diagnosed purely on the basis of the typical clinical features of the illness.""""Many patients with Still's disease develop markedly elevated white blood cell counts, as if they have a serious infection, but no infection is found."" These features include high intermittent fever, joint inflammation and pain, muscle pain, faint salmon-colored skin rash, swelling of the lymph glands or enlargement of the spleen and liver, and inflammation around the heart (pericarditis) or lungs (pleuritis). Persistent arthritis (arthritis lasting at least six weeks) is required to make a firm diagnosis of Still's disease. Other diseases (especially infections, cancers, and other types of arthritis) must be excluded. Low red blood counts (anemia) and elevated blood tests that indicate inflammation (such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR, C-reactive protein, and ferritin) are common. However, the classic blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis (rheumatoid factor) and systemic lupus erythematosus (antinuclear antibodies) are usually negative."
What is the frequency of Still's disease and its features?,"""Still's disease accounts for 10%-20% of all cases of JIA. It affects about 25,000-50,000 children in the United States. It is rare in adults, a majority of whom are 20-35 years of age at the onset of symptoms.""""Of all patients with Still's disease, 100% have high intermittent fever, and 100% have joint inflammation and pain, muscle pain with fevers, and develop persistent chronic arthritis. Approximately 95% of Still's disease patients have the faint salmon-colored skin rash, 85% have swelling of the lymph glands or enlargement of the spleen and liver, 85% have a marked increase in the white blood cell count, 60% have inflammation of the lungs (pleuritis) or around the heart (pericarditis), 40% have severe ""'anemia'', and 20% have ''abdominal pain''.' "
What is the treatment for Still's disease?,"""Still's disease can cause serious damage to the joints, particularly the wrists. It can also impair the function of the heart and lungs. Treatment of Still's disease is directed toward the individual areas of inflammation. Many symptoms are often controlled with anti-inflammatory ""'drugs'' such as ''aspirin'' or other nonsteroidal drugs (''NSAIDs'""). It has been reported that some patients with Still's disease can frequently have elevations of ""'liver function'' blood tests as a side effect of aspirin and sometimes other anti-inflammatory medications. Cortisone medications (steroids) such as ''prednisone'' are used to treat more severe features of illness.''For patients with persistent illness, medications that affect the inflammatory aspects of the immune system are used. Medications now being used are analogous to the classic ""second-line"" therapies used for patients with ''rheumatoid arthritis''. These include ''hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil), ''penicillamine'' (''Cuprimine'', ''Depen''), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), and ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan'').'""Recently, because Still's disease has been found to involve a specific chemical messenger of inflammation known as interleukin 1 (IL-1), the injectable biologic medication ""'anakinra'' (''Kineret'""), which blocks IL-1, has been found to be a very effective treatment for Still's disease. Still's disease also involves interleukin 6 (IL-6). ""'Tocilizumab'' (''Actemra''), an intravenous treatment which blocks IL-6, is approved to treat systemic JIA in children.'  "
Is it possible to prevent Still's disease?,"'There is no ''prevention'"" for Still's disease."" "
What types of specialists treat Still's disease?,"""Still's disease is treated by primary care physicians, including pediatricians, internists, general practice, and family practice physicians."" Typically, these primary care doctors work with either pediatric or adult rheumatologists in caring for these patients. Depending on organs affected, other specialists who can be involved in the care of patients with Still's disease includecardiologists,pulmonologists,orthopedic surgeons,physical therapists, andoccupational therapists. cardiologists, pulmonologists, orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists, and occupational therapists."
What is the prognosis of Still's disease?,"'The fever and other systemic features tend to run their course within several months. The arthritis can be a long-term problem. It usually stays on after the systemic features have gone.'   The arthritis can then become chronic and persist into adulthood. Persisting arthritis of the wrists, with eventual fusion, is common, especially if not treated aggressively. Newer biologic treatments are likely to be beneficial in stopping the progressive joint damage."
What Still's disease research is being done?,"""A wide variety of research is ongoing related to Still's disease. While intravenous immunoglobulin therapy has been used in adult-onset Still's disease, more studies are needed to confirm these results."" Newer IL-1 blockers may prove to be even more effective in treating Still's disease. Also, TNF-inhibitors (etanercept [Enbrel] and infliximab [Remicade]) have been used successfully in people who have failed other treatments (much as they are now used in rheumatoid arthritis). The intravenous infusions of infliximab helped decrease the Still's disease signs and symptoms, including fever, arthritis, muscle pains, enlarged spleen, and rash in some studies."
What does stillborn mean? Stillbirth statistics,"'Stillborn (stillbirth) means the death of a baby prior to birth. This can occur before or during delivery of the baby. About 1% of ''pregnancies'' overall result in stillbirth, meaning that there are about 24,000 stillbirths each year in the U.S.' "
Stillbirth vs. miscarriage,"'Both stillbirth and ''miscarriage'' are forms of ''pregnancy'' loss. In the U.S., a ''pregnancy'' loss before the 20th week of pregnancy is referred to as a ''miscarriage'', while the term “stillbirth” refers to the loss of a baby after 20 weeks’ gestation. Not all doctors agree worldwide on these terms; for example, the WHO (World Health Organization) recommends a stillbirth to be defined as a baby born with no signs of life at or after 28 weeks gestation.' "
What are stillborn baby symptoms?,"'Stillbirth can be described as early, late, or term, depending on the stage of pregnancy.''The most common symptom of stillbirth is not feeling the baby moving or kicking. In some women, ''cramps'', ''pain'', or ''vaginal bleeding'' may also occur.'  An early stillbirth is a fetal death occurring between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy. A late stillbirth is a fetal death occurring between 28 and 36 weeks. A term stillbirth is a fetal death occurring at 37 or more weeks."
What causes a baby to be stillborn?,"'A number of diseases and conditions as well as problems with the pregnancy or health of the mother can all be causes of stillbirth. Some causes of stillbirth include:' birth defects or chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus; problems with the placenta, such as insufficient blood flow; infections of the fetus, mother, or placenta; complications of pregnancy and labor, such as preterm labor and placental abruption (separation of the placenta from the uterine wall); problems with the umbilical cord; and high blood pressure or other health complications in the mother."
What are the risk factors for delivering a baby stillborn?,"'Certain conditions or factors increase the risk of having a stillborn baby. These include:' Obesity Diabetes or high blood pressure Multiple gestation Age under 20 or over 35 Black race Smoking Alcohol use Drug abuse History of stillbirth, miscarriage, or pregnancy complications"
How is a stillbirth diagnosed?,"'Stillbirth can be diagnosed by ''ultrasound'' examination to show that the baby’s ''heart'' is no longer beating. After delivery, the baby is found to be stillborn if there are no signs of life such as ''breathing'', heartbeat, and movements.' "
What is the treatment for mothers of stillborn babies?,"'Treatment for mothers of stillborn ''babies'' includes several key components:' Delivery of the fetus. Depending on the stage of pregnancy, the fetus may be delivered by induction of labor or by dilation and evacuation (dilation of the cervix and removal of the fetus from the womb) if the stillbirth occurs in the second trimester. Cesarean delivery may also be an option for some women. Examination of the fetus and search for causes of stillbirth. This can include examination of the fetus or the amniotic fluid to try to determine the reason for the stillbirth. It is important to do this to try to determine if there are conditions or factors that might place future pregnancies at risk. Management of risk factors. If medical reasons or risk factors are present that might put future pregnancies at risk, the mother can work with her health care team to try to minimize risk for future pregnancies. Coping with grief. Emotional support and grief counseling is another important part of treatment of the mother."
Can anything be done to prevent stillborn births?,"'While there is never a way to prevent stillbirth completely, you can take steps to reduce your risk and to ensure a healthy pregnancy, such as maintaining a healthy weight before ''getting pregnant'', not ''smoking'' or using alcohol or other ''drugs'', getting a thorough checkup prior to ''becoming pregnant'', ensuring good ''prenatal care'' and medical supervision, and getting treatment for any medical conditions.' "
What is the prognosis for women who want to become pregnant after having a stillborn baby?,'Most women who have a stillborn baby go on to have a healthy pregnancy. The chances for a repeat stillbirth are very low. Only about 1 in 100 women (1%) will have a repeat stillbirth.' 
Why is wound closure important?,"'The ability to close a skin wound is an important surgical skill learned by medical care providers. Whether a fall in the street or a scalpel made the skin injury in an operating room, the decision as to how and when to repair the damage needs to be individualized for each patient and situation.''The skin has many layers from the ''epidermis'' on the outside, to the deeper subcutaneous tissues and the dermis in between. Each of these layers has other sub-layers that help the skin perform its functions. The skin provides a barrier to the outside world and the dangers of infection, environmental hazards and chemicals, and temperature. It contains melanocytes that can darken or tan the skin while protecting the body from ultraviolet ''radiation''. It also plays an important role in temperature and fluid regulation.''Different options exist for repairing lacerated skin and providing a nice cosmetic outcome. There are two important steps that need to occur before the skin is closed.''The purpose of ''wound care'' is not simply to yield a good-looking ''scar''. All wounds will eventually heal over time, although closing the skin edges will make that healing time shorter. The primary purpose of seeking medical care from a health care professional is to get the wound properly cleaned and make certain everything is in good working order beneath the damaged skin.''When a laceration occurs, there are some reasonable ''first aid'' and home care steps to consider. Washing with tap water to clean the wound is always helpful. Studies show that plain tap water is as good as any special fluids used in hospitals for cleaning wounds. Lightly bandage the wound and elevate it if possible.''The amount of blood supplied to different parts of the body varies. A wound on the face, ''scalp'', or hand may bleed profusely while one on the shin or back may not. Bleeding will often stop with direct pressure at the bleeding site and elevation of the injured part of the body.' Exploration: A doctor will need to examine and explore most wounds need to their full depth, looking for dirt and debris that may have entered, and making certain that the anatomic structures beneath the damaged skin are intact and not injured. For example, in a hand or finger laceration, the care provider will want to make certain that the blood vessels, nerves, and tendons beneath the skin have not been cut. This is done both by physical examination of the hand and finger, evaluating their power and motion, blood supply and nerve sensation, and also by looking inside the wound, identifying the tendon and perhaps the artery and nerve bundles to make certain that they are intact. Cleaning: When the skin is broken, the outside world invades the body and may cause infection. Before closing the skin, a doctor must wash out or thoroughly irrigate a wound to prevent the occurrence of an infection. Sometimes, it's necessary to cut out a small amount of dirty tissue (a process called debridement)."
How does the health care professional assess a wound?,"""Lacerations are common injuries treated in physicians' offices, walk-in clinics, and emergency departments. The approach to the injury is often the same. The history taken by the health care provider is very important to decide whether the benefit of repairing the wound outweighs the potential risk of complications. Infection is the most common worrisome complication. The provider will want to know the circumstances of the injury.""'Physical examination is key to making certain that underlying structures are undamaged. This is especially important in the extremities where arteries, nerves, and tendons run beneath the skin. When there is damage to skin over a ''broken bone'', it is called an open ''fracture'', and often patients with such a fracture require surgery and are taken to the operating room so that the wound can be extensively cleaned to prevent ''osteomyelitis'' (an infection of the bone). This same situation may also occur if the laceration goes deep into a joint.''It may be necessary to take ''X-rays'' to look for foreign material that may be imbedded in the laceration. While metal objects are easier to see, it may also be possible to identify nonmetallic foreign objects.''A doctor has many options when it comes to repairing a wound: sutures, staples, glue, Steri-Strips, and Band-Aids. First, the wound needs to be prepared for sewing (or suturing or stitching; the words all describe the same procedure).' Where did the accident occur? Was it washing dishes in the sink, or did it occur in a farm field, cleaning dirty equipment covered in mud? When did it happen? The older the wound, the higher the potential for infection since there is more time for bacteria to invade the wound and begin the infection/inflammation process. Was it due to a fall or other trauma? Is there damage to other parts of the body? Were there unusual circumstances, like an animal bite, or did it occur underwater in a river or lake (both situations posing a high risk for infection)? One can imagine a variety of scenarios that may greatly increase the infection risk. Ideally, the injured area is exposed and cleaned with water, saline (salt water), and/or soap. A health care provider administers a local anesthetic to allow full exploration of the wound, looking for foreign objects or damage to underlying structures. Minimizing the pain in the area allows for better exploration and visualization of the underlying anatomy. A health care provider may wash or irrigate a wound a second time to try to minimize the risk of infection."
How do health care providers choose the type of closure material?,"'The purpose of repairing a wound is to provide good cosmetic results. All wounds will eventually heal by themselves; however, bringing the edges together and without tension will allow for a better result. All lacerations will leave a scar, and a good wound closure will minimize the visibility of that scar.''Since there are many layers of skin, a doctor uses layers of suture to bring those layers together. A deep wound increases the risk of infection, and if only the skin is closed, empty spaces may exist beneath the outer skin layer. Fluid can accumulate within these empty spaces, and stagnant fluid can increase the risk for infection.''For skin sutures, the hope is to cause minimal inflammation so that the scar will form nicely. When a doctor places deep sutures, that suture material gradually disintegrates or dissolves as part of the inflammatory response of the body.''The strength of the suture depends upon the thickness of the suture material. Some suture materials used to repair nerves may be so thin that the surgeon needs a microscope to see the suture and be able to sew. Some suture material is as thick as string. The thinner the suture, the less tension it can tolerate and the more stitches need to be placed closer together, to keep the wound from breaking open as it heals.''Doctors use different types of needles depending upon the situation. The two major kinds are cutting and non-cutting. The cutting needles have a diamond-shaped tip designed to ""cut"" through skin. The non-cutting needle tips are circular and designed for use on deep tissues that do not have the resistance of skin. There are different shapes of the needle curve as well to help guide the needle and the attached suture on its path.''Almost all suture material is preloaded on a needle and does not need to be hand-threaded. The care provider will specify the type of suture, the thickness, and the type of needle when planning to repair a laceration.' "
How do doctors close a wound?,"'Most frequently, the closure of choice for the skin layer repair is a single filament suture, meaning that it is not braided. This non-absorbable suture does not cause irritation and inflammation, minimizing scar formation. The two main choices are nylon and ''polypropylene'"" (Prolene). Doctors may use staples when potential scarring isn't as important. They often use staples to close scalp wounds. Often surgeons who have made a long incision on the abdomen, back, or extremity use staples to close the skin.""'If the laceration follows the crease lines of the body (lines of Langerhans) and is not under ''stress'' or stretch, Steri-Strips or butterfly Band-Aids may be considered. Dermabond or skin glue is another potential option for repairing the skin. For this option, the wound must be superficial and run along the crease lines, not be under ''stress'' or stretch, and not have blood or hair present at the wound site. If a doctor uses Steri-Strips or Dermabond, the principles of wound cleaning and exploration still are important considerations.''In some circumstances, doctors use very thin absorbable sutures to close the skin. A medical professional may use material made of polyglycolic acid (Dexon), polyglactic acid (Vicryl), poliglecaprone (Monocryl), or polydioxanone (PDS II) just beneath the epidermis (subcuticular area) to allow for good skin closure. The decision to use absorbable suture in the skin depends upon the situation and the skill and experience of the provider performing the repair.' "
How do doctors repair wounds to deep tissues?,"'If the laceration requires layered closures in which it will not be possible to remove the sutures, dissolvable suture material may be used. Polyglycolic, polyglactic acid, poliglecaprone, and polyglyconate (Maxon) may be considered. Other materials may include silk or catgut (chromic). Depending upon the type of material and the circumstances, absorbable suture may take from 3 weeks to 3 months to dissolve.' "
What actually happens when a medical professional places stitches?,"""Once a doctor decides to sew or stitch up a wound, a medical professional brings an instrument tray to the patient's side. The tray usually contains the following items:""'The care provider will need to decide the type of suture or thread required, including whether it is absorbable or non-absorbable and its thickness. (The thicker the suture, the higher its tensile strength, and the stronger it is.) Another decision is the size and type of needle; this also affects the size of needle holder required. Tinier needles need smaller instruments to guide them through tissue and skin.''The first step is to clean the wound and inject local anesthetic. Wound exploration and cleansing follows.''How a doctor closes an incision depends upon how the wound was made. A wound created due to a sharp scalpel in the operating room will need less planning for closure than one with a jagged wound edge because of a burst laceration from a fall.''The medical professional needs to bring the skin edges close together with minimal tension. The doctor grasps one side of the wound skin edge with the forceps and brings it near to the other edge. If possible, the doctor passes the needle through both skin edges and by pulling on the suture thread, brings the skin edges together. It is important that there is not too much pulling because the stitch can pull right through the skin.''The skin edges need to be everted, meaning that the undersides of the skin, the layer just below the epidermis, on each side of the laceration need to contact each other. When a health care provider ties and knots the stitch, the edges tend to relax, and the epidermis tends to lay flatter. Without eversion, the scar can cave in and potentially appear ''depressed''.''It is important that a doctor ties the knot with the right amount of tension; too loose and the wound edges separate, widening the scar, but too tight and the skin edges can strangulate and cause damage to the skin surface.''There are different types of stitches, depending upon the situation and the expertise of the care provider. Examples include the following:''Knot tying is very important. The stitch needs to be secure so that it does not unravel and fall out prematurely. The surgical knot really consists of multiple layered knots to prevent the suture from falling out. A doctor needs to tie a knot to make removal easy when the time comes. Tying the knot too tightly results in skin damage from the knot itself.''The equipment used in urgent care or the emergency department to stitch a wound is the same as that found in the operating room. Surgical sutures in the operating room are the same as those used as an outpatient. Those used inside the body for specific purposes may be of different sizes and made of different materials, depending on the tissue they are being used to repair, from arteries and nerves to muscles and bowel and everything in between.''While the surgical incision in the skin is all the patient and family can see, it is the surgical sutures located deep in the body that a doctor really needs to place precisely. Those stitches cannot fail to hold tissue together because a doctor cannot replace them without another surgical procedure.' A needle holder (to grasp the needle and suture material) Forceps (medical tweezers) to help grasp the wound edges Scissors to cut the suture. A syringe with local anesthetic Sponges Cleansing liquids Simple interrupted suture Simple running or continuous suture Purse-string suture Horizontal mattress suture Vertical mattress suture Subcuticular running suture"
When and how do medical professionals remove sutures?,"'The optimal time for suture removal depends upon both the location of the laceration and how much stress one places on the laceration. For example, a knee laceration will require the suture to remain in place longer than on the thigh, since the skin will be stressed each time the knee flexes and extends with ''walking'', sitting, and standing.''Sutures form a loop that surrounds the laceration and when pulled tight cause the wound to close. The body can start to form a scar around the suture itself, and it is important to remember this when deciding the appropriate time to remove the sutures. This scarring tends to occur within 7 to 8 days and can have an appearance resembling crosshatching or railroad tracks.''Follow-up for suture removal on the face usually occurs within 3 to 5 days, since there is such good blood supply in this region and healing occurs more quickly. The goal is to minimize scarring; therefore, the risk of the sutures causing a scar in their own right is balanced against the strength and potential ''weakness'' of the healing laceration. Elsewhere on the body, health care providers may leave sutures in for 7 to 10 days. In some circumstances, in which scarring is not an issue or if there is concern that wound is under mechanical stress (like a laceration over a joint), the sutures may be left in longer.' "
What happens to the site after suture removal?,"'After suture removal, the scar continues to mature over time. For the first 3 months, there will be a raised, red healing ridge at the laceration site. Over the next 2 to 3 months, the ridge will flatten and then will start to weather and lighten. It may take 6 to 8 months or longer before a patient can appreciate the result of the laceration repair.'  "
Are there any special considerations regarding wound repair?,"'People with ''diabetes'' or those with ''peripheral vascular disease'' may have delayed healing and increased risk of infection.''Animal bites are especially prone to infection, and the decision to repair a bite with sutures must balance the risk of infection with the benefit of a better-looking scar. Approximately 50% of dog bites, 80% of cat bites, and 100% of human bites will develop infections.''When the risk of infection is high, the health care provider may choose from different options to allow wound healing. When a health care provider cleanses and dresses a laceration but does not repair it, it will gradually heal on its own. This called healing by secondary intention. (Primary closure describes a wound that is sutured or stitched.)''Another alternative is delayed primary closure, in which a health care provider cleans and dresses a dirty or contaminated wound and then evaluates it in a few days (usually 2 or 3). If the wound is not infected, it might be possible to then suture it closed, as if it is a new injury.' "
Introduction,'Gastric bypass surgery combines the creation of a small stomach pouch to restrict food intake and construction of bypasses of the duodenum and other segments of the small intestine to cause malabsorption (decreased ability to absorb calories and nutrients from food).' 
Types of Gastric Bypass Surgery,"'Gastric bypass surgery that causes malabsorption and restricts food intake produces more ''weight loss'' than restriction operations like ''gastric banding'', which only decrease food intake. People who have bypass surgery generally lose two-thirds of their excess weight within two years.' Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RGB): This operation is the most common gastric bypass surgery performed in the U.S. First, a small stomach pouch is created by stapling part of the stomach together or by vertical banding. This limits how much food you can eat. Next, a Y-shaped section of the small intestine is attached to the pouch to allow food to bypass the duodenum as well as the first portion of the jejunum. This causes reduced calorie and nutrient absorption. This procedure can now be done with a laparoscope (a thin telescope-like instrument for viewing inside the abdomen) in some people. This involves using small incisions and generally has a more rapid recovery time.
 Extensive gastric bypass (biliopancreatic diversion): In this more complicated gastric bypass operation, the lower portion of the stomach is removed. The small pouch that remains is connected directly to the final segment of the small intestine, thus completely bypassing both the duodenum and jejunum. Although this procedure successfully promotes weight loss, it is not as widely used because of the high risk for nutritional deficiencies."
Risks of Gastric Bypass Surgery,"'People who undergo gastric bypass surgery are at risk for: ''Gastric bypass surgery also may cause ""dumping syndrome,"" whereby stomach contents move too rapidly through the small intestine. Symptoms include ''nausea'',  ''weakness'', ''sweating'', faintness, and, occasionally, ''diarrhea'' after eating, as well as the inability to eat sweets without becoming extremely weak. ''Gallstones'' can occur in response to rapid ''weight loss''. They can be dissolved with medication taken after the surgery. ' Pouch stretching (stomach gets bigger overtime, stretching back to its 
	original size). Band erosion (the band closing off part of the stomach disintegrates). Breakdown of staple lines (band and staples fall apart, reversing the 
	procedure). Leakage of stomach contents into the abdomen (this is dangerous because 
	the acid can eat away other organs).  Nutritional deficiencies causing health problems."
Complications From Nutritional Deficiencies,"'The limited absorption of ''vitamin B-12'' and iron can cause ''anemia''. The lack of calcium absorption can cause ''osteoporosis'' and metabolic bone disease. People who undergo this procedure are required to take nutritional ''supplements'' that usually prevent these deficiencies. ''The more extensive the gastric bypass surgery, the greater the risk for complications and nutritional deficiencies. People who undergo extensive bypasses of the normal digestive process require not only close monitoring, but also lifelong use of special foods and medications. ''WebMD Medical Reference' "
"Gastric cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the 
lining of the stomach.","'The stomach is a J-shaped organ in the upper abdomen. It is part of the digestive system, which processes nutrients (''vitamins'', minerals, carbohydrates, ''fats'', proteins, and water) in foods that are eaten and helps pass waste material out of the body. Food moves from the throat to the stomach through a hollow, muscular tube called the ''esophagus''. After leaving the stomach, partly-digested food passes into the small intestine and then into the ''large intestine''.''The wall of the stomach is made up of 3 layers of tissue: the mucosal (innermost) layer, the muscularis (middle) layer, and the serosal (outermost) layer. Gastric cancer begins in the cells lining the mucosal layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.''Stromal tumors of the stomach begin in supporting connective tissue and are treated differently from gastric cancer.' "
"Age, diet, and stomach disease can affect the risk of developing gastric cancer.","""Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for gastric cancer include the following:"" Having any of the following medical conditions:Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection of the stomach.Chronic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach).Pernicious anemia.Intestinal metaplasia (a condition in which the normal stomach lining is replaced with the cells that line the intestines).Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or gastric polyps. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection of the stomach. Chronic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach). Pernicious anemia. Intestinal metaplasia (a condition in which the normal stomach lining is replaced with the cells that line the intestines). Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or gastric polyps. Eating a diet high in salted, smoked foods and low in fruits and vegetables. Eating foods that have not been prepared or stored properly. Being older or male. Smoking cigarettes. Having a mother, father, sister, or brother who has had stomach cancer."
Symptoms of gastric cancer include indigestion and stomach discomfort or pain.,"'These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by gastric cancer or by other conditions.''In the early stages of gastric cancer, the following symptoms may occur:''In more advanced stages of gastric cancer, the following signs and symptoms may occur:''Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.'   Indigestion and stomach discomfort. A bloated feeling after eating. Mild nausea. Loss of appetite. Heartburn. Blood in the stool. Vomiting. Weight loss for no known reason. Stomach pain. Jaundice (yellowing of eyes and skin). Ascites (build-up of fluid in the abdomen). Trouble swallowing."
Tests that examine the stomach and esophagus are used to detect (find) and diagnose gastric cancer.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:''The sample of tissue may be checked to measure how many HER2 genes there are and how much HER2 protein is being made. If there are more HER2 genes or higher levels of HER2 protein than normal, the cancer is called HER2 positive. HER2-positive gastric cancer may be treated with a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 protein.' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. Upper endoscopy: A procedure to look inside the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine) to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth and down the throat into the esophagus. Barium swallow: A series of x-rays of the esophagus and stomach. The patient drinks a liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound). The liquid coats the esophagus and stomach, and x-rays are taken. This procedure is also called an upper GI series. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. A biopsy of the stomach is usually done during the endoscopy."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:''When gastric cancer is found very early, there is a better chance of recovery. Gastric cancer is often in an advanced stage when it is diagnosed. At later stages, gastric cancer can be treated but rarely can be cured. Taking part in one of the clinical trials being done to improve treatment should be considered.' The stage of the cancer (whether it is in the stomach only or has spread to lymph nodes or other places in the body). The patient's general health."
"After gastric cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to 
find out if cancer cells have spread within the stomach or to other parts of the 
body.","'The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the stomach or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.''The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:'   CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) assay: Tests that measure the level of CEA in the blood. This substance is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. When found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of gastric cancer or other conditions. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or rectum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT."
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
"Cancer may 
spread from where it began to other parts of the body.","'When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if gastric cancer spreads to the ''liver'', the cancer cells in the liver are actually gastric cancer cells. The disease is metastatic gastric cancer, not ''liver cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
The following stages are used for gastric cancer:,"'In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the inside lining of the mucosa (innermost layer) of the stomach wall. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called ''carcinoma in situ''.''In stage I, cancer has formed in the inside lining of the mucosa (innermost layer) of the stomach wall. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB, depending on where the cancer has spread.''Stage II gastric cancer is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB, depending on where the cancer has spread.''Stage III gastric cancer is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC, depending on where the cancer has spread.''In stage IV, cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.' Stage IA: Cancer may have spread into the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall. Stage IB: Cancer:may have spread into the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall and is found in 1 or 2 lymph nodes near the tumor; orhas spread to the muscle layer of the stomach wall. may have spread into the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall and is found in 1 or 2 lymph nodes near the tumor; or has spread to the muscle layer of the stomach wall. Stage IIA: Cancer:has spread to the subserosa (layer of tissue next to the serosa) of the stomach wall; orhas spread to the muscle layer of the stomach wall and is found in 1 or 2 lymph nodes near the tumor; ormay have spread to the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall and is found in 3 to 6 lymph nodes near the tumor. has spread to the subserosa (layer of tissue next to the serosa) of the stomach wall; or has spread to the muscle layer of the stomach wall and is found in 1 or 2 lymph nodes near the tumor; or may have spread to the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall and is found in 3 to 6 lymph nodes near the tumor.

Recurrent Gastric Cancer,'Recurrent gastric cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the stomach or in other parts of the body such as the liver or lymph nodes.' 
There are different types of treatment for patients with gastric cancer.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with gastric cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Five types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery is a common treatment of all stages of gastric cancer. The following types of surgery may be used:''If the tumor is blocking the stomach but the cancer cannot be completely removed by standard surgery, the following procedures may be used:''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat gastric cancer.''Chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both. Chemoradiation given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Chemoradiation given before surgery, to shrink the tumor (neoadjuvant therapy), is being studied.''Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used in the treatment of gastric cancer.''Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. For stage IV gastric cancer and gastric cancer that has recurred, monoclonal antibodies, such as ''trastuzumab'' or ramucirumab, may be given. Trastuzumab blocks the effect of the growth factor protein HER2, which sends growth signals to gastric cancer cells. Ramucirumab blocks the effect of the protein VEGF and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.'   Subtotal gastrectomy: Removal of the part of the stomach that contains cancer, nearby lymph nodes, and parts of other tissues and organs near the tumor. The spleen may be removed. The spleen is an organ in the upper abdomen that filters the blood and removes old blood cells. Total gastrectomy: Removal of the entire stomach, nearby lymph nodes, and parts of the esophagus, small intestine, and other tissues near the tumor. The spleen may be removed. The esophagus is connected to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat and swallow. Endoluminal stent placement: A procedure to insert a stent (a thin, expandable tube) in order to keep a passage (such as arteries or the esophagus) open. For tumors blocking the passage into or out of the stomach, surgery may be done to place a stent from the esophagus to the stomach or from the stomach to the small intestine to allow the patient to eat normally. Endoluminal laser therapy: A procedure in which an endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) with a laser attached is inserted into the body. A laser is an intense beam of light that can be used as a knife. Gastrojejunostomy: Surgery to remove the part of the stomach with cancer that is blocking the opening into the small intestine. The stomach is connected to the jejunum (a part of the small intestine) to allow food and medicine to pass from the stomach into the small intestine. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.' "
"Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their 
cancer treatment.",'Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' 
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "
Treatment Options by Stage,"'Treatment of stage 0 is usually surgery (total or subtotal gastrectomy).''Treatment of stage I gastric cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage II gastric cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage III gastric cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage IV or recurrent gastric cancer may include the following:'   Surgery (total or subtotal gastrectomy).

What is the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Stomach flu'' or ''gastroenteritis'' is a general term for a number of inflammatory problems that occur in the gastrointestinal tract. ''Gastroenteritis'' is a better term because when some individuals use the term ""stomach ''flu'',"" they get the term confused with the ''flu'' (''influenza'') and the ''viruses'' that cause the flu. ''Influenza'' ''viruses'' do not cause ''stomach flu''.''The most common symptoms of the stomach flu include:''Other symptoms may include:''Because stomach flu means gastroenteritis and, because when the term “stomach flu” is used, the readers usually mean acute gastroenteritis caused by viruses (mainly ''Norovirus''); the emphasis of this article will be on ''Norovirus''- caused gastroenteritis although other causes will be mentioned.'   Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Fever Headache Body aches Dehydration"
Is the stomach flu contagious? What causes it?,"'There are many causes of stomach flu. The most common causes are ''contagious'' gastroenteritis, and include:''However, many other causes of gastroenteritis that are not ''contagious'' include:''Many medications list gastroenteritis as a common side effect.' Viruses (for example, Norovirus, Adenovirus and others), Bacteria (for example,  Salmonella,  Shigella,  E. coli and others), and Parasites (for example  Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium, and others). Food allergies Antibiotics Toxins"
What are the signs and symptoms of the stomach flu?,"'The primary symptom of stomach flu or gastroenteritis is ''diarrhea'' that does not contain blood usually accompanied by ''nausea'', some occasional ''vomiting'', and abdominal cramping.''The incubation time for gastroenteritis varies according to the particular cause. The most rapid incubation time is usually with viral illnesses (for example, for ''Norovirus'', which is about 1 -2 days), and the infected person may become contagious during this time without symptoms of ''nausea'' or ''diarrhea''.''Noncontagious causes (''allergies'', toxins, medication side effects) may produce symptoms very rapidly (minutes to hours) and in some people, the symptoms may become so severe that they require emergency care.'""Doctors usually base the diagnosis on the person's history and physical exam; some patients will need further blood and fecal tests done to determine the cause, especially in more severe infections.""  "
How is the stomach flu spread (how do you get it)?,"   Contagious causes of stomach flu (gastroenteritis) are spread usually through contamination of food or water or by person-to-person (fecal – oral route) spread via contaminated droplets containing infectious organisms. Some of the contagious causes of gastroenteritis (most notably, Norovirus) can be spread by kissing and other close personal contact or on surfaces where droplets containing viruses or other agents survive. Some viruses can even be spread to household pets such as dogs that, in turn, can spread the disease to other people. Fortunately, most causes of contagious gastroenteritis are not spread by breastfeeding or through breast milk. Noncontagious gastroenteritis such as that related to side effects of medicine or food allergies is not spread from person to person."
How long is the stomach flu contagious (incubation period)?,"'Stomach flu is contagious when the organisms that cause stomach flu are spread to uninfected individuals. The timeframe or how long the infected person remains contagious depends on the infecting cause. For example, most common cause of stomach flu is ''Norovirus''. It has an incubation period of about 12 - 48 hours, and can cause the person to be contagious during the incubation period and for as long as they shed virus (usually about three days after symptoms stop but sometimes up to two weeks). ''Norovirus'' symptoms usually last about one to two days and is sometimes termed the 24 hour stomach flu.''Other infectious agents such as other viral ''strains'', bacteria, and other infectious agents have incubation periods and contagious periods unique to them. Because this is an introductory article about stomach flu, readers are recommended to check the incubation periods and contagious periods of whatever infectious agent is thought to be causing the problem (for example, ''Salmonella'' or ''E. coli'').' "
How long does the stomach flu last?,"'For contagious causes of stomach flu, many individuals have symptoms that last about 2 to 5 days, after which the symptoms tend to resolve. Once the symptoms resolve, an individual may be considered ""cured"" of stomach flu. However, it\'s not unusual for that same individual to develop stomach flu again at some point in time if they are exposed to other causes, or in some individuals, the same infectious cause. Occasionally, the stomach flu ""symptoms"" progress and goes on to become another more severe disease (for example, salmonellosis or ''shigellosis'').'  "
How long do the contagious causes of the stomach flu last on surfaces?,"'The most common cause of stomach flu, noroviruses, can live on surfaces for up to about two weeks. Consequently, is important to try to avoid contaminating surfaces while you are infected with the virus and equally important, anyone not infected individual should wash their hands with soap and water after touching surfaces that might be contaminated. Cleaning surfaces like doorknobs or kitchen counters with a diluted bleach and water solution can help reduce the chance of infection.''For other causes of stomach flu (gastroenteritis), the reader is suggested to look up the specific infectious agent to determine how long it will remain viable and contagious on surfaces.' "
When should I contact a doctor for the stomach flu?,"'Many people get contagious stomach flu from different causes, but in general, they recover from the infection in about 2 to 5 days and usually do not contact a health-care professional. Most doctors consider gastroenteritis to be a self-limiting disease. Unfortunately some people, especially the elderly, young children, and individuals that have multiple medical problems may develop more severe symptoms. Consequently, people should contact their health-care professional or emergency department if one or more the following occurs:'   Gastroenteritis symptoms that last more than five days The intensity of the symptoms increases A fever above 101 F or 38.3 C Bloody diarrhea Signs of dehydration appear, for example, little or no urine output or dry mucous membranes Constant or increasing abdominal pains A person is immunocompromised, has other medical problems, or is pregnant Facial or throat swelling Shortness of breath"
What is the difference between the stomach flu vs. food poisoning?,"  People use the term ""stomach flu"" to refer to a feeling of being sick with unpleasant symptoms such as:FeverNauseaVomiting, abdominal (stomach) cramping or painDiarrhea Fever Nausea Vomiting, abdominal (stomach) cramping or pain Diarrhea It can be hard to know exactly what is causing these symptoms. All of them can occur due to an infection and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) most commonly caused by a virus known as viral gastroenteritis. This condition is sometimes referred to as ""stomach flu"" or a ""stomach bug."" Even though both the ""flu"" (influenza) and viral gastroenteritis are illnesses caused by a virus, the ""stomach flu"" or ""stomach bug"" (viral gastroenteritis) is not related to actual influenza (flu) virus. Food poisoning is more common than stomach flu. It is a food-borne disease that causes symptoms and signs that are similar illness to the stomach flu. Symptoms include:Abdominal (stomach) cramping and painDiarrhea (watery)NauseaVomitingPainFever Abdominal (stomach) cramping and pain Diarrhea (watery) Nausea Vomiting Pain Fever This type of poisoning results when organisms (viruses, bacteria, parasites, or prions) or the toxins produced by the organisms, contaminate foods or beverages. This type of poisoning also is known as a food-borne illness or food-borne disease."
"Are the stomach flu and food poisoning contagious, and how are they spread (transmitted)?","'However, some forms of poisoning are spread through contact with infected bodily fluid (''stool'' in particular-the ""fecal-oral"" route, which means a person has contaminated feces on their hand or hands, and then touches their mouth with the portion of the hand with the infected feces).'   The stomach flu virus is contagious. This means that the virus, spread from person to person. This ""flu"" is most common during the winter months (November to April in the US). Direct contact with a person infected with a stomach bug can spread the disease, as can contact with stool or vomit from a person infected with the virus. Outbreaks of the 
	infection can occur in schools or toddler and child daycare settings. Other outbreaks have been reported on cruise ships (norovirus) and other places where people are gathered in close quarters (like dorms or military barracks). Most food poisoning is not 
	contagious. You get it when you eat foods or drinks contaminated with 
	bacterium, viruses, or fungus, for example:
Raw meats
Seafood and sushi
Some mushrooms

 Raw meats Seafood and sushi Some mushrooms"
What is the difference between the causes of the stomach flu vs. food poisoning?,"  Viral gastroenteritis most often is caused by an infection with a virus. Rotavirus infection is the leading cause of diarrhea in children worldwide, and it also infects people in nursing homes. Another common virus type responsible for stomach flu is the noroviruses. Norovirus outbreaks have been reported in schools and on cruise ships. Other causes are adenoviruses and Astrovirus. There are many different causes of food poisoning (more than 200). Contamination can occur at many stages of food preparation such as harvesting, processing, storing, shipping, cooking, or serving. Contamination can occur when food handlers do not properly clean their hands before working with or serving food (an infection spread by the fecal-oral route). Often, Escherichia coli (I), Staphylococcus are the types of bacteria that lead to the contamination of the food. Other bacteria that cause food poisoning are Campylobacter,  Vibrio cholerae (that bacterium that causes cholera), Salmonella, Listeria, botulism, and Shigella. Some bacteria also produce toxins in the contaminated foods that cause the disease. You can get this disease when you consume undercooked or raw meats, but it also has been reported after eating:Raw and undercooked eggsUnpasteurized cheesesRaw fish or shellfishRaw sproutsUnpasteurized beverages Raw and undercooked eggs Unpasteurized cheeses Raw fish or shellfish Raw sprouts Unpasteurized beverages Drinking contaminated water with bacteria also can lead to this disease. Vegetables and fruits also can be the source of poisoning if they have been contaminated while handling."
"What is the difference between the signs and symptoms of the stomach flu vs. food poisoning, and when do they begin?","'Symptoms of viral gastroenteritis can begin anywhere from 4 to 48 hours (a half a day or two) after exposure to the virus.''The most common symptoms of this health condition include:''Other possible symptoms can include:''If the health condition persists, ''dehydration'' can result, leading to symptoms and signs such as:''Infants with ''dehydration'' may have:''Signs and symptoms of this type of poisoning are similar to those of the stomach flu; however, are often more severe. ''Food poisoning symptoms'' usually begin within an hour or 2, or up to 12 hours (1/2 day) of eating or drinking the contaminated food.''Symptoms include:''Vomiting blood'' or ''blood in the stool'' may occur in particularly severe cases. Similar to the stomach flu, ''symptoms of dehydration'' as mentioned previously can develop over time if the poisoning symptoms persist. If you are ''vomiting blood'' or have blood in your ''stool'' (''rectal bleeding'') see your medical doctor or health care professional immediately.' Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal (stomach) pain or cramping Fever Chills Sweating Joint or muscle aches Loss of appetite Weight loss Dizziness Decreased urine output Dry mouth Dark urine Excessive thirst Low blood pressure Dry diapers Sunken eyes and soft spots on the skull (fontanelles) Decreased tears when crying Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea (watery) Muscle aches and pains Fever Chills Stomach pain and cramping Fatigue A general sense of feeling unwell"
"What is the difference between how long the stomach flu vs. food poisoning 
recovery (how long does it last)?"," The duration of the stomach flu can vary. The symptoms may get better after a few days, but in some cases, a person may be sick with 
	the infection can last for several days, up to 10. Food poisoning symptoms usually last anywhere from several hours, a day or two, or up to a several days. The duration of this type of poisoning typically is shorter than the stomach flu."
How do you know if you have the stomach flu or food poisoning (tests and diagnosis)?," Specific tests for the stomach flu usually are not ordered, and the diagnosis is suggested by the signs and symptoms described to the doctor by the patient, for example, pain or cramping in the stomach, diarrhea, and fever. Stool samples can be sent for cultures or other tests to identify the exact organism that is causing the illness, but this usually is not done unless the patient has blood in his or her stool. If a patient is vomiting blood or has blood in the stool, he or she should contact a medical doctor or health care professional immediately. The diagnosis of food poisoning also usually 
is made by a doctor observing the patient for the typical signs and symptoms of this type of poisoning (for example, diarrhea, fever, and pain or cramping in the stomach), and specific tests are usually not ordered. The history of the disease is important, since multiple people who ate or drank the same foods or beverages may become ill. Stool cultures are one of the few ways to pinpoint the type of 
bacteria, virus, fungi, or prion that caused the poisoning."
"What natural, home remedies, foods, drinks, special diets, or medications relieve 
symptoms or cure these infections?","  Natural or home remedies for the stomach flu include steps to ensure that the patient is taking in enough fluid and electrolytes to replace what is lost through vomiting and diarrhea. Adults with 
	the infection can drink sports drinks, but these should not be used for a child or infant. There are special fluid and electrolyte solutions or ice pops for a child, toddler, or infant suffering from dehydration. It's important to drink lots of liquids in small amounts, and not force large amounts of fluid. Juices and colas are not recommended because the sugars they contain can be harsh on the stomach. Once you are able to eat, try to eat foods that are bland, and that are unlikely to be irritating to the stomach. Try foods such as:CerealsBreadPotatoesLean meatsPlain yogurtFresh apples, and bananas Cereals Bread Potatoes Lean meats Plain yogurt Fresh apples, and bananas Eating foods on the BRAT diet also are recommended if you are sick with the stomach flu because they also are easy on the stomach. Medical treatment or care by a doctor, and medications for the infection typically are not necessary. Most cases are due to viral infection, and antibiotics are not necessary. Certain infections with bacterium that may lead to stomach flu may require antibiotic treatment, but these are much less common than viral gastroenteritis. Treatment involves maintaining adequate fluid and electrolyte levels. In severe cases, the doctor or health care professional may order medical treatment of fluids and electrolytes to be administered through an IV, or intravenously (through a vein), at a medical clinic or emergency department. Natural or home remedies for relief of food poisoning are also related to the necessity to keep well hydrated by drinking lots of fluids. After symptoms start and you begin to feel sick, it can be helpful to let the stomach settle and not eat or drink for a few hours, unless you have severe vomiting or diarrhea. As previously 
	mentioned, sports drinks and pediatric hydration solutions can be used to replace lost fluid and electrolytes from diarrhea and vomiting. Some people may find it helpful to suck on ice chips or take small sips of water to rehydrate and avoid further stomach pain or cramping. When experiencing food poisoning, the best plan is to slowly start by eating and drinking bland and easy-to-digest foods (the BRAT diet) that are easy on the stomach when you feel ready to begin eating again. Examples include:ToastSoda crackersGelatinRiceBananas.Avoid high-fat or spicy foods Toast Soda crackers Gelatin Rice Bananas. Avoid high-fat or spicy foods There are no medications or medical treatment recommended for the 
	poisoning. Severe dehydration may require IV and electrolyte replacement, as mentioned previously."
How can I prevent from getting the stomach flu or food poisoning?," The best way to prevent getting this 
type of ""flu"" is to avoid contact with anyone suffering from the disease (or 
any other type of flu or contagious illness).  Wash your hands frequently if you have been around 
a person who is sick.  A vaccine is available against 
rotavirus, one of the most common causes of this type of ""flu."" Prevention of food poisoning involves careful attention to food storage and 
preparation. While it is not completely possible to prevent poisoning from 
	contaminated food that was later sold, there are steps you can take to 
	prevent food poisoning at home.
Keep the kitchen and your food prep 
area and kitchen tools clean.

How can I prevent stomach pain?,"'Dietary changes''Self-medication/self-help under your doctor’s advice' Avoid specific dietary items that your stomach doesn’t tolerate including dairy products (lactose), wheat, beans and carbohydrates. Fiber in the diet should be increased if you have constipation. Ingesting probiotics (good bacteria) can be beneficial for your gut in relieving your irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. Take over-the-counter medications for diarrhea, gaseous distention and constipation where appropriate. Take antacids and drugs that prolong acid production (proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]) .  These are probably inappropriate for treating abdominal cramping and pain. Laxatives may cause cramps, but they can reduce pain if you have more severe constipation."
What is a peptic ulcer?,"'A peptic ulcer (stomach or duodenal) is a break in the inner lining of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. A peptic ulcer of the stomach is called a gastric ulcer; of the duodenum, a duodenal ulcer; and of the esophagus, an esophageal ulcer. Peptic ulcers occur when the lining these organs is eroded by the acidic digestive (peptic) juices that the cells of the lining secrete of the stomach secrete. A peptic ulcer differs from an erosion because it extends deeper into the lining and incites more of an inflammatory reaction from the tissues that are involved, occasionally with scaring. Peptic ulcer also is referred to as peptic ulcer disease.''Peptic ulcer disease is common, affecting millions of Americans yearly. Moreover, peptic ulcers are a recurrent problem; even healed ulcers can recur unless treatment is directed at preventing their recurrence. The medical cost of treating peptic ulcer and its complications runs into billions of dollars annually. Recent medical advances have increased our understanding of ulcer formation. Improved and expanded treatment options now are available.' "
Are peptic ulcers painful?,'The pain of ulcer disease correlates poorly with the presence or severity of active ulceration. Some individuals have persistent pain even after an ulcer is almost completely healed by medication. Others experience no pain at all. Ulcers often come and go spontaneously without the individual ever knowing that they are present unless a serious complication (like bleeding or perforation) occurs.' 
What are the early signs and symptoms of peptic ulcers?,"'Symptoms and signs of\xa0peptic (esophageal, duodenal, or stomach) ulcers disease vary. Some people with stomach ulcers do not have any symptoms or signs while others may have a few or several.''The most common symptom\xa0of a peptic ulcer is a dull or burning pain in the stomach. The pain may be felt anywhere between your ''belly button'' and breastbone. Pain from a peptic or stomach ulcer;''Peptic ulcer other symptoms and signs that are less common include;''Even if your symptoms are mild, you may have a peptic ulcer. You should see your doctor to talk about your symptoms. Without treatment, your peptic ulcer can get worse.'   usually happens when your stomach is empty, for example, such as between meals or during the night; may stop briefly if you eat or take antacids; may last for minutes to hours; may come and go for several days, weeks, or months bloating, burping, feeling sick to your stomach, poor appetite, vomiting, and weight loss."
What causes peptic ulcers?,"'For many years, excess acid was believed to be the major cause of ulcer disease. Accordingly, the emphasis of treatment was on neutralizing and inhibiting the secretion of stomach acid. While acid is still considered necessary for the formation of ulcers and its suppression is still the primary treatment, the two most important initiating causes of ulcers are infection of the stomach by a bacterium named ""''Helicobacter pylori''"" (''H. pylori'') and chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or NSAIDs, including ''aspirin''. ''Cigarette smoking'' also is an important cause of ulcers as well as failure of ulcer healing.''Infection with ''H. pylori'' is very common, affecting more than a billion people worldwide. It is estimated that half of the United States population older than age 60 has been infected with ''H. pylori''. Infection usually persists for many years, leading to ulcer disease in 10% to 15% of those infected. In the past, ''H. pylori'' was found in more than 80% of patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers. With increasing appreciation, diagnosis and treatment of this infection, the prevalence of infection with ''H. pylori'' as well as the proportion of ulcers caused by the bacterium has decreased. It is estimated that currently only 20% of ulcers are associated with the bacterium. While the mechanism by which ''H. pylori'' causes ulcers is complex, elimination of the bacterium by antibiotics has clearly been shown to heal ulcers and prevent their recurrence.''NSAIDs are medications used for the treatment of ''arthritis'' and other painful inflammatory conditions in the body. Aspirin, ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'', ''Naprosyn''), and ''etodolac'' (Lodine) are a few examples of this class of medications. Prostaglandins are substances produced by the body, which are important in helping the linings of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to resist damage by the acidic digestive juices of the stomach. NSAIDs cause ulcers by interfering with the production of prostaglandins in the stomach.''Cigarette smoking'' not only causes ulcers, but it also increases the risk of complications from ulcers such as bleeding, obstruction, and perforation. ''Cigarette smoking'' also is a leading cause of failure of treatment for ulcers.''Contrary to popular belief, ''alcohol'', coffee, colas, spicy foods, and ''caffeine'' have no proven role in ulcer formation. Similarly, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that life stresses or personality types contribute to ulcer disease.'  "
What procedures and tests diagnose peptic ulcers?,"'The diagnosis of an ulcer is made by either a barium upper gastrointestinal X-ray (upper GI series) or an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (''EGD'' or ''esophagogastroduodenoscopy''). The barium upper gastrointestinal (GI) X-ray is easy to perform and involves no risk (other than exposure to ''radiation'') or discomfort. Barium is a chalky substance that is swallowed. It is visible on X- rays\xa0and allows the outline of the stomach to be seen on ''X-rays''; however, barium X-rays are less accurate and may miss ulcers up to 20% of the time.''An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is more accurate than X-rays, but usually involves sedation of the patient and the insertion of a flexible tube through the mouth to inspect the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. ''Upper endoscopy'' has the added advantage of having the capability of removing small tissue samples (biopsies) to test for ''H. pylori'' infection. Biopsies are also examined under a microscope to exclude a cancerous ulcer. While virtually all duodenal ulcers are benign, gastric ulcers can occasionally be cancerous. Therefore, biopsies often are performed on gastric ulcers to exclude ''cancer''.' "
Is there a diet for peptic ulcers? Can you drink alcohol?,"'There is no conclusive evidence that dietary restrictions and bland diets play a role in ulcer healing. No proven relationship exists between peptic ulcer disease and the intake of coffee and alcohol. However, since coffee stimulates gastric acid secretion, and alcohol can cause ''gastritis'', moderation in alcohol and coffee consumption is recommended.' "
What is the treatment for peptic ulcers?,"'The goal of ulcer treatment is to relieve pain, heal the ulcer, and prevent complications. The first step in treatment involves the reduction of risk factors (NSAIDs and cigarettes). The next step is medications.''Many people harbor ''H. pylori ''in their stomachs without ever having pain or ulcers. It is not completely clear whether these patients should be treated with antibiotics. More studies are needed to answer this question.''Eradication of ''H. pylori'' prevents the return of ulcers (a major problem with all other ulcer treatment options). Elimination of this bacteria also may decrease the risk of developing ''gastric cancer'' in the future.''Treatment with antibiotics carries the risk of ''allergic'' reactions, ''diarrhea'', and sometimes severe antibiotic-induced ''colitis'' (inflammation of the colon).'   Patients with documented ulcer disease and H. pylori infection should be treated for both the ulcer and the H. pylori. H. pylori can be very difficult to completely eradicate. Treatment for peptic ulcers requires a combination of several antibiotics, sometimes in combination with a proton-pump inhibitor, H2 blockers, or Pepto-Bismol. Commonly used antibiotics are;tetracycline,amoxicillin,metronidazole (Flagyl),clarithromycin (Biaxin), andlevofloxacin (Levaquin). tetracycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole (Flagyl), clarithromycin (Biaxin), and levofloxacin (Levaquin)."
Antacids and H2 blockers,"'Antacids neutralize existing acid in the stomach. Antacids such as ''Maalox'', ''Mylanta'', and ''Amphojel'' are safe and effective treatments. However, the neutralizing action of these agents is short-lived, and frequent dosing is required. Magnesium containing antacids, such as Maalox and Mylanta, can cause ''diarrhea'', while aluminum containing agents like Amphojel can cause ''constipation''. Ulcers frequently return when antacids are discontinued.''Studies have shown that a protein released in the stomach called histamine stimulates gastric acid secretion. Histamine antagonists (H2 blockers) are drugs designed to block the action of histamine on gastric cells and reduce the production of acid. Examples of H2 blockers are ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet''), ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac''), ''nizatidine'' (''Axid''), and ''famotidine'' (''Pepcid''). While H2 blockers are effective in ulcer healing, they have a limited role in eradicating H. pylori without antibiotics. Therefore, ulcers frequently return when H2 blockers are stopped.''Generally, H2 blockers are well tolerated and have few side effects even with long-term use. In rare instances, patients report ''headache'', ''confusion'', lethargy, or ''hallucinations''. Chronic use of cimetidine may rarely cause ''impotence'' or ''breast swelling'"". Both cimetidine and ranitidine can interfere with the body's ability to handle alcohol. Patients on these drugs who drink alcohol may have elevated blood alcohol levels. These drugs also may interfere with the ""'liver'""'s handling of other medications like ""'phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''), ''warfarin'' (''Jantoven'', ''Coumadin''), and ''theophylline''. Frequent monitoring and adjustments of the dosages of these medications may be needed.' "
"Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), Carafate, and Cytotec","'Proton-pump inhibitors such as ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''), ''pantoprazole'' (''Protonix''), ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium''), and ''rabeprazole'' (''Aciphex'') are more potent than H2 blockers in suppressing acid secretion. The different proton-pump inhibitors are very similar in action and there is no evidence that one is more effective than the other in healing ulcers. While proton-pump inhibitors are comparable to H2 blockers in effectiveness in treating gastric and duodenal ulcers, they are superior to H2 blockers in treating esophageal ulcers. Esophageal ulcers are more sensitive than gastric and duodenal ulcers to minute amounts of acid. Therefore, more complete acid suppression accomplished by proton-pump inhibitors is important for esophageal ulcer healing.''Proton-pump inhibitors are well tolerated. Side effects are uncommon; they include ''headache'', ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'', ''nausea'' and ''rash'"". Interestingly, proton-pump inhibitors do not have any effect on a person's ability to digest and absorb nutrients. Proton-pump inhibitors have also been found to be safe when used long term, without serious adverse health effects. Although they may promote loss of bone (""'osteoporosis'') and low magnesium levels, both\xa0side effects are easily identified and treated.''Sucralfate'' (''Carafate'') and ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec'') are agents that strengthen the gut lining against attacks by acidic digestive juices. Sucralfate coats the ulcer surface and promotes healing. Sucralfate has very few side effects. The most common side effect is ''constipation'' and the interference with the absorption of other medications. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin-like substance commonly used to counteract the ulcerogenic effects of NSAIDs. Studies suggest that misoprostol may protect the stomach from ulceration among people who take NSAIDs chronically. Diarrhea is a common side effect. Misoprostol can cause miscarriages when given to ''pregnant'' women\xa0and should be avoided by women of childbearing age.' "
What are the complications of peptic ulcers?,"'With modern treatment, people with ulcer disease can lead normal lives without lifestyle changes or dietary restrictions. ''Cigarette'' ''smokers'' have been found to have more complications from ulcers and treatment failure.''Eradication of the bacteria ''H. pylori ''not only heals ulcers but also prevents the recurrence of ulcer disease.''Patients with ulcers generally function quite comfortably.''Some ulcers probably heal even without medications (though they probably recur as well). Therefore, the major problems resulting from ulcers are related to ulcer complications. Complications include;''Patients with bleeding ulcers may report;''Patients with persistent or severe bleeding may require blood transfusions. An endoscopy is performed to establish the site of bleeding and to stop active ulcer bleeding with the aid of specialized endoscopic instruments.''Perforation ''through the stomach leads to the leakage of stomach contents into the abdominal (peritoneal) ''cavity'', resulting in acute ''peritonitis'' (infection of the abdominal ''cavity''). These patients report a sudden onset of extreme ''abdominal pain'', which is worsened by any type of motion. Abdominal muscles become rigid and board-like. ''Urgent surgery usually is required.'' A duodenal ulcer that has perforated can burrow into adjacent organs such as the pancreas or behind the abdomen and into the back. An esophageal ulcer that perforates can cause severe inflammation of the tissues that surround it (mediastinitis).''Duodenum -\xa0''A\xa0peptic ulcer that forms in the narrow outlet from the stomach, it can obstruct the flow of stomach contents into the duodenum. Duodenal ulcers sometimes also may obstruct the flow of intestinal contents.\xa0''Patients with obstruction often report;''The obstruction usually occurs at or near the pylorus of the stomach. Endoscopy is useful in establishing the diagnosis of obstruction from an ulcer and excluding gastric ''cancer'' as the cause of the obstruction. In some patients, gastric obstruction can be relieved by suction of the stomach contents with a tube for 72 hours, along with intravenous anti-ulcer medications, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac).''Patients with persistent obstruction require surgery.'   bleeding, perforation, and obstruction of emptying of the passage of food. passage of black tarry stools (melena), weakness, a sense of light-headedness or ay even pass out upon standing (orthostatic hypotension or syncope), and vomiting blood (hematemesis).

What is the prognosis for a person with peptic ulcer disease? Can it be cured?,"'With modern treatment, people with ulcer disease can lead normal lives without lifestyle changes or dietary restrictions. Cigarette smokers have been found to have more complications from ulcers and treatment failure. Eradication of the bacteria ''H. pylori'' not only heals ulcers but also prevents the recurrence of ulcer disease.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat peptic ulcers?,"'Doctors who commonly treat peptic ulcer disease include primary care providers, such as general medicine physicians, family medicine doctors, and internists. Specialists in the diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease are gastroenterologists.' "
What is a stool acidity test?,"'The ''stool'' acidity test is a test for diagnosing intolerance to lactose, the ''sugar'' contained in milk, in infants and very young children.'  "
What is lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose intolerance'' is the inability to digest the lactose ''sugar'' in milk. Milk containing the sugar lactose is a main source of ''nutrition'' for infants and young children. With normal lactose tolerance, all of the lactose is digested (broken down into two smaller sugars) and absorbed in the small intestine so that none reaches the colon. ''On the other hand, in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose, the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon. The bacteria produce chemicals that cause ''diarrhea'' and also produce ''gas''. Some of the chemicals produced by bacteria include lactic and other acids that turn the ''stool'' acidic. '""Individuals with intolerance to lactose cannot drink regular cow's milk without developing ""'diarrhea'', gas, and often ''abdominal pain''. They instead must drink substitutes like rice or ''soy'"" milk or treat cow's milk with an enzyme that digests the lactose (Lactaid) so that the smaller sugars can be absorbed in the small intestine."" "
How does the stool acidity test work?,"'During the stool acidity test, infants and very young children are given lactose to drink. With normal tolerance to lactose, all of the lactose is digested and absorbed in the small intestine. In individuals who are lactose intolerant, some or all of the lactose is not digested and absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon. Through the action of the colonic bacteria, the stool becomes acidic. The acidity of stools that are passed after ingestion of the lactose then is measured. If the stool becomes acidic, the individual is intolerant of lactose.' "
How does testing for lactose intolerance differ in adults?,"'Lactose intolerance in older children and adults can be detected by using the ''lactose tolerance test'' or the lactose ''hydrogen breath test''. ' The lactose tolerance and lactose hydrogen breath tests are not given to infants and very young children who are suspected of having lactose intolerance because they require cooperation for either multiple samplings of blood or breath, which can be difficult if the infant or child is not cooperative.  The dose of lactose that is needed for the lactose tolerance and hydrogen breath tests also may present problems for infants and very young children since if they are intolerant of lactose, they may develop diarrhea and become dehydrated.  Nevertheless, special masks have been developed for infants and very young children that can make the sampling of breath for the lactose hydrogen breath test easier to perform."
What is a fecal occult blood test?,"'Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is testing that is performed on samples of ''stool'' in order to detect occult blood (blood that is not visible to the naked eye) in otherwise normal-colored ''stool''. Fecal occult blood usually is a result of slow (often intermittent) bleeding from inside the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. The slow bleed does not change the color of the stool or result in visible bright red blood. Therefore, the blood is found only by testing the stool for blood in the laboratory. Occult bleeding has many of the same causes as other forms of more rapid gastrointestinal bleeding, such as ''rectal bleeding'' (passage of red blood and/or ''blood clots'' rectally) and melena (black tarry stool as a result of bleeding from the upper ''intestines'' such as ulcers). Please read the ''Rectal Bleeding'' article for a more detailed explanation of different patterns of gastrointestinal bleeding. ' "
Why is fecal occult blood testing done?,"'A fecal occult blood test is done primarily to detect\xa0''colon cancer'' in people without intestinal symptoms. ''Cancers'' of the colon are common and frequently produce fecal occult blood long before they cause other symptoms such as ''abdominal pain'', rectal bleeding, or changes in bowel habits. In addition, some precursors of colon ''cancer'', specifically, some types of ''colon polyps'', also may bleed slowly and cause fecal occult blood. By finding the cancers early through fecal occult blood testing when the cancers are small and before they ''metastasize'' (spread to distant organs), patients may be cured of their cancers by removing them surgically. By removing ''precancerous'' polyps that are found through fecal occult blood testing, ''cancer'' may be prevented.'  "
How is a fecal blood test performed?,"'For fecal occult blood testing, several (usually three) samples of stool are collected for testing.  The reason for testing multiple samples is that bleeding from cancers and polyps often is intermittent and only one of the samples may show blood.''There are two types of fecal occult blood testing, 1) chemical and 2) immunologic.'  Chemical testing: For chemical testing, a solution containing the chemical guaiac and an oxidizing chemical is used.  If blood is present in the sample of stool, the mixing of the solution with blood causes the guaiac to turn visibly blue.  The blue color is caused by the interaction (promoted by the oxidizing agent) of the heme portion of the hemoglobin molecule, the oxygen carrying molecule in red blood cells, and the guaiac. Immunologic testing: For immunologic testing, a sample of stool is mixed with a solution that contains an antibody to globin, the protein part of the hemoglobin molecule.   The antibody is combined with a small amount of gold.  When the antibody/gold complex binds to the globin in stool, the antibody/gold/globin complex settles out of the solution as a visible line on the test strip."
How do the results of chemical fecal occult blood testing compare with immunologic fecal occult blood testing?,"'A chemical fecal occult blood test is inexpensive and easy, but it has several disadvantages.''The immunologic fecal occult blood test has additional advantages over the chemical fecal occult blood test.  First, it is more sensitive for blood.  This means that given the same amount of ''blood in the stool'', the immunologic fecal occult blood test will more frequently be abnormal.  In other words, it will more frequently detect cancers and precancerous polyps.  Second, it is more specific for blood.  That is, there will be fewer abnormal tests due to interfering substances in the ''diet'', and as a result, an abnormal immunologic fecal occult blood test will more commonly be due to ''cancer'' or a precancerous polyp.  As a result, less follow-up testing (for example, ''colonoscopy'') will be necessary to pursue a falsely abnormal fecal occult blood test.'  Substances in fruits and vegetables can mimic heme and cause chemical fecal occult blood tests to be falsely positive, that is, falsely abnormal.  Therefore, it is necessary to restrict certain fruits and vegetables before and during the collection of stool samples. Unlike heme which can travel intact from the stomach or small intestine and into the stool, globin is destroyed in the small intestine.  As a result, a positive chemical fecal occult blood test can be caused by bleeding anywhere in the stomach or intestines, but a positive immunologic fecal occult blood test only occurs when there is bleeding into the colon.  Therefore, it is necessary to restrict red meat containing hemoglobin before and during the collection of stool samples or the heme from the ingested meat will cause a falsely positive test. Some drugs commonly cause small amounts of bleeding into the stomach or small intestine.  Moreover, vitamin C and a few other drugs can cause an abnormal chemical fecal occult blood tests.  Therefore, these drugs must be stopped before and during the collection of samples."
How effective are fecal occult blood tests?,"'The true bottom line for a fecal occult blood test is how many cancers or precancerous polyps can be detected and, ultimately, how many cancer-related deaths can be prevented by fecal occult blood tests.  Large studies with chemical fecal occult blood tests have demonstrated at least a 15%-20% reduction in mortality due to colon cancer.  Similar studies are now underway with immunologic fecal occult blood tests, and, based on factors discussed previously, the results are expected to be better.  Nevertheless, the results of these ongoing studies are necessary to demonstrate what the bottom line truly is for immunologic fecal occult blood tests. ' "
How should fecal occult blood tests be used?,"'Fecal occult blood tests offer an important screening modality for colon cancer, but, because it detects only a minority of cancers and precancerous polyps, by itself it is not sufficient.  It needs to be complemented by endoscopic examination of the colon, either ''sigmoidoscopy'' and/or colonoscopy.  ''Recommendations for the age at which fecal occult blood tests and endoscopic examinations should be initiated, and the frequency with which they should be repeated depend on the risk for colon cancer.  Patients who are older, have relatives with colon cancer, have had polyps previously, or have diseases that are associated with a higher risk for colon cancer may have testing that begins earlier and is done more frequently.  '""The use of fecal occult blood tests has only one downside. Tests can be falsely positive, that is, tests that show blood in patients who don't have colon cancer or ""'premalignant'' polyps.  Every test showing blood requires the performance of colonoscopy, an expensive procedure that carries a small but definite risk of serious complications.  The more frequently tests are falsely positive, the more frequently unnecessary colonoscopies are performed.  If studies underway (discussed previously) demonstrate an increased ability to diagnose cancer and colon polyps with a reduced frequency of these falsely positive tests, there will be clear advantages for immunologic over chemical fecal occult blood tests. ''For this reason, immunologic fecal occult blood tests have advantages over chemical fecal occult blood tests since it has fewer false positive tests.''It is important to remember that having occult blood in the stool does not automatically imply that one has colon cancer or a polyp. There are many causes of occult  blood in the stomach, small intestine, or colon, most of which are benign. Some examples include bleeding from use of ''aspirin'' or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, ''ibuprofen''), ulcers, ''esophagitis'', ''colitis'', and intestinal angiodysplasias (weakened clusters of blood vessels on the surface of intestinal linings). Therefore, patients with stools containing occult blood should be evaluated by physicians to exclude cancers and polyps, as well as to identify other causes of intestinal bleeding.' "
What are symptoms of stool color changes?,"'Changes in stool color alone do not cause symptoms. The underlying cause of the change in stool color, texture, or form is responsible for any symptoms. '  "
"What does it mean when your stool color changes in color, texture, or form?","'Bowel movements are usually light to dark brown in color, and there is moderate variation among individuals with respect to stool color, quantity, and form. When these changes in stool do occur, it can mean that there may be an illness affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or the entire body.' "
What is the color of normal stool?,"'Stool (feces, poop) color is most commonly brown. When stool color changes, a person, parent, or ''caregiver'' often becomes concerned. The presence of the ''bilirubin'' in the bile (a breakdown product of the ''hemoglobin'' in ''red blood cells'' that are normally destroyed after a useful life of several weeks) is generally responsible for stool color. Bilirubin concentration can vary the color of stool from light yellow to almost black. Changes in the chemical structure of the bilirubin can cause stool to turn green or yellow. ''Yellow stool'' also may occur if stool is dilute or there is a reduction in the amount of bilirubin that is produced by the liver. Bacteria and ''digestive enzymes'' in the intestine can act on the bilirubin and change its color. Most stool-to-stool changes in color have little meaning. However, some changes, particularly if the changes are consistent over time and not present in only one stool may mean something needs to be investigated.' "

Green stools,"'If stool passes through the intestine too quickly, there might not be enough time for bile to be digested and broken down to provide the normal brownish stool color. Normally, bacteria in the intestine chemically change bile to a greenish-brown color. It takes time for the bile to be fully changed in the intestine and become brown again, and if the transit time is short, for example, when a person has diarrhea, the stool remains green colored.''Green stools may be a normal variant. A ''diet'' rich in green vegetables, especially spinach, or ''Iron supplements'' also may cause green poop, though iron often turns stool black.' "
"Yellow, greasy, and foul smelling stool","""There are a variety of reasons why stool will be yellow, greasy, and foul smelling. It can be due to the intestine's inability to digest and absorb fat because of diseases of the intestinal lining (such as in ""'celiac disease'' and ''cystic fibrosis'') because the pancreas is unable to manufacture adequate digestive enzymes (such as with ''chronic pancreatitis'' or ''pancreatic cancer'' that blocks the pancreatic duct, or there is not enough bile being delivered to the intestine (such as in ''cancer of the liver'' or bile ducts that are blocked). The yellowness, greasiness, and foul smell is due to the undigested fat.' "
Bright red stools," The most common cause of bright red-colored stool in adults is bleeding from hemorrhoids. In infants, the most common cause is an anal fissure or tear in the tissue surrounding the anus. Other causes for bright red blood in the stool may be more serious such as: Infections of the intestines Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) Diverticular bleeding Tumors Arteriovenous malformations (abnormal communications between arteries and veins in the wall of the intestine that rupture). Brisk bleeding from the an ulcer in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum also may cause stools to be red instead of black if there has not been enough time for the red blood cells to be digested. Red food coloring and beets can also give a reddish hue to the stool."
Black tarry stools,"'Black stools are a worrisome symptom because it may be due to a large amount of bleeding into the ''digestive system'', most often from the upper GI tract including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Red blood cells are broken down by digestive enzymes in the intestine and turn the stool black. These stools tend to be tar-like (sticky) and foul smelling. ''This can be a medical emergency; black ''tarry stools'' should not be ignored.''Blood from ''nosebleeds'' or from dental procedures or mouth injuries can be swallowed and may be the cause of ''black stool'', but the amount of bleeding usually is not substantial enough to do this.' "
Clay-colored or white stools (pale stools),'Light-colored or clay-colored stool are often seen with diseases of the liver or bile ducts. Pale stool may be caused by ''pancreatic cancer'' that blocks the bile ducts. Lack of bile causes stool to lose its brown color and leaves it appearing pale.' 
Maroon stools,"'Maroon colored stools are often due to bleeding in the GI tract. The source of bleeding for red stools is the upper GI tract (esophagus, stomach, duodenum), while the colon is the source for bright red blood. Maroon stools, which is caused by partial ''digestion'' of the blood in the intestine often arises from the small intestine (jejunum, ileum) and proximal colon, but the color also depends in part on how rapidly the blood travels through the intestines. The faster the stool moves through the GI tract, the brighter red the color. This can be an emergency.''In children with ''intussusception'', where one portion or the intestine telescopes into another part, causing a temporary obstruction, stools may be described as currant jelly in color and consistency.' "
Mucus in the stool,"'Mucus'' in the stool may be normal, and it may cover segments of formed feces. However, it also can occur in people with ''inflammatory bowel disease'' or ''cancer''. Mucus associated with blood and/or ''abdominal pain'' should not be ignored and requires medical attention. People with ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') also can have mucus in the stool.' "
Drugs that change stool color,"'The most common medications that change the color of stool are the ''drugs'' that turn the stool black and include iron and bismuth (contained in Pepto-Bismol and ''Kaopectate''). Nevertheless, a large number of other drugs have been associated with changes in the color of stool to black or other colors. Practically, the importance of this fact is that the any new drugs or ''dietary supplements'' need to be considered as the cause of any change in stool color.' "
Stool that floats,"'Most stool floats because it contains an excessive amount of ''gas''. By itself, it is normal and has little meaning. Changes in diet can lead to stool that floats, but as an isolated symptom, no action needs to be taken, and often it resolves spontaneously. Stool does not float because of an increased amount of fat. (Fat in stool causes oil droplets in the toilet bowl.)''Any condition that causes increased amounts of gas to form in the intestines theoretically may lead to floating stool, especially in conditions where there is malabsorption of nutrients such as with ''lactose intolerance'', ''celiac disease'', cystic fibrosis, and short bowel syndrome.' "
Changes in the size and shape of stool,"'People have their own size, shape, and stool consistency. It is the change in stool pattern that matters more than the absolute size and shape of stool. Narrow stool, sometimes called pencil-thin, may occur occasionally and is of no concern. People with ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') may develop thinner stools.''Nevertheless, a person with ""normal"" stools that has a new change in the diameter, length, width (caliber) of the bowel movement should consult his/her health care professional. This may be a sign of a narrowed or scarred colon, perhaps due to a ''tumor'', but the health care professional may want further information about accompanying symptoms or tests.''It is not unusual to have two or even three stools in a morning. The first stool will usually have a more solid form because it has been in the colon (where water is absorbed) the longest. The second stool will be looser, and if there is a third stool, it will the loosest. Another change in stool form that often requires evaluation is the development of looser or firmer than normal stools. At one end of the spectrum is ''constipation'' and at the other end is diarrhea, but even if the change does not reach these levels, consistent, milder changes in either direction need to be evaluated.'  "
Which type of doctors treat stool color changes?,"'Most often, people will contact their primary care health care professional with questions about the color of their stool. These include health care professionals who care for infants and children. Depending upon the cause of the stool color change, certain specialists may need to be involved. For example, for red or black stool due to bleeding, a ''gastroenterologist'"" may be needed to perform endoscopy, to look for a bleeding source in the stomach or intestine. Gastroenterologists are the specialist that helps manage other diseases of the intestinal tract, including Crohn's disease, ""'pancreatitis'', and ''celiac disease'', that can cause color changes because of poor absorption of nutrients from the diet.' "
How is the cause of stool color changes diagnosed?,"'In most cases, a diagnosis, if any, cannot be made by stool color alone.''The patient and the doctor need to consider other symptoms, past medical history, dietary changes, and medications to help decide what has caused the stool to change color. Physical examination will be important to help decide the significance of the stool color.''Stool may be tested to look for blood, fat, or infection. Blood tests may be necessary depending upon the clinical situation. Depending on the change in color, it may be necessary to evaluate the pancreas, liver or GI tract.'

The second stool will be looser, and if there is a third stool, it will the loosest. Another change in stool form that often requires evaluation is the development of looser or firmer than normal stools. At one end of the spectrum is ''constipation'' and at the other end is diarrhea, but even if the change does not reach these levels, consistent, milder changes in either direction need to be evaluated.'  "
Which type of doctors treat stool color changes?,"'Most often, people will contact their primary care health care professional with questions about the color of their stool. These include health care professionals who care for infants and children. Depending upon the cause of the stool color change, certain specialists may need to be involved. For example, for red or black stool due to bleeding, a ''gastroenterologist'"" may be needed to perform endoscopy, to look for a bleeding source in the stomach or intestine. Gastroenterologists are the specialist that helps manage other diseases of the intestinal tract, including Crohn's disease, ""'pancreatitis'', and ''celiac disease'', that can cause color changes because of poor absorption of nutrients from the diet.' "
How is the cause of stool color changes diagnosed?,"'In most cases, a diagnosis, if any, cannot be made by stool color alone.''The patient and the doctor need to consider other symptoms, past medical history, dietary changes, and medications to help decide what has caused the stool to change color. Physical examination will be important to help decide the significance of the stool color.''Stool may be tested to look for blood, fat, or infection. Blood tests may be necessary depending upon the clinical situation. Depending on the change in color, it may be necessary to evaluate the pancreas, liver or GI tract.'

When should I contact my doctor about stool color or texture changes?,"'Aside from black, red, or maroon stools that may mean bleeding is a possibility, and require urgent assessment and treatment, most color changes are not an emergency. The significance is determined based on other symptoms that might be present.''Women who are ''pregnant'' often note changes in their bowel pattern. Stool can turn black because of iron and vitamin ''supplements''. Iron can also turn stool greenish. As the uterus enlarges and increases pressure within the pelvis, ''constipation'' may occur and ''hemorrhoids'' can develop and cause blood in the stool.''If there is no underlying problem, stool color changes are often due to changes in the diet and will resolve in a couple of days. If this is not the case and changes persist, it is appropriate to contact your health care professional and seek medical attention.''Contact your doctor if you have stool color changes and have associated symptoms such as ''vomiting'', diarrhea, ''fever'', or ''abdominal pain''.''It is important to remember that every person is different and changes in bowel habit be it color, size, frequency, or consistency (hard or soft) may be normal for one person or a sign of a potential problem for another.'

What is a stool acidity test?,"'The ''stool'' acidity test is a test for diagnosing intolerance to lactose, the ''sugar'' contained in milk, in infants and very young children.'  "
What is lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose intolerance'' is the inability to digest the lactose ''sugar'' in milk. Milk containing the sugar lactose is a main source of ''nutrition'' for infants and young children. With normal lactose tolerance, all of the lactose is digested (broken down into two smaller sugars) and absorbed in the small intestine so that none reaches the colon. ''On the other hand, in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose, the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon. The bacteria produce chemicals that cause ''diarrhea'' and also produce ''gas''. Some of the chemicals produced by bacteria include lactic and other acids that turn the ''stool'' acidic. '""Individuals with intolerance to lactose cannot drink regular cow's milk without developing ""'diarrhea'', gas, and often ''abdominal pain''. They instead must drink substitutes like rice or ''soy'"" milk or treat cow's milk with an enzyme that digests the lactose (Lactaid) so that the smaller sugars can be absorbed in the small intestine."" "
How does the stool acidity test work?,"'During the stool acidity test, infants and very young children are given lactose to drink. With normal tolerance to lactose, all of the lactose is digested and absorbed in the small intestine. In individuals who are lactose intolerant, some or all of the lactose is not digested and absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon. Through the action of the colonic bacteria, the stool becomes acidic. The acidity of stools that are passed after ingestion of the lactose then is measured. If the stool becomes acidic, the individual is intolerant of lactose.' "
How does testing for lactose intolerance differ in adults?,"'Lactose intolerance in older children and adults can be detected by using the ''lactose tolerance test'' or the lactose ''hydrogen breath test''. ' The lactose tolerance and lactose hydrogen breath tests are not given to infants and very young children who are suspected of having lactose intolerance because they require cooperation for either multiple samplings of blood or breath, which can be difficult if the infant or child is not cooperative.  The dose of lactose that is needed for the lactose tolerance and hydrogen breath tests also may present problems for infants and very young children since if they are intolerant of lactose, they may develop diarrhea and become dehydrated.  Nevertheless, special masks have been developed for infants and very young children that can make the sampling of breath for the lactose hydrogen breath test easier to perform."
Introduction to Strabismus,"'Strabismus'', also known as ''crossed eyes'"", is a condition in which the eyes don't look towards an object together. One of the eyes may look in or out, or turn up or down. The eye turning can occur all of the time or only sometimes, such as during stressful situations or illness."" "
What Causes Strabismus?,"'Some people are born with eyes that do not align in the usual way. This is called congenital ''strabismus''. In many children, there is no clear cause of strabismus. In some cases, it is a result of a problem with the nervous system, especially the part that controls the muscles of the eyes. If it is not corrected, strabismus can continue into the adult years. Most adults who have strabismus were born with it.''If strabismus does not appear until later in life, it will cause ''double vision''. If the eyes become misaligned in an adult who did not have strabismus as a child, it could be a sign of a serious condition such as a ''stroke''. A sudden, misalignment of the eyes or ''double vision'' are important reasons to see a doctor immediately.''Someone who is born with strabismus will see without having double vision. There might be other effects on vision, however. Because the two eyes are not working well together, depth perception and peripheral vision (vision off to the side) will not be very good. Eyestrain and ''headaches'' can occur frequently. It might also be necessary to turn the head in unusual ways in order to see in certain directions.'  "
How Is Strabismus Treated?,"""A doctor may recommend that patients go through physical therapy to help strengthen their eye muscles. Vision therapy is also used to help a person correct their vision when suffering with strabismus. This therapy helps train a patient's brain to be able to align their eyes and focus and visually process images. Vision therapy uses computerized optical devises, including lenses and filters, to develop the eye muscles.""  "
Is Surgery an Option to Treat Strabismus?,"'Yes. Surgery to correct strabismus is performed to strengthen or weaken the effect of one or more of the muscles that move the eye. When this procedure is performed on adults, it is usually done under local anesthesia. (The eye is numb, but the patient is awake.)''The surgeon will first make an opening into the outer layer of the eyeball. This allows the surgeon to reach the muscle that will be strengthened or weakened.''Strengthening the muscle means removing a small section from one end and then stitching it back together. This makes the muscle shorter, which tends to turn the eye toward the side of that muscle.''""Weakening"" the muscle means making a cut across one end, but not removing any of the muscle to shorten it. Instead, a gap is left where the muscle was cut, and the ends of the muscle are tied back together with a suture (thread). This has the effect of making the muscle longer, which lets the eye turn further away from the side of that muscle.''At the end of the procedure, the surgeon will close the opening in the eye with ''stitches''. The patient will often have double vision for a few weeks after surgery. This goes away as the brain adjusts to the new way of seeing.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.'  "
Introduction,"'Botox'' is a brand name of a toxin produced by the bacterium ''Clostridium botulinum''. There are other brand names for ''botulinum'', such as Xeomin. In large amounts, this toxin can cause ''botulism'', which you probably associate with ''food poisoning''. Despite the fact that one of the most serious complications of ''botulism'' is ''paralysis'', scientists have discovered a way to use it to human advantage. Small, diluted amounts can be directly injected into specific muscles causing controlled weakening of the muscles. ''The FDA approved such usage in the late 1980s upon the discovery that Botox could stop ailments like ''blepharospasm'' (uncontrolled blinking) and ''strabismus'' (''lazy eye''). Doctors have been using Botox for years to successfully treat ''wrinkles''  and facial creases. In April 2002, Botox gained FDA approval for treatment of moderate-to-severe frown lines between the eyebrows - called glabellar lines. However, Botox is often used for other areas of the face as well.' "
How Does Botox Work?,"'Botox blocks signals from the nerves to the muscles. The injected muscle can no longer contract, which causes the ''wrinkles'' to relax and soften.'""It is most often used on forehead lines, crow's ""'feet'' (lines around the eye) and frown lines. ''Wrinkles'' caused by sun damage and gravity will not respond to Botox.' "
How Is a Botox Procedure Performed?,'Getting Botox takes only a few minutes and no anesthesia is required. Botox is injected with a fine needle into specific muscles with only minor discomfort. It generally takes three to seven days to take full effect and it is best to avoid ''alcohol'' at least one week prior to treatment. ''Aspirin'' and anti-inflammatory medications should be stopped two weeks before treatment as well in order to reduce ''bruising''.' 
How Long Does a Botox Injection Last?,"'The effects from Botox will last four to six months. As muscle action gradually returns, the lines and wrinkles begin to re-appear and wrinkles need to be re-treated. The lines and wrinkles often appear less severe with time because the muscles are being trained to relax.' "
What Are the Side Effects of Botox?,"'Temporary ''bruising'' is the most common side effect of Botox. ''Headaches'', which resolve in 24-48 hours, can occur, but this is rare. A small percentage of patients may develop ''eyelid'"" drooping. This usually resolves in three weeks. This usually happens when the Botox moves around so you shouldn't rub the treated area for 12 hours after injection or lay down for three to four hours."" "
Who Should Not Receive Botox?,"'Patients who are ''pregnant'', ''breastfeeding'"" or have a neurological disease should not use Botox. Since Botox doesn't work for all wrinkles, a consultation with a doctor is recommended."" "
Will Insurance Pay For Botox?,"'Insurance coverage varies for Botox injections, depending largely on the medical necessity of your condition. Botox is not generally covered by insurance when used for cosmetic purposes. Check with your insurance carrier for coverage details.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Facts you should know about whiplash injuries, Whiplash is a relatively common injury that is often ignored or mistreated due to lack of understanding of the condition. Whiplash is usually the result of a rear impact while in a stationary position. Early range of motion and exercises lead to a more rapid recovery than prolonged immobilization or use of a cervical collar. Failure to properly educate and treat patients with whiplash can lead to chronic psychosocial symptoms including depression and anxiety.
What is whiplash?,"'Whiplash is a relatively common injury that occurs to a person\'s neck following a sudden acceleration-deceleration force that causes unrestrained, rapid forward and backward movement of the head and neck, most commonly from motor vehicle accidents. The term ""whiplash"" was first used in 1928. The term ""railway spine"" was used to describe a similar condition that was common in persons involved in train accidents prior to 1928. The term ""whiplash injury"" describes damage to both the bone structures and soft tissues, while ""whiplash associated disorders"" describes a more severe and chronic condition.''Fortunately, whiplash is typically not a life threatening injury, but it can lead to a prolonged period of partial disability. There are significant economic expenses related to whiplash that can reach 30 billion dollars a year in the United States, including:''While most people involved in minor motor vehicle accidents recover quickly without any chronic symptoms, some continue to experience symptoms for years after the injury. This wide variation in symptoms after relatively minor injuries has led some to suggest that, in many cases, whiplash is not so much a real physiologic injury, but that symptoms are more created as a result of potential economic gain. Many clinical studies have investigated this issue. Unfortunately, while there will always be people willing to attempt to mislead the system for personal gain, whiplash is a real condition with real symptoms.'   medical care,  disability,  sick leave,  lost productivity, and litigation."
What causes whiplash?,"""Whiplash is most commonly caused by a motor vehicle accident in which the person is in a car that is not moving, and is struck by another vehicle from behind. It is commonly thought the rear impact causes the head and neck to be forced into hyperextended (backward) position as the seat pushes the person's torso forward - and the unrestrained head and neck fall backwards. After a short delay the head and neck then recover and are thrown into a hyperflexed (forward) position.""'More recent studies investigating high-speed cameras and sophisticated crash dummies have determined that after the rear impact the lower cervical vertebrae (lower bones in the neck) are forced into a position of ''hyperextension'' while the upper cervical vertebrae (upper bones in the neck) are in a ''hyperflexed'' position. This leads to an abnormal S-shape in the cervical spine after the rear impact that is different from the normal motion. It is thought that this abnormal motion causes damage to the soft tissues that hold the cervical vertebrae together (ligaments, facet capsules, muscles). ' "
What are the symptoms of whiplash?,"'Common symptoms related to whiplash may include:''In a more severe and chronic case of ""whiplash associated disorder"" symptoms may include:''Patients with whiplash injuries may enter into litigation and ''social isolation'' may occur as a result of their symptoms.'   neck pain and stiffness, headache,  shoulder pain and stiffness,  dizziness,  fatigue,  jaw pain (temporomandibular joint symptoms),  arm pain,  arm weakness,  visual disturbances,  ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and  back pain.  depression,  anger,  frustration,  anxiety,  stress,  drug dependency,  post-traumatic stress syndrome,  sleep disturbance (insomnia), "
How do medical professionals diagnose whiplash?,"""After an accident the patient may be taken to the hospital or a doctor's office to be examined. The doctor will examine the patient to determine if they have any injuries that require treatment. Based on the symptoms and examination findings the doctor may place a collar on the neck for additional support. The doctor may also obtain ""'X-rays'' of the neck to check for more serious injury. The most important first step is to make sure there is no major injury to the neck, head or the rest of the body requiring immediate treatment.''If the X-rays are normal but the patient continues to have ''neck pain'', the doctor may keep the cervical collar in place and see the patient back in the office in about a week for an additional examination. At that time, the doctor may obtain new X-rays to see if there have been any changes. If the doctor is still concerned about soft tissue injuries, he or she may obtain either X-rays with the head leaning forward and backward\xa0(dynamic X-rays) or obtain an ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'' study). These dynamic X-rays or MRI scans are better able to detect injuries to the soft tissues of the neck, especially instability, that may not been seen with normal X-rays of the neck.' "
What is the treatment for whiplash?,"'Treatment of whiplash depends on the wide variety of symptoms present. Unfortunately, most treatments of whiplash have not been well tested to determine their effectiveness.''The most important issue in the management of whiplash is optimal education of the patient about their injury. This includes information on the cause, potential treatments, and likely outcomes. Patients should understand that this is a real injury, but that nearly all patients have the ability to fully recover. Patients that do not receive this information are much more likely to develop the more chronic ""whiplash associated disorder.""''In the past, the initial treatment for whiplash was often a soft cervical collar for several weeks. The goal of the collar was intended to reduce the range of motion of the neck and to prevent any additional injuries. More recent studies have shown that this prolonged immobilization actually slows the healing process. If there is no evidence of abnormal spinal alignment, early range of motion is advised.''Patients involved in early range of motion exercises have been shown to have a more reliable and rapid improvement in their symptoms. This treatment typically involves rotational exercises performed 10 times per hour as soon as symptoms allow within the first four days of the accident.''It seems that excessive rest and immobilization have been shown to have greater chances of chronic symptoms. This is explained by loss of range of motion leading to increased ''pain'' and stiffness. Immobilization also causes muscle atrophy (muscle wasting), decreased blood flow to the injured soft tissues, and healing of damaged muscles in shortened position that renders them less flexible.''Physical therapy can be useful in helping to wean a patient from a cervical collar as well as to help strengthen muscles and reduce painful motions. Occupational therapy can be used to help return the patient to the work environment.''If the patient begins to develop psychological symptoms including anger, ''anxiety'' or ''depression'' following an injury, prompt treatment of the emotional condition is recommended. This can help the patient better understand the good chances for successful recovery and reduce the chances of chronic symptoms.'  "
What can people do to prevent whiplash?,"'While it is not always possible to prevent accidents, advances in automobile safety have attempted to reduce the associated risks. Many advances in seat belts and head restraints have been able to reduce the risk of whiplash injury. The proper use of these devices is crucial to their success in preventing injury. Head restraints are designed to prevent the head from moving into hyperextension when struck from behind. In order for this to work properly, the head restraint should be optimally positioned directly behind the head. If the head restraint is lowered below the level of the head it could actually force the head into further hyperextension after an impact. Many automobiles have additional safety equipment including air ''bags'' and air curtains to further protect drivers and passengers from injury.' "
What is the difference between a sprain and a strain?,"'The soft tissues of the body include the muscles, tendons, and ligaments that help the body move but are not part of the bony skeleton. Sprains and strains are considered soft tissue injuries.''The purpose of the musculoskeletal system is to allow the body to move. A muscle attaches to bone on each side of a joint, either directly or by way of a tendon. When the muscle contracts, the joint moves through its range of motion. The muscle that you can feel moving underneath your skin is really made up of many smaller bundles of muscle fibers called fascicles. These, in turn, are made up of individual muscle fibers that are crosslinked to allow them to slide back and forth within the fascicle. Sliding together causes the muscle fibers to shorten and the muscle to contract and move the joint. When the muscle relaxes, the muscle fibers return to their resting position and as the fibers elongate, the joint may return to its previous position.''The transition of muscle to tendon happens gradually as muscle fibers give way to tendon fibers before the bony attachment occurs. The anatomy of each tendon is different and depending upon their location in the body, the tendon portion may be very short or very long. A strain is damage caused by an overstretched muscle or tendon, causing their fibers to be pulled apart, losing the ability to adequately contract. The severity of injury depends upon the amount of tissue that is damaged. The muscle ''fiber'' may be just stretched, partially torn, or completely torn apart.''The most common cause of a muscle or tendon strain is overuse, which weakens the tissue fibers. Muscles and joints may also be forced to perform movements for which they are not prepared or designed, stretching and potentially damaging the surrounding muscle or tendon. An injury can occur from a single stressful incident, or it may gradually arise after many repetitions of a motion (overuse). The damage can occur in three areas: the muscle itself, the muscle tendon intersection where the muscle fibers transition to tendon fibers, or the tendon itself.''Strains are described by the severity of damage in three grades:''Joints are stabilized by thick bands of tissue called ligaments that allow the joint to move only in specific directions. Some joints move in multiple planes. Therefore, they need more than one group of ligaments to hold the joint in proper alignment. The ligaments are anchored to bone on each side of the joint. If a ligament is stretched or torn, the injury is called a sprain.''The grading system for sprain injury is similar to that of strains.' A sprain is an injury to a ligament. A strain is an injury to muscle or tendon tissue. Grade 1 strain usually causes stretching of a few of the muscle fibers. Grade 2 strain has more significant damage, and some muscle fibers are damaged or torn. Grade 3 strain is a complete rupture of the muscle. Grade 1 sprains occur when fibers of the ligament are stretched but not torn. Grade 2 sprains are injuries where the ligament is partially torn. Grade 3 sprains occur when the ligament is completely torn or ruptured."
What causes a sprain or strain?,"'Sprains and strains occur when the body is put under physical ''stress''. In these situations, muscles and joints are forced to perform movements for which they are not prepared or designed. An injury can occur from a single stressful incident, contact sports, or it may gradually arise after many repetitions of a motion. Usually, the mechanism of injury involves placing the muscle tendon unit or the ligament under excessive stretching, causing damage to the muscle, tendon, or ligament fibers.'  "
Where do sprains and strains usually occur?,"'An ''ankle sprain'' is one of the most common injuries of a joint. Usually, the mechanism of injury is a rapid ""rolling"" or ""twisting"" of the ankle and turning it inward (inversion) so that the sole of the foot starts to point upward (supination). This causes stretching and damage to the ligaments on the outside or lateral part of the ankle that hold the joint stable. While common and many are mild sprains, some ankle sprains can be severe.'""Knee sprains are common sports injuries and often make headlines because of their potential for ending professional athletes' playing careers. There are four ligaments of the knee that allow it to act as a hinge joint, flexing (bending) or extending (straightening). The medial and lateral collateral ligaments and the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments keep the knee in alignment and are assisted by the ""'quadriceps'' and hamstring muscles. When a player completely tears the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee, it is described as a grade 3 injury of that cruciate ligament.''Neck injuries are common, for example, after a car accident. While ''whiplash'' is a nonmedical term, it accurately describes the head and neck movement when violently flexed forward and backward as the car abruptly stops. While the rest of the body is held in place with a seat belt and/or air bag, the head is like a bobble head and can continue moving. Both muscles and ligaments hold the neck bones (cervical vertebrae) in place, and the stresses placed on those structures can cause severe pain and damage. Sometimes, the vertebrae are not damaged, but the ligaments that support and stabilize the bones are torn, causing significant pain and swelling. On occasion, these injuries can cause the neck to become unstable and put the spinal cord at risk for injury.''Wrist injuries are common because we use our hands to perform many tasks. Usually, the wrist is damaged because of a fall, but repetitive tasks and a single aggressive move may also cause pain. Some sports are more prone to wrist injuries than others because of the forces that are placed on the joint. Sports injuries from throwing motions can occur in baseball, football, bowling, and tennis. Sports injuries from falling on an outstretched hand may happen with skateboarding, snowboarding, and skiing.'""The thumb and fingers can also be injured. Skier's or gamekeeper's thumb is a sprain at the base of the thumb where the ulnar collateral ligament spans the metacarpophalageal joint, where the thumb attaches to the hand. This ligament holds the thumb stable during grasping and pinching motions. It is most often injured in a fall where the thumb is forced away from the palm of the hand, like when a skier falls and the ski pole pushes the thumb in an awkward direction.""'Muscles strains may involve any body area that is required to perform work. ''Lower back pain'' and spasm is a common result of repetitive lifting injuries, but it only takes one twist or turn at the wrong time or in the wrong position to cause muscle fibers in the back to stretch and develop spasms. Low back strain is the most common work-related injury.''Muscles need to be well-balanced around the joints they move. For example, muscles can be damaged from overuse or imbalance. The quadriceps muscle in the front of the thigh extends the knee and is balanced by the hamstring muscles of the back of the thigh, which flex the knee. Excess bending or straightening can cause the muscle fibers to tear. Muscles that move and stabilize the hip are prone to injury. Groin injuries or groin pulls are strains of the hip muscles that normally move the thigh inward to the middle of the body. When the leg is pulled away from the body like doing the splits, the adductors are stretched and potentially damaged.''We use our arms and hands for a variety of activities, and the arm muscles (biceps and triceps muscles) and the forearm muscles may be strained by aggressive lifting, pushing, pulling grabbing, twisting, or any other activity that you can imagine the arm and hand trying to accomplish.''Chest wall muscles can be pulled or strained because of activities as aggressive as lifting or as seemingly harmless as ''sneezing'' or ''coughing''. Acute strains of the large muscles on the outside of the chest (pectoralis muscles) or the muscles between the ribs (intercostal muscles) can cause severe pain and can mimic the pain of a ''broken rib''.''The core muscles of the torso of the body, including the abdominal wall muscles and those of the back, lend stability to the trunk and are often the source of power for the arms and legs to lift and push. These muscles can be strained from many different activities that require the torso to bend, stretch, or twist.' "
What are sprain symptoms and signs?,"'The first symptom of a sprain or strain injury is usually pain, though there may be a delay in onset of the symptom until there is some onset of ''muscle spasm''. The person who is injured may not recall the specific event that caused the injury of the affected area. For example, a person who paints a room may develop ''shoulder pain'' the day after the repetitive effort of brushing overhead. This is because inflammation, swelling, and spasm can take time (from minutes to hours) to develop.''Pain is always a symptom that indicates that there is something wrong with the body. It is the message to the brain that warns that a muscle or joint should be protected from further harm. In work, ''exercise'', or sport, the pain may develop after a specific incident, or it may gradually progress after many repetitions of a motion.''Swelling almost always occurs with injury, but it may take from minutes to hours to be noticed. Anytime fibers of a ligament, muscle, or tendon are damaged, some inflammation and bleeding occurs. The bleeding (such as ''bruising'' on the surface of the skin) may take time to be noticed.''Because of pain and swelling, the body starts to favor the injured part. This may cause the muscles that surround the injured area to go into spasm or cramp. Hard knots of muscle might be felt near the site of the injury.''The combination of pain, swelling, and spasm causes the body to further protect the injured part, which results in difficulty with use. ''Limping'' is an example of the body trying to protect an injured leg from weight-bearing.'

How do health care professionals diagnose sprains and strains?,"'The diagnosis of a muscle strain or joint sprain is usually made by history and physical examination. The health care professional may want to know the circumstances of the injury and whether the body sustained damage other than the sprain or strain that initially causes the patient to seek care. For example, if a person was involved in a significant fall or car accident, the strain or sprain may not be a priority in caring for the patient with potential ''internal bleeding'' or ''head injury''.''Physical examination may focus on the part of the body that is injured: the tender muscle or the swollen joint. It is important to know whether or not there may be broken bones (''fractures'') or other associated injuries with the sprain or strain. The health care professional may evaluate the pulses and sensation beyond the injury site to be certain that there is no associated artery or nerve damage.''X-ray tests may be used to detect broken bones. CT scan or MRI are used to evaluate bone and can also help detect damage to muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and other structures. Usually, physical examination is adequate to make the diagnosis, but if surgery is suggested, imaging might be considered to help plan the operation. Most often CT and MRI tests are performed electively and scheduled to be done at a future time.''Sometimes X-rays are not recommended. For example, patients with ''low back pain'' who have not had a significant fall, car accident, or injuries (and there is little concern that a ''broken bone'' exists) do not particularly require X-rays since ''fracture'' is unlikely. The health care professional may wish to minimize the exposure to ''radiation'' by avoiding these. For ankle and knee sprains, guidelines (like the Ottawa ankle and knee rules) exist to help decide when X-rays of those joints might be helpful in finding an accompanying fracture. Usually, though, physical examination is enough to clinically assess the presence or absence of a bony injury.' "
What is the treatment for sprains and strains?,"'When muscle, tendon, or ligament fibers are damaged, the body will heal that area by producing ''scar tissue''. The area that is injured needs to be kept relatively rested while healing.''First aid'"" continues afterward with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). These are the keys elements in the treatment of both sprains and strains. More intense treatment may be required depending upon the location and severity of injury and the patient's level of function. For example, an athlete who sprains the ACL of their knee may need to have surgery to reconstruct the ligament, but an elderly patient who is less active may not need such an aggressive approach and physical therapy may be all that is needed to return to their previous level of activity.""'Depending upon the extent and location of the injury, it may take many weeks to return to normal function. That does not mean that all activity must stop; instead there needs to be a gradual return to function that is guided by the body\'s response to activity. Most often, the patient can ""listen"" to their body\'s response to activity and increase or decrease the amount and intensity of activity. There is a balance between resting a part of the body enough to help with healing and resting it too much so that strength and range of motion are lost. For example, when the ''rotator cuff'' is strained, it may take a significant amount of time for the shoulder to return to full function. Resting the arm for a prolonged period of time in a sling to rest the muscle group may lead to ''stiffness'' in the shoulder joint and loss of range of motion. The health care professional and patient must appreciate that balance and minimize the loss of function while maximizing the rate of healing.''Muscle, tendon, and ligaments heal themselves naturally by repairing the fibers or filling in the damaged area with ''scar'' tissue. Full muscle and joint mobility may take time to return, and gradual stretching may be required to return the injured area to normal. Additionally, depending upon the area of the body that is injured, the damage sustained, and the amount of loss of function, physical therapy may be suggested. A variety of treatment modalities may be considered, including ''ultrasound'' and ''massage'', to encourage healing and preserve range of motion and function.''If the muscle or tendon is ruptured or severely torn (grade 3 strain), surgery may be required to repair the damage. Some common sites of this injury include the''Physical therapists may be an important part of the treatment team to help with recovery. Their skills in teaching and monitoring range of motion and strengthening exercises allow recovery from their injury in a controlled way. It may be only one visit for an ankle sprain, or there may need to be multiple visits to help with post operative care. Physical therapy can also involve other treatment options like ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and muscle massage.''Certified athletic trainers work with athletes, especially in organized sports, and are involved in the treatment of acute and chronic sprains and strains. They are skilled in taping and using compression bandages (ace wraps) to support and protect injured muscles and joint, as well as implementing treatment plans as part of the sports medicine team.'""Surgery is a consideration for certain sprains and strains. The decision to offer surgical operations to repair muscle, tendons, or ligaments depends upon the patient's underlying function before the injury and their expectations for activity after recovery. Not all structures need repair, even if completely torn. For example, a professional athlete may continue to perform at a high level even with a torn posterior cruciate ligament in the knee but cannot easily return to the field of play with a ""'torn anterior cruciate ligament''.''Anti-inflammatory medications like ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') and ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') are often suggested to help decrease inflammation and relieve pain. Before taking any ''over-the-counter'' medication, it is important to appreciate that side effects and medication interactions exist and it is wise to ask a health care professional or pharmacist for advice and direction for their use.''New treatments are being developed to help with recovery For example, platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections may help in speeding recovery and may be useful in some patient treatment plans.''For more significant pain, prescription pain medications, muscle relaxants, and/or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed for a short period of time.'   quadriceps (front of the thigh) muscle or its tendon, either the quadriceps or patellar, that allows the knee to extend or straighten tendon; hamstring muscle located in the back of the thigh and flexes the knee; Achilles tendon which attached the calf muscle to the calcaneus (heel) and allows the ankle to flex; biceps muscle or tendon, which flexes the elbow."
What is the recovery time for sprains and strains?,"'The goal of treatment after a sprain or strain is to return the patient to their previous level of function before the injury. The duration of recovery depends upon the extent of injury and what part of the body is damaged. The most important therapy for all injuries is allowing time to recover and heal. Rehabilitating an injury may involve a home ''exercise'' program or it may be a formal physical therapy program. Regardless, it takes time and effort to repair the body and the patient should have a clear understanding of what is expected to rehabilitate the injury. Some questions that may be helpful include the following:''While it may take weeks for a sprain or strain to be completely healed, the time to return to activity may be much shorter. Many minor muscle strains resolve themselves in a few days. While the injured person can return to full activity relatively quickly, the muscle may not be completely healed and is less able to withstand excessive ''stress'' and may still be more prone to future recurrent injury. Similarly, sprained joints may be functional in a couple of weeks but might take months to heal completely and return to full strength and stability.''Some muscle strains take longer to heal than others due to their location and function.''The muscles that help us to breathe operate much like a bellows. The chest wall expands to suck air into the ''lungs''. When injuries occur to the muscles of the chest wall, healing time may be measured in weeks, not days. The muscles are unable to rest since they are involved in taking in a breath every five to six seconds. When there is a chest wall injury, the pectoralis muscles that cover the front part of the chest and help the arms with lifting, the intercostal muscles that are located between the ribs, and the upper back muscles can all go into spasm. Regardless of whether there is a broken or bruised rib or a strained muscle, attempts to take a deep breath may cause sharp pain as the chest wall moves and the damaged muscle is stretched. While an injured arm can be rested in a sling, or crutches can be used to rest an injured leg, it is difficult to stop ''breathing''. It means that 12-14 times a minute, the injured muscle is required to work and stretch. Each breath is painful and delays healing. Chest wall muscles strains may take weeks to heal.''While wrapping the chest with an ace bandage might help with the discomfort, that treatment option is not recommended. It is important to take deep breaths and expand the lung completely to prevent the most common complication of a chest wall injury, which is ''pneumonia'', an infection of the lung.''Numerous muscles are required to keep the head optimally stable on the shoulders and to allow it to swivel in many directions. Injuries are common to the trapezius and sternomastoid muscles, the large muscles that do the major the work of neck turning. Smaller muscles that attach to the bony prominences of the neck can also be strained. Depending upon the injury, significant pain and spasm can occur that is long-lasting. Whiplash is a nonmedical term that describes strains and sprains of the neck that occur with violent flexion-extension injuries. Many structures can be the source of pain, and treatment results depend upon which structure, from muscle to tendon to ligament to nerve, is involved.' Are there work or activity restrictions or limitations that need to be observed? When can I expect to be able to return to normal daily activities? When can I expect to be fully recovered? Do I need to be reevaluated, and if so, when?"
Is it possible to prevent sprains and strains?,"'Putting the body to work requires that it be prepared for a specific activity. Athletes routinely warm up before practice and competition, and that same philosophy of injury ''prevention'' can be applied to regular daily activities. Stretching before work and gradually increasing the amount of effort and exertion may help prevent injured joints and muscles. Everybody is an athlete in their own way, and it is just as important to warm up before shoveling snow, mowing the grass, or vacuuming, as it is before playing basketball or golf. Moreover, exercises and stretches that strengthen the muscles that are used in routine activities can help maximize flexibility and minimize the risk of future injury.''A previous sprain or strain is a risk factor for another future injury to that particular area. Being certain that an injured body part is completely healed before stressing it again is essential to minimize that risk.'

What is the prognosis of sprains and strains?,"'The goal for treating a strain or sprain is to return the patient to their normal level of physical activity. When that can be accomplished and the time frame for recovery depends upon the specific injury. An arm muscle strain may resolve with rest, ice, compression, and elevation in one to two days, and a ''sprained ankle'' may take two to four weeks. However, a torn knee ACL, which is really a grade 3 sprain, may need surgery and months of physical therapy and rehabilitation.''It is important to discuss with a health care professional or therapist their expectations as to how long they think a specific injury will take to get better and what the goal is for recovery. An athlete being cared for in a sports medicine clinic may have different expectations for activities and return to play than a sedentary patient whose goal is to be able to perform basic functions of daily life.' "
Where can people find more information about sprains and strains?,"'A health care professional can be an important resource for information regarding muscle and joint injuries. Physical therapists and chiropractors can help rehabilitate people with these injuries.''Local hospitals, county health departments, and health clubs will have literature and information about injury prevention and healthy lifestyles that may minimize the risk of a strain or sprain. They may also have exercise and stretching classes, including ''yoga'' and ''Pilates'', to help with injury prevention.' "
What is ventilator management?,"'Intubation'' is a procedure performed when the patient is unable to breathe by themselves. It may be a life-saving procedure in the emergency room (ER) or planned during the surgery when the patient is under general anesthesia.\xa0''The doctor inserts a tube through the nose or mouth into the throat and trachea (windpipe). The tube facilitates air entry into and out of the ''lungs''. The tube is connected to a machine called a ventilator that pumps air containing an increased concentration of oxygen compared with atmospheric air. The machine then helps in exhaling air containing carbon dioxide (CO2).\xa0''The ventilator maintains normal oxygen and CO2 levels in the body. This is called mechanical ventilation. During mechanical ventilation, cardiac function, ''blood pressure'', and oxygen saturation/levels in the body are monitored continuously.' "
What are the two basic settings of ventilator management?,"'Most ventilators can be set to apply a custom amount of air based on the individual patient’s lungs and ''breathing'' function. This is called delivered tidal volume (the total volume of air that is inspired and expired in one cycle of breathing/''respiration''), and a respiratory therapist can adjust the delivered tidal volume . Ventilators deliver air via two basic settings:' Control mode: In a control mode, the ventilator delivers a preset tidal volume once it is triggered irrespective of patient’s effort. Support mode: In a support mode, the ventilator provides assistance during inspiration with the help of an assist pressure. The ventilator detects inspiration by the patient and supplies an assist pressure during inspiration. The assist pressure is terminated when it detects expiration. The support mode requires the patient to have an adequate respiratory drive."
What are the six major types of ventilatory support?,"'There are six major types of ventilator support:' Continuous mandatory ventilation: Breaths are delivered at preset intervals, irrespective of the patient’s effort. This mode is usually used in patients who are paralyzed with no respiratory effort of their own. It can increase the breathing rate if respiratory effort is present; hence, it is not be used in patients with adequate respiratory drive.  Assist-control ventilation: The ventilator delivers a preset number of breaths. This is used in co-ordination with the patient’s irregular spontaneous attempts at breathing. Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV): The ventilator delivers breaths at preset intervals, and spontaneous breathing occurs between the ventilator-administered breaths.  Synchronous IMV: The ventilator delivers preset breaths in coordination with the respiratory effort of the patient. Spontaneous breathing occurs between the ventilator breaths.  Synchronization between preset mandatory breaths with the patient’s spontaneous breaths reduces the risk of ventilator-related trauma to the chest.  Pressure support ventilation: This type of ventilation is for people who are able to breathe some on their own. It reduces the risk of ventilator-related trauma to the chest and the effort of breathing. The airway pressure support is maintained till the patient's inspiratory flow drops. There is better patient comfort, reduced risk to the heart, reduced risk to the chest and better gas distribution. Noninvasive ventilation: Mechanical ventilatory support is provided through a mask instead of a tube. This is common in emergency departments. It is used in patients with mild-to-moderate respiratory failure, and the patient should be alert."
When is mechanical ventilation done?,"'The main purpose of mechanical ventilation is to protect the airway and manage respiratory failure. Patients with respiratory failure in the emergency room are usually clinically diagnosed. The decision to intubate and mechanically ventilate or use noninvasive ventilation support is based on clinical assessment by the physician, without delay for laboratory results.''It is also indicated for the treatment of critical, life-threatening conditions such as salicylate intoxication, major ''head injury'' with elevated intracranial pressure, or ''antidepressant'' toxicity.' "
What are the complications of mechanical ventilation?,"'The heart and major blood vessels in the chest ''cavity'' are subjected to the increased pressure from mechanical ventilation. This may decrease cardiac function, leading to ischemia (decreased oxygenation in the body).' Barotrauma (damage to the lungs due to pressure differences) may result in the following: Pneumomediastinum (air in the space between the two lungs) Pneumoperitoneum (presence of air in the abdomen) Pneumothorax (air in the space between the lungs and chest wall) Infection of the lungs Atelectasis (collapse of the lungs)"
What should I know about strep throat?," Strep throat is a type of infection caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria that results in a sore, inflamed throat. Most sore throats are caused by viruses, not strep bacteria. Symptoms of strep throat in adults, middle-aged children, and adolescents include:Sore throat (90%)Headache (85%)Fever (85%)Upset stomach (65%) Sore throat (90%) Headache (85%) Fever (85%) Upset stomach (65%) Symptoms of strep throat in infants and toddlers may also include a thick nasal discharge, reduced appetite, fussiness, and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms associated with an upper respiratory infection (a ""cold""), such as nasal congestion, muscle aches, and oral blisters, are typically absent with strep throat. Strep throat is highly contagious and is usually spread through direct person-to-person contact. The diagnosis of strep throat is established either via a rapid strep test (RADT) or a throat culture. Strep throat is cured with antibiotic therapy. While rare, there are several complications that may develop from a strep throat infection."
What is strep throat? What causes it?,"'Strep throat is a bacterial infection of the soft palate and tonsillar region. Microbiologists identify the member of the ''Streptococcus'' bacterial family that causes strep throat as ""GAS"" (Group A, beta hemolytic, ''Streptococcus pyogenes'').''Strep throat is most common in young children and adolescents, but it can also occur in toddlers and adults. Strep throat is highly contagious and it is present most commonly in the community during the winter months. Symptoms and physical signs of strep throat may vary depending upon the age of the person infected.'  "
How is strep throat spread? How long is it contagious?,"'Strep throat is highly contagious and is most commonly spread via direct person-to-person contact.''Strep throat will usually get better on its own within two to five days, however, you may start feeling better within a day or two after antibiotics are started. Strep throat remains contagious for the first 24 hours after starting antibiotics, so it is recommended that people stay home from work or school to avoid spreading the infection.'   The incubation period (the time it takes from exposure to the infection to the appearance of symptoms) for strep throat is two to five days. Passage of airborne droplets and/or saliva from the infected individual to another is the most likely mechanism of contracting strep throat. Close quarters (such as the home, classroom, day care centers, college dorms, etc.) provide an ideal environment for passage of strep bacteria from one person to another. The risk of contracting a strep throat infection is approximately 40% in household environments. Most infectious disease specialists believe that a patient is no longer contagious after 24 hours of effective antibiotic therapy. Spread of strep bacteria via food borne transmission is less common than direct person-to-person exchange of droplets or saliva. The exact likelihood of developing strep throat from family pets is unknown, but most experts believe it is minimal."
What are the common signs and symptoms of strep throat?,"'Signs of strep throat are not unique - many viral infections (which cause the majority of sore throats) can have identical signs and symptoms as a ''group A strep'' (GAS) infection. Typically, an older child and adolescent will experience symptoms such as:''Runny nose'', ''cough'', hoarse voice, muscle aches, ''diarrhea'' and oral blisters are generally not seen with a strep throat infection. These symptoms usually indicate a ''sore throat'' caused by a virus.''Adults with strep throat may have milder symptoms that may not prompt a medical evaluation unless an exposure history to strep throat is known.'

What are other signs and symptoms of strep throat?,"'Other signs and symptoms of strep throat infection may include:''While most patients with strep throat will experience these signs and symptoms, not all will necessarily be present in each individual.' Redness of the soft palate, uvula (the ""punching bag"" structure hanging from the back of the soft palate), and tonsils. Commonly, the tonsils may have a bumpy look on their surface - somewhat like a golf ball White or yellow colored spots on the tonsils (tonsillar exudate) Petechiae (look like 1-2 mm bright red ""dots"" which represent ruptured capillaries) scattered on the soft palate Enlarged and tender neck lymph nodes (also known as lymph glands) A diffuse rash over the torso and groin region. The classic description of this rash is that it looks like ""goose bumps on a moderate sunburn"". The presence of a strep infection and this specific rash is termed scarlet fever. This diagnosis does not imply a more severe strep infection or imply any change in prognosis or management. The rash is not contagious. Some indivduals who develop acarlet fever may also experience peeling of the skin of the finger tip pads."
Are the signs and symptoms of strep throat in infants and toddlers?,"'The information above is seen in those most likely to have a strep throat infection, including older children and teenagers. However, other age groups may experience some different symptoms with a strep throat infection.' Infants with strep throat more commonly have a thick nasal discharge, low grade fever (< 101 F [38.33 C]), reduction in appetite, and fussiness. Toddlers (children from one to three years of age) with strep throat may complain of a sore throat and a subsequent decrease in appetite, and swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck beneath the mandible (lower jaw bone)."
What tests diagnose strep throat?,"'There are two common tests used to diagnose strep throat the rapid strep test (RADT) and traditional throat culture.''The traditional test, a throat culture, involves obtaining a swab from the back of the throat and tonsils. It takes approximately 24 to 48 hours to determine the presence or absence of the group A strep bacteria. This test is typically more accurate in diagnosing strep throat than the rapid strep test.''The rapid strep and throat culture tests are designed to determine whether an individual currently has a strep throat infection. Sometimes it may be necessary to determine whether a patient has had a recent history of a strep infection. In that case, two blood tests are available:''The antibodies that these tests are sensitive to are not commonly present until a few weeks following an acute strep infection. These tests may be ordered when evaluating a patient who may have developed delayed complications (such as ''rheumatic fever'' or glomerulonephritis) after a strep throat infection.'   Many medical offices, clinics, and hospital emergency departments use a rapid strep test (RADT - rapid antigen detection test) to diagnose strep throat. A throat swab is obtained from the back of the throat and tonsils, and a RADT ""kit"" is employed to help determine the presence or absence of the strep bacteria. The turn around time for results of the test generally is 10 minutes. RADT tests are about 70%-95% accurate in determining the presence of strep bacteria. Most guidelines recommend that a negative rapid strep test be confirmed with a throat culture, which can take a few days to get the results. Antibiotic pretreatment prior to obtaining a throat swab for strep bacteria can interfere with throat culture results, and thus the ability to correctly diagnose and treat a strep throat infection. Antibiotic treatment prior to a rapid strep test is less likely to have a false negative result since the test is designed to document the presence or absence of the GAS bacteria. Residual dead bacteria in the patient may allow a positive result. ASO (antistreptolysin O) titer Anti-DNase titer"
How is strep throat treated?,'Treatment of a strep throat infection includes the use of antibiotics and ''over-the-counter'' medications and home remedies for the reduction of symptoms.' 
What natural and home remedies help soothe strep throat pain?,"'There are a number of home remedies that may be used to reduce the symptoms of strep throat. They may be used whether the patient has strep throat or a viral cause of their illness. These remedies should not be used in lieu of a complete course of antibiotics if a strep infection is being treated. Home remedies to soothe symptoms of strep throat include:'

   Saltwater gargle: mix ¼ to ½ teaspoon with 8 ounces of warm water. Young children may accidently swallow the solution instead of gargling it and should thus avoid this approach. Throat lozenges may be sucked on to reduce the symptoms of pain or throat dryness. Some lozenges contain topical anesthetics. Very young children should not be given throat lozenges, as they may be a choking hazard. Throat sprays that contain topical pain relievers (benzocaine, phenol) may be used to relieve sore throat pain, though lozenges often provide more long-lasting relief. Hot or cold foods and drinks: Ice cream, smoothies, popsicles, cold drinks, warm (not hot) broth-based soup, and warm tea with honey may help soothe the sore throat. Honey should be avoided in infants less that 1 year of age because of their increased likelihood of botulinum toxicity and paralysis."
What over-the-counter (OTC) medication soothes strep throat pain?,"'Several over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'' and ''Motrin'') can be used to lower the fever and provide pain relief for the sore throat. ''Aspirin'' should not be used in children or adolescents because of its association with Reye syndrome.' "
What antibiotics are prescribed to treat strep throat?,"'Antibiotics provide the mainstay for successfully treating a strep throat infection.''If a woman contracts strep throat during ''pregnancy'', the same types of antibiotics are typically used for treatment. All penicillin-type and cephalosporin-type antibiotics are considered safe for ''pregnant'' women. Because fever is a common symptom of strep throat, pregnant women are advised to take fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Aspirin and ''NSAID''’s should be avoided during pregnancy. Consult your doctor if you are pregnant and you think you have strep throat, and follow your doctor’s instructions for medication use.''Strep throat is typically diagnosed and treated by a primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, an internist, or a child’s pediatrician. If you go to a hospital’s emergency department, you will be seen by an ''emergency medicine'' specialist.''If you have recurring or chronic strep throat, you may be referred to an otolaryngologist, sometimes referred to as an ENT (ear, nose, and throat specialist) for treatment.' The group A strep bacteria are generally susceptible to the penicillin family, for example,amoxicillin (Amoxil), andthe cephalosporin family, for example, cephalexin (Keflex), cefprozil (Cefzil), cefdinir (Omnicef) and others. amoxicillin (Amoxil), and the cephalosporin family, for example, cephalexin (Keflex), cefprozil (Cefzil), cefdinir (Omnicef) and others. Members of the macrolide family, for example, erythromycin (E-mycin), azithromycin (Zithromax) and clarithromycin (Biaxin) generally are felt to be less effective than the other two classes of antibiotics, but are used in individuals with moderate penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. If such a patient cannot tolerate the macrolide family, clindamycin (Cleocin) is an alternative and very effective antibiotic option. Regardless of what antibiotic is prescribed, it is important to finish the entire course of the antibiotic. Most patients will experience a rapid reduction in signs and symptoms within 24 to 48 hours of starting antibiotic therapy. Viral throat infections do not require antibiotics since they provide no benefit."
What are potential complications of strep throat?,"'The possible complications of strep throat include:' Middle ear infection (otitis media) Toxic shock syndrome (a rare severe complication which may result in multiple organ failure and sometimes death) Peritonsillar abscess or retropharyngeal abscess (a walled-off collection of pus) containing GAS bacteria which typically requires drainage Acute rheumatic fever (ARF): While rare, this complication of an untreated or inadequately treated strep infection can have devastating and lifelong consequences. It is believed that due to incomplete eradication of the strep bacteria, certain GAS organisms cause an immune response, which may attack the joints leading to permanent arthritis. More concerning is the autoimmune response to the heart valves, which may damage them and may result in heart failure. Many studies have shown that effective and appropriate antibiotic therapy for strep throat vastly reduces the likelihood of developing ARF. Glomerulonephritis: Similar to the abnormal immune response seen with ARF, antibodies may develop and damage the microscopic filters (glomeruli) of the kidney. This complication more commonly affects children between 7 to 10 years of age. While more common than acute rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis has a less serious prognosis. Effective treatment exists and most children make a complete recovery and do not experience any long-term kidney damage. Unlike ARF, the development of glomerulonephritis is not necessarily prevented by effective antibiotic treatment. PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Strep): Specialists debate the proposed link of a GAS infection in children with the development and/or worsening of obsessive-compulsive behaviors or tic disorder (Tourette's syndrome in the extreme). One area being researched in this controversial condition is whether antibiotic therapy effects the development of, or the severity of, the disorder."

   Avoid people with sore throats, and especially those with documented strep throat, until they have taken antibiotics for more than 48 hours. Wash your hands frequently after using items which may harbor the group A strep bacteria (for example, dishes and utensils). Don't share food or drinks with a sick individual. Encourage ill individuals to cover their nose and mouth when they sneeze or cough."
Why is identification of streptococcal infection important?,"'Patients benefit both immediately and potentially in the long-term by rapid confirmation of ''streptococcal'' cause of their sore throat. Antibiotic treatment provides a quicker reduction of symptoms, shortens the duration of illness and quickly, and efficiently eliminates the possibility of spread of infection to others. ' Although rare, serious consequences of
	streptococcal infections do 
occur. Rheumatic fever is associated with
	heart, 
	joint and nervous 
system damage and is preventable by rapid treatment of strep disease.  Serious kidney disease that may result in 
	kidney failure may also be a consequence of 
	streptococcal infection.  A throat infection due to strep needs antibiotic 
therapy initiated as 
rapidly as possible. The rapid strep test facilitates this goal."
Why is the rapid test better?,"'By comparison with culture methods, a rapid strep test is much quicker and can produce results within minutes.' "
What is the traditional test for strep throat?,'The traditional test for a strep throat has been a throat culture. The major drawback of a throat culture is that the results take two to three days due to the time necessary to allow enough GAS bacteria to grow to enable accurate identification.' 
What is a rapid strep test?,"""The rapid strep test is a quick and accurate diagnostic tool used to determine whether or not strep bacteria are present in the patient's throat. The same test may be used to evaluate for the presence of ""'Streptococci'' in other infected areas (for example, perianal infection in either gender, or vulvar infection in pre-pubertal girls).'  "
How is a rapid strep test done?,"'Obtaining a specimen is the same whether your doctor will do a throat culture or rapid test for strep. A cotton swab (similar to a Q-tip) is quickly rubbed over both ''tonsils'' as well as the back wall of the mouth (the posterior pharynx). It is important to avoid contact with other structures inside the mouth such as the tongue or cheeks. The swab is then placed in a specialized container and the rapid test performed. Many people find that obtaining the swab produces a gagging sensation. However, since the entire swabbing process lasts less than five seconds this inconvenience is minimal.' "
What are the limitations of the rapid strep test?,"'There are several manufactures of rapid strep tests. Each manufacturer has designed their test to respond only to the presence of the particular ''streptococcal'' bacteria (Group A) responsible for strep throat. Other bacteria which are less much less likely to cause sore throats are not identified by the rapid strep test. ' The test will not 
detect viral causes of sore throat.  A positive test response occurs when a 
reaction occurs between a protein on the surface of strep bacteria and chemicals in the 
test materials. Either living or dead strep bacteria will produce a 
positive reaction.  Most rapid strep tests have a
	sensitivity of 95%, meaning that 
the test will be positive in 95 of 100 patients who are documented to have strep 
throat via throat culture obtained at the same time. Since 5 of 100 patients 
with strep throat will be missed using a rapid strep test, all negative swab 
specimens should be sent for culture to confirm the absence of strep bacteria. 
	 A 
positive culture requires antibiotics.  The rapid strep test has a 98%
	specificity. This 
means that 98 of 100 positive tests correctly indicate the 
presence specifically of Group A streptococcus bacteria; 2 of 100 positive 
results are ""false positives"" - indicative of similarities between various surface
	proteins found on strep bacteria and other non-strep bacteria found in the 
mouth."
What are the causes of a sore throat?,'Sore throats are usually caused by ''viruses'' (such as ''cold'' or ''flu'') or from ''smoking''. Very occasionally they can be caused by bacteria. Sore throats are very commonly seen during winter or cold season when respiratory diseases are at their peak. There is usually nothing to worry about because they generally get better by themselves within a week.''The following infections may cause ''sore throat''\xa0' Tonsillitis (infection of the tonsils) Strep throat (a bacterial throat infection)  Mononucleosis infection (glandular fever)

Drink plenty of fluids. Get adequate rest. Eat cool and soft food to ease swallowing. Avoid smoking or smoky places. Use over-the-counter medicated lozenges or a throat spray.  Use medicines to reduce your fever such as paracetamol. You should avoid using these medications in children without consulting your pediatrician."
Should I take antibiotics?,"'Most sore throats get better (cold or viral flu) in a week to 10 days.''Doctors do not normally prescribe antibiotics for viral sore throats because they will not help relieve your symptoms or speed up the recovery process.''Your doctor may advise and prescribe antibiotics for you when''You must complete the course if your doctor has advised you to take an antibiotic. This will avoid further complications such as the recurrence of an infection and the development of drug-resistant bacteria.''If your sore throat is caused by ''allergies'', your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat them. If you have glandular fever (mononucleosis), it may last for more than four weeks and can be cured with plenty of rest.\xa0''Antibiotics won’t help you if you have viral infections.

What is group A Streptococcus (GAS)?,"'Group A ''Streptococcus'' is defined as a gram-positive bacterial genus composed of ''Streptococcus pyogenes'' ''strains''. Group A ''Streptococcus'' strains have a similar surface antigen recognized by specific laboratory tests, termed the Lancefield group A antigen. Lancefield groups (there are about 18 Lancefield groups) are composed of different ''Streptococcus'' species groups that have specific antigens and are distinguished by specific antibody tests. In addition, group A ''Streptococcus'' strains are beta-hemolytic (beta-hemolytic means the bacteria lyse ''red blood cells'' suspended in agar plates with secreted substances, see for example, Fig. 3). These tests are mentioned because they are frequently used to distinguish group A ''Streptococcus'' bacteria from group B, group C, and other ''Streptococcus'' groups. Group A ''Streptococcus'' bacteria appear as pairs and chains when gram-stained (see Fig. 1); these bacteria are also termed ""beta ''strep'', GAS, and GABHS."" Although these bacteria can harmlessly colonize people on their throat and skin, sometimes they can cause mild to serious diseases. GAS bacteria have been causing diseases in humans probably since humans first developed.''Streptococcus pyogenes'"" (GAS) bacteria have many components that contribute to the pathogen's ability to cause disease:""'Exotoxins cause the ''scarlet fever'' ''rash'', damage organs, may cause shock, and inhibit the human immune system, while the human immune system stimulators may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that likely play a role in the development of autoimmune responses that can lead to glomerulonephritis or acute ''rheumatic fever''. ''S. pyogenes'"" (GAS) has over 100 serotypes that may vary somewhat in their ability to produce the above components that contribute to the pathogenicity of each strain of the bacteria. In 2015, a new GAS strain, known as genotype emm89, was noted in the United Kingdom; the genetic changes seemed to enhance the strain's ability to cause disease and seems to be replacing older GAS genotypes."" Lipoteichoic acid on its surface helps the GAS bacteria to bind to epithelial cell membranes. M proteins (over 100 types on the GAS bacterial strains) help the bacteria resist immunologic host defenses. Exotoxins (for example, DNAses A, C and D, streptolysin S, proteinase, streptokinase, and pyrogenic exotoxins [A-D]) Human immune system stimulators (for example, streptolysin O, DNAse B, and hyaluronidase)"
How do people contract group A streptococcal (GAS) infections?,"'In most instances, GAS bacteria are contracted via person-to-person contact with ''mucus'', skin, or infected lesions. Spread of the GAS organisms occurs infrequently by items that have made contact with infected people. However, many people are colonized (have the bacteria on body surfaces but are not infected) with GAS bacteria. Infants and children often first acquire these organisms from their colonized mothers.' "
What diseases are caused by group A streptococcal infection?,"'There are a number of diseases that GAS organisms can cause. The predominant diseases are as follows:''This list is not exhaustive as GAS bacteria have been found in many other disease processes.

Are group A strep infections contagious?,"'In general, ''group A strep'' infections are contagious, but there are some qualifiers to this answer. For example, strep throat is contagious, but other infection types such as toxic shock syndrome are generally considered noncontagious; consequently, the answer depends on the specific type of infection and any extenuating circumstances.' "
What is the contagious period for group A strep infections?,"'For those infections that are considered to be contagious, the person is contagious in the incubation period (before any symptoms of the infection develop) and through the acute phase of the infection while the patient has symptoms. When symptoms stop, the person is usually noncontagious unless the individual becomes a carrier (colonized with group A strep but without symptoms).' "
What is the incubation period for group A strep infections?,'The incubation period for GAS pharyngitis and cellulitis varies from about one to five days. Other types of GAS infection may develop rapidly (necrotizing fasciitis) while others (scarlet fever) may take a week or more to develop.' 
What are the signs and symptoms of group A strep infections?,"'GAS infections can produce many different signs and symptoms:''Most of the diseases listed here for GAS infection usually occur after an initial pharyngitis, with necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock sometimes occurring without a detectable initial pharyngitis infection. Other disease processes involving GAS organisms (for example, meningitis, bone infections, ''pneumonia'', wound infections, and others) produce the typical symptoms associated with these disease processes and clinically are not unique for GAS or other pathogenic organisms.'   Pharyngitis (strep throat/tonsillitis): sore throat, irritation with swallowing, white patches on tonsils (exudates), swollen lymph nodes on the neck, fever; pharyngitis with fever and white patches on tonsils are important but not definitive signs of GAS pharyngitis. Scarlet fever: pharyngitis symptoms (see above), pastia (pink or red lines formed of confluent petechiae, which are small purple or red spots in the skin caused by minor blood vessel breaks) that are found in skin creases, especially the flexor surface of the elbow), fever, rash on neck and chest, then entire body with sandpaper texture, muscle aches, abdominal pain, swollen red tongue (strawberry tongue) Rheumatic fever: inflammation of the joints, heart valve damage Glomerulonephritis: inflammation of the kidneys, impaired kidney function Necrotizing fasciitis: tissue destruction that progresses rapidly Toxic shock syndrome: rapidly progressing organ failure with low blood pressure"
"What is invasive group A streptococcal disease? 
Who is most at risk for 
getting invasive GAS disease?","'Invasive GAS disease is when GAS organisms invade and infect organs or organ systems in the body (for example, GAS infections of the blood, muscle, fatty tissue, or the ''lungs''). These are serious infections, and the mortality rate (death rate) varies from about 10%-60%, depending on the area(s) of the body infected. The most severe forms of invasive GAS infections are with necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome described below. People at higher risk for getting invasive forms of GAS are individuals with chronic diseases and immunosuppressed patients (for example, ''cancer'', ''diabetes'', and ''renal failure'' patients, and people taking steroid-type medications). Most healthy people do not get this type of GAS disease, but if they have skin breaks (''cuts'', abrasions, recent surgical sites), these individuals have a higher risk of GAS disease than people without skin breaks.''Other patients who are at risk for invasive GAS disease are patients with GAS infections that can easily progress into deep fat and muscle (for example, a GAS infection near the scrotum or anus or an ''abscess'' in the skin) and can progress to necrotizing fasciitis. Toxic shock syndrome was initially found to be associated with vaginal infections secondary to tampon use (or inappropriate use such as leaving a tampon in the vagina for an extended time). However, any patient who has a wound or surgery that requires packing to reduce bleeding (for example, nasal packing for severe nose bleeding) is at increased risk for toxic shock syndrome. Toxic shock syndrome may also be caused by a different bacterium called ''Staphylococcus''.''Consequently, risk factors for GAS organisms to cause infection include suppression of the immune system (see above), open wounds or wound packing, or tampons that may promote GAS survival and proliferation. Children and the elderly are at higher risk to become infected with GAS.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of necrotizing fasciitis?,"'Early signs and symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis include fever, severe ''pain'', swelling, and erythema (redness) at the wound site or site where GAS organisms entered the body. The pain and swelling may extend well beyond the erythema. Skin changes may resemble cellulitis initially, but ulceration, scabs, and fluid draining from the site develop, sometimes rapidly (Fig. 3). GAS organisms then can spread to the bloodstream and the patient can develop ''bacteremia'' and ''septic shock'' with high fever and a low blood pressure. About 20% of patients with necrotizing fasciitis caused by GAS will die from the infection.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)?,"'Early symptoms of ''TSS'' are nonspecific and often begin with ''influenza''-like symptoms of mild fever and malaise. However, ''TSS'' often suddenly advances with symptoms of high fever, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', skin rash, and a low blood pressure. If it progresses, confusion, ''headaches'', ''seizures'', and skin loss from the palms of the hands and from the soles of the feet can occur. The blood pressure can become dangerously low so that body organs are not profused with enough blood, and if multiorgan failure develops, the patient often dies. The death rate varies widely, depending on how well the patient can respond to treatment. GAS bacteria and ''Staphylococcus aureus'' are the predominant bacteria that cause TSS.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose group A streptococcal (GAS) infections?,"'After a history and physical examination, many clinicians presumptively diagnose strep throat from its symptom production and throat appearance (see Fig. 2). However, cultures from the throat or other site of infection form the basis of definitive testing. For example, GAS organisms will grow on sheep blood agar plates that contain two different antibiotics and cause beta hemolysis (complete sheep blood red cell lysis to form a clear area) of the sheep red blood cells (see Fig. 3). In addition, there are rapid tests (RADT or rapid antigen detection test) that take only a few minutes to complete that detect a carbohydrate surface antigen produced by GAS, with specificity of about 95% or better and fairly good sensitivity of about 80%-90%.''Because there are many other groups of ''Streptococcus'' spp., positive identification of the infecting bacteria is necessary to separate out other bacteria that may cause some similar symptoms but may require a different workup, different treatment, and produce different complications.''These tests help distinguish GAS from ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' and other organisms.' "
What is the treatment for invasive group A streptococcal disease?,"'Antibiotics treat invasive GAS infections as well as noninvasive group A strep infections. Although many antibiotics may be adequate treatment for GAS infections, the best practice methods would be to determine antibiotic sensitivity of GAS bacteria to be sure the bacteria are susceptible to the antibiotics. Milder infections caused by GAS (strep throat, skin infections) are often treated with oral antibiotics (for example, ''penicillin v'' [Pen-Vee-K, ''Veetids''], ''amoxicillin'' [''Amoxil'', Dispermox, ''Trimox''], cephalosporins; if ''allergic'' to ''penicillins'', ''erythromycin'' [E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', Pce, Pediazole, Ilosone], ''azithromycin'' [''Zithromax'', ''Zmax'']). Some third-generation cephalosporins (for example, ceftriaxone [Rocephin]), given IV or IM, followed by oral antibiotics are useful to treat mild to moderate infections. However, invasive group A strep infections require a more aggressive treatment approach. High doses of ''penicillin'', together with ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin'') by sequential IV administration, are often recommended. Some investigators suggest adding immune globulin to the multi-antibiotic treatment.''In addition to antibiotics, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove dead and dying tissue to limit the spread of invasive GAS organisms. This is almost always done in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, early diagnosis and treatment of invasive GAS infections yield the best patient outcomes. Many clinicians consult with an infectious-disease specialist to help determine the best antibiotic therapy for individual patients. More GAS strains are being reported to have some resistance to one or more antibiotics so the treatment may require alterations in antibiotics. The infectious-disease specialist can help choose the most effective antibiotic combinations to treat antibiotic-resistant GAS organisms.'  "
What specialists treat group A streptococcal infections?,"'The specialists that treat group A streptococcal infections are infectious-disease specialists. However, depending on the severity and the type of infection, other specialists may be involved. For example, if hospitalization is needed, a critical care specialist may join the team; if the person is pregnant, an OB/GYN specialist and/or a pediatric specialist may be needed. If surgical debridement is needed (necrotizing fasciitis), a surgical specialist would be consulted. Other types of medical specialists that may care for patients with GAS infections include emergency-medicine specialists, dermatologists, internal-medicine specialists, family-medicine specialists, nephrologists, and ear, nose, and throat specialists.' "
What complications are seen with group A streptococcal infections?,"'Many of the complications of GAS infections are considered to be diseases themselves. For example, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, and many others can complicate or be triggered by GAS infection. Other post-streptococcal complications can include the necessity to remove tonsils, renal damage, abscess formation, seizures, and other organ damage; some researchers suggest that severe GAS infections in children may lead to permanent or long-lasting brain changes. Although GAS infections in pregnant females during ''pregnancy'' and delivery are infrequent, they require immediate treatment to avoid poststreptococcal complications such as ''endometritis'', ''sepsis'', necrotizing fasciitis, or toxic shock syndrome.' "
Is it possible to prevent group A streptococcal infections?,"'Many GAS infections can be prevented by reducing the spread of organisms from one person to another. Washing hands frequently is one of the major ways to reduce bacterial transmission. In addition, not sharing the same food and drink containers with others may also be effective. For those people with a GAS infection, covering the mouth and nose when ''sneezing'' or ''coughing'' can reduce the chance of transmitting the bacteria to others. Washing material that comes in contact with GAS-infected people is also another way to reduce exposure to GAS organisms.''Early treatment of deep infections (for example, excision, drainage, and antibiotic treatment of rectal abscesses) helps prevent invasive GAS disease. In addition, appropriate and timely removal of tampons and surgical packing may reduce the incidence of toxic shock syndrome.''Currently, there is no vaccine commercially available for GAS, but researchers are working on developing ''vaccines''. At least four different major approaches are being researched. There has been some success with a related experimental vaccine against GAS bacterial antigens coupled to ''cholera'' toxin subunits. However, the GAS vaccine, prepared by recombinant technology by Vaxent, a vaccine company, may be going into human ''clinical trials''. The new experimental ''vaccines'' may become available in the future to prevent GAS infections.' "
What is the prognosis for group A streptococcal infections?,"'The prognosis for mild GAS infections is usually good to excellent. The prognosis for patients with chronic diseases, such as ''diabetes'' or ''cancer'', or for those who are immunosuppressed, is more guarded, but often is still good with early treatment. However, the prognosis for patients developing necrotizing fasciitis or toxic shock syndrome ranges from good with early effective treatment to poor when the diseases are diagnosed and treated late in the disease process.'

What is group A Streptococcus (GAS)?,"'Group A ''Streptococcus'' is defined as a gram-positive bacterial genus composed of ''Streptococcus pyogenes'' ''strains''. Group A ''Streptococcus'' strains have a similar surface antigen recognized by specific laboratory tests, termed the Lancefield group A antigen. Lancefield groups (there are about 18 Lancefield groups) are composed of different ''Streptococcus'' species groups that have specific antigens and are distinguished by specific antibody tests. In addition, group A ''Streptococcus'' strains are beta-hemolytic (beta-hemolytic means the bacteria lyse ''red blood cells'' suspended in agar plates with secreted substances, see for example, Fig. 3). These tests are mentioned because they are frequently used to distinguish group A ''Streptococcus'' bacteria from group B, group C, and other ''Streptococcus'' groups. Group A ''Streptococcus'' bacteria appear as pairs and chains when gram-stained (see Fig. 1); these bacteria are also termed ""beta ''strep'', GAS, and GABHS."" Although these bacteria can harmlessly colonize people on their throat and skin, sometimes they can cause mild to serious diseases. GAS bacteria have been causing diseases in humans probably since humans first developed.''Streptococcus pyogenes'"" (GAS) bacteria have many components that contribute to the pathogen's ability to cause disease:""'Exotoxins cause the ''scarlet fever'' ''rash'', damage organs, may cause shock, and inhibit the human immune system, while the human immune system stimulators may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that likely play a role in the development of autoimmune responses that can lead to glomerulonephritis or acute ''rheumatic fever''. ''S. pyogenes'"" (GAS) has over 100 serotypes that may vary somewhat in their ability to produce the above components that contribute to the pathogenicity of each strain of the bacteria. In 2015, a new GAS strain, known as genotype emm89, was noted in the United Kingdom; the genetic changes seemed to enhance the strain's ability to cause disease and seems to be replacing older GAS genotypes."" Lipoteichoic acid on its surface helps the GAS bacteria to bind to epithelial cell membranes. M proteins (over 100 types on the GAS bacterial strains) help the bacteria resist immunologic host defenses.

How do people contract group A streptococcal (GAS) infections?,"'In most instances, GAS bacteria are contracted via person-to-person contact with ''mucus'', skin, or infected lesions. Spread of the GAS organisms occurs infrequently by items that have made contact with infected people. However, many people are colonized (have the bacteria on body surfaces but are not infected) with GAS bacteria. Infants and children often first acquire these organisms from their colonized mothers.'

What should I know about strep throat?," Strep throat is a type of infection caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria that results in a sore, inflamed throat. Most sore throats are caused by viruses, not strep bacteria. Symptoms of strep throat in adults, middle-aged children, and adolescents include:Sore throat (90%)Headache (85%)Fever (85%)Upset stomach (65%) Sore throat (90%) Headache (85%) Fever (85%) Upset stomach (65%) Symptoms of strep throat in infants and toddlers may also include a thick nasal discharge, reduced appetite, fussiness, and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms associated with an upper respiratory infection (a ""cold""), such as nasal congestion, muscle aches, and oral blisters, are typically absent with strep throat. Strep throat is highly contagious and is usually spread through direct person-to-person contact. The diagnosis of strep throat is established either via a rapid strep test (RADT) or a throat culture. Strep throat is cured with antibiotic therapy. While rare, there are several complications that may develop from a strep throat infection."
What is strep throat? What causes it?,"'Strep throat is a bacterial infection of the soft palate and tonsillar region. Microbiologists identify the member of the ''Streptococcus'' bacterial family that causes strep throat as ""GAS"" (Group A, beta hemolytic, ''Streptococcus pyogenes'').''Strep throat is most common in young children and adolescents, but it can also occur in toddlers and adults. Strep throat is highly contagious and it is present most commonly in the community during the winter months. Symptoms and physical signs of strep throat may vary depending upon the age of the person infected.'  "
How is strep throat spread? How long is it contagious?,"'Strep throat is highly contagious and is most commonly spread via direct person-to-person contact.''Strep throat will usually get better on its own within two to five days, however, you may start feeling better within a day or two after antibiotics are started. Strep throat remains contagious for the first 24 hours after starting antibiotics, so it is recommended that people stay home from work or school to avoid spreading the infection.'   The incubation period (the time it takes from exposure to the infection to the appearance of symptoms) for strep throat is two to five days. Passage of airborne droplets and/or saliva from the infected individual to another is the most likely mechanism of contracting strep throat. Close quarters (such as the home, classroom, day care centers, college dorms, etc.) provide an ideal environment for passage of strep bacteria from one person to another. The risk of contracting a strep throat infection is approximately 40% in household environments. Most infectious disease specialists believe that a patient is no longer contagious after 24 hours of effective antibiotic therapy. Spread of strep bacteria via food borne transmission is less common than direct person-to-person exchange of droplets or saliva. The exact likelihood of developing strep throat from family pets is unknown, but most experts believe it is minimal."
What are the common signs and symptoms of strep throat?,"'Signs of strep throat are not unique - many viral infections (which cause the majority of sore throats) can have identical signs and symptoms as a ''group A strep'' (GAS) infection. Typically, an older child and adolescent will experience symptoms such as:''Runny nose'', ''cough'', hoarse voice, muscle aches, ''diarrhea'' and oral blisters are generally not seen with a strep throat infection. These symptoms usually indicate a ''sore throat'' caused by a virus.''Adults with strep throat may have milder symptoms that may not prompt a medical evaluation unless an exposure history to strep throat is known.'

What are other signs and symptoms of strep throat?,"'Other signs and symptoms of strep throat infection may include:''While most patients with strep throat will experience these signs and symptoms, not all will necessarily be present in each individual.' Redness of the soft palate, uvula (the ""punching bag"" structure hanging from the back of the soft palate), and tonsils. Commonly, the tonsils may have a bumpy look on their surface - somewhat like a golf ball White or yellow colored spots on the tonsils (tonsillar exudate) Petechiae (look like 1-2 mm bright red ""dots"" which represent ruptured capillaries) scattered on the soft palate Enlarged and tender neck lymph nodes (also known as lymph glands) A diffuse rash over the torso and groin region. The classic description of this rash is that it looks like ""goose bumps on a moderate sunburn"". The presence of a strep infection and this specific rash is termed scarlet fever. This diagnosis does not imply a more severe strep infection or imply any change in prognosis or management. The rash is not contagious. Some indivduals who develop acarlet fever may also experience peeling of the skin of the finger tip pads."
Are the signs and symptoms of strep throat in infants and toddlers?,"'The information above is seen in those most likely to have a strep throat infection, including older children and teenagers. However, other age groups may experience some different symptoms with a strep throat infection.' Infants with strep throat more commonly have a thick nasal discharge, low grade fever (< 101 F [38.33 C]), reduction in appetite, and fussiness. Toddlers (children from one to three years of age) with strep throat may complain of a sore throat and a subsequent decrease in appetite, and swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck beneath the mandible (lower jaw bone)."
What tests diagnose strep throat?,"'There are two common tests used to diagnose strep throat the rapid strep test (RADT) and traditional throat culture.''The traditional test, a throat culture, involves obtaining a swab from the back of the throat and tonsils. It takes approximately 24 to 48 hours to determine the presence or absence of the group A strep bacteria. This test is typically more accurate in diagnosing strep throat than the rapid strep test.''The rapid strep and throat culture tests are designed to determine whether an individual currently has a strep throat infection. Sometimes it may be necessary to determine whether a patient has had a recent history of a strep infection. In that case, two blood tests are available:''The antibodies that these tests are sensitive to are not commonly present until a few weeks following an acute strep infection. These tests may be ordered when evaluating a patient who may have developed delayed complications (such as ''rheumatic fever'' or glomerulonephritis) after a strep throat infection.'   Many medical offices, clinics, and hospital emergency departments use a rapid strep test (RADT - rapid antigen detection test) to diagnose strep throat. A throat swab is obtained from the back of the throat and tonsils, and a RADT ""kit"" is employed to help determine the presence or absence of the strep bacteria. The turn around time for results of the test generally is 10 minutes. RADT tests are about 70%-95% accurate in determining the presence of strep bacteria. Most guidelines recommend that a negative rapid strep test be confirmed with a throat culture, which can take a few days to get the results. Antibiotic pretreatment prior to obtaining a throat swab for strep bacteria can interfere with throat culture results, and thus the ability to correctly diagnose and treat a strep throat infection. Antibiotic treatment prior to a rapid strep test is less likely to have a false negative result since the test is designed to document the presence or absence of the GAS bacteria. Residual dead bacteria in the patient may allow a positive result. ASO (antistreptolysin O) titer Anti-DNase titer"
How is strep throat treated?,'Treatment of a strep throat infection includes the use of antibiotics and ''over-the-counter'' medications and home remedies for the reduction of symptoms.' 
What natural and home remedies help soothe strep throat pain?,"'There are a number of home remedies that may be used to reduce the symptoms of strep throat. They may be used whether the patient has strep throat or a viral cause of their illness. These remedies should not be used in lieu of a complete course of antibiotics if a strep infection is being treated. Home remedies to soothe symptoms of strep throat include:'

   Saltwater gargle: mix ¼ to ½ teaspoon with 8 ounces of warm water. Young children may accidently swallow the solution instead of gargling it and should thus avoid this approach. Throat lozenges may be sucked on to reduce the symptoms of pain or throat dryness. Some lozenges contain topical anesthetics. Very young children should not be given throat lozenges, as they may be a choking hazard. Throat sprays that contain topical pain relievers (benzocaine, phenol) may be used to relieve sore throat pain, though lozenges often provide more long-lasting relief. Hot or cold foods and drinks: Ice cream, smoothies, popsicles, cold drinks, warm (not hot) broth-based soup, and warm tea with honey may help soothe the sore throat. Honey should be avoided in infants less that 1 year of age because of their increased likelihood of botulinum toxicity and paralysis."
What over-the-counter (OTC) medication soothes strep throat pain?,"'Several over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'' and ''Motrin'') can be used to lower the fever and provide pain relief for the sore throat. ''Aspirin'' should not be used in children or adolescents because of its association with Reye syndrome.' "
What antibiotics are prescribed to treat strep throat?,"'Antibiotics provide the mainstay for successfully treating a strep throat infection.''If a woman contracts strep throat during ''pregnancy'', the same types of antibiotics are typically used for treatment. All penicillin-type and cephalosporin-type antibiotics are considered safe for ''pregnant'' women. Because fever is a common symptom of strep throat, pregnant women are advised to take fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Aspirin and ''NSAID''’s should be avoided during pregnancy. Consult your doctor if you are pregnant and you think you have strep throat, and follow your doctor’s instructions for medication use.''Strep throat is typically diagnosed and treated by a primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, an internist, or a child’s pediatrician. If you go to a hospital’s emergency department, you will be seen by an ''emergency medicine'' specialist.''If you have recurring or chronic strep throat, you may be referred to an otolaryngologist, sometimes referred to as an ENT (ear, nose, and throat specialist) for treatment.' The group A strep bacteria are generally susceptible to the penicillin family, for example,amoxicillin (Amoxil), andthe cephalosporin family, for example, cephalexin (Keflex), cefprozil (Cefzil), cefdinir (Omnicef) and others. amoxicillin (Amoxil), and the cephalosporin family, for example, cephalexin (Keflex), cefprozil (Cefzil), cefdinir (Omnicef) and others. Members of the macrolide family, for example, erythromycin (E-mycin), azithromycin (Zithromax) and clarithromycin (Biaxin) generally are felt to be less effective than the other two classes of antibiotics, but are used in individuals with moderate penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. If such a patient cannot tolerate the macrolide family, clindamycin (Cleocin) is an alternative and very effective antibiotic option. Regardless of what antibiotic is prescribed, it is important to finish the entire course of the antibiotic. Most patients will experience a rapid reduction in signs and symptoms within 24 to 48 hours of starting antibiotic therapy. Viral throat infections do not require antibiotics since they provide no benefit."
What are potential complications of strep throat?,"'The possible complications of strep throat include:' Middle ear infection (otitis media) Toxic shock syndrome (a rare severe complication which may result in multiple organ failure and sometimes death) Peritonsillar abscess or retropharyngeal abscess (a walled-off collection of pus) containing GAS bacteria which typically requires drainage Acute rheumatic fever (ARF): While rare, this complication of an untreated or inadequately treated strep infection can have devastating and lifelong consequences. It is believed that due to incomplete eradication of the strep bacteria, certain GAS organisms cause an immune response, which may attack the joints leading to permanent arthritis. More concerning is the autoimmune response to the heart valves, which may damage them and may result in heart failure. Many studies have shown that effective and appropriate antibiotic therapy for strep throat vastly reduces the likelihood of developing ARF. Glomerulonephritis: Similar to the abnormal immune response seen with ARF, antibodies may develop and damage the microscopic filters (glomeruli) of the kidney. This complication more commonly affects children between 7 to 10 years of age. While more common than acute rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis has a less serious prognosis. Effective treatment exists and most children make a complete recovery and do not experience any long-term kidney damage. Unlike ARF, the development of glomerulonephritis is not necessarily prevented by effective antibiotic treatment. PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Strep): Specialists debate the proposed link of a GAS infection in children with the development and/or worsening of obsessive-compulsive behaviors or tic disorder (Tourette's syndrome in the extreme). One area being researched in this controversial condition is whether antibiotic therapy effects the development of, or the severity of, the disorder."
How can I prevent contracting strep throat?,"'There is no ''vaccine'' currently available to prevent strep throat, but there are several behaviors to lessen the likelihood of developing a strep throat infection. These include:'

   Avoid people with sore throats, and especially those with documented strep throat, until they have taken antibiotics for more than 48 hours. Wash your hands frequently after using items which may harbor the group A strep bacteria (for example, dishes and utensils). Don't share food or drinks with a sick individual. Encourage ill individuals to cover their nose and mouth when they sneeze or cough."
Why is identification of streptococcal infection important?,"'Patients benefit both immediately and potentially in the long-term by rapid confirmation of ''streptococcal'' cause of their sore throat. Antibiotic treatment provides a quicker reduction of symptoms, shortens the duration of illness and quickly, and efficiently eliminates the possibility of spread of infection to others. ' Although rare, serious consequences of
	streptococcal infections do 
occur. Rheumatic fever is associated with
	heart, 
	joint and nervous 
system damage and is preventable by rapid treatment of strep disease.  Serious kidney disease that may result in 
	kidney failure may also be a consequence of 
	streptococcal infection.  A throat infection due to strep needs antibiotic 
therapy initiated as 
rapidly as possible. The rapid strep test facilitates this goal."
Why is the rapid test better?,"'By comparison with culture methods, a rapid strep test is much quicker and can produce results within minutes.' "
What is the traditional test for strep throat?,'The traditional test for a strep throat has been a throat culture. The major drawback of a throat culture is that the results take two to three days due to the time necessary to allow enough GAS bacteria to grow to enable accurate identification.' 
What is a rapid strep test?,"""The rapid strep test is a quick and accurate diagnostic tool used to determine whether or not strep bacteria are present in the patient's throat. The same test may be used to evaluate for the presence of ""'Streptococci'' in other infected areas (for example, perianal infection in either gender, or vulvar infection in pre-pubertal girls).'  "
How is a rapid strep test done?,"'Obtaining a specimen is the same whether your doctor will do a throat culture or rapid test for strep. A cotton swab (similar to a Q-tip) is quickly rubbed over both ''tonsils'' as well as the back wall of the mouth (the posterior pharynx). It is important to avoid contact with other structures inside the mouth such as the tongue or cheeks. The swab is then placed in a specialized container and the rapid test performed. Many people find that obtaining the swab produces a gagging sensation. However, since the entire swabbing process lasts less than five seconds this inconvenience is minimal.' "
What are the limitations of the rapid strep test?,"'There are several manufactures of rapid strep tests. Each manufacturer has designed their test to respond only to the presence of the particular ''streptococcal'' bacteria (Group A) responsible for strep throat. Other bacteria which are less much less likely to cause sore throats are not identified by the rapid strep test. ' The test will not 
detect viral causes of sore throat.  A positive test response occurs when a 
reaction occurs between a protein on the surface of strep bacteria and chemicals in the 
test materials. Either living or dead strep bacteria will produce a 
positive reaction.  Most rapid strep tests have a
	sensitivity of 95%, meaning that 
the test will be positive in 95 of 100 patients who are documented to have strep 
throat via throat culture obtained at the same time. Since 5 of 100 patients 
with strep throat will be missed using a rapid strep test, all negative swab 
specimens should be sent for culture to confirm the absence of strep bacteria. 
	 A 
positive culture requires antibiotics.  The rapid strep test has a 98%
	specificity. This 
means that 98 of 100 positive tests correctly indicate the 
presence specifically of Group A streptococcus bacteria; 2 of 100 positive 
results are ""false positives"" - indicative of similarities between various surface
	proteins found on strep bacteria and other non-strep bacteria found in the 
mouth."
What causes stress?,"""Stress is a fact of nature in which forces from the inside or outside world affect the individual, either one's emotional or physical well-being, or both. The individual responds to stress in ways that affect the individual, as well as their environment. Due to the overabundance of stress in our modern lives, we usually think of stress as a negative experience, but from a biological point of view, stress can be a neutral, negative, or positive experience.""""In general, stress is related to both external and internal factors. External factors include the physical environment, including your job, your relationships with others, your home, and all the situations, challenges, difficulties, and expectations you're confronted with on a daily basis. Internal factors determine your body's ability to respond to, and deal with, the external stress-inducing factors. Internal factors which influence your ability to handle stress include your nutritional status, overall health and ""'fitness'' levels, emotional well-being, and the amount of ''sleep'' and rest you get.''Stress has driven evolutionary change (the development and natural selection of species over time). Thus, the species that adapted best to the causes of stress (stressors) have survived and evolved into the plant and animal kingdoms we now observe.''Man is the most adaptive creature on the planet because of the evolution of the human brain, especially the part called the neo-cortex. This adaptability is largely due to the changes and stressors that we have faced and mastered. Therefore, we, unlike other animals, can live in any climate or ecosystem, at various altitudes, and avoid the danger of predators. Moreover, we have learned to live in the air, under the sea, and even in space, where no living creatures have ever survived. So then, what is so bad about stress?' "
A brief history of stress,"'A key to the understanding of the negative aspects of stress is the concept of ''milieu interieur'' (the internal environment of the body), which was first advanced by the French physiologist Claude Bernard. In this concept, he described the principles of dynamic equilibrium. In dynamic equilibrium, constancy, a steady state (situation) in the internal bodily environment, is essential to survival. Therefore, external changes in the environment or external forces that change the internal balance must be reacted to and compensated for if the organism is to survive. Examples of such external forces include temperature, oxygen concentration in the air, the expenditure of energy, and the presence of predators. In addition, diseases are also stressors that threaten the constancy of the ''milieu interieur''.''The ''neurologist'' Walter Cannon coined the term ''homeostasis'' to further define the dynamic equilibrium that Bernard had described. He also was the first credited with recognizing that stressors could be emotional, as well as physical. Through his experiments, he demonstrated the ""fight or flight"" response that man and other animals share when threatened. Further, Cannon traced these reactions to the release of powerful neurotransmitters from a part of the adrenal gland, the medulla. (Neurotransmitters are the body\'s chemicals that carry messages to and from the nerves.) The adrenal medulla secretes two neurotransmitters, epinephrine (also called adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), in the response to stress. The release of these neurotransmitters leads to the physiologic effects seen in the fight or flight response, for example, a rapid ''heart'' rate, and increased alertness.'""Hans Selye, another early scientist who is known for his studies of stress, extended Cannon's observations. He included the ""'pituitary gland'', a small gland at the base of the brain, as part of the body\'s stress response system. He described how this gland controls the secretion of hormones (for example, cortisol) that are important in the physiological response to stress. Additionally, Selye actually introduced the term stress from physics and engineering and defined it as ""mutual actions of forces that take place across any section of the body, physical or psychological.""''In his experiments, Selye induced stress in rats in a variety of ways. He found typical and constant psychological and physical responses to the adverse situations that were imposed on the rats. In rats exposed to constant stress, he observed enlargement of the adrenal glands, gastrointestinal ulcers, and a wasting away (atrophy) of the immune (defense) system. He called these responses to stress the general adaptation (adjustment) or stress syndrome. He discovered that these processes, which were adaptive (healthy, appropriate adjustment) and normal for the organism in warding off stress, could become much like illnesses. That is, the adaptive processes, if they were excessive, could damage the body. This observation, then, was the beginning of an understanding of why stress, really overstress, can be harmful, and why the word stress has earned such a bad name.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of poorly managed stress?,"'Excess stress can manifest itself in a variety of emotional, behavioral, and even physical symptoms, and the symptoms of stress vary enormously among different individuals.''Common somatic (physical) symptoms often reported by those experiencing excess stress include''Symptoms of many preexisting medical conditions can also worsen during times of stress. Emotional and behavioral symptoms that can accompany excess stress include''Of course, none of these signs or symptoms means for certain that there is an elevated stress level since all of these symptoms can be caused by other medical and/or psychological conditions.''It is also known that people under stress have a greater tendency to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as excessive use or abuse of alcohol and drugs, ''cigarette smoking'', and making poor ''exercise'' and nutritional choices, than their less-stressed counterparts. These unhealthy behaviors can further increase the severity of symptoms related to stress, often leading to a ""vicious cycle"" of symptoms and unhealthy behaviors.''The experience of stress is highly individualized. What constitutes overwhelming stress for one person may not be perceived as stress by another. Likewise, the symptoms and signs of poorly managed stress will be different for each person.'   sleep disturbances or changes in sleeping habits (insomnia or sleeping too much), muscle tension, muscle aches, headache, gastrointestinal problems, and fatigue. nervousness, anxiety, changes in eating habits including overeating or undereating (leading to weight gain or loss), loss of enthusiasm or energy, and mood changes, like irritability and depression."
Who is most vulnerable to stress? What are the risk factors for stress?,"'Stress comes in many forms and affects people of all ages and all walks of life. No external standards can be applied to predict stress levels in ''individuals -- one'' need not have a traditionally stressful job to experience workplace stress, just as a parent of one child may experience more ''parenting'"" stress than a parent of several children. The degree of stress in our lives is highly dependent upon individual factors such as our physical health, the quality of our interpersonal relationships, the number of commitments and responsibilities we carry, the degree of others' dependence upon us, expectations of us, the amount of support we receive from others, and the number of changes or traumatic events that have recently occurred in our lives.""'However, it is possible to make some generalizations. People with adequate or strong social support networks report less stress and overall improved ''mental health'' in comparison to those without adequate social support. People who are poorly nourished, who get inadequate sleep, or who are physically unwell also have a reduced capacity to handle pressures and stresses of everyday life and may report higher stress levels. Some stressors are particularly associated with certain age groups or life stages. Children, ''teens'', the newly married, working parents, single parents, and seniors are examples of the groups who often face common stressors related to life transitions.' "
Teen stress,"'As one example of stress related to a life transition, the teen years often bring about an increase in perceived stress as young adults learn to cope with increasing demands and pressures along with changes in their bodies. Studies have shown that excessive stress during the teen years can have a negative impact upon both physical and mental health later in life. For example, teen stress is a risk factor for the development of ''teen depression'', a serious condition that carries an increased risk of ''suicide''.''Fortunately, effective stress-management strategies can diminish the ill effects of stress. The presence of intact, strong, supportive social support networks among friends, family, educational and religious or other group affiliations can help reduce the subjective experience of stress during the teen years. Recognition of the problem and helping teens develop stress-management skills can also be valuable preventive measures. In severe cases, a physician or other health-care professional can recommend counseling or other treatments that can reduce the long-term risks of teen stress.'  "
What is the healthy response to stress?,"'A key aspect of a healthy adaptational response to stress is the time course. Responses must be initiated rapidly, maintained for a proper amount of time, and then turned off to ensure an optimal result. An over-response to stress or the failure to shut off a stress response can have negative biological and mental-health consequences for an individual. Healthy human responses to stress involve three components:''The combined results of these three components of the stress response maintain the internal balance (homeostasis) and optimize energy production and utilization. They also gear up the organism for a quick reaction through the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS operates by increasing the heart rate, increasing ''blood pressure'', redirecting blood flow to the heart, muscles, and brain and away from the gastrointestinal tract, and releasing fuel (glucose and fatty acids) to help fight or flee the danger.' The brain handles (mediates) the immediate response. This response signals the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and norepinephrine. The hypothalamus (a central area in the brain) and the pituitary gland initiate (trigger) the slower maintenance response by signaling the adrenal cortex to release cortisol and other hormones. Many neural (nerve) circuits are involved in the behavioral response. This response increases arousal (alertness, heightened awareness), focuses attention, inhibits feeding and reproductive behavior, reduces pain perception, and redirects behavior."
How does the response to stress work?,"'While the complete story is not fully known, scientists understand much about how the response to stress works. The two main systems involved are the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). (These systems are described later.) Triggered (activated) primarily by an area in the brain stem (lowest part of brain) called the locus coeruleus, the SNS results in the secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine. The following are the five most important concepts to remember about these two systems:' They are governed by a feedback loop to regulate their response. (In a feedback loop, increased amounts of a substance -- for example, a hormone -- inhibit the release of more of that substance, while decreased amounts of the substance stimulate the release of more of that substance.) They interact with each other. They influence other brain systems and functions. Genetic (inherited) variability affects the responses of both systems. (That is, depending on their genes, different people can respond differently to similar stresses.) Prolonged or overwhelming responses of these systems can be harmful to an individual."
What is the role of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (grouping) in stress?,"'The HPA axis is a grouping of responses to stress by the brain and the pituitary and adrenal glands. First, the hypothalamus (a central part of the brain) releases a compound called corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), which was discovered in 1981. The CRF then travels to the pituitary gland, where it triggers the release of a hormone, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is released into the bloodstream and causes the cortex of the adrenal gland to release the stress hormones, particularly cortisol, which is a ''corticosteroid'"" hormone. Cortisol increases the availability of the body's fuel supply (carbohydrate, fat, and glucose), which is needed to respond to stress. However, if cortisol levels remain elevated for too long, then muscle breaks down, there is a decreased inflammatory response, and suppression of the immune (defense) system occurs.""'Corticosteroids'' in measured doses are used to treat many illnesses that are characterized by inflammation or an overactive immune system, such as ''asthma'' and ''inflammatory bowel disease''. For the same reason, they are used to help reduce the chances that our body will immunologically reject a transplanted organ. Corticosteroids also can cause fluid retention and ''high blood pressure''. Therefore, it is critical that the response to corticosteroids be carefully controlled (modulated). This control usually is accomplished by a feedback mechanism in which increased cortisol levels feeding back to the hypothalamus and pituitary turn off production of ACTH. In addition, extremely high levels of cortisol can cause mental changes, including ''depression'' and psychosis, which disappear when the levels return to normal.' "
What is the role of the locus coeruleus in stress?,"'The locus coeruleus has many connections to other parts of the brain, particularly areas that bring in and process sensory information (information from sight, ''hearing'', smell, taste, and touch). The locus coeruleus secretes norepinephrine and stimulates other brain centers to do the same. It is like the ''pacemaker'' (meaning it controls the tempo) of the brain. Thus, it increases arousal (heightened awareness, alertness) and vigilance (watchfulness, carefulness) and adjusts (modulates) the action of the autonomic nervous system, which includes the SNS. The autonomic nervous system regulates blood flow, heart rate, blood pressure, and ''breathing'' (''respiration''). It can also temporarily shut down the gastrointestinal (GI) and sexual systems until the crisis or stressful event is over. These initial reactions, to get our blood flowing, heart pumping, and muscles energized, occur very quickly and automatically.' "
How do the connections in the brain work in stress?,"""The HPA axis and the locus coeruleus systems are linked through the hypothalamus and an area of the brain known as the limbic system. The limbic system is the control area for emotion and the processing area for memory. These linkages are critical. For example, if you see the bushes rustling, your locus coeruleus immediately gets the stress response rolling. However, when you see that it is not a mountain lion but a golden retriever in the bushes, your memory of the tameness of the dog will turn off the stress response. Similarly, if a person is nervous before a public-speaking engagement and the first minute or two goes well, this happy feeling will turn down the activity of the locus coeruleus. These internal adjustments are why experienced public speakers often start off with a joke. It's as much to calm themselves (if the joke goes well) as it is to entertain you.""'The connections also include the endogenous (within the body) opiate (opium-like) system and the reward (''dopamine'') system. Thereby, during stress, pain is reduced and an extremely happy feeling (''euphoria'') may result. These connections partially account for ""runner\'s high"" and have a great deal to do with why we like roller coasters and scary movies.'""Here's how the connections work. The limbic system performs an emotional analysis and memory review of the information provided by the senses. Then, the multiplicity of connections allows us to determine whether the current stress is""'All of this internal activity must occur in milliseconds, and it does.' one that has been mastered in the past and successfully adapted to, not a threat at all, or a clear and present danger."
What do we know about using (activating) and overusing our internal systems that respond to stress?,"'Animal and human research has taught us much about our internal stress systems. When laboratory animals are exposed to a prolonged stress (usually food deprivation, mild electrical stimulation of the foot, or handling), they develop a stress syndrome. This syndrome consists of ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), ''loss of appetite'', ''weight loss'', muscle wasting, gastrointestinal ulcers, loss of reproductive function, suppression of the immune system, and ''depression''. Researchers also noticed that stress of long duration (chronic stress) sensitizes the stress system (makes it more responsive to stress). That is, the system then overresponds to new stressors. They further noticed that the administration of certain drugs, such as ''amphetamines'' or ''cocaine'', could also sensitize the stress response. Moreover, constant stress increases the self-administration of drugs in laboratory animals. So, a vicious cycle is induced. The more stress there is, the more mice seek the drugs, and the more the sensitivity (increased responsiveness) to stress is increased!''Early separation from the mother has also been seen as another potent stressor in animals. Such separation has been linked to increased levels of the stress hormones that cause the stress syndrome, which includes ''depression''. Studies in humans are under way to evaluate how maternal stress, even early in the ''pregnancy'', can affect the developing fetus.'""Why might maternal stress affect the fetus? The answer is the communication of the blood circulations of the mother and the fetus. From the mother's blood, the fetus gets both the good (for example, nutrients and oxygen) and the bad. The bad components of the blood can include alcohol, ""'nicotine'', illicit drugs, some prescription medications, and stress chemicals such as cortisol and norepinephrine.'""These animal and human studies seem to indicate that excessive stress leads to depression. In other words, chronic stress in the mother's womb (in utero) or early deprivation (separation from the mother) might even predispose a person to developing the psychiatric syndrome of ""'clinical depression'' in later life. Furthermore, other experiments show that the administration of stress hormones can actually decrease brain connections and even the number of brain cells in crucial areas, such as the limbic system. This loss of brain connections and cells then can lead to further maladaptive (inadequate adjustment) responses to stress.'""What's more, some particular kinds of stress seem to be even more detrimental than other types. That is, some types of stress can actually lead to diseases. For example, stresses that are unpredictable and uncontrollable seem to be the greatest culprits. On the other hand, stresses with which we can cope and master are not necessarily bad. In fact, we can learn from these stresses, predict their recurrence, and develop action plans to reduce or avoid them in the future. In this way, some stresses can actually trigger new personality growth and biologically induced adaptive (healthy adjustment) changes. Indeed, much of ""'psychotherapy'' is empirically (guided by practical experience rather than theory) based upon this concept.' "
What are the effects of stress on medical and psychological conditions?,"'There is now evidence that points to abnormal stress responses as causing or contributing to various diseases or conditions. These include ''anxiety'' disorders, depression, and ''substance abuse''. Stress can affect virtually any organ system, being associated with conditions as diverse as skin ''rashes'' or ''hives'', ''high blood pressure'', ''cardiovascular disease'', certain gastrointestinal diseases, some ''cancers'', and even the process of ''aging'' itself. Stress also seems to increase the frequency and severity of ''migraine'' ''headaches'', episodes of ''asthma'', and fluctuations of blood ''sugar'' in people with ''diabetes''. There also is scientific evidence showing that people experiencing psychological stress are more prone to developing colds and other infections than their less-stressed peers. Overwhelming psychological stress (also called ''trauma'') can cause both temporary (transient) and long-lasting (chronic) symptoms of a serious psychiatric illness called ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD'').'  "
Conclusions about the effects of stress,"'Uncontrollable, unpredictable, and constant stress has far-reaching consequences on our physical and mental health. Stress can begin in the womb and recur throughout life. One of the potential pathological (abnormal) consequences of stress is a learned helplessness that leads to the hopelessness and helplessness of clinical depression, but in addition, many illnesses, such as chronic ''anxiety'' states, ''high blood pressure'', ''heart disease'', and addictive disorders, to name a few, also seem to be influenced by chronic or overwhelming stress.''Nature, however, has provided us with efficient processes (mechanisms) to cope with stressors through the HPA axis and the locus coeruleus/sympathetic nervous system. Furthermore, research has shown us the biological processes that explain what we all intuitively know is ''true -- which'' is, that too much stress, particularly when we cannot predict it or control its recurrence, is harmful to our health.' "
"What can people do for stress 
management? What are home remedies to combat stress symptoms?","'If we think about the causes of stress, the nature of the stress response, and the negative effects of some types of stress (prolonged, unexpected, or unmanageable stress), several healthy management strategies and home remedies to combat the effects of stress become clear. An important step in ''stress management'' and treatment of stress-related symptoms is exercise. Since the stress response prepares us to fight or flee, our bodies are primed for action. Unfortunately, however, we usually handle our stresses while sitting at our desk, standing at the watercooler, or behind the wheel stuck in traffic. Exercise on a regular basis helps to turn down the production of stress hormones and associated neurochemicals. Thus, exercise can help avoid the damage to our health that prolonged stress can cause. In fact, studies have found that exercise is a potent ''antidepressant'', anxiolytic (combats ''anxiety''), and sleeping aid for many people.''For centuries in Eastern religious traditions, the benefits of meditation and other relaxation techniques have been well known. Now, Western medicine and psychology have rediscovered that particular wisdom, translated it into simple nonspiritual methods, and scientifically verified its effectiveness. Thus, one or two 20-30 minute meditation sessions a day can have lasting beneficial effects on health. Indeed, advanced meditators can even significantly control their blood pressure and heart rate as well.''Elimination of ''drug abuse'"" (both illegal drugs and prescription medications have the potential for abuse) and no more than moderate alcohol use are important for the successful management of stress. We know that people, when stressed, seek these outlets, but we also know that many of these substances sensitize (make even more responsive) the stress response. As a result, small problems produce big surges of stress chemicals. What's more, these attempts with drugs and alcohol to mask stress often prevent the person from facing the problem directly. Consequently, they are not able to develop effective ways to cope with or eliminate the stress.""'In fact, even prescription drugs for treatment of anxiety, such as ''diazepam'' (''Valium''), ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan''), ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin''), or ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax''), can be counterproductive in the same way. Therefore, these medications should only be used cautiously under the strict guidance of a physician. If, however, stress produces a full-blown psychiatric problem, like ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), clinical depression, or anxiety disorders, then psychotropic medications, particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are extremely useful. Examples of SSRIs include ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro'').''We know that chronic or uninterrupted stress is very harmful. It is important, therefore, to take breaks and ''decompress'"". Take a lunch break and don't talk about work. Take a walk instead of a coffee break. Use weekends to relax, and don't schedule so many events that Monday morning will seem like a relief. Learn to recognize and respond to your stress signals. Take regular vacations or even long weekends or mental-health days at regular intervals.""'Create predictability in one\'s work and home life as much as possible. Structure and routine in one\'s life can\'t prevent the unexpected from happening. However, they can provide a comfortable framework from which to respond to the unexpected. Think ahead and try to anticipate the varieties of possibilities, good and bad, that may become realities at work or home. Generate scenarios and response plans. One might find that the ""unexpected"" really doesn\'t always come out of the blue. With this kind of preparation, it\'s possible to turn stress into a positive force to work for growth and change.''For those who may need help dealing with stress, stress-management counseling in the form of individual or group therapy is offered by various mental-health-care providers. Stress counseling and group discussion therapy have proven to reduce ''stress symptoms'' and improve overall health and attitude.'  "
What's in the future for stress?,"'Stress is part of life and will always be around. The keys to dealing with stress are appropriate control of stressors and management of our physical (physiological) and mental (psychological) responses. In this regard, critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) involves discussing the traumatic event as soon as possible after the event. Although it is thought to help lessen extreme (pathological) reactions to stress and often prevent PTSD in its worst forms for some individuals, other research has called its effectiveness into question. Hopefully, the circumstances in which CISD can be useful can be clearly delineated and this approach to stress management can be translated into helpful strategies for managing the more common (normal) types of stress.''We all have slightly different stress responses because of our genetic ''makeup'"". In the future, perhaps we will be able to alter our genes (for example, if we are genetically determined to be over- or underreactors to stress). In fact, the field of pharmacogenetics (medicines that enter the cells' DNA and turn on or off certain genes) is very promising for the area of stress and health."" "
Heart disease and stress introduction,"'Are ''stress'' and ''heart disease'' related? Does ''stress'' increase the risk of ''heart disease''? Stress is a normal part of life. But if left unmanaged, stress can lead to emotional, psychological, and even physical problems, including:\xa0' heart disease, high blood pressure, chest pains, or irregular heart beats."
How Does Stress Increase the Risk for Heart Disease?,"""Medical researchers aren't sure exactly how stress increases the risk of heart disease. Stress itself might be a risk factor, or it could be that high levels of stress make other risk factors (such as ""'high cholesterol'' or ''high blood pressure'') worse. For example, if you are under stress, your ''blood pressure'' goes up, you may overeat, you may ''exercise'' less, and you may be more likely to smoke.''If stress itself is a risk factor for heart disease, it could be because chronic stress exposes your body to unhealthy, persistently elevated levels of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. Studies also link stress to changes in the way ''blood clots'', which increases the risk of ''heart attack''.' "
Does Stress Affect Everyone the Same?,"'No. People respond in different ways to events and situations. One person may find an event joyful and gratifying, but another person may find the same event miserable and frustrating. Sometimes, people may handle stress in ways that make bad situations worse by reacting with feelings of anger, guilt, fear, hostility, ''anxiety'"", and moodiness. Others may face life's challenges with ease."" "
What Causes Stress?,"'Stress can be caused by a physical or emotional change, or a change in your environment that requires you to adjust or respond. Things that make you feel stressed are called ""stressors.""''Stressors can be minor hassles, major lifestyle changes, or a combination of both. Being able to identify stressors in your life and releasing the tension they cause are the keys to managing stress.''Below are some common stressors that can affect people at all stages of life.' Illness, either personal or of a family member or friend. Death of a friend or loved one. Problems in a personal relationship. Work overload. Starting a new job. Unemployment. Retirement. Pregnancy. Crowds. Relocation. Daily hassles. Legal problems. Financial concerns. Perfectionism."
What Are the Warning Signs of Stress?,"""When you are exposed to long periods of stress, your body gives warning signals that something is wrong. These physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral warning signs should not be ignored. They tell you that you need to slow down. If you continue to be stressed and you don't give your body a break, you are likely to develop health problems like heart disease. You could also worsen an existing illness."" "
How Can I Cope With Stress?,"""After you've identified the cause of stress in your life, the next step is to learn techniques that can help you cope with stress while fighting heart disease. There are many techniques you can use to manage stress. Some of which you can learn yourself, while other techniques may require the guidance of a trained therapist.""'Some common techniques for coping with stress include:' Eat and drink sensibly. Abusing alcohol and food may seem to reduce stress, but it actually adds to it. Assert yourself. You do not have to meet others' expectations or demands. It's OK to say ""no."" Remember, being assertive allows you to stand up for your rights and beliefs while respecting those of others. Stop smoking. Aside from the obvious health risks of cigarettes, nicotine acts as a stimulant and brings on more stress symptoms. Exercise regularly. Choose non-competitive exercise and set reasonable goals. Aerobic exercise has been shown to release endorphins (natural substances that help you feel better and maintain a positive attitude.) Relax every day. Choose from a variety of different techniques (see below). Take responsibility. Control what you can and leave behind what you cannot control. Reduce causes of stress. Many people find life is filled with too many demands and too little time. For the most part, these demands are ones we have chosen. Effective time-management skills involve asking for help when appropriate, setting priorities, pacing yourself, and taking time out for yourself. Examine your values and live by them. The more your actions reflect your beliefs, the better you will feel, no matter how busy your life is. Set realistic goals and expectations. It's OK, and healthy, to realize you cannot be 100% successful at everything all at once. Sell yourself to yourself. When you are feeling overwhelmed, remind yourself of what you do well. Have a healthy sense of self-esteem. Get enough rest. Even with proper diet and exercise, you can't fight stress effectively without rest. You need time to recover from exercise and stressful events. The time you spend resting should be long enough to relax your mind as well as your body. Some people find that taking a nap in the middle of the day helps them reduce stress."
How Can I Keep a Positive Attitude?,"""A positive attitude and self-esteem are good defenses against stress and heart disease because they help you view stress as a challenge rather than a problem. A positive attitude keeps you in control when there are inevitable changes in your life. A positive attitude means telling yourself there are things you can do to improve certain situations and admitting that sometimes there's nothing you can do. To maintain a positive attitude during a stressful situation (or to prepare yourself for a potentially stressful situation), keep these tips in mind:"" Stay calm. Stop what you're doing. Breathe deeply. Reflect on your choices. Always tell yourself you can get through the situation. Try to be objective, realistic and flexible. Try to keep the situation in perspective. Think about the possible solutions. Choose one that is the most acceptable and feasible. Think about the outcome: Ask yourself, what is the worst possible thing that can happen? (Chances are that won't happen) Tell yourself that you can learn something from every situation."
How Can I Reduce My Stressors?,"'While it is impossible to live your life completely stress-free, it is possible to reduce the harmful effects of certain stressors on you and your heart. Here are some suggestions:' First identify the stressor. What's causing you to feel stressed? Avoid hassles and minor irritations if possible. If traffic jams cause you stress, try taking a different route, riding the train or bus, or car-pooling. When you experience a change in your life, try to continue doing the things that you enjoyed before the change occurred. Learn how to manage your time effectively, but be realistic and flexible when you plan your schedule. Do one thing at a time; concentrate on each task as it comes. Take a break when your stressors compile to an uncontrollable level. Ask for help if you feel that you are unable to deal with stress on your own."
How Can I Learn How to Relax?,"""In order to cope with stress, especially if you have heart disease, you need to learn how to relax. Relaxing is a learned skill -- it takes commitment and practice. Relaxation is more than sitting back and being quiet. Rather, it's an active process involving techniques that calm your body and mind. True relaxation requires becoming sensitive to your basic needs for peace, self-awareness, and thoughtful reflection. The challenge is being willing to meet these needs rather than dismissing them.""'There are a number of relaxation techniques, including:'""Once you find a relaxation method that works for you, practice it every day for at least 30 minutes. Taking the time to practice simple relaxation techniques gives you the chance to unwind and get ready for life's next challenge.""'Can What I Eat Help Fight Stress? ''Your body is able to fight stress and heart disease better when you take the time to eat well-balanced meals. Eat a variety of foods each day, including lean meats, fish, or poultry, enriched or whole grain breads and cereals, fruits and vegetables, and low-fat dairy products.''About 55%-60% of your daily intake of calories should come from carbohydrates, no more than 25%-30% from of your caloric intake should come from fat and 10%-15% should come from protein.' Deep breathing. Imagine a spot just below your navel. Breathe into that spot, filling your abdomen with air. Let the air fill you from the abdomen up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. With every long, slow exhalation, you should feel more relaxed. Progressive muscle relaxation. Switch your thoughts to yourself and your breathing. Take a few deep breaths, exhaling slowly. Mentally scan your body. Notice areas that feel tense or cramped. Quickly loosen up these areas. Let go of as much tension as you can. Rotate your head in a smooth, circular motion once or twice. (Stop any movements that cause pain!) Roll your shoulders forward and backward several times. Let all of your muscles completely relax. Recall a pleasant thought for a few seconds. Take another deep breath and exhale slowly. You should feel relaxed. Guided Imagery. Guided imagery, or mental imagery relaxation, is a proven form of focused relaxation that helps create harmony between the mind and body. Guided imagery coaches you in creating calm, peaceful images in your mind -- a ""mental escape."" Identify your self-talk, that is, what you are saying to yourself about what is going on with your illness or situation. It is important to identify negative self-talk and develop healthy, positive self-talk. By making affirmations, you can counteract negative thoughts and emotions. Relax to music. Combine relaxation exercises with your favorite music. Select the type of music that lifts your mood or that you find soothing or calming. Some people find it easier to relax while listening to specially designed relaxation audio tapes, which provide music and relaxation instructions. Biofeedback. Biofeedback helps a person learn stress-reduction skills by using various instruments to measure temperature, heart rate, muscle tension, and other vital signs as a person attempts to relax. The goal of biofeedback is to teach you to monitor your own body as you relax. It is used to gain control over certain bodily functions that cause tension and physical pain. If a headache, such as a migraine, begins slowly, many people can use biofeedback to stop the attack before it becomes full blown. Yoga. Many types of yoga teach you how to relax while also helping posture and flexibility. Consult with your doctor before starting a yoga program."
Guidelines for Healthy Eating to Fight Stress," Eat a wide variety of healthy foods. Eat in moderation -- control the portions of the foods you eat. Reach a healthy weight and maintain it. Eat at least 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Eat food that is high in dietary fiber such as whole grain cereals, legumes, and vegetables. Minimize your daily fat intake. Choose foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Limit your consumption of sugar and salt. Limit the amount of alcohol that you drink. Make small changes in your diet over time. Combine healthy eating habits with a regular exercise program."
What if Sleep Problems Are Contributing to my Stress,"'If you cannot ''sleep'"" and it's causing you stress or making it worse, try these tips:"" Establish a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Make sure your bed and surroundings are comfortable. Arrange the pillows so you can maintain a comfortable position. Keep your bedroom dark and quiet. Use your bedroom for sleeping only; don't work or watch TV in your bedroom. Avoid napping too much during the day. At the same time, remember to balance activity with rest during recovery. If you feel nervous or anxious, talk to your spouse, partner, or a trusted friend. Get your troubles off your mind. Listen to relaxing music. Talk to your doctor before taking any sleeping aid. Take diuretics or ""water pills"" earlier, if possible, so you don't have to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. If you can't sleep, get up and do something relaxing until you feel tired. Don't stay in bed worrying about when you're going to fall asleep. Avoid caffeine. Don't exercise within two to three hours of bedtime."

How Do I Keep Track Of My Medical Information?," Do not be afraid to ask your doctor, nurse, or other healthcare provider to repeat any instructions or medical terms that you don't understand. Your healthcare providers should always be available to answer your questions and address your concerns. Make use of resources and support services offered by your hospital and in the community.

What is stress?,"'Stress may be considered as any physical, chemical, or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental unrest and that may be a factor in causing disease. Physical and chemical factors that can cause stress include ''trauma'', infections, toxins, illnesses, and injuries of any sort. Emotional causes of stress and tension are numerous and varied. While many people associate the term ''stress'' with psychological stress, scientists and physicians use this term to denote any force that impairs the stability and balance of bodily functions.''If stress disrupts body balance and function, then is all stress bad? Not necessarily. A mild degree of stress and tension can sometimes be beneficial. For example, feeling mildly stressed when carrying out a project or assignment often compels us to do a good job, focus better, and work energetically.''Likewise, exercising can produce a temporary stress on some body functions, but its health benefits are indisputable. It is only when stress is overwhelming, or poorly managed, that its negative effects appear.''An important goal for those under stress is the ''management'' of life stresses. ''Elimination'"" of stress is unrealistic, since stress is a part of normal life. It's impossible to completely eliminate stress, and it would not be advisable to do so. Instead, we can learn relaxation techniques and other methods to manage stress so that we have control over our stress and its effects on our physical and ""'mental health''.'  "
Who is most susceptible to stress?,"'Stress comes in all forms and affects people of all ages and all walks of life. No external standards can be applied to predict stress levels in individuals -- one need not have a traditionally stressful job to experience workplace stress, just as a parent of one child may experience more stress related to ''parenting'"" than a parent of several children. The degree of stress in our lives is highly dependent upon individual factors such as our physical health, the quality of our interpersonal relationships, the number of commitments and responsibilities we carry, the degree of others' dependence upon and expectations of us, the amount of support we receive from others, and the number of changes or traumatic events that have recently occurred in our lives.""' However, certain factors can enhance our susceptibility to stress or act to reduce its severity. People with strong social support networks (consisting of family, friends, religious organizations, or other social groups) report less stress and overall improved mental health in comparison to those without these social contacts. People who are poorly nourished, who get inadequate ''sleep'', or who are physically unwell also have reduced capabilities to handle the pressures and stresses of everyday life and may report higher stress levels. Some stressors are particularly associated with certain age groups or life stages. Children, ''teens'', college students, working parents, and seniors are examples of the groups who often face common stressors related to life transitions.''People who are providing care for elderly or infirm loved ones may also experience a great deal of stress as caregivers. Having a loved one or family member who is under a great deal of stress often increases our own stress levels as well.' "
"What are the symptoms and effects of excess stress or ""out-of-control"" stress?","'Manifestations of excess or poorly managed stress can be extremely varied. While many people report that stress induces ''headaches'', ''sleep'' disturbances, feelings of ''anxiety'' or tension, anger, or ''concentration problems'', others may complain of ''depression'', lack of interest in food, ''increased appetite'', or any number of other symptoms. In severe situations, one can experience overwhelming stress to the point of so-called ""burnout,"" with loss of interest in normal activities.''Scientific studies have shown that psychological stress may worsen the symptoms of almost every known medical condition. Examples of conditions in which stress may worsen the intensity of symptoms include cardiovascular diseases, ''asthma'', ''multiple sclerosis'', ''chronic pain'', ''acne'', ''fibromyalgia'', and ''depression''. While stress alone is not a cause of ''cardiovascular disease'' nor ''high blood pressure'', it may actually worsen the progression of these diseases in many people.''Stress also has effects on the immune system. While some studies show that acute short-term stresses may actually be able to boost the body\'s immune response, chronic (long-term) stress has the effect of ""wearing down"" the immune system, leading to an increased susceptibility to colds and other infections. Scientific studies have also shown that stress can decrease the immune response to ''vaccinations'' and prolong ''wound'' healing.' "
What can I do to better manage stress?,"""In general, stress is related to both external and internal factors. External factors include your physical environment, your job, relationships with others, your home, and all the situations, challenges, difficulties, and expectations you're confronted with on a daily basis. Internal factors determine your body's ability to respond to, and deal with, the external stress-inducing factors. Internal factors which influence your ability to handle stress include your nutritional status, overall health and ""'fitness'' levels, emotional well-being, your ability to control stress through relaxation techniques or other strategies, and the amount of sleep and rest you get.''Managing stress, therefore, can involve learning tips to change the external factors which confront you or the internal factors which strengthen your ability to deal with what comes your way.' "
Exercise,"'Exercise'' can be a key, central method to compensate for stressors. Physical exercise not only promotes overall ''fitness'', but it helps you to manage emotional stress and tension as well. Exercise can also aid in relaxation and improve sleep. For one thing, exercise can emotionally remove one temporarily from a stressful environment or situation. Being fit and healthy also increases your ability to deal with stress as it arises.' "
Relaxation techniques and meditation,"""There are many ways to use structured relaxation techniques to help control stress and improve your physical and mental well-being. While some types of meditation and relaxation therapies are best learned in a class, it's also possible to learn meditation techniques on your own. There are literally hundreds of different types of relaxation methods ranging from audio CDs to group martial arts and ""'fitness'' classes. The following are only examples of the types of structured programs available that can increase our capacity for relaxation:'  Autogenic training: Developed in the early 20th century, this technique is based upon passive concentration and awareness of body sensations. Through repetition of so-called autogenic ""formulas"" one focuses upon different sensations, such as warmth or heaviness, in different regions of the body. Autogenic training has been used by physicians as a part of therapy for many conditions. Popular in Europe (where it is even covered by some insurance plans), this method is currently gaining acceptance in the United States. No particular physical skills or exercises are involved; however, people desiring to learn this technique must be prepared to invest time and patience. Since this technique is slightly more complex than some relaxation methods, a course is generally the best way to learn the method. Biofeedback: Biofeedback is one method of learning to achieve relaxation, control stress responses, or modify the body's reactions through the use of monitoring equipment that provides information from the body which would normally not be available. This method is based upon the principle first advanced in the early 1960s that the autonomic nervous system (the part we don't consciously use) is trainable. For example, instruments can be used to measure heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, stomach acidity, muscle tension, or other parameters while people experiment with postural changes, breathing techniques, or thinking patterns. By receiving this feedback, one can learn to identify the processes that achieve the desired result, such as reduction in heart rate and blood pressure. Biofeedback is used by many practitioners for a variety of psychological and physical conditions. Because the technique involves the use of measuring devices, it can only be performed by a professional. Imagery: Imagery, sometimes referred to as guided imagery, is the use of pleasant or relaxing images to calm the mind and body. By controlling breathing and visualizing a soothing image, a state of deep relaxation can occur. This method can be learned by anyone and is relatively easy to try out. Meditation techniques: Ranging from practices associated with specific religions or beliefs to methods focusing purely on physical relaxation, meditation is one of the most popular techniques to achieve physical and mental relaxation. There are thousands of different types of meditation, and many can be learned on your own. The meditative state is one in which there is a deep centering and focusing upon the core of one's being; there is a quieting of the mind, emotions, and body. The meditative state can be achieved through structured (as in a daily practice of a routine) or unstructured (for example, while being alone outdoors) activities. While teachers of meditative arts are readily available, some techniques can be learned though books or online tutorials. A form of meditation popularized for several decades is transcendental meditation (TM). TM has the goal of achieving transcendental consciousness (the simplest form of awareness). It is practiced for 15-20 minutes in the mornings and evenings and is relatively easy to learn. Numerous classes and teaching materials are available for beginners. Another variant of a meditation technique has gained popularity in the U.S. since its description in the 1970s by Harvard physician Herbert Benson. This technique involves generation of the so-called relaxation response through the repetition of a word of phrase while quietly seated, 10-20 minutes per day. Designed to evoke the opposite bodily reaction to the stress response (or ""fight or flight"" reaction), this method carries no religious or spiritual overtones. Its value has been documented in the reduction of blood pressure and other bodily stress responses. Like other forms of meditation, it can be learned on one's own, but time and practice are required to elicit the desired relaxation state. Progressive muscle relaxation: Progressive muscle relaxation is a method developed in the 1930s in which muscle groups are tightened and then relaxed in succession. This method is based upon the idea that mental relaxation will be a natural outcome of physical relaxation. Although muscle activity is involved, this technique requires no special skills or conditioning, and it can be learned by almost anyone. Progressive muscle relaxation is generally practiced for 10-20 minutes a day. As with the relaxation response, practice and patience are required for maximum benefits.  Qigong: The martial art qigong is an ancient Chinese health-care system that combines physical training (such as isometrics, isotonics, and aerobic conditioning) with Eastern philosophy and relaxation techniques. There are many different kinds of qigong, including medical qigong. Some forms are practiced while standing, sitting, or lying down; others involve structured movements or massage. Over 70 million Chinese practice some form of qigong daily. Qigong has been used for centuries in China for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions. Learning qigong involves time, commitment, patience, and determination, and learning from a master or group is advisable. Since this technique involves physical exertion, check with your doctor before beginning, particularly if you have a chronic medical condition or are over 40 years old.  Tai chi: Like qigong, tai chi is a Chinese martial art. It has been termed a kind of ""meditation in motion"" and is characterized by soft, flowing movements that stress precision and force. Also known as tai chi chuan, this method is thousands of years old. As with qigong, training from a master is necessary to learn the art of tai chi. Again, since motion and force are required, check with your doctor before beginning training.  Yoga: There are many forms of yoga, an ancient Indian form of exercise based upon the premise that the body and breathing are connected with the mind. The practice of yoga is thought to be over 5,000 years old. One goal of yoga is to restore balance and harmony to the body and emotions through numerous postural and breathing exercises. Yoga, which means ""joining"" or ""union"" in Sanskrit, has been called the ""search for the soul"" and the ""union between the individual and the divine."" Among the benefits of yoga are increased flexibility and capability for relaxation. No special level of conditioning is required; yoga can be learned by nearly anyone. Classes, books, and videos are widely available. Those with special or chronic physical conditions will want to get clearance from their doctor before beginning."
Other stress-management strategies; Time management,"""Good time-management skills are critical for effective stress control. In particular, learning to prioritize tasks and avoid over-commitment are critical measures to make sure that you're not overscheduled. Always using a calendar or planner and checking it faithfully before committing to anything is one way to develop time-management skills. You can also learn to identify time-wasting tasks by keeping a diary for a few days and noticing where you may be losing time. ""'For example, productivity experts recommend setting aside a specific time (or multiple times) each day to check and respond to email and messages rather than being a continual slave to incoming information. Banishing procrastination is another time-management skill that can be learned or perfected. ' "
Organizational skills,"""If your physical surroundings (office, desk, kitchen, closet, car) are well organized, you won't be faced with the stress of misplaced objects and clutter. Make it a habit to periodically clean out and sort through the messes of paperwork and clutter that accumulate over time."" "
Support systems,"'People with strong social support systems experience fewer physical and emotional symptoms of stress than their less-connected counterparts. Loved ones, friends, business associates, neighbors, and even pets are all part of our social networks. Cultivating and developing a social support network is healthy for both body and mind.' "
How can I get help with stress management?,"""If you feel you can't cope with or manage stress on your own or you are faced with unbearable stress, remember that there are resources to help. "" Check in with your doctor. Stress can take its toll on your body, increasing your susceptibility to infections and worsening the symptoms of practically any chronic condition. Stress alone can also be a cause of numerous physical symptoms. Your physician will be able to assess the effects that stress may be having on your physical functioning and can recommend ways to combat these negative influences. Remember to be honest about the extent of stress you are experiencing. In severe cases of short-term life stress, your doctor can talk with you about the possibility of medications to help alleviate the short-term symptoms. He or she can also suggest relaxation techniques and provide advice on stress-reduction strategies that are most appropriate for you. Your doctor is also an excellent referral source should you decide to seek a counselor or therapist. Consider counseling. Stress-management counseling is offered by various types of mental-health professionals. Stress counseling and group-discussion therapy have proven benefits in reduction of stress symptoms and improvement in overall health and attitude. Counseling doesn't have to be a long-term commitment, but some people will benefit from a series of stress-counseling sessions from a qualified therapist. He/she can help you identify the problem areas in your life and work on strategies to control your most stressful moments or situations. The very act of talking to an impartial and supportive observer can also be a great way to unleash tension and worry. Spend time with those you love. Countless studies show that people with a balanced, happy social support structure (consisting of friends, family, loved ones, or even pets) experience fewer stress-related symptoms and are better stress managers than people without social support. Your loved ones are also in an excellent position to observe your lifestyle and offer suggestions and help when you need it.  Take a course. Many relaxation programs, meditation techniques, and methods for emotional and physical relaxation are actually learned processes that can be acquired most quickly through a class or course with a competent instructor. An added benefit is that you will meet others with similar goals and interests. "
What is coronary heart disease?,"'Coronary ''heart disease'' or''coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') is  ''atherosclerosis'' (plaque in artery walls) of the inner lining of the blood vessels that supply blood to the ''heart''. A similar term, ''arteriosclerosis'' which means hardening or stiffening of the arteries is sometimes interchanged with atherosclerosis by some authors. Coronary ''heart disease'' is a common form of ''heart disease'' and is a major cause of illness and death. Coronary heart disease begins when hard ''cholesterol'' substances (plaques) are deposited within a coronary artery. The coronary arteries arise from the ''aorta'', which is adjacent to the heart. The plaques narrow the internal diameter of the arteries (Figure1) which may cause a tiny clot to form which can obstruct the flow of blood to the heart muscle (Figure 2). Symptoms of coronary heart disease include:'  chest pain (angina pectoris) from inadequate blood flow to the heart;  heart attack, from the sudden total blockage of a coronary artery; or  sudden death, due to a fatal rhythm disturbance. "
What is the purpose of screening tests for coronary heart disease?,"'In many individuals, the first symptom of coronary heart disease is heart attack or sudden death, with no preceding ''chest pain'' as a warning. For this reason, doctors perform screening tests to detect signs of coronary heart disease before serious medical events occur so the tests are designed to detect plaque (Figure 1) before a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (Figure 2). Screening tests are of particular importance for people with risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include a family history of coronary heart disease at relatively young ages, an abnormal serum cholesterol profile,''cigarette smoking'', elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), and ''diabetes mellitus''. '  "
"What are common initial screening tests for 
coronary heart disease?","'EKG'' (''Electrocardiogram'', ECC)''An electrocardiogram (EKG, ECC) usually is the first and most simple test used to look for any coronary heart disease signs. Unless the person is actively having a heart attack, which often is seen as an electrical change in the heart rhythm (ST segment elevation), the EKG may show electrical changes such as ST depressions or Q waves that suggest the patient has coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease with signs of a previous heart attack. An EKG often encourages the physician to proceed with initial screening test(s).''Initial screening for coronary heart disease commonly involves stressing the heart under controlled conditions. These ''stress'' tests are able to detect the presence of flow-limiting blockages in the coronary arteries, generally in the range of at least a 50% reduction in the diameter of at least one of the three major coronary arteries. There are two basic types of ''stress'' tests; those that involve exercising the patient to stress the heart (''exercise'' cardiac stress tests), and those that involve chemically stimulating the heart directly to mimic the stress of ''exercise'' (physiologic stress testing). Physiologic stress testing can be used for patients who are unable to exercise.' "
Exercise cardiac stress test (treadmill stress test or ECST),"'Exercise cardiac stress testing'"" (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac stress test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol, with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at three minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes (for example, ST segment depressions) may be observed in the EKG, as well as in the response of the heart rate and blood pressure. ""'The accuracy of the ECST in predicting significant coronary heart disease is variable, depending in part on the ""pre-test likelihood"" of coronary heart disease (also known as Bayes\' theorem). In a person at high risk for coronary heart disease (for example, advanced age, multiple coronary risk factors), an abnormal ECST is very predictive of the presence of coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate). However, a relatively normal ECST may not reflect the absence of significant disease in a person with the same risk factors. Conversely, in a person with a low-risk, a normal ECST is very predictive of the absence of significant coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate), but an abnormal test may not reflect the true presence of coronary heart disease (so-called ""false-positive ECST""). The ECST may either miss the presence of significant coronary heart disease, or be a false-positive test, due to a variety of cardiac circumstances, which may include: ''When the doctor determines that the results of the ECST do not accurately reflect the presence or absence of significant coronary heart disease, additional tests are often used to clarify the condition. These additional options include radionuclide isotope injection and ''ultrasound of the heart'' (stress ''echocardiography'') during the stress test.' An abnormal EKG at rest, which may be due to 
abnormal serum electrolytes, abnormal cardiac electrical conduction, or certain medications, such as digitalis; Heart conditions not related to coronary heart disease, such as mitral valve prolapse or hypertrophy (increased size) of the heart; or An inadequate increase in the heart rate and/or blood pressure during exercise."
Radionuclide stress test,"'Radionuclide stress testing involves injecting a radioactive isotope (typically ''thallium'"" or cardiolite) into the patient's vein after which an image of the patient's heart becomes visible with a special camera. The radioactive isotopes are absorbed by the normal heart muscle. Nuclear images are obtained in the resting condition, and again immediately following exercise. The two sets of images are then compared. During exercise, if a blockage in a coronary artery results in diminished blood flow to a part of the ""'cardiac muscle'', this region of the heart will appear as a relative ""''cold'' spot"" on the nuclear scan. This cold spot is not visible on the images that are taken while the patient is at rest (when coronary flow is adequate). Radionuclide stress testing, while more time-consuming and expensive than a simple ECST, greatly enhances the accuracy in diagnosing coronary heart disease. ' "
Stress echocardiography,"'Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ''ultrasound'' are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the ''left ventricle'' (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of coronary heart disease, if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant coronary heart disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. ''What if a person is unable to exercise adequately for an exercise cardiac stress test?''Many people are unable to exercise maximally for stress testing due to a variety of conditions including ''arthritis'', severe lung disease, severe cardiac disease, orthopedic conditions, and diseases of the nervous system. In such individuals, pharmacological stress testing is often used. ' "
Pharmacologic stress test,"'During a pharmacologic stress test, certain medications are administered which stimulate the heart to mimic the physiologic effects of exercise. One of these medications is dobutamine, which is similar to adrenaline. Dobutamine is carefully administered to gradually increase the heart rate and strength of the contractions of the heart muscle. Simultaneously, echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is performed. ''Alternatively, a medicine called adenosine is administered, which simulates the physiology of the coronary artery circulation during exercise. Adenosine is combined with radionuclide isotope imaging to provide a very accurate test for the detection of significant coronary heart disease. A newer agent, regadenoson (Lexiscan), is often used as it seems to be better tolerated. Pharmacological stress testing is commonly performed in individuals who are thought to be at high risk for significant coronary heart disease and who are scheduled for major non-cardiac surgical procedures. These people often are unable to perform exercise stress testing due to the underlying condition for which they require surgery. In this setting, pharmacological stress testing is invaluable in assessing the cardiac risk of patients prior to surgery. ' "
"Are there other tests for 
coronary heart disease that are noninvasive?","'A new noninvasive test for the detection of coronary heart disease is electron beam ''computerized tomography'"" (EBCT), or calcium scoring. Unlike the above mentioned stress tests that measure the heart's physiology, EBCT is designed to measure calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. ""'In individuals with coronary heart disease, the plaques which make up the blockages contain significant amounts of calcium, which can be detected with the CT scanner and the amount of blockage is calculated by calcium scoring. This test will identify calcium in blockages as mild as 10%-20%, which would not be detected by standard physiological testing. When such mild blockages are detected, however, the only recommended therapy is risk factor modification (cholesterol lowering and cessation of ''smoking'' if applicable), and adjunctive use of ''aspirin'' and certain ''vitamins''; such therapy would be advised in all persons with risk factors for coronary heart disease, regardless of the results of any noninvasive tests. ''Calcium scoring may be very helpful in convincing people to change their lifestyle or take their medicines, as a score that is not zero implies that the blockage process is starting, and likely will progress unless lifestyle changes are made. It is important to realize that calcification is a function of age, and in younger people (men under 50, women under 60) the calcium score is less helpful when low. ''A more elaborate modality is CT ''angiography'' (ultrafast CT). This is a non-invasive (no catheter involved) form of ''angiogram'', but still involves dye exposure and ''radiation'', and is less precise than a ''coronary angiogram''. This is still a rather new modality, and its role is still being defined.'  "
What is the most accurate method of defining coronary heart disease?,"'The ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of coronary heart disease remains the coronary angiogram. ''Coronary angiography'' can be used to identify the exact location and severity of coronary heart disease; it is described below.' "
Coronary angiography,"'During a coronary angiogram (also termed a coronary catheterization), a small catheter (a thin hollow tube with a diameter of 2-3 mm) is inserted through the skin into an artery usually in either the groin or the arm. Guided with the assistance of a fluoroscope (a special X-ray viewing instrument), the catheter is then advanced to the opening of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart. Next, a small amount of radiographic contrast (a solution containing ''iodine'', which is easily visualized with X-ray images) is injected into each coronary artery. The images that are produced are called the angiogram. ''Angiographic images accurately reveal the extent and severity of all coronary arterial blockages. Coronary angiography is performed with the use of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation, and is generally not terribly uncomfortable. The procedure takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. After the procedure, the catheter is removed and the artery in the leg or arm is sutured, ""sealed,"" or treated with manual compression to prevent bleeding. There is a small risk of serious complications from coronary angiography, as it is an ""invasive"" test, but in the hands of experienced physicians, this risk is quite small (well below one per cent). In appropriate patients, the therapeutic information learned from the angiogram is far more valuable than the relatively small risk of the procedure.''For patients with severe ''angina'' or heart attack (''myocardial infarction''), or those who have markedly abnormal noninvasive tests for coronary heart disease, the angiogram also helps the doctor select the optimal treatment, which may include medications, ''balloon angioplasty'', coronary ''stent'' placement, or ''coronary bypass'' surgery. The coronary angiogram is the only test which allows the precise quantification of the extent and severity of coronary heart disease to optimally make these treatment decisions.' "
Conclusions,"'For the purpose of screening for coronary heart disease, each person should discuss their particular coronary heart disease ""risk factor profile"" with the doctor in order to decide if screening tests are indicated and which test is most appropriate. The doctor will have detailed information regarding what testing involves and the implications of the results for each individual.' "
Why is identification of streptococcal infection important?,"'Patients benefit both immediately and potentially in the long-term by rapid confirmation of ''streptococcal'' cause of their sore throat. Antibiotic treatment provides a quicker reduction of symptoms, shortens the duration of illness and quickly, and efficiently eliminates the possibility of spread of infection to others. ' Although rare, serious consequences of
	streptococcal infections do 
occur. Rheumatic fever is associated with
	heart, 
	joint and nervous 
system damage and is preventable by rapid treatment of strep disease.  Serious kidney disease that may result in 
	kidney failure may also be a consequence of 
	streptococcal infection.  A throat infection due to strep needs antibiotic 
therapy initiated as 
rapidly as possible. The rapid strep test facilitates this goal."
Why is the rapid test better?,"'By comparison with culture methods, a rapid strep test is much quicker and can produce results within minutes.' "
What is the traditional test for strep throat?,'The traditional test for a strep throat has been a throat culture. The major drawback of a throat culture is that the results take two to three days due to the time necessary to allow enough GAS bacteria to grow to enable accurate identification.' 
What is a rapid strep test?,"""The rapid strep test is a quick and accurate diagnostic tool used to determine whether or not strep bacteria are present in the patient's throat. The same test may be used to evaluate for the presence of ""'Streptococci'' in other infected areas (for example, perianal infection in either gender, or vulvar infection in pre-pubertal girls).'  "
How is a rapid strep test done?,"'Obtaining a specimen is the same whether your doctor will do a throat culture or rapid test for strep. A cotton swab (similar to a Q-tip) is quickly rubbed over both ''tonsils'' as well as the back wall of the mouth (the posterior pharynx). It is important to avoid contact with other structures inside the mouth such as the tongue or cheeks. The swab is then placed in a specialized container and the rapid test performed. Many people find that obtaining the swab produces a gagging sensation. However, since the entire swabbing process lasts less than five seconds this inconvenience is minimal.' "
What are the limitations of the rapid strep test?,"'There are several manufactures of rapid strep tests. Each manufacturer has designed their test to respond only to the presence of the particular ''streptococcal'' bacteria (Group A) responsible for strep throat. Other bacteria which are less much less likely to cause sore throats are not identified by the rapid strep test. ' The test will not 
detect viral causes of sore throat.  A positive test response occurs when a 
reaction occurs between a protein on the surface of strep bacteria and chemicals in the 
test materials. Either living or dead strep bacteria will produce a 
positive reaction.  Most rapid strep tests have a
	sensitivity of 95%, meaning that 
the test will be positive in 95 of 100 patients who are documented to have strep 
throat via throat culture obtained at the same time. Since 5 of 100 patients 
with strep throat will be missed using a rapid strep test, all negative swab 
specimens should be sent for culture to confirm the absence of strep bacteria. 
	 A 
positive culture requires antibiotics.  The rapid strep test has a 98%
	specificity. This 
means that 98 of 100 positive tests correctly indicate the 
presence specifically of Group A streptococcus bacteria; 2 of 100 positive 
results are ""false positives"" - indicative of similarities between various surface
	proteins found on strep bacteria and other non-strep bacteria found in the 
mouth."
What are stretch marks?,"'Stretch marks appear as linear streaks on the skin that has been overstretched, and they run perpendicular to maximum lines of tension in the skin. They begin as flat red lines, and they appear as slightly ''depressed'' white streaks over time. They tend to occur near the armpits, on the thighs, abdomen, chest, buttocks, and groin. Their appearance is similar to changes seen in the surface of rubber balloons that have been overinflated.' "
What causes stretch marks?,"'There is some controversy over the precise mechanism by which striae occur. There seems to be damage to the elastic fibers of the dermis (the deeper layer of the skin) accompanied by inflammation which eventually results in atrophic ''scar''-like changes. Excessive physical stretching of the skin appears to induce these changes. There are a number of clinical situations that will predispose the skin to the formation of striae. These include rapid and excessive increase in body mass (''weight gain''), the excessive use of topical or systemic glucocorticoid ''drugs'"" (steroids), Cushing's disease (overproduction of glucocorticoids by the adrenal gland), ""'puberty'', ''Marfan syndrome'' and ''Ehlers-Danlos syndrome'' (two uncommon genetic diseases), excessively large breasts or ''breast implants'', and pregnancy.' "
What are risk factors for stretch marks?,'Excessive rapid weight gain and pregnancy are the two most common risk factors. Other risk factors include the conditions described above that predispose the skin to developing stretch marks.' 
What are symptoms and signs of stretch marks?,'Striae are rarely painful or ''itchy''. They do not produce troublesome symptoms. They begin as linear red streaks and eventually mature into linear white lines.' 
How do health care providers diagnose and assess stretch marks?,"'Since stretch marks are quite common, most people are familiar with their appearance. They are identifiable on visual inspection by patients and doctors.' "
What is the treatment for stretch marks?,"'There is a wide variety of treatments, but none of them seem to be particularly valuable in preventing or treating this condition. Medical professionals generally agree that there is no good medical evidence that any creams or ointments will produce any sustained improvement in the appearance of stretch marks. The use of physical modalities such as lasers, ''ultrasound'', and microneedling holds some promise, but currently there is little compelling evidence that any treatment is safe and effective.'  "
Are there any home remedies for stretch marks?,"'No, there is no evidence that any home remedies can improve the appearance of stretch marks.' "
What is the prognosis of stretch marks?,"'As the striae mature, they become less apparent but they rarely disappear. They do not cause any health problems.' "
Is it possible to prevent stretch marks?,"'Aside from maintaining a normal weight and avoiding the long-term use of potent topical steroids under occlusion (wrapping and securing the skin after application of steroid preparations) or oral steroid drugs, little can be done to prevent stretch marks from developing.' "
What is Schatzki's ring? What causes it?,"""Schatzki (Schatzki's) ring is described a smooth, benign (non-cancerous), circumferential, and narrow ring of tissue in the lower end of the ""'esophagus'' (the food pipe that connects the mouth to the stomach). Schatzki rings are common and are located just above the junction of the esophagus with the stomach. The cause of Schatzki rings is not clearly understood. Some doctors believe they are caused by long-term damage from reflux of stomach acid (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'', ''GERD'').' "
What are Schatzki's ring symptoms and signs?,"'The majority of these rings cause no symptoms, and people do not know they are there. As the diameter of these rings shrinks; solid, poorly chewed food, for example, steak, turkey, or hotdogs, that stays in chunks can get caught at the level of the ring. This occurs when the diameter of the ring reaches approximately 1 cm (0.4 inches).''Rarely, food becomes impacted (the food cannot pass nor can it be regurgitated). Symptoms of impacted food in the throat include''A flexible endoscope has to be inserted through the mouth into the esophagus to extract the impacted food to relieve the obstruction.'   The person with Schatzki ring then experiences chest pain or sticking sensation in the chest with swallowing (referred to as dysphagia). When the chunk of food passes into the stomach, symptoms subside quickly and the person can resume eating. If the food does not pass into the stomach, some people have to induce regurgitation of the food by sticking their finger in the back of their throat before they can begin eating. chest pain, difficulty swallowing, decreased saliva, and secretion production."
How is Schatzki's ring diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of Schatzki ring can usually be made by barium X-ray examination of the esophagus; however, a narrow ring can be missed on X-ray. In patients with symptoms of ''dysphagia'', doctors usually also order an upper intestinal ''endoscopy'' examination.' Endoscopy is the best way of diagnosing a Schatzki ring. During the endoscopy, a flexible viewing tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus. It allows a direct view of the inner lining of the esophagus and the stomach. The test helps to exclude early cancer, esophagitis, and Barrett's esophagus that also may cause narrowing of the esophagus."
What treatment is for Schatzki's rings? Can they be cured?,"'There is no cure for Schatzki rings. Treatment and management of the condition include procedures that will stretch or ''fracture'' the rings, which will allow solid food to pass through the esophagus more freely.'   Schatzki rings can be stretched or fractured with endoscopes or tapered dilators inserted through the mouth. They also can place deflated balloons across the ring and then inflate them. Occasionally, Schatzki rings may be cut with an electrocautery probe. Rarely, surgery is necessary to treat Schatzki rings."
What is heat stroke? Who is at risk?,"'Heat stroke is a form of hyperthermia or ''heat-related illness'', an abnormally elevated body temperature with accompanying physical symptoms including changes in the nervous system function. Unlike ''heat cramps'' and ''heat exhaustion'', two other forms of hyperthermia that are less severe, ''heat stroke is a true medical emergency that is often fatal if not properly and promptly treated. '' Heat stroke is also sometimes referred to as heatstroke or sun stroke. Severe hyperthermia is defined as a body temperature of 104 F (40 C) or higher.''The body normally generates heat as a result of metabolism, and is usually able to dissipate the heat by ''radiation'' of heat through the skin or by evaporation of sweat. However, in extreme heat, high humidity, or vigorous physical exertion under the sun, the body may not be able to sufficiently dissipate the heat and the body temperature rises, sometimes up to 106 F (41.1 C) or higher. Another cause of heat stroke is ''dehydration''. A dehydrated person may not be able to sweat fast enough to dissipate heat, which causes the body temperature to rise.''Heat stroke is not the same as a stroke. ""Stroke"" is the general term used to describe decreased oxygen flow to an area of the brain.''Those most susceptible (at risk) individuals to heat stroke include:''Heat stroke is sometimes classified as exertional heat stroke (EHS, which is due to overexertion in hot weather) or non-exertional heat stroke (NEHS, which occurs in climactic extremes and affects the elderly, infants, and chronically ill.'   Infants The elderly (often with associated heart diseases, lung diseases, kidney diseases, or who are taking medications that make them vulnerable to dehydration and heat strokes) Athletes Individuals who work outside and physically exert themselves under the sun Infants, children, or pets left in cars."
What are heat stroke symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of heat stroke can sometimes mimic those of ''heart attack'' or other conditions. Sometimes a person experiences symptoms of heat exhaustion before progressing to heat strokes.''Signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion include''However, some individuals can develop symptoms of heat stroke suddenly and rapidly without warning.''Different people may have different symptoms and signs of heat stroke. ''Common symptoms and signs of heat stroke include;'   nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, headache, muscle cramps and aches, and dizziness. high body temperature, the absence of sweating, with hot red or flushed dry skin, rapid pulse, difficulty breathing, strange behavior, hallucinations, confusion, agitation, disorientation, seizure, and/or coma."
"Can infants, children, and teens suffer from heat stroke?","'While the elderly are at greatest risk for heat stroke, infants and children are also at risk. In particular, infants or young children who are unattended in locked a car may suffer heat-related illness quickly, since the indoor temperature of a locked car can rise to dangerous levels even in moderate weather. Rarely, infants have died of heat stroke when overly bundled in their cribs. It is critically important that parents understand the medical dangers inherent in leaving children unattended in cars in addition to the obvious safety risks. Further, cars should always be kept locked when not in use so that children may not enter them and become trapped.''Among older children and ''teens'', heat stroke or heat-related illness is a risk for athletes who train in hot environmental conditions. Among reported heat-related illnesses in U.S. high school athletes, the majority of cases occur in football players during the month of August.' "
4 First aid treatments for heat stroke,"'Victims of heat stroke must receive immediate treatment to avoid permanent organ damage.'' ''First and foremost, cool the victim. '   Get the victim to a shady area, remove clothing, apply cool or tepid water to the skin (for example, you may spray the person with cool water from a garden hose), fan the victim to promote sweating and evaporation, and place ice packs under the armpits and groin. If the person is able to drink liquids, have them drink cool water or other cool beverages that do not contain alcohol or caffeine. Monitor body temperature with a thermometer and continue cooling efforts until the body temperature drops to 101 to 102 F (38.3 to 38.8 C). Always notify emergency services (911) immediately. If their arrival is delayed, they can give you further instructions for treatment of the victim."
How can you prevent heat stroke?,"   The most important measures to prevent heat strokes are to avoid becoming dehydrated and to avoid vigorous physical activities in hot and humid weather. If you have to perform physical activities in hot weather, drink plenty of fluids (such as water and sports drinks), but avoid alcohol, and caffeine (including soft drinks and tea), which may lead to dehydration. Your body will need replenishment of electrolytes (such as sodium) as well as fluids if you sweat excessively or perform vigorous activity in the sunlight for prolonged periods. Take frequent breaks to hydrate yourself. Wear hats and light-colored, lightweight, loose clothes. Keep cars locked when not in use and never, ever, leave infants, children or pets unattended in a locked car."
Introduction,"""If you're like most Americans, you plan for your future. When you take a job, you examine its benefit plan. When you buy a home, you consider its location and condition so that your investment is safe. Today, more and more Americans are protecting their most important asset--their health. Are you?""'Stroke'' ranks as the third leading killer in the United States. A ''stroke'' can be devastating to individuals and their families, robbing them of their independence. It is the most common cause of adult disability. Each year more than 700,000 Americans have a ''stroke'', with about 160,000 dying from ''stroke''-related causes. Officials at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) are committed to reducing that burden through biomedical research.' "
What is a Stroke?,"'A stroke, or ""brain attack,"" occurs when blood circulation to the brain fails. Brain cells can die from decreased blood flow and the resulting lack of oxygen. There are two broad categories of stroke: ''Blockage of Blood Flow''While not usually fatal, a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain or neck, called an ischemic stroke, is the most frequent cause of stroke and is responsible for about 80 percent of ''strokes''. These blockages stem from three conditions: ''Bleeding''Bleeding into the brain or the spaces surrounding the brain causes the second type of stroke, called hemorrhagic stroke.'""Two key steps you can take will lower your risk of death or disability from stroke: know stroke's warning signs and control stroke's risk factors. Scientific research conducted by the NINDS has identified warning signs and a large number of risk factors."" those caused 
by a blockage of blood flow and those caused by bleeding.  the formation of a clot within a 
blood vessel of the brain or neck, called
	thrombosis;  the 
movement of a clot from another part of the body such as the heart to the neck or brain, called
	embolism; or  a severe narrowing of an artery in or leading to the brain, called 
	stenosis. "
What are Warning Signs of a Stroke?,"'Warning signs are clues your body sends that your brain is not receiving enough oxygen. ''If you observe one or more of these signs of a stroke or ""brain attack,"" don\'t wait, call a doctor or 911 right away!''Other danger signs that may occur include ''double vision'', drowsiness, and ''nausea'' or ''vomiting''. Sometimes the warning signs may last only a few moments and then disappear. These brief episodes, known as transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are sometimes called ""mini-strokes."" Although brief, they identify an underlying serious condition that isn\'t going away without medical help. Unfortunately, since they clear up, many people ignore them. Don\'t. Heeding them can save your life.'  Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm or leg, especially on one side of 
the body Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden trouble walking,

What are Risk Factors for a Stroke?,"""A risk factor is a condition or behavior that occurs more frequently in those who have, or are at greater risk of getting, a disease than in those who don't. Having a risk factor for stroke doesn't mean you'll have a stroke. On the other hand, not having a risk factor doesn't mean you'll avoid a stroke. But your risk of stroke grows as the number and severity of risk factors increases.""'Stroke occurs in all age groups, in both sexes, and in all races in every country. It can even occur before birth, when the fetus is still in the womb. In African-Americans, stroke is more common and more deadly--even in young and middle-aged adults--than for any ethnic or other racial group in the United States. Scientists have found more and more severe risk factors in some minority groups and continue to look for patterns of stroke in these groups.' "
What Are the Treatable Risk Factors?,"'Some of the most important treatable risk factors for stroke are:'  High blood pressure. Also called 
	hypertension, this is 
by far the most potent risk factor for stroke. If your blood pressure is high, you and your 
doctor need to work out an individual strategy to bring it down to the normal 
range. Some ways that work: Maintain proper weight. Avoid drugs known to raise 
blood pressure. Cut down on salt. Eat fruits and vegetables to increase 
	potassium in your diet. 
	Exercise more. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that help lower blood 
pressure. Controlling blood pressure will also help you avoid 
	heart disease, 
	diabetes, and 
	kidney failure. Cigarette smoking. 
Cigarette smoking has been linked to the buildup of 
fatty substances in the carotid artery, the 
main neck artery supplying blood to the brain. Blockage of this artery is the 
leading cause of stroke in Americans. Also, 
	nicotine raises blood pressure; 
carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen your blood can carry to the brain; 
and cigarette smoke makes your blood thicker and more likely to clot. Your 
doctor can recommend programs and medications that may help you quit smoking. By 
quitting, at any age, you also reduce your risk of lung disease, heart disease, 
and a number of cancers including lung cancer. Heart disease. Common heart disorders such as coronary 
artery disease, valve defects, irregular heart beat, and enlargement of one of 
the heart's chambers can result in
	blood clots that may break loose and block vessels in or 
leading to the brain. The most common blood vessel disease, caused by the 
buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, is called 
	atherosclerosis. Your 
doctor will treat your heart disease and may also prescribe medication, such as 
	aspirin, to help 
prevent the formation of clots. Your doctor may recommend surgery to clean out a 
clogged neck artery if you match a particular risk profile. If you are over 50, 
NINDS scientists believe you and your doctor should make a decision about 
	aspirin therapy. A doctor can evaluate your risk factors 
and help you decide if you will benefit from aspirin or other blood-thinning 
therapy. Warning signs or history of stroke. If you experience a 
TIA, get help at 
once. Many communities encourage those with stroke's warning signs to dial 911 
for emergency medical assistance. If you have had a stroke in the past, it's 
important to reduce your risk of a second stroke. Your brain helps you recover 
from a stroke by drawing on body systems that now do double duty. That means a 
second stroke can be twice as bad. Diabetes. You may think this disorder affects only the 
body's ability to use sugar, or glucose. But it also causes destructive changes in the blood 
vessels throughout the body, including the brain. Also, if 
	blood glucose levels 
are high at the time of a stroke, then brain damage is usually more severe and 
extensive than when blood glucose is well-controlled. Treating 
	diabetes can 
delay the onset of complications that increase the risk of stroke."

What is a stroke?,"'A stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident or CVA is when part of the brain loses its blood supply and the part of the body that the blood-deprived brain cells control stops working. This loss of blood supply can be ischemic because of lack of blood flow, or hemorrhagic because of bleeding into brain tissue. ''A stroke is a medical emergency'' because strokes can lead to death or permanent disability. There are opportunities to treat ischemic strokes but that treatment needs to be started in the first few hours after the signs of a stroke begin. The patient, family, or bystanders, should call 9-1-1 and activate emergency medical services immediately should a stroke be suspected.''A ''transient ischemic attack'' (TIA or ''mini-stroke'') describes an ischemic stroke that is short-lived where the symptoms resolve spontaneously. This situation also requires emergency assessment to try to minimize the risk of a future stroke. By definition, a stroke would be classified as a TIA if all symptoms resolved within 24 hours.' "
What causes a stroke?,"'The blockage of an artery in the brain by a clot (thrombosis) is the most common cause of a stroke. The part of the brain that is supplied by the clotted blood vessel is then deprived of blood and oxygen. As a result of the deprived blood and oxygen, the cells of that part of the brain die and the part of the body that it controls stops working. Typically, a ''cholesterol'"" plaque in one of the brain's small blood vessels ruptures and starts the clotting process.""'Risk factors for narrowed blood vessels in the brain are the same as those that cause narrowing blood vessels in the heart and ''heart attack'' (''myocardial infarction''). These risk factors include:''Another type of stroke may occur when a ''blood clot'' or a piece of ''atherosclerotic'' plaque (cholesterol and calcium deposits on the wall of the inside of the heart or artery) breaks loose, travels through the bloodstream, and lodges in an artery in the brain. When blood flow stops, brain cells do not receive the oxygen and glucose they require to function and a stroke occurs. This type of stroke is referred to as an embolic stroke. For example, a blood clot might originally form in the heart chamber as a result of an irregular heart rhythm, like ''atrial fibrillation''. Usually, these clots remain attached to the inner lining of the heart, but occasionally they can break off, travel through the bloodstream (embolize), block a brain artery, and cause a stroke. An embolism, either plaque or clot, may also originate in a large artery (for example, the carotid artery, a major artery in the neck that supplies blood to the brain) and then travel downstream to clog a small artery within the brain.''A cerebral hemorrhage occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain tissue. A cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain) causes ''stroke symptoms'' by depriving blood and oxygen to parts of the brain in a variety of ways. Blood flow is lost to some cells. Additionally, blood is very irritating and can cause swelling of brain tissue (cerebral ''edema''). Edema and the accumulation of blood from a cerebral hemorrhage increases pressure within the skull and causes further damage by squeezing the brain against the bony skull. This further decreases blood flow to brain tissue and its cells.''In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, blood accumulates in the space beneath the arachnoid membrane that lines the brain. The blood originates from an abnormal blood vessel that leaks or ruptures. Often this is from an ''aneurysm'' (an abnormal ballooning out of the blood vessel). Subarachnoid hemorrhages usually cause a sudden severe ''headache'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', light intolerance, and ''stiff neck''. If not recognized and treated, major neurological consequences, such as ''coma'', and brain death may occur.''Another rare cause of stroke is ''vasculitis'', a condition in which the blood vessels become inflamed causing decreased blood flow to parts of the brain.''There appears to be a very slight increased occurrence of stroke in people with ''migraine headache''. The mechanism for ''migraine'' or vascular ''headaches'' includes narrowing of the brain blood vessels. Some ''migraine'' ''headache'' episodes can even mimic stroke with loss of function of one side of the body or vision or speech problems. Usually, the symptoms resolve as the ''headache'' resolves.' high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking."
What are the types of stroke?,"'Strokes are usually classified by what mechanism caused the loss of the blood supply, either ischemic or hemorrhagic. A stroke may also be described by what part of the brain was affected (for example, a right temporal stroke) and what part of the body stopped working (stroke affecting the left arm).''An ischemic stroke is caused by an artery in the brain being obstructed or blocked, preventing oxygen-rich blood from being delivered to brain cells. The artery can be blocked in a couple of ways. In a thrombotic stroke, an artery can narrow over time because of cholesterol buildup, called plaque. If that plaque ruptures, a clot is formed at the site and prevents blood from passing to brain cells downstream, which are then deprived of oxygen.''In an embolic stroke, the artery is blocked because of debris or a clot that travels from the heart or another blood vessel. An embolus or embolism is a clot, a piece of fatty material or other object that travels within the bloodstream that lodges in a blood vessel to cause an obstruction.''Blood clots'' that embolize usually arise from the heart. The most common cause of these blood clots is a heart ''arrhythmia'' called ''atrial fibrillation'"", where the upper chambers of the heart, the atria, do not beat in an organized rhythm. Instead, the chaotic electrical rhythm causes the atria to jiggle like a bowl of Jell-O. While blood still flows to the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) to be pumped to the body, some blood along the inner walls of the ""'atrium'' can form small blood clots. If a clot breaks off, it can travel or embolize to the brain, where it can block blood flow to a part of the brain and cause a stroke.''The carotid arteries are two large blood vessels that provide the brain with blood supply. These arteries can narrow, or develop stenosis, with cholesterol plaque that may build up over time. The surface of the plaque is irregular and bits of debris can break off and embolize to the brain to block blood vessels downstream and deprive brain cells of oxygen-rich blood.''When a blood vessel leaks and spills blood into brain tissue, those brain cells stop working. The bleeding or hemorrhage is often due to poorly controlled ''high blood pressure'' that weakens the wall of an artery over time. Blood may also leak from an ''aneurysm'', a congenital weakness or ballooning of an artery wall, or from an ''AVM'' (''arteriovenous malformation''), a congenital abnormality where an artery and vein connect incorrectly. The bleeding can form a ''hematoma'' that directly damages brain cells and may also cause swelling that puts further pressure on surrounding brain tissue.''There are four major arteries that supply the brain with blood.''The left side of the brain controls the right side of the body and vice versa. Speech tends to be located in the dominant hemisphere, most often the left brain.''The anterior and middle cerebral arteries provide blood supply to the front two-thirds of the brain, including the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. These parts of the brain control voluntary body movement, sensation, speech and thought, personality, and behavior.''The vertebral and basilar arteries are considered the posterior circulation and supply the occipital lobe where vision is located, the cerebellum that controls coordination and balance, and the brainstem that is responsible for the unconscious brain functions that include blood pressure, ''breathing'', and wakefulness.''Strokes may be described based upon the function of the body that is lost and by the area of the brain that is affected. Most commonly in strokes that involve the brain, the symptoms involve either the right or left side of the body. In strokes that affect the brainstem or the spinal cord, symptoms may present on both sides of the body.''Strokes may affect motor function or the ability for the body to move. Part of the body may be affected, like the face, a hand, or an arm. An entire side of the body may be affected (for example, the left part of the face, left arm, and left leg). Weakness on one side of the body is called hemiparesis (hemi = half + paresis = weak) and ''paralysis'' is hemiplegia (hemi = half + plegia = paralysis).''Similarly, sensory function -- the ability to feel -- can affect the face, hand, arm, trunk, or a combination of these.''Other symptoms like speech, vision, balance, and coordination help locate the part of the brain that has stopped working and helps the health care professional make the clinical diagnosis of stroke. This is an important concept since not all loss of neurologic function is due to stroke and if the anatomy and physiology do not match the loss of body function, other diagnoses may be considered that can affect both brain and body.''A ''lacunar'' stroke describes the blockage of a single tiny penetrating artery branch in the brain. The area of the involved brain is small but can still cause significant neurologic deficits, just like a stroke involving a larger blood vessel and more brain tissue. In some cases, however, the stroke is silent, meaning that no obvious body function is lost and an old lacunar stroke can be seen as an incidental finding on a CT or ''MRI'' scan of the head that might be done for other reasons. The term lacune means empty space and a tiny empty space of an old lacunar stroke can be seen on imaging where brain tissue has been lost.'   The right and left carotid artery are located in the front of the neck and their pulse can be felt with the fingers. The right and left vertebral arteries are encased in bone as they run through the vertebrae in the neck. As the two enter the brain, they join to form the basilar artery. The carotid arteries and the vertebrobasilar arteries join to form the Circle of Willis at the base of the brain and from this circle, arteries branch off to supply the brain with blood."
What is a transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'A transient ischemic attack (TIA, mini-stroke) is a short-lived stroke that gets better and resolves spontaneously. It is a short-lived episode (less than 24 hours) of temporary impairment of brain function that is caused by a loss of blood supply. A TIA causes a loss of function in the area of the body that is controlled by the portion of the brain affected. The loss of blood supply to the brain is most often caused by a clot that spontaneously forms in a blood vessel within the brain (thrombosis). However, it can also result from a clot that forms elsewhere in the body, dislodges from that location, and travels to lodge in an artery of the brain (emboli). Arterial spasm and, rarely, a bleed into brain tissue are other causes of a TIA. Many people refer to a TIA as a ""mini-stroke.""''Some TIAs develop slowly, while others develop rapidly. By definition, all TIAs resolve within 24 hours. Strokes take longer to resolve than TIAs, and with strokes, complete function may never return and reflect a more permanent and serious problem. Although most TIAs often last only a few minutes, all TIAs should be evaluated with the same urgency as a stroke in an effort to prevent recurrences and/or strokes. TIAs can occur once, multiple times, or precede a permanent stroke. ''A transient ischemic attack should be considered an emergency because there is no guarantee that the situation will resolve itself and function will return spontaneously without the help of medical intervention.''A TIA from a clot in the blood vessel that supplies the retina of the eye can cause temporary visual loss (amaurosis fugax), which is often described as the sensation of a black, dark curtain coming down. A TIA that involves the carotid artery (the largest blood vessel supplying the brain) can produce problems with movement or sensation on one side of the body, which is the side opposite to the actual blockage. An affected patient may experience temporary ''double vision''; ''dizziness'' (''vertigo''); loss of balance; one-sided weakness or complete paralysis of the arm, leg, face, or one whole side of the body; or be unable to speak or understand commands.' "
What are the risk factors for stroke?,"'Overall, the most common risk factors for stroke are:''Heart conditions like atrial ''fibrillation'', patent foramen ovale (hole in the heart), and ''heart valve disease'' can also be the potential cause of stroke.''When stroke occurs in younger individuals (less than 50 years old), less common risk factors to be considered include illicit drugs, such as ''cocaine'' or ''amphetamines'', ruptured aneurysms, and ''inherited'' (genetic) predispositions to abnormal blood clotting.''An example of a genetic predisposition to stroke occurs in a rare condition called ''homocystinuria'', in which there are excessive levels of the chemical homocystine in the body. Scientists are trying to determine whether the non-hereditary occurrence of high levels of homocystine at any age can predispose to stroke.'   high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and increasing age."
What are the warning signs and symptoms of a stroke?,"'There may be no warning signs of a stroke until it occurs. It is why high blood pressure (''hypertension''), one of the risk factors for stroke, is called the silent killer.''Some patients may experience transient ischemic attack (TIA) that can be thought of as a stroke that has resolved itself. The symptoms may be mild or dramatic and can mimic a stroke with weakness, numbness, facial droop, and speech difficulties, but these symptoms may only last a few minutes. TIAs should not be ignored since they may offer an opportunity to look for potentially reversible or controllable causes of stroke. As well, there is no guarantee that the ''symptoms of stroke'' will resolve on their own. For that reason, a TIA should be considered an emergency and medical care should be accessed immediately.''Amaurosis fugax describes the temporary ''loss of vision'' in one eye that occurs because of an embolus of blood clot or debris to the artery that supplies the eye. While it only involves vision, this situation should be considered a type of TIA.'

What are the signs and symptoms of a stroke?,"'Symptoms of stroke depend upon what area of the brain has stopped working due to loss of its blood supply. Often, the patient may present with multiple symptoms including the following:''The symptoms of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke may be the same, but patients with hemorrhagic stroke may also complain more of ''headache'' and ''vomiting''.'

   Acute change in level of consciousness or confusion Acute onset of weakness or paralysis of half or part of the body Numbness of one half or part of the body Partial vision loss Double vision Difficulty speaking or understanding speech Difficulty with balance and vertigo"
Which specialties of doctors treat stroke?,"'Stroke care involves many health care professionals as the patient travels through the care process.''Care for a stroke patient may begin with prehospital providers (first responders, EMTs, paramedics) who recognize stroke symptoms and activate a stroke response.''Emergency physicians begin the evaluation and may help make the decision to administer tPA. Neurologists, neurosurgeons, interventional radiologists may also be involved in the decision to treat the stroke patient with tPA or clot retrieval, if the latter is an option at the hospital.''Critical care specialists help stabilize the patient after tPA is given. Patients who are not candidates for tPA are often admitted to a hospitalist.''Rehabilitation physicians, physical therapists and occupational therapists are involved after the acute event has resolved.''Finally, the primary care provider would look after the patient long-term.' "
What tests diagnose stroke?,"'Time is of the essence since the longer a stroke remains unrecognized and untreated, the longer brain cells are deprived of oxygen-rich blood and the greater number of brain cells that die and cannot be replaced.''The clinical diagnosis of stroke is usually made after the health-care professional performs a history and physical examination. While speed is important in making the diagnosis, it is also important to learn about the circumstances that brought the patient to be seen. For example, the patient just started slurring words about an hour ago versus the patient has been slurring his words since last evening.''There is urgency to make the diagnosis and determine whether treatment with thrombolytic medications (clot-busting drugs) to “reverse” the stroke is a possibility. The time frame to intervene is narrow and may be as short as 3 to 4 ½ hours after onset of symptoms. For that reason, family members or bystanders may be needed to confirm information, especially if the patient is not fully awake or has a speech deficit.''History may include asking about what symptoms are present, when they began, and if they are improving, progressing, or remaining the same. Past medical history will look for stroke risk factors, medications, ''allergies'', and any recent illnesses or surgeries. Medication history is very important, especially when the patient is taking ''anticoagulants'' (examples include ''warfarin'' [''Coumadin''], dabigatrin [Pradaxa], rixaroxiban [''Xarelto''], ''apixaban'' [''Eliquis''], ''enoxaparin'' [''Lovenox'']).''Physical examination includes assessing vital signs and patient wakefulness. A neurologic examination is performed, usually using the standardized stroke scale. Heart, ''lungs'', and abdomen are also assessed.''If an acute stroke is still a consideration, blood tests and CT of the head are indicated. However, the tests are not used to make the diagnosis, but are used to help plan treatment. Nonetheless, a CT is often used to differentiate an ischemic from a hemorrhagic stroke because the treatment plans are quite different.''The CT is used to look for bleeding or masses in the brain and potentially how much brain tissue is experiencing decreased blood supply.''A CT perfusion scan may also be done to see how much brain is at risk by using injected dye to check brain blood supply (perfusion).''An MRI of the brain may be possibly indicated, but not all hospitals have this technology readily available.''Blood tests may include a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), to measure red blood cell count and platelets, ''electrolytes'"", blood glucose, and kidney function and blood tests to measure blood clotting function, international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Other blood tests may be indicated based upon the patient's specific situation.""'An ''EKG'"" may be performed to check the heart's rate and rhythm. The patient is usually placed on a cardiac monitor."" The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association recommend that everybody be aware of FAST in recognizing stroke: Face Drooping, Arm Weakness, Speech Difficulty, Time to Call 9-1-1 First responders, EMTs and paramedics may use the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale to recognize a stroke and alert the emergency department to prepare for their arrival. This scale addresses the same three components as the FAST: speech, arm strength, and speech. In the emergency department, nurses and doctors may use the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale to perform a more in depth and standardized neurologic examination."
What is the NIH Stroke Scale?,"'Not all strokes affect the brain equally, and stroke symptoms and signs depend upon the part of the brain affected.''The ''NIH Stroke Scale'"" tries to score how severe a stroke might be. It also monitors whether the person's stroke is improving or worsening as time passes as the patient is re-examined.""'There are 11 categories that are scored and include whether the patient is awake; can follow commands; can see; can move face, arms and legs; has normal body sensations or feelings; has speech difficulties; and has coordination problems.' For example, most people’s speech center is located in the left half of the brain so a stroke affecting the left side of the brain would affect speech and comprehension. It also would be associated with weakness of the right side of the body. A right brain stroke would make the left side of the body weak. And depending on where in the brain the injury occurred, the weakness could be the face, arm, leg or a combination of the three."
What is the treatment for stroke?,"'A stroke is a medical emergency, but prompt intervention can restore blood supply to the brain if stroke patients receive medical care early enough.''As in many emergencies, the first consideration are the CABs (Circulation, ''Airway'"", and Breathing, according to the new CPR guidelines) to make certain that the patient has blood pumping, no airway blockage and can breathe, and then has adequate blood pressure control. In severe strokes, especially those that involve the brainstem, the brain's ability to control breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate may be lost.""'Patients will have intravenous lines established, oxygen administered, appropriate blood tests, and noncontrast ''CT scans'' performed. At the same time, the health care professional performs an assessment to make the clinical diagnosis of stroke and decides whether thrombolytic therapy (tPA, a clot busting medication) or clot retrieval (mechanically removing the clot through catheters that are threaded into the blocked artery) is an option to treat the stroke.''If the diagnosis of ischemic stroke has been made, there is a window of time when thrombolytic therapy using tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) may be an option. tPA dissolves the clot that is blocking an artery in the brain and restores blood supply. For many patients, that time window is 3 hours after the onset of symptoms. In a select group of patients, that period may be extended to 4.5 hours. During that 3-to-4½ hours, the patient or family needs to recognize the stroke symptoms, get the patient to a hospital (call 9-1-1), have the patient assessed by the health care professional, who performs a ''CT scan'' to look for other causes of stroke (including hemorrhage or ''tumor''), consults with a ''neurologist'', and stabilizes the patient’s blood pressure and breathing. Only then can it be time to administer the tPA or call an interventional radiologist or neurosurgeon to try to remove the clot (mechanical thrombectomy).'""Hemorrhagic strokes are difficult to treat, so it's imperative to consult a specialist (neurosurgeon) immediately to help determine whether any treatment options are available to the patient (possibly aneurysm clipping, hematoma evacuation, or other techniques). Treatment for hemorrhagic strokes, in contrast to ischemic strokes, does not use tPA or other thrombolytic agents, as these could worsen bleeding, make the symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke worse, and cause death. Consequently, it is important to distinguish between a hemorrhagic stroke and an ischemic stroke before treatment begins.""'Hospital ER doctors and nurses are trained to act quickly in caring for stroke patients. The most common delay that prevents tPA from being administered is patient delay in seeking medical attention. Health care professionals perform an urgent CT scan of the head to help distinguish an ischemic from a hemorrhagic stroke. This may also cause a delay in a few instances.''Some smaller hospitals may use telemedicine to virtually consult neurology specialists, who can help make the diagnosis of stroke, review the CT scan, and help decide whether tPA is a reasonable option. They may administer the thrombolytic drug and transfer the patient to a better-equipped hospital for further care.''The decision to administer tPA in the appropriate patient (there are many reasons that the drug is not indicated even if the patient arrives in time) is one that health care professionals discuss with the patient and family, since there is risk of bleeding in the brain with the use of tPA. While there is potential great benefit, because the blood vessels are fragile, there is a 6% risk that an ischemic stroke can turn into a hemorrhagic stroke with bleeding into the brain. This risk is minimized the earlier the drug is given and if the appropriate patient is selected.''In certain stroke situations, the treatment period may be extended to 4.5 hours. If tPA is given, the patient will need to be admitted to an intensive care bed for monitoring. As well, depending upon circumstances, the patient may be transferred to a stroke center.''Some stroke patients are candidates for mechanical thrombectomy, where a thin catheter is threaded into the blocked artery in the neck or brain, and the clot is sucked out. Depending upon the patient, the size of the stroke, the location of the blockage in the brain and brain function, mechanical thrombectomy may be considered up to 24 hours after onset of symptoms. Mechanical thrombectomy is not available at all hospitals and may not be appropriate for all patients. These procedures require the skill of a specially trained interventional neuroradiologist, neurologist, or neurosurgeon.''In those patients where tPA and other interventions are not possible or are not indicated, the patient is usually admitted to the hospital for observation, supportive care, and referral for rehabilitation.''Discuss the latest stroke guidelines with your doctor.'

What is the prognosis for a person that suffers a stroke?,"'Stroke remains a major killer in the United States and worldwide. In the U.S., 20% of stroke patients will die within a year. However, with the ability to intervene with thrombolytic therapy to reverse the stroke and with more aggressive rehabilitation, the goal is to increase patient survival and function after recovery.''Specialized stroke centers -- hospitals that have the doctors, equipment, and resources to intervene quickly and treat strokes aggressively -- have shown to increase stroke survival as well as patient function and recovery. These hospitals are certified by The Joint Commission, the American Stroke Association, and the health departments of some states. It is to your advantage to know which hospitals in your area are designated stroke centers because they will have the specialists and equipment needed to minimize diagnosis-to-treatment times.''Many complications can develop in stroke patients, some of whom may not be able to return to full-time employment because of disability. Patients are affected physically with decreased body function, mentally with decreased cognition, and emotionally with ''depression'' and ''anxiety''.''The return to function depends upon the severity of the stroke, what parts of the brain and body have stopped working, and what complications develop. Patients who lose their ability to swallow may develop aspiration ''pneumonia'' when they inhale food or saliva into the lungs, causing infection. Patients who have difficulty moving can develop pressure sores and infection due to skin breakdown.''Seizures'' may be a complication in up to 10% of patients. The more severe the stroke, the more likely that ''seizures'' may develop.' "
Is recovery after a stroke possible?,"'Prompt intervention in the acute stroke and restored blood supply to brain tissue increase the likelihood that stroke patients can be rescued and ''brain damage'' minimized.''In patients who have physical, mental, and emotional deficits because of the stroke, rehabilitation offers hope of increased function and return to the level of activity that they had prior to the stroke.''Again, the best treatment for stroke is ''prevention'' and minimizing risk factors for not only stroke but for heart attack and ''peripheral vascular disease'' (PAD).'  "
What is stroke rehabilitation?,"'The purpose of rehabilitation is to return the stroke patient to the life and level of function that existed before the stroke. The success of that goal depends upon the underlying health of the patient and severity of the stroke.''Rehabilitation may take weeks or months and usually requires a team approach for success. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech pathologists will coordinate care with the primary doctor and physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists.''Some of the treatments are directed to prevent life-threatening complications. For example, speech pathologists may help with swallowing to prevent aspiration ''pneumonia''. Physical therapists may concentrate on strength and balance to prevent falls. Occupational therapists may find ways to allow the patient to perform daily activities from personal hygiene to cooking in the kitchen.''Many patients with significant stroke deficits may require admission to a rehabilitation hospital and/or longer term ''nursing'' facility prior to returning home. Unfortunately, some patients will have had too severe a stroke to be offered that opportunity.' "
Can strokes be prevented?,"'Prevention is always the best treatment, especially when the illness can be life-threatening or life-altering. Ischemic strokes are most often caused by ''atherosclerosis'', or ''hardening of the arteries'', and carry the same risk factors as ''heart attacks'' (myocardial infarction, ''coronary artery disease'') and ''peripheral vascular disease''. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. Stopping smoking and keeping the other three under lifelong control greatly minimizes the risk of ischemic stroke.''Patients who have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) are often prescribed medications to decrease their risk of a subsequent stroke. These include medications to lower blood ''cholesterol levels'' and control blood pressure. In addition, ''antiplatelet medications'' may be prescribed to make platelets less likely to promote blood clot formation. These include ''aspirin'', clopidogrel (''Plavix''), and ''dipyridamole''/aspirin (''Aggrenox'').''Patients with a TIA are usually evaluated for carotid stenosis or narrowing of the carotid artery. Surgery to open critically narrowed carotid arteries (termed endarterectomy) may decrease stroke risk.''Lifelong control of high blood pressure decreases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.''Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of embolic stroke. Ideally the heart rhythm can be converted to normal sinus rhythm but in those patients whose hearts are chronically in atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation or “blood thinning” minimizes the risk of blood clot formation in the heart and subsequent embolization and stroke. The drug that is prescribed depends upon the specific patient and individual situation. Patients who are prescribed apixaban (Eliquis), ''rivaroxaban'' (Xarelto), dabigatran (Pradaxa), or warfarin (Coumadin), have a decreased chance of stroke but are at risk for bleeding complications.' "
Are a stroke and an aneurysm the same thing?,"'No, a ''stroke'' and an aneurysm are not the same thing. They are two very different medical health problems. ''Stroke'' is a process or an event that happens in your body, while an aneurysm is a problem with a person’s anatomy (anatomical abnormality).' "
What is a stroke?,"'There are two major types of ''stroke'' – ischemic ''strokes'' and hemorrhagic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked by a ''blood clot''. The other type is a hemorrhagic stroke where a blood vessel leaks due to weakened blood vessel walls or due to damage by traumatic injury. The leaking vessels allow blood to leak into the brain tissue resulting in loss of blood to brain tissues, and because the leaked blood is under pressure, it can squeeze off other blood vessels that supply blood to other areas of the brain close to the blood vessel injury.' "
What is an aneurysm?,"'An aneurysm is a ''weakness'' in an artery wall that allows the artery to abnormally widen or balloon out. This anatomical feature can occur almost anywhere in the body, for example, cerebral aneurysms (brain aneurysms), aortic aneurysms, and splenic aneurysms and others. This article will only discuss brain aneurysms. An aneurysm is not a process like stroke but an anatomic abnormality.'  "
Are the causes of a stroke and brain aneurysm the same?,"'No, the causes of these two conditions are very different.''Strokes are caused by a cut off of oxygen to brain cells. Ischemic stroke happens when a ''blood clot'' blocks an area in an arterial blood vessel in the brain. This type of stroke accounts for about 80% of strokes.''A ''brain aneurysm'' may be caused by congenital (present at birth) blood vessel problems happen as a result of blood vessel disease over time, or result from injury and/or damage to the blood vessel. Almost all brain aneurysms have no symptoms until they begin to leak blood. When the aneurysm leaks blood, they are considered to be a cause of a hemorrhagic stroke and this is a medical emergency.' Ischemic strokes are caused by blood clots that form on the inside of the arteries or by a blood clot or cholesterol plaque fragment from elsewhere in the body (usually the heart). A hemorrhagic stroke is due to blood leaking out of a brain artery into brain tissue. Because of this leakage, the brain receives less oxygen. And, because the blood is under pressure, the bleeding into adjacent brain tissue can compress other vessels and deprive areas next the injured blood vessel or artery (adjacent brain tissue) of oxygen. This type of stroke accounts for about 20% of strokes."
What are the differences between the symptoms and signs of stroke vs brain aneurysm?,"""Unless a brain aneurysm leaks or bursts open, there usually aren't any symptoms. However, if the aneurysm does leak or burst open, then signs and symptoms are the same for a stroke, which also is the cause of a hemorrhagic stroke. A very slow leak from a brain aneurysm may cause ""'headaches'' or a large aneurysm may cause blurry vision, ''loss of vision'', facial droop and possibly ''headaches''.''The symptoms and signs for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are similar. The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association emphasize four letters and three numbers to consider if a person is having a stroke. They suggest the following ''FAST'' system to recognize and treat strokes:''Other symptoms may appear either separately or in combination with the above, and they all happen suddenly without warning:''If you think someone is having a stroke or aneurysm call 911 immediately.'  F - facial drooping A - arm weakness S - speech difficulty T – time - do not delay call these three numbers – 911 Confusion Numbness or weakness in the extremities, especially on one side of the body Vision problems Difficulty walking along with dizziness, lack of coordination and/or balance Severe headache with no known cause Seizures Loss of memory Trouble getting words out Trouble typing, texting, or other problems with motor coordination"
What is the treatment for these diseases?,"'Treatment for stroke is time-dependent and type dependent. If ''stroke symptoms'"" are noticed, call 911 and have the patient taken to a stroke center, and don't give them ""'aspirin''. Once at the hospital, the patient will have a CT of the head to determine if the person has an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. This is very important because subsequent treatments are markedly different for these two types of stroke.''If the stroke is diagnosed as ischemic, the treatment may involve an IV infusion of a “clot-busting” drug (r-tPA or tissue plasminogen activator) to open the blood vessel. If the stroke is determined to be hemorrhagic, usually a neurosurgeon, neurologist and in some hospitals, and invasive neuroradiologist will be consulted to reduce or stop the bleeding and/or surgically decompress the blood clot. It’s important that the diagnosis between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke is made - treating a hemorrhagic stroke with a clot-busting drug will increase bleeding and likely will cause the patient to die. In certain circumstances, there may be no effective acute treatment for a stroke.''Treatment of brain aneurysms that aren’t leaking (or have a very slow leak) varies from patient to patient, but usually involves supportive measures like reducing ''high blood pressure'' with medication under the care of a doctor or other health care professional.''However, other treatments such as endovascular treatments that place coils in the aneurysm to promote thrombosis that results in obliteration of the aneurysm and/or surgical therapy by clipping the base or bottom of the aneurysm, much like tying off the end of a balloon to prevent further expansion and/or any leaking. Your medical condition and advice from your team (primary care doctor, neurosurgeon, neurologist and/or interventional neuroradiologist) play significant roles in deciding what treatment course is best for you.' "
What's the prognosis for stroke and aneurysm?,"'The prognosis for an ischemic stroke is highly variable and depends on where the clot occurs in the brain, how long the clot remains before it is treated, and how effective the treatment is. Consequently, ischemic strokes may vary in prognosis from good to poor, depending upon the above conditions and how well the patient responds to treatment and/or rehabilitation. Hemorrhagic strokes more often have a poorer prognosis and have a higher mortality rate than ischemic strokes.''The prognosis for brain aneurysms is usually good as long as they don’t leak or burst open. Prophylactic treatment of brain aneurysms is still controversial because there is a chance that any attempt to use endovascular treatments or surgical clipping actually may cause aneurysm to begin bleeding. Some procedures have a mortality rate of 3%. If the brain aneurysm leaks, the prognosis is poor and mortality is high unless acute neurosurgical or neurointerventional treatment is successful.' "
Stroke vs. mini-stroke (TIA) comparison of differences,"   Mini-stroke (transient ischemic attack, TIA) and stroke usually are caused by blockage of an artery in the brain, and less often by bleeding into the brain tissue. Strokes usually are classified as either ischemic or hemorrhagic. The causes of strokes and min-strokes (transient ischemic attack, TIA) are the same, however, blood flow leakage or blockage is temporary in mini-strokes, and blood flow returns spontaneously. In most strokes, blood flow does not return spontaneously. The majority of mini-strokes produce symptoms that are temporary, while the majority of strokes produce symptoms that are often long lasting, and cause permanent disability. Symptoms of a mini-stroke may include one or more of the following:Weakness or numbness in your arms and/or legs, usually on one side of the bodyDysphasia (difficulty speaking)DizzinessVision changesTingling (paresthesias)Abnormal taste and/or smellsConfusionLoss of balanceAltered consciousness and/or passing out Weakness or numbness in your arms and/or legs, usually on one side of the body Dysphasia (difficulty speaking) Dizziness Vision changes Tingling (paresthesias) Abnormal taste and/or smells Confusion Loss of balance Altered consciousness and/or passing out Symptoms of a stroke include those of a mini-stroke, but the symptoms do not resolve. Treatment for mini-stroke usually is medication to reduce blood clot risk, reduction of other risk factors (smoking, for example) and follow-up to consider surgery if the cause is an aneurysm that occasionally slowly leaks blood. A stroke is a medical emergency and treatment depends upon the type of stroke. A stroke caused by a blood clot (ischemic) is treated with clot busting drugs or mechanical methods to remove the clot. Hemorrhagic (bleeding into brain tissue) stroke requires life-saving surgery, performed by a neurosurgeon. Mini-strokes symptoms are short-term that resolve, while strokes often produce long-term symptoms (disabilities). In mini-strokes, normal function returns quickly, but with strokes, normal function may never return. Recovery of normal function occurs quickly in mini-strokes, but strokes usually have an extended time for recovery that includes therapy. In mini-strokes, blood flow returns spontaneously (the body resolves the blockage and/or leakage) and causes little or no damage to brain cells, whereas strokes do not have spontaneous blood flow return (the body does not resolve the blockage and/or leakage) and brain cells are permanently damaged and/or destroyed. Damage from a stroke is permanent, and an individual may never regain normal function of the part of the body affected. Other terms for stroke include cerebral vascular accident (CVA). Other terms for mini stroke include TIA, transient ischemic attack, and mini-stroke."
What are stroke and mini-stroke (TIA)? What causes them?,"'A stroke occurs when brain tissue becomes deprived of oxygen resulting in malfunction of the brain, and brain tissue is damaged or destroyed. A stroke usually is due to either blockage (ischemic) or leakage (hemorrhage) of blood flow by an artery that supplies oxygen rich blood to areas in the brain. If the extent of brain tissue damage is large, the person may die. A stroke is a medical emergency. It is the fifth most common cause of death in the U.S.''A subset of strokes is termed a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ""''mini-stroke''."" In a mini-stroke, brain cells are dysfunctional for short period of time and produce symptoms similar to stroke. However, mini-''stroke symptoms'"" and signs usually are resolved within a short time (minutes to hours) (usually because the brain's arteries involved are only blocked, or may leak blood into the brain, intermittently)."" "
What are the warning signs and symptoms of stroke vs. mini-stroke?,"'Warning signs and symptoms of a stroke and mini-stroke are the same, and include:'   Weakness or numbness in your arms and/or legs, usually on one side of the body Dysphasia (difficulty speaking) Dizziness Vision changes Tingling (paresthesias) Abnormal taste and/or smells Confusion Loss of balance Altered consciousness and/or passing out"
How long do the symptoms of stroke vs. mini-stroke last?,"'Stroke symptoms'' typically last more than 24 hours, and may or may not resolve, even with therapy. Some ''stroke symptoms'' may never resolve or get better.''TIA symptoms last for a short time. Symptoms can begin to resolve in about 1 to 5 minutes, which is typical, but some may take about 24 hours to resolve.' "
How can you tell if a person is having a stroke or mini-stroke (FAST)?,"'The term ""''FAST''"" is an easy way to help determine if a person is having a stroke or mini-stroke, and what you should do. ''FAST'' ''applies to both mini-strokes and strokes. The National Stroke Association and other organizations suggest that you use FAST as a way to remember what to look for, and what to do if a person develops any of these warning signs and symptoms of a stroke or mini-stroke.' F stands for face. Ask the person to smile, if one side of the face droops, it is a warning sign. A stands for arms. Ask the person to lift both arms, if one arm drifts down or has difficulty moving, it is a warning sign. S stands for speech: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase, if the speech is slurred or odd, it is a warning sign. T stands for time: If a person develops any of the warning signs, it is time to call 911 and have him or her evaluated for a stroke and/or mini-stroke at an emergency department."
"What is worse, a stroke or mini-stroke?","'The answer to this question depends upon several factors. Many doctors would conclude that a large hemorrhagic stroke is the worst kind of stroke because they often are untreatable, and cause devastating damage to the brain from which there is little or no recovery. However, other types of strokes, for example, a ''blood clot'' in the brain, also can have similar devastating consequences. These strokes can result in disability and death just like hemorrhagic strokes. Some people consider being unable to care for themselves as a fate worse than death, and would say that survival with extreme disabilities (cannot feed themselves, unable to talk, cannot do any personal hygiene, for example) is the worst kind of stroke. Perhaps the worst kind of stroke is the one that occurs in yourself or your loved one, no matter to what extent is the disability.' "
Which side effects of stroke vs. mini-stroke are the same?,"'The after/side effects of stroke and mini-strokes can be the same, especially immediately after any symptoms develop, and can include:'   Numbness or weakness of the face, arms and/or legs, often the weakness is only on one side of the body Difficulty speaking or understanding speech Abrupt loss of vision in one or both eyes Dizziness Loss of balance and/or coordination Confusion"
What are the differences between the side effects of stroke vs. mini-stroke?,"'All of the signs and symptoms of mini-strokes usually resolve within five minutes; a few people resolve in less than 24 hours.''Stroke side effects and symptoms last longer than 24 hours. Some may last a lifetime. The early ''symptoms of stroke'' may resolve partially, or never. When this happens, other signs and symptoms such as ''depression'', muscle atrophy (muscle loss), and worsening of early symptoms may progress over time.' "
Can a mini-stroke lead to other types of strokes?,"'TIAs or mini-strokes are considered by the American Stroke Association to be major warning signs of a stroke. For example, about 7% to 40% of individuals experiencing a stroke report having a TIA sometime before their first stroke. Moreover, about one-third of people who have a mini-stroke have a stroke within a year after their mini-stroke.' "
What is the treatment for stroke vs. mini-stroke?,"'Strokes and mini-strokes are not treated exactly the same. Strokes are a medical emergency. Treatment for a stroke begins with a ''CT scan'' of the brain to help determine the difference between a ''blood clot'' in the brain or an artery rupture and hemorrhage. The type of treatment then depends upon the type of stroke.''A mini-stroke also is a medical emergency. However, by the time the person receives medical care, the mini-''stroke symptoms'' may have resolved, or are resolving. Hospitalization for TIA may be necessary for additional tests, and prescription medication and/or surgery may be necessary depending upon the cause.''Mini-strokes may predict that an individual may (up to 40% chance) have a stroke within a year of the TIA.'  "
What is the recovery time and life expectancy for stroke vs. mini-stroke?,"'Mini-strokes or TIAs resolve spontaneously, and the individual recovers normal function quickly, usually within a few minutes up to about 24 hours without medical treatment. The prognosis for TIA is very good; however, TIAs frequently (up to 40%) are the way of telling you that in the next year you may have a stroke.''The recovery and prognosis for a stroke is quite variable. Early treatment may increase recovery and improve prognosis. Unfortunately, the prognosis and recovery decline if a stroke is severe (a large area of brain tissue is damaged and/or dies) or the symptoms are present for more than a few hours and the individual is outside of the window for treatment.' "
What is a heart attack? What is a stroke? Are they the same?,"'Heart attack occurs when sudden damage and/or death occurs to a portion of the heart muscle. The damage to the heart muscle usually is caused by a blocked coronary artery, which then prevents oxygen from getting to the muscle tissue of the heart. Heart attack is the most common cause of death in the US''Arrhythmias (an abnormal heart beat) also can cause a heart attack. Examples of life-threatening arrhythmias include ventricular ''fibrillation'' and ''sudden cardiac arrest'', in which the person will die within a few minutes.''Heart attacks'' can result in permanent heart muscle damage. If the extent of the heart muscle damage is large, the person may die.\xa0''A ''stroke'' occurs when brain tissue becomes deprived of oxygen, leading to damage or death of the brain tissue in the region affected by the ''stroke''. The most frequent cause of a stroke is clot that blocks a blood vessel in the brain (ischemic stroke).''Hemorrhagic stroke (leakage or rupture of a blood vessel within the brain) is a less common cause of stroke.''Strokes'' can result in permanent brain tissue damage and/or death. If the extent of brain tissue damage is large, the person may die. It is the fifth most common cause of death in the US.''Heart attack and stroke are medical emergencies.''A ''transient ischemic attack'' (''TIA'', ''mini-stroke'') occurs when there is a temporary blockage of a blood vessel in the brain, producing symptoms similar to a stroke. However, during a transient ischemic attack, the ''stroke symptoms'' resolve completely within a short period of time after the clot blocking the vessel breaks apart, and thus does not produce any permanent damage or lasting effects. Transient ischemic attacks often are a warning sign of an imminent full-blown stroke, and thus require immediate medical treatment.' "
"Heart attack vs. stroke, which is worse?","'You do not want to have a heart attack or stroke because both can lead to disability or death. In terms of mortality statistics, ''heart attacks'' are more common since they are the leading cause of death in the US, while strokes are the fifth leading cause of death.''However, individuals may have more difficulty afterwards if they survive a stroke than if they survive a heart attack, though this will depend on how much brain tissue is damaged after the stroke. For example, a stroke can cause profound life-altering disabilities, such as losing the ability to communicate verbally or to use certain parts of your body (for example, your right arm and right leg). If you fear permanent disability worse than death, you may think that a stroke is worse than a heart attack.' "
How can you tell if a person is having a heart attack or stroke (differences)?,"'The warning signs of heart attack and stroke are not the same.''The classic warning symptoms and signs of a heart attack in men and women may include:''Recognition of ''stroke symptoms'' is vital for emergency treatment.''The acronym ''“''FAST''”'' stands for recognition of:''If you or someone you are with experiences the symptoms (FAST) call contact 911 immediately.''Other classic warning symptoms and/or signs of a stroke may include:'  Chest pain or chest discomfort (pressure, squeezing, fullness) that may come and go Pain or discomfort that may radiate to the shoulders, arms, back, abdomen, jaw, or teeth Shortness of breath Sweating Lightheadedness or fainting Nausea and vomiting Facial drooping Arm weakness Speech difficulty Time for action Numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, usually affecting only one side of the body Difficulty speaking or understanding speech Confusion or loss of consciousness Difficulty seeing out of one or both eyes Sudden severe headache"
What signs and symptoms heart attack and stroke are the same?,"'Heart attacks'' and strokes are similar in that they both:''Neurologists that treat people who have had a stroke consider a stroke just as important as a heart attack because of the similarities between these two life-threatening conditions. Many neurologists refer to a stroke as a ""brain attack.""' Usually have a sudden onset Are caused by disruptions in the flow of oxygen-rich blood Produce signs and symptoms suddenly Can cause debilitating symptoms and health problems that may or may not improve over time Can be disabling Should be treated immediately in an emergency department Can cause death if enough of the person's brain or heart tissue is damaged"
Are the signs and symptoms of heart attack or stroke different in women?,"'In addition to the classic symptoms of heart attack symptoms, women may have somewhat different signs and symptoms that may include:''In addition to the classic signs and symptoms of a stroke, women may also experience other symptoms such as:''Some women may have a mixture of the classic and less common signs and ''symptoms of stroke'' or heart attack.'  Abdominal pain (discomfort or pain feels like heartburn or indigestion) Dizziness Moderate to severe fatigue Clammy skin Shortness of breath Disorientation General weakness Agitation Nausea/vomiting Behavioral changes and/or hallucinations Seizures Hiccups"
What are the risk factors of heart attack vs. stroke?,"'Heart attacks and strokes (ischemic strokes) are caused by ''blood clots'' (thrombosis). These two conditions share essentially the same risk factors, which include:' Family history Smoking High cholesterol levels Hypertension (high blood pressure) Obesity Diabetes Stress Physical inactivity"
What is the treatment for heart attack vs. stroke?,"'Cardiopulmonary resuscitation'' (CPR) is the initial emergency treatment for heart attacks if the patient person has no pulse and/or if an available ''defibrillator'' is ineffective in restoring a pulse. Clot busting medications that can help open blocked arteries or ''angioplasty'' and ''stent'' placement to open a blocked artery are potential initial treatments available for a heart attack.''If a person with heart attack symptoms is able to swallow, many doctors will recommend initial treatment of four chewable 81 mg “baby ''aspirin''” (do not use aspirin that are coated or labeled as extended release). Some patients may require emergency ''coronary artery bypass'' grafting (surgery that removes segments of blocked heart arteries and replaces them with open vessels taken from other areas of the body).''There are two major types of stroke, with the majority due to a blocked artery in the neck or brain. About 15% of strokes are due to either leakage or rupture of a ''brain aneurysm'', which leads to bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). Unfortunately, both types of stroke can have the same initial symptoms. Emergency medical treatment depends on which type of stroke you or another person is having.''Time to diagnose the type of stroke is critical to treatment since each type of stroke requires different treatment and is time-dependent. It is critical for 911 personnel and the emergency department medical personnel to know the time that the symptoms of stroke first developed or were noticed, as this can determine the treatment options. In contrast to heart attacks, do not give aspirin to a person having a stroke, as aspirin could make the stroke worse if it is hemorrhagic.''Upon arrival to the hospital, a ''CT scan'' of the head will be immediately ordered to image the brain and determine the cause of the stroke symptoms. If the CT scan indicates an ischemic stroke, and if the patient’s stroke symptoms started within 4.5 hours of when they are evaluated, then the treatment can be similar to that of heart attacks (a clot dissolving medication may be administered) if there are no contraindications.''In certain cases, individuals with certain types of ischemic strokes may be candidates for procedures to open up the blocked artery, even if they are outside this time-window. Ultimately, the treatment decisions generally are made with the input from various specialists (neurologist, emergency physician, interventional radiologist) and the treatment options may vary depending on many different factors.''Hemorrhagic strokes can be difficult to treat. Medical treatment includes tightly controlling ''blood pressure'', stopping medications that may increase the bleeding, and monitoring/controlling the pressure inside the brain with surgical placement of a drain to remove blood. A decompressive craniotomy (opening up the skull to relieve the pressure and/or remove blood from around the brain) is an emergency surgery procedure that also may be considered by a neurosurgeon. Other surgical procedures may be undertaken to clamp or seal up a ruptured/leaking ''aneurysm'' or damaged vessel.''Patients with severe heart attacks or severe strokes may require assisted ventilation (life-support).' "
What is the prognosis for heart attack vs. stroke?,"'If you survive the initial event, the prognosis for heart attacks and strokes is highly variable. Some individuals may recover fully and lead normal lives, whereas other individuals may suffer severe permanent disability and require lifelong care. The prognosis depends on the severity of the person’s initial stroke or heart attack, whether they are able to seek medical treatment in a timely manner, their underlying health and medical problems, and the effectiveness of the treatment options available to the them when they are evaluated. The elderly individuals with chronic medical illnesses (such as ''COPD'', ''diabetes'' or ''cancer'', for example) often have worse outcomes.''The prognosis for heart attacks is somewhat worse than strokes, as heart attacks are the leading cause of death in the US.' "
How can heart attack and stroke be prevented?,"'Because heart attacks and strokes have many of the same risk factors, the measures to reduce the risk of these two diseases are the same.''Various lifestyle modifications can decrease the risk of developing a heart attack or stroke. No matter what your age, you can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by engaging in a regular ''exercise'' program and by eating a well-balanced healthy ''diet''. A low-fat ''diet'' with plenty of vegetables and fruit, in addition to moderate ''exercise'' several days a week is recommended.''Other things you can do to prevent a heart attack or stroke include:''For certain individuals, taking the above measures can also help decrease their risk of developing ''high blood pressure'', ''diabetes'' and ''high cholesterol'', which are all risk factors for having a heart attack or stroke. However, if you are diagnosed with ''high blood pressure'', diabetes, or ''high cholesterol'', and you are prescribed medications to help manage these conditions, it is very important to take these medications as instructed to better control these chronic illnesses. Regular check-ups with your doctor or other healthcare professional also are important to monitor and manage these conditions.' Stop smoking Limit your alcohol intake Reduce stress"
What is a gastric emptying study?,"'The most common type of gastric emptying study is a procedure that is done by nuclear medicine physicians using radioactive chemicals that measures the speed with which food empties from the stomach and enters the small intestine. Gastric emptying studies are used for evaluating patients who are having symptoms that may be due to slow and, less commonly, rapid emptying of the stomach.  The symptoms of slow emptying are primarily ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''abdominal pain'', and abdominal fullness after eating.  The symptoms of rapid emptying are ''diarrhea'', ''weakness'', or light-headedness after eating.' "
How is a gastric emptying study done?,"""For a gastric emptying study, a patient eats a meal in which the solid component of the meal (for example, scrambled eggs or oatmeal for vegetarians), the liquid component of the meal (for example, water), or both, are mixed with a small amount of radioactive material. A scanner (acting like a Geiger counter) is placed over the patient's stomach to monitor the amount of radioactivity in the stomach for several hours after the test meal is eaten. As the radioactively-labeled food empties from the stomach, the amount of radioactivity in the stomach decreases. The rate at which the radioactivity leaves the stomach reflects the rate at which food is emptying from the stomach""'Some medications such as narcotic ''pain'' relievers and anticholinergic medications can cause a delay in emptying of the stomach, while other medications such as ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan'') and ''erythromycin'' can cause rapid emptying of the stomach. Medications that slow emptying of the stomach can give a falsely abnormal test result, while medications that speed up emptying of the stomach can give a falsely normal result. Therefore, medications that affect emptying of the stomach should be withheld for 72 hours before performing emptying studies.''Abnormally high blood glucose (''sugar'') levels also can slow emptying of the stomach. Therefore, it is important to control blood glucose levels to near normal levels before performing emptying studies in people with ''diabetes'' who are prone to develop high blood glucose levels.' "
When is a gastric emptying study used?,"'A gastric emptying study often is used when there is a suspicion that there is an abnormally delayed emptying of food from the stomach, medically called delayed gastric emptying. Delayed gastric emptying most commonly gives rise to abdominal discomfort after meals, ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. The two most common causes of delayed gastric emptying are gastric outlet obstruction and ''gastroparesis''. ''Gastric outlet obstruction refers to a condition in which the narrow channel leading from the stomach into the small intestine through which food passes (called the pylorus) is physically blocked, and, as a result food enters the first part of the small intestine (called the duodenum) slowly or not at all. The most common causes of gastric outlet obstruction are scarring or inflammation of the pylorus from peptic ulcers, ''cancers'' of the stomach, or, occasionally, cancers near the pylorus, for example, of the pancreas or duodenum. A diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction is made by tests such as''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'' (''EGD''), abdominal ''computerized tomography'' (''CT scan''), and ''upper GI series''. ''Once gastric outlet obstruction has been excluded by appropriate testing as the cause of delayed gastric emptying, physicians then may perform a gastric emptying study to diagnose ''gastroparesis'"". Gastroparesis is a condition in which there is delayed gastric emptying, but the delay is not due to obstruction. Rather, it is due to abnormal function of the muscles of the stomach. Normal function of the stomach's muscles is necessary in order to propel food from the stomach and into the small intestine. If the muscles or the nerves that control the muscles are not working normally, food remains in the stomach. Gastroparesis is commonly caused by diseases and medications. The most common cause of gastroparesis is ""'diabetes mellitus'"", which affects the function of the stomach's nerves and muscles. Many cases of gastroparesis have no clear cause for the dysfunction. These cases are referred to as idiopathic gastroparesis.""'A gastric emptying study also may be used when there is a suspicion that there is abnormally rapid gastric emptying. Rapid gastric emptying can cause ''diarrhea'' and episodes of weakness or light-headedness following meals (referred to as the ""dumping"" syndrome). Common causes of rapid gastric emptying include surgery of the stomach and ''diabetes'' mellitus. ' "
How are the results of a gastric emptying study evaluated?,"'In patients with gastroparesis, the food and the attached radioactive material remain in the stomach longer than normal (usually hours) before emptying into the small intestine. As a result, the scanner continues to show radioactivity in the area of the stomach for hours after the test meal. If abnormally slow emptying is demonstrated, medications such as metoclopramide (Reglan) may be given to speed up the emptying and improve symptoms. If abnormally rapid emptying of the stomach is found, medications may be given to slow down emptying. ' "
Are there any side effects of a gastric emptying study?,"'There are no side effects from a gastric emptying study. The radioactive material is not absorbed into the body and is eliminated in the ''stool''. Nevertheless, gastric emptying studies as well as any other studies that utilize radioactive materials should not be performed in ''pregnant'' women because the fetus is exposed to some radioactivity. ' "
Are there other tests that can be performed instead of a gastric emptying study?,"'An upper gastrointestinal (GI) series X-ray demonstrates abnormal emptying of barium in patients with a severe emptying problem, however, it cannot diagnose abnormal emptying of a mild or moderate degree. An ''antro-duodenal motility study'' or an ''electrogastrogram'' can demonstrate abnormalities in the muscles and nerves of the stomach, but they do not directly evaluate the effects of these abnormalities on emptying of the stomach. Other experimental methods for evaluating emptying of the stomach have been described, for example, ''ultrasonography'', breath tests using fatty acids, and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) but these tests are available in very few centers.' "
What is stuttering?,"'Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by repetition of sounds, syllables, or words; prolongation of sounds; and interruptions in speech known as blocks. An individual who stutters exactly knows what he or she would like to say but has trouble producing a normal flow of speech. These speech disruptions may be accompanied by struggle behaviors, such as rapid eye blinks or ''tremors'"" of the lips. Stuttering can make it difficult to communicate with other people, which often affects a person's quality of life and interpersonal relationships. Stuttering can also negatively influence job performance and opportunities, and treatment can come at a high financial cost.""""Symptoms of stuttering can vary significantly throughout a person's day. In general, speaking before a group or talking on the telephone may make a person's stuttering more severe, while singing, reading, or speaking in unison may temporarily reduce stuttering.""'Stuttering is sometimes referred to as ''stammering'' and by a broader term, ''disfluent'' speech.' "
Who stutters?,"'Roughly 3 million Americans stutter. Stuttering affects people of all ages. It occurs most often in children between the ages of 2 and 6 as they are developing their language skills. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of all children will stutter for some period in their life, lasting from a few weeks to several years. Boys are 2 to 3 times as likely to stutter as girls and as they get older this gender difference increases; the number of boys who continue to stutter is three to four times larger than the number of girls. Most children outgrow stuttering. Approximately 75 percent of children recover from stuttering. For the remaining 25 percent who continue to stutter, stuttering can persist as a lifelong communication disorder.' "
How is speech normally produced?,"'We make speech sounds through a series of precisely coordinated muscle movements involving ''breathing'', phonation (voice production), and articulation (movement of the throat, palate, tongue, and lips). Muscle movements are controlled by the brain and monitored through our senses of ''hearing'' and touch.' "
What are the causes and types of stuttering?,"'The precise mechanisms that cause stuttering are not understood. Stuttering is commonly grouped into two types termed developmental and neurogenic.'""Developmental stuttering occurs in young children while they are still learning speech and language skills. It is the most common form of stuttering. Some scientists and clinicians believe that developmental stuttering occurs when children's speech and language abilities are unable to meet the child's verbal demands. Most scientists and clinicians believe that developmental stuttering stems from complex interactions of multiple factors. Recent brain imaging studies have shown consistent differences in those who stutter compared to nonstuttering peers. Developmental stuttering may also run in families and research has shown that genetic factors contribute to this type of stuttering. Starting in 2010, researchers at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) have identified four different genes in which mutations are associated with stuttering.""'Neurogenic stuttering may occur after a ''stroke'', head trauma, or other type of brain injury. With neurogenic stuttering, the brain has difficulty coordinating the different brain regions involved in speaking, resulting in problems in production of clear, fluent speech.''At one time, all stuttering was believed to be psychogenic, caused by emotional trauma, but today we know that psychogenic stuttering is rare.'  "
How is stuttering diagnosed?,"""Stuttering is usually diagnosed by a speech-language pathologist, a health professional who is trained to test and treat individuals with voice, speech, and language disorders. The speech-language pathologist will consider a variety of factors, including the child's case history (such as when the stuttering was first noticed and under what circumstances), an analysis of the child's stuttering behaviors, and an evaluation of the child's speech and language abilities and the impact of stuttering on his or her life.""""When evaluating a young child for stuttering, a speech-language pathologist will try to determine if the child is likely to continue his or her stuttering behavior or outgrow it. To determine this difference, the speech-language pathologist will consider such factors as the family's history of stuttering, whether the child's stuttering has lasted 6 months or longer, and whether the child exhibits other speech or language problems.""  "
How is stuttering treated?,"""Although there is currently no cure for stuttering, there are a variety of treatments available. The nature of the treatment will differ, based upon a person's age, communication goals, and other factors. If you or your child stutters, it is important to work with a speech-language pathologist to determine the best treatment options.""""For very young children, early treatment may prevent developmental stuttering from becoming a lifelong problem. Certain strategies can help children learn to improve their speech fluency while developing positive attitudes toward communication. Health professionals generally recommend that a child be evaluated if he or she has stuttered for 3 to 6 months, exhibits struggle behaviors associated with stuttering, or has a family history of stuttering or related communication disorders. Some researchers recommend that a child be evaluated every 3 months to determine if the stuttering is increasing or decreasing. Treatment often involves teaching parents about ways to support their child's production of fluent speech. Parents may be encouraged to:""'Many of the current therapies for teens and adults who stutter focus on helping them learn ways to minimize stuttering when they speak, such as by speaking more slowly, regulating their breathing, or gradually progressing from single-syllable responses to longer words and more complex sentences. Most of these therapies also help address the ''anxiety'' a person who stutters may feel in certain speaking situations.''The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved any drug for the treatment of stuttering. However, some ''drugs'' that are approved to treat other health problems -- such as ''epilepsy'', ''anxiety'', or ''depression'' -- have been used to treat stuttering. These drugs often have side effects that make them difficult to use over a long period of time.'""Some people who stutter use electronic devices to help control fluency. For example, one type of device fits into the ear canal, much like a hearing aid, and digitally replays a slightly altered version of the wearer's voice into the ear so that it sounds as if he or she is speaking in unison with another person. In some people, electronic devices may help improve fluency in a relatively short period of time. Additional research is needed to determine how long such effects may last and whether people are able to easily use and benefit from these devices in real-world situations. For these reasons, researchers are continuing to study the long-term effectiveness of these devices.""'Many people find that they achieve their greatest success through a combination of self-study and therapy. Self-help groups provide a way for people who stutter to find resources and support as they face the challenges of stuttering.'   Provide a relaxed home environment that allows many opportunities for the child to speak. This includes setting aside time to talk to one another, especially when the child is excited and has a lot to say. Listen attentively when the child speaks and focus on the content of the message, rather than responding to how it is said or interrupting the child. Speak in a slightly slowed and relaxed manner. This can help reduce time pressures the child may be experiencing. Listen attentively when the child speaks and wait for him or her to say the intended word. Don't try to complete the child's sentences. Also, help the child learn that a person can communicate successfully even when stuttering occurs. Talk openly and honestly to the child about stuttering if he or she brings up the subject. Let the child know that it is okay for some disruptions to occur."
What research is being conducted on stuttering?,"'Researchers around the world are exploring ways to improve the early identification and treatment of stuttering and to identify its causes. For example, scientists have been working to identify the possible genes responsible for stuttering that tend to run in families. NIDCD scientists have now identified variants in four such genes that account for some cases of stuttering in many populations around the world, including the United States and Europe. All of these genes encode proteins that direct traffic within cells, ensuring that various cell components get to their proper location within the cell.

What is stuttering?,"'Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by repetition of sounds, syllables, or words; prolongation of sounds; and interruptions in speech known as blocks. An individual who stutters exactly knows what he or she would like to say but has trouble producing a normal flow of speech. These speech disruptions may be accompanied by struggle behaviors, such as rapid eye blinks or ''tremors'"" of the lips. Stuttering can make it difficult to communicate with other people, which often affects a person's quality of life and interpersonal relationships. Stuttering can also negatively influence job performance and opportunities, and treatment can come at a high financial cost.""""Symptoms of stuttering can vary significantly throughout a person's day. In general, speaking before a group or talking on the telephone may make a person's stuttering more severe, while singing, reading, or speaking in unison may temporarily reduce stuttering.""'Stuttering is sometimes referred to as ''stammering'' and by a broader term, ''disfluent'' speech.' "
Who stutters?,"'Roughly 3 million Americans stutter. Stuttering affects people of all ages. It occurs most often in children between the ages of 2 and 6 as they are developing their language skills. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of all children will stutter for some period in their life, lasting from a few weeks to several years. Boys are 2 to 3 times as likely to stutter as girls and as they get older this gender difference increases; the number of boys who continue to stutter is three to four times larger than the number of girls. Most children outgrow stuttering. Approximately 75 percent of children recover from stuttering. For the remaining 25 percent who continue to stutter, stuttering can persist as a lifelong communication disorder.' "
How is speech normally produced?,"'We make speech sounds through a series of precisely coordinated muscle movements involving ''breathing'', phonation (voice production), and articulation (movement of the throat, palate, tongue, and lips). Muscle movements are controlled by the brain and monitored through our senses of ''hearing'' and touch.' "
What are the causes and types of stuttering?,"'The precise mechanisms that cause stuttering are not understood. Stuttering is commonly grouped into two types termed developmental and neurogenic.'""Developmental stuttering occurs in young children while they are still learning speech and language skills. It is the most common form of stuttering. Some scientists and clinicians believe that developmental stuttering occurs when children's speech and language abilities are unable to meet the child's verbal demands. Most scientists and clinicians believe that developmental stuttering stems from complex interactions of multiple factors. Recent brain imaging studies have shown consistent differences in those who stutter compared to nonstuttering peers. Developmental stuttering may also run in families and research has shown that genetic factors contribute to this type of stuttering. Starting in 2010, researchers at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) have identified four different genes in which mutations are associated with stuttering.""'Neurogenic stuttering may occur after a ''stroke'', head trauma, or other type of brain injury. With neurogenic stuttering, the brain has difficulty coordinating the different brain regions involved in speaking, resulting in problems in production of clear, fluent speech.''At one time, all stuttering was believed to be psychogenic, caused by emotional trauma, but today we know that psychogenic stuttering is rare.'  "
How is stuttering diagnosed?,"""Stuttering is usually diagnosed by a speech-language pathologist, a health professional who is trained to test and treat individuals with voice, speech, and language disorders. The speech-language pathologist will consider a variety of factors, including the child's case history (such as when the stuttering was first noticed and under what circumstances), an analysis of the child's stuttering behaviors, and an evaluation of the child's speech and language abilities and the impact of stuttering on his or her life.""""When evaluating a young child for stuttering, a speech-language pathologist will try to determine if the child is likely to continue his or her stuttering behavior or outgrow it. To determine this difference, the speech-language pathologist will consider such factors as the family's history of stuttering, whether the child's stuttering has lasted 6 months or longer, and whether the child exhibits other speech or language problems.""  "
How is stuttering treated?,"""Although there is currently no cure for stuttering, there are a variety of treatments available. The nature of the treatment will differ, based upon a person's age, communication goals, and other factors. If you or your child stutters, it is important to work with a speech-language pathologist to determine the best treatment options.""""For very young children, early treatment may prevent developmental stuttering from becoming a lifelong problem. Certain strategies can help children learn to improve their speech fluency while developing positive attitudes toward communication. Health professionals generally recommend that a child be evaluated if he or she has stuttered for 3 to 6 months, exhibits struggle behaviors associated with stuttering, or has a family history of stuttering or related communication disorders. Some researchers recommend that a child be evaluated every 3 months to determine if the stuttering is increasing or decreasing. Treatment often involves teaching parents about ways to support their child's production of fluent speech. Parents may be encouraged to:""'Many of the current therapies for teens and adults who stutter focus on helping them learn ways to minimize stuttering when they speak, such as by speaking more slowly, regulating their breathing, or gradually progressing from single-syllable responses to longer words and more complex sentences. Most of these therapies also help address the ''anxiety'' a person who stutters may feel in certain speaking situations.''The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved any drug for the treatment of stuttering. However, some ''drugs'' that are approved to treat other health problems -- such as ''epilepsy'', ''anxiety'', or ''depression'' -- have been used to treat stuttering. These drugs often have side effects that make them difficult to use over a long period of time.'""Some people who stutter use electronic devices to help control fluency. For example, one type of device fits into the ear canal, much like a hearing aid, and digitally replays a slightly altered version of the wearer's voice into the ear so that it sounds as if he or she is speaking in unison with another person. In some people, electronic devices may help improve fluency in a relatively short period of time. Additional research is needed to determine how long such effects may last and whether people are able to easily use and benefit from these devices in real-world situations. For these reasons, researchers are continuing to study the long-term effectiveness of these devices.""'Many people find that they achieve their greatest success through a combination of self-study and therapy. Self-help groups provide a way for people who stutter to find resources and support as they face the challenges of stuttering.'   Provide a relaxed home environment that allows many opportunities for the child to speak. This includes setting aside time to talk to one another, especially when the child is excited and has a lot to say. Listen attentively when the child speaks and focus on the content of the message, rather than responding to how it is said or interrupting the child. Speak in a slightly slowed and relaxed manner. This can help reduce time pressures the child may be experiencing. Listen attentively when the child speaks and wait for him or her to say the intended word. Don't try to complete the child's sentences. Also, help the child learn that a person can communicate successfully even when stuttering occurs. Talk openly and honestly to the child about stuttering if he or she brings up the subject. Let the child know that it is okay for some disruptions to occur."
What research is being conducted on stuttering?,"'Researchers around the world are exploring ways to improve the early identification and treatment of stuttering and to identify its causes. For example, scientists have been working to identify the possible genes responsible for stuttering that tend to run in families. NIDCD scientists have now identified variants in four such genes that account for some cases of stuttering in many populations around the world, including the United States and Europe. All of these genes encode proteins that direct traffic within cells, ensuring that various cell components get to their proper location within the cell. Such deficits in cellular trafficking are a newly recognized cause of many neurological disorders. Researchers are now studying how this defect in cellular trafficking leads to specific deficits in speech fluency.''Researchers are also working to help speech-language pathologists determine which children are most likely to outgrow their stuttering and which children are at risk for continuing to stutter into adulthood. In addition, researchers are examining ways to identify groups of individuals who exhibit similar stuttering patterns and behaviors that may be associated with a common cause.''Scientists are using brain imaging tools such as PET (positron emission tomography) and functional ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'') scans to investigate brain activity in people who stutter.

What are the risk factors for a sty (stye)?,"'The most common risk factor is sluggish outflow of the sebum from the meibomian glands, which is commonly seen in a chronic inflammatory condition called meibomian gland dysfunction (also commonly called meibomian gland disease, meibomitis, meibomianitis, or ''blepharitis'').''Meibomian gland dysfunction is frequently associated with ''acne rosacea'' on the cheeks and nose but can also be seen alone.'""Other risks include obstruction of the gland's opening by ""'scar'' tissue following infections, ''burns'', or ''trauma'"".

Are styes contagious?,'Styes are not ''contagious''.' 
Which types of specialists treat stys?,"'Health care providers, including pediatricians and ''emergency medicine'' physicians, often diagnose and treat ''eye problems''. Eye specialists, including optometrists and ophthalmologists, are called upon to treat more advanced cases such as styes that appear infected or those that recur.' "
What tests diagnose stys (styes)?,"'The health care professional will examine the lids to locate the opening of the plugged gland. This helps to distinguish between a hordeolum and a chalazion. Also, the doctor will look for signs of scar tissue, foreign bodies, and underlying chronic meibomitis.''In addition, the doctor will look for any signs that the gland may have become infected. It is particularly important to identify infection that has spread from the gland to the eye, neighboring skin, or orbit.'  "
What home remedies relieve pain from a sty (stye)?,'The best home treatment to get rid of a ''stye'' is to apply a warm water compress as often as possible. It is important to remember that a chalazion may take months to resolve completely.'  
What is the treatment for stys (styes)?,"'The most conservative treatment is application of frequent warm (not too hot) compresses alone. This can be accomplished with a wet warm washcloth, microwaveable eye masks (sold at drugstores), or a plug-in electric heating pad. The key is to dedicate as much time as possible to treatment with the warm compress. Several minutes at a time (for example, 15 minutes), several times a day (for example, four times per day) will improve the odds that the sty or chalazion will clear on its own. A child may need help applying the warm compress. Be sure to check the temperature of the compress against another part of your skin, such as the back of your hand, to ensure the compress does not ''burn'' your eye or face.''An ophthalmologist can inject a steroid into the lesion, often resulting in a speedier resolution. However, this carries a small risk of bleeding/''bruising'', depigmentation/thinning of the skin, scar, ''pain'', and in very rare cases, ''loss of vision''.'""Finally, the chalazion can be incised and drained. This is the most invasive method and is reserved as a last resort by most eye doctors. The eyelid is anesthetized, and a clamp is placed around the chalazion. The eyelid is everted, and the meibomian gland is incised from the back surface of the eyelid, avoiding cutting the skin on the front surface. The waxy sebum is scooped out of the gland with a special curette. This debulking of the gland's contents may be sufficient to shrink the chalazion; however, there is risk that the chalazion may recur, particularly if the underlying cause is not addressed.""'If a sty appears infected, oral antibiotics may be necessary. An ''abscess'' can form in the eyelid. A culture of the material in the chalazion is sometimes obtained to identify the bacterium. Antibiotic treatment is particularly important if the bacterial infection is spreading along the skin (''cellulitis'') or spreading into the orbit (orbital cellulitis). Orbital cellulitis is considered an emergency, as rapidly spreading infection can be vision or life-threatening. Orbital cellulitis treatment usually requires intravenous antibiotics.''In some situations, the infection spreads to the eye itself. If ''conjunctivitis'' (''pinkeye'') develops, topical ophthalmic antibiotics (antibiotic ointments or drops) might be necessary.''Treatment of the underlying cause of the sty is also important to prevent recurrence.''Some eye doctors will recommend not wearing ''contact lenses'"" or eye makeup until the sty resolves.

An ophthalmologist will look for signs of ''malignancy'' and obtain a biopsy of one is suspected.' "
What is the prognosis for a sty (stye)?,"'A hordeolum may resolve in a few days, while a chalazion may take months. Both types of styes should resolve completely once the plugged gland drains. If an infection sets in, treatment will be necessary.'""Recurrence is likely if chronic underlying conditions aren't addressed. In the case of meibomitis, your eye doctor will likely recommend daily cleansing of the eyelids and eyelashes with a gentle soap (such as baby shampoo). Increased intake of ""'omega-3 fatty acids'' in the ''diet'' or from ''supplements'' may also help improve the flow of the sebum. Small doses of oral ''doxycycline'' are prescribed for ''acne'' ''rosacea'' and meibomitis in some patients.' "
Can you prevent stys (styes)?,"'The best ''prevention'' is to keep the eyelids and eyelashes clean. This can be done with daily diluted baby shampoo lid scrubs while in the shower or use of eyelid cleansing pads available at drug stores. Many people benefit from daily warm compresses.''A ''diet'' high in ''omega-3 fatty acids'' (for example, fish or flaxseeds) and vegetables is believed to have an anti-inflammatory effect and is associated with improvement of meibomian gland function and better eye health in general.''Ask your ophthalmologist for advice about the use of preventative antibiotics. For example, in adults with chronic recurring chalazions, low-dose oral doxycycline may help meibomian gland dysfunction, but doxycycline should be avoided in children and women of child-bearing age.''A device undergoing ''clinical trials'' that warms the lids and expresses thickened oils may also help alleviate chronically clogged oil glands.'  "
What is a sty?,"'A ''sty'' is a localized infection with inflammation of the ''eyelid'' margin, usually involving eyelash hair follicles or ''eyelid'' glands (meibomian glands). A ''sty'' (also spelled ''stye'' and also termed a ''hordeolum'') is usually a painful, reddish, and swollen area on the eyelid margin and is caused most often by the bacterium ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ''(about 90%-95% of cases).' "
How will I know if I have a sty?,"'Most people know when they develop a ''sty'' because of the symptoms and signs that are as follows:''Sometimes a ''sty'' is confused with a ''chalazion'', which is a blockage of a small oil gland behind the eyelashes. It differs from a ''sty'' because it is usually not painful and is most prominent on the inner side of the eyelid. However, the treatment for both conditions is essentially the same.''Most doctors diagnose a sty simply by observation; no tests are needed.' A red lump or bump begins to occur on an eyelid margin that resembles a boil or a pimple. Almost always there will be eyelid discomfort or pain. Some individuals will develop eyelid swelling. Some individuals will have increased tear formation."
Is a sty contagious?,"'There is some disagreement among experts about the contagiousness of a ''sty''. In most individuals, a sty develops when some normal occurring and/or transient bacteria multiply in the eyelid margin. Because these bacteria are not necessarily transferred from one person to another, some investigators consider a sty to be noncontagious. Others, however, feel that if another person contacts the causative bacterium and they touched their eyes, it is possible to transfer the infection, but this happens very infrequently; nonetheless, these experts consider this to be a ''contagious'' disease. The compromise position would be that, in most instances, a sty is not ''contagious'' unless certain circumstances are met, such as touching a sty and then transferring the causative organism to another person, where it may or may not cause a sty or other infection to develop.' "
How is a sty spread?,"'Most of the time a sty is not spread from person to person except under unusual circumstances. However, in the same person, the infection responsible for a sty can spread to other areas of the eyelid and eventually to other components in the eye to produce an emergency condition termed orbital ''cellulitis''. This type of spread of a sty is very infrequent.' "
When will I know I am cured of a sty?,"'The majority of people who get a sty usually see it resolve in about seven days; the symptoms gradually disappear. Also, many people self-treat by utilizing warm compresses that eventually cause the sty to discharge or drain a small amount of pus. This simple treatment can hasten recovery. However, people who develop a sty are more likely to form another one in the future. There are no tests indicated for diagnosis of a sty.' "
When should I contact a health care professional about a sty?,"'Most individuals who develop a sty do not need to contact a health care professional since most infections are either self-limiting or can be easily treated by warm compresses at home. However, if the eyelid begins to develop generalized redness and swelling, you should contact your physician and/or ophthalmologist urgently. Some of the infections will not drain (even after warm compression treatments have been done for two to three days) and require small incisions or removal of an eyelash to drain the pus from a sty; this should be done by a trained health care professional or an ophthalmologist.'

What are complications of stys?,"'When a sty or chalazion clears on its own, there are rarely complications.''A steroid injection carries the complication of possible scarring of the lid, discoloration (depigmentation) of the overlying skin, infection, bleeding or bruising, and in extremely rare situations, ''blindness'' if the steroid is injected improperly.''Incision and drainage of a chalazion carries a risk of scarring or deformity of the eyelid, bleeding, or bruising.''If a sty or chalazion becomes infected, the infection can spread to the eye (''conjunctivitis'' or corneal ''keratitis''), skin (cellulitis), or orbit (orbital cellulitis). Prompt treatment for these complications is extremely important, and your ophthalmologist will prescribe the appropriate antibiotics when indicated.''Very rarely, a chronic, recurring chalazion is a sign of a ''cancer'' in the eyelid. An ophthalmologist will look for signs of ''malignancy'' and obtain a biopsy of one is suspected.' "
What is the prognosis for a sty (stye)?,"'A hordeolum may resolve in a few days, while a chalazion may take months. Both types of styes should resolve completely once the plugged gland drains. If an infection sets in, treatment will be necessary.'""Recurrence is likely if chronic underlying conditions aren't addressed. In the case of meibomitis, your eye doctor will likely recommend daily cleansing of the eyelids and eyelashes with a gentle soap (such as baby shampoo). Increased intake of ""'omega-3 fatty acids'' in the ''diet'' or from ''supplements'' may also help improve the flow of the sebum. Small doses of oral ''doxycycline'' are prescribed for ''acne'' ''rosacea'' and meibomitis in some patients.' "
Can you prevent stys (styes)?,"'The best ''prevention'' is to keep the eyelids and eyelashes clean. This can be done with daily diluted baby shampoo lid scrubs while in the shower or use of eyelid cleansing pads available at drug stores. Many people benefit from daily warm compresses.''A ''diet'' high in ''omega-3 fatty acids'' (for example, fish or flaxseeds) and vegetables is believed to have an anti-inflammatory effect and is associated with improvement of meibomian gland function and better eye health in general.''Ask your ophthalmologist for advice about the use of preventative antibiotics. For example, in adults with chronic recurring chalazions, low-dose oral doxycycline may help meibomian gland dysfunction, but doxycycline should be avoided in children and women of child-bearing age.''A device undergoing ''clinical trials'' that warms the lids and expresses thickened oils may also help alleviate chronically clogged oil glands.'  "
What is a subconjunctival hemorrhage?,'The conjunctiva is the clear tissue that covers the white of the eye (the sclera) and lines the inside of both eyelids. A subconjunctival hemorrhage is blood from a tiny broken blood vessel located between the conjunctiva and the underlying sclera.' 
What are the risk factors for subconjunctival hemorrhage?,"'Most subconjunctival hemorrhages are spontaneous and not linked to any specific risk factors. If the hemorrhage is not spontaneous, then the risk factors for subconjunctival hemorrhage include ''trauma'' to the eye, eye surgery, the use of ''contact lenses'', the use of medication that inhibits clotting or promotes bleeding, and diseases that are characterized by decreases in ''platelet count'' or vascular fragility. Because of the association between increasing vascular fragility and advanced age, being older also includes an increased risk of subconjunctival hemorrhage.' "
What causes a subconjunctival hemorrhage?,"'The conjunctiva contains nerves and many small blood vessels. These blood vessels are usually barely visible but become larger and more visible if the eye is inflamed. These blood vessels are somewhat fragile and their walls break easily, resulting in a subconjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding under the conjunctiva). A subconjunctival hemorrhage appears as a bright red or dark red patch on the sclera. Most subconjunctival hemorrhages are spontaneous without an obvious cause for the bleeding. The come from normal ''conjunctival'' blood vessels. Since most subconjunctival hemorrhages are painless, a person may discover a subconjunctival hemorrhage only by looking in the mirror. Many spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhages are first noticed by another person seeing a red spot on the white of your eye. Rarely there may be an abnormally large or angulated blood vessel as the source of the hemorrhage.''The following can occasionally result in a spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhage:''Subconjunctival hemorrhage can also be non-spontaneous and result from hemorrhagic ''conjunctivitis'', a severe eye infection, ''trauma'' to the head or eye, or after ''cataract surgery'', other eye surgery, or ''eyelid surgery''.'   Sneezing Coughing Straining/vomiting or a Valsalva maneuver, increasing the pressure in the veins of the head, as in weight lifting or lying on an inversion table upside-down Eye rubbing or inserting contact lenses Certain infections of the outside of the eye (conjunctivitis) where a virus or a bacteria weaken the walls of small blood vessels under the conjunctiva Medical disorder causing bleeding or inhibiting normal clotting The use of anticoagulant medication such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) or other blood thinners"
What are subconjunctival hemorrhage symptoms and signs?,"'Most of the time, no symptoms are associated with a subconjunctival hemorrhage other than seeing blood over the white part of the eye or ""blood in the whites of the eye.""''Call a primary care provider or ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specializes in ''eye care'' and surgery) if the subconjunctival hemorrhage does not get better within two weeks or if it has happened multiple times.''Also, call your health care provider if you have a hemorrhage in both eyes at the same time or if the subconjunctival hemorrhage coincides with a new onset of ''easy bruising'' or ''bleeding gums''.''Go to a doctor immediately if the subconjunctival hemorrhage is associated with'   Very rarely people experience pain when the hemorrhage begins. When the bleeding first occurs, one may notice a sense of fullness in the eye or under the lid. Mild pressure around the eye may also be experienced. There is no associated headache. As the hemorrhage resolves, some people may feel very mild irritation of the eye or merely a sense of awareness of the eye. The hemorrhage itself is an obvious, sharply outlined bright red area overlying the sclera. The entire white part of the eye may occasionally be covered by blood. In a spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhage, no blood will exit from the eye. If one blots the eye with a tissue, there should be no blood on the tissue. The hemorrhage will appear larger within the first 24 hours after its onset and then will slowly decrease in size as the blood is absorbed. pain, changes in vision (for example, blurry vision, double vision, difficulty seeing), a history of recent injury or trauma, and a history of bleeding disorder."
How do health care professionals diagnose a subconjunctival hemorrhage?,"'A health care provider will take a medical history and medication history to determine what events were leading up to the subconjunctival hemorrhage and will also perform an examination. Vital signs including ''blood pressure'' may also be checked.''If trauma was the cause, a more thorough examination will usually be performed.''In ''newborn'' infants, subconjunctival hemorrhage can occasionally be found as a result of the birth process.' "
What specialists treat a subconjunctival hemorrhage?,'Your primary care provider or ophthalmologist can make the diagnosis. That physician can also order tests if you have a recent history of ''easy bruising''.' 
Are there home remedies for a subconjunctival hemorrhage?,"'Because of the benign nature of most subconjunctival hemorrhage, there is no need for home remedies.' "
What is the treatment for a subconjunctival hemorrhage?,"'Usually, no treatment is needed. ''Over-the-counter'' artificial tears can be applied to the eye if mild irritation is present. The eye does not require a patch.''The use of ''aspirin'' or other medication that inhibits clotting should be avoided. If you are taking ''aspirin'' or an ''anticoagulant'' for a medical condition, check with your physician to determine whether the medication should be stopped or continued. Do not stop anti-coagulation medicines without physician consultation. These medications are frequently life savers, and they rarely need to be discontinued for a subconjunctival hemorrhage.''If the subconjunctival hemorrhage is trauma-related, an ophthalmologist will determine what other treatment is necessary to promote healing of the injury.''If the subconjunctival hemorrhage is a result of an external infection, an ophthalmologist may prescribe antibiotic drops or an ointment.''This condition clears by itself within one to two weeks. Recovery is usually complete, without any long-term problems, similar to a mild bruise under the skin. Like a bruise, a subconjunctival hemorrhage changes colors (often red to orange to yellow) as it heals. A skin bruise changes to various shades of green, black, and blue as it heals, because the blood is being seen through skin. Because the conjunctiva is transparent, a subconjunctival hemorrhage never has these color characteristics.''Very rarely, with recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage in the same location in the same eye, there may be an abnormal fragile capillary within the conjunctiva that has thin walls and tends to bleed spontaneously. An ophthalmologist can identify such a condition and close this non-essential blood vessel using heat, either from a laser or a diathermy unit.'  "
What are possible complications of a subconjunctival hemorrhage?,'A subconjunctival hemorrhage will not cause any complications unless it is associated with trauma to the eye or a recent history of easy ''bruising''.' 
What is the prognosis for subconjunctival hemorrhage?,'The prognosis of subconjunctival hemorrhage is excellent when it occurs in the absence of trauma. It will spontaneously become smaller and disappear in less than two weeks. It will cause no scarring visual loss or other ''ocular'' changes.' 
Is it possible to prevent a subconjunctival hemorrhage?,"'If you are having frequent subconjunctival hemorrhages or your subconjunctival hemorrhage is associated with easy ''bruising'' or bleeding elsewhere, you should have a medical evaluation for an underlying bleeding or clotting problem. Successful treatment of such an underlying condition may prevent future hemorrhages.' "
Why is submuscular breast augmentation done?,"'Submuscular ''breast augmentation'' is a surgical procedure that involves changing the shape of the breasts and enlarging them by placing an implant below the breast muscles. The muscles are spread apart to accommodate the implant, but the surgeon does not cut through them. This preserves the insertion of the breast muscles at the sternum.\xa0''Breast enlargement, in general, involves four techniques:''Implants are round or teardrop-shaped and are filled with either silicone or saline solutions.' Injecting inert materials such as silicone or paraffin directly into breast tissue Utilizing tissues from one’s body for injecting into the breast tissue Using a suction pump device for enhancing breast shape Implanting fluid-filled implants to augment breast size"
Who should avoid breast augmentation?,'Women who' Have severe breast sagging; a different cosmetic breast surgery (mastopexy) is preferred over augmentation procedure Have certain breast deformities that pose a risk Have severe medical conditions that may cause difficulty in the surgery
What is the procedure for submuscular breast augmentation?," You should consult a plastic surgeon before the surgery to discuss your expectations, details of the procedure, surgery preparation and post-surgery care You should detail the medical and medication history; especially, any breast-related disorders Your surgeon might require photographs before the surgery The surgeon marks your skin the day before to guide the surgery You would be given a local anesthetic to numb the site.  An incision is made at the base of the breasts or around the nipple.  The incised area is dissected, and the area between the two breast muscles is located.  An implant is inserted into this area and filled with either saline or silicone solution.  The incision is closed after placing the drains.  A compressing dressing will be placed. The drains are generally removed 2-5 days after the procedure. You can resume your deskwork within one week, and slowly increase your physical activities by three weeks. Wear an underwire bra while performing heavy exercises."
Is submuscular breast augmentation safe?,"'Breast augmentation is one of the safest cosmetic procedures, producing soft and natural-appearing breasts.''Side effects of submuscular breast augmentation include:\xa0' bleeding pain swelling fever infection changes in sensation of the nipple scars asymmetry of the breasts"
What Is Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Sometimes brain ''seizures'' begin in a vital area of the brain -- for example, in areas that control movement, feeling, language, or memory. When this is the case, a relatively new ''epilepsy treatment'' called multiple subpial transection (MST) may be an option. MST stops the ''seizure'' impulses by cutting nerve fibers in the outer layers of the brain (''gray matter''), sparing the vital functions concentrated in the deeper layers of brain tissue (white matter).' "
Who Is a Candidate for Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Most people with ''epilepsy'' can control their ''seizures'' with medication. However, about 20% of people with ''epilepsy'' do not improve with ''drugs''. In some cases, surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures may be recommended.''MST may be an option for people who do not respond to medication and whose seizures begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. In addition, there must be a reasonable chance that the person will benefit from surgery. MST may be done alone or with the removal of a section of brain tissue (resection). MST also may be used as a treatment for children with ''Landau-Kleffner syndrome'' (LKS), a rare childhood brain disorder which causes seizures and affects the parts of the brain that control speech and comprehension.' "
What Happens Before Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Candidates for MST undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation -- including ''seizure'' monitoring, electroencephalography (''EEG''), ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), and positron emission tomography (PET). These tests help to pinpoint the area in the brain where the seizures occur and determine if surgery is feasible.'""Another test to assess electrical activity in the brain is EEG-video monitoring, in which video cameras are used to record seizures as they occur, while the EEG monitors the brain's activity. In some cases, invasive monitoring -- in which electrodes are placed inside the skull over a specific area of the brain -- is also used to further identify the tissue responsible for seizures."" "
What Happens During Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'MST requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. (""Crani"" refers to the skull and ""otomy"" means ""to cut into."") After the patient is put to ''sleep'' with anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the ''scalp'', removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a ""window"" in which the surgeon inserts his or her surgical instruments. The surgeon utilizes information gathered during pre-surgical brain imaging to help identify the area of abnormal brain tissue and avoid areas of the brain responsible for vital functions.''Using a surgical microscope to produce a magnified view of the brain, the surgeon makes a series of parallel, shallow ''cuts'' (transections) in gray matter, just below the pia mater (subpial), the delicate membrane that surrounds the brain (it lies beneath the dura). The cuts are made over the entire area identified as the source of the seizures. After the transactions are made, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed using ''stitches'' or staples.' "
What Happens After Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'After MST, the patient generally stays in an intensive care unit for 24 to 48 hours and in a regular hospital room for three to four days. Most people who have MST will be able to return to their normal activities, including work or school, in six to eight weeks after surgery. Most patients will continue to take anti-seizure medication. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
How Effective Is Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'MST results in satisfactory improvement in seizure control in about 70% of patients, although the procedure is still relatively new, and no long-term outcome data are available. Children with LKS or other forms of ''epilepsy'' not controlled by medication may have improved intellectual and psychosocial functioning following MST.' "
What Are the Side Effects of Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'The following side effects may occur after MST, although they generally go away on their own over several weeks:' Scalp numbness. Nausea. Feeling tired or depressed. Headaches. Difficulty speaking, remembering, or finding words."
What Risks Are Associated With Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'The risks associated with MST include:''WebMD Medical Reference' Risks associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and an allergic reaction to anesthesia. Failure to relieve seizures. Swelling in the brain. Damage to healthy brain tissue."
Why Have the Procedure?,"'Some people have stubborn areas of fat cells that will not shrink no matter how much they ''diet'' or ''exercise''. The common areas for these fat pockets include the chin, neck, hips, abdomen, thighs, buttocks and even calves and ankles. ''A newer technique called ultrasonic-assisted lipoplasty (UAL) may help you address that unwanted fat. UAL is an enhancement to the currently used tumescent ''liposuction'' method. To keep your new shape and new weight after this lipoplasty, you will need to follow a proper ''diet'' and ''exercise'' plan. ' "
How Does Lipoplasty Differ From Other Liposuction Techniques?,""" UAL uses high-frequency sound waves to liquefy fat beneath the skin's surface before removing it with gentle suction. Tumescent liposuction and traditional liposuction cannot liquefy fat cells, and this makes the fat more difficult to remove. "" "
What Are the Benefits of Lipoplasty?,"'Early results by a select group of ''plastic'' surgeons internationally have been encouraging. However, further study is needed to determine if lipoplasty will replace existing  liposuction  techniques.''UAL allows physicians to remove significant amounts of fat in a single session because the fat is liquefied by sound waves. It can be especially useful in areas of dense fat such as the back. The use of sound waves prevents surrounding blood vessels and connective tissue from being damaged because fat cells are selectively destroyed and removed. ' "
What Happens During Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"' Several steps are involved. Similar to traditional liposuction, the skin is marked to indicate the precise area from which the fat will be removed. Next, a large amount of very dilute anesthetic solution is injected into the body site to numb and swell the fatty area (tumescent technique). '' Then, in a step unique to lipoplasty, a thin tube-like instrument called an ultrasonic probe is inserted beneath the skin through a small incision. The probe is maneuvered in a crisscross pattern while sound waves generate negative pressure, causing the fat cells to implode, or collapse, and liquefy. The liquefied fat and anesthetic fluid are removed using gentle suction. ' "
What Happens After Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"' Patients are instructed to wear a tight-fitting garment, such as a girdle or thick support hose for up to six weeks after the procedure. Sometimes, postoperative ''pain'' medication is not needed because the injected anesthetic solution keeps the area numb for 12 hours or more. '"" Every person's outcome will vary somewhat based on factors such as volume of fat cells removed and area of removal. Your doctor will discuss what results you can expect to achieve, and how to best maintain your new body shape. "" "
Are The Results of Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty Permanent?,"' The fat cells are removed permanently, so if you gain weight after the procedure, it will usually not concentrate in the treated area. This is because you now have less cells in the treated area in which fat can be deposited. However, ultrasonic-assisted lipoplasty will not prevent you from regaining weight. ' "
Who Is a Good Candidate for Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"' A thorough evaluation by a board-certified ''plastic surgeon'' experienced in lipoplasty will determine if you are a good candidate. But in general, a good candidate for lipoplasty (as well as other liposuction techniques) is a person of average or slightly above average weight, in good health, with a localized area of fat that does not respond well to diet and exercise. ' "
Who Can Perform Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"'Board-certified plastic surgeons who have undergone specialized training required by the Ultrasonic Liposuction Task Force can perform lipoplasty. This task force was established by three major ''plastic surgery'' societies: The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, The Aesthetic Society and The Lipoplasty Society. Its mission is to set safety standards for the performance of UAL. Do not hesitate to ask your doctor about credentials and training and how many lipoplasty procedures he or she has performed. ' "
Are There Risks Involved With Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"'UAL has a good safety record to date, but carries the same risks as all liposuction surgery, such as rare occurrence of infection, blood or fat clots; or cosmetic risks like a change in skin pigmentation, or skin texture. Post-operative fluid collections, known as seromas may also form. However these can be drained with a needle and a syringe.''Unique to UAL is the risk of ''burns'' caused by heat from the ultrasonic probe. This risk is minimized when performed by a surgeon skilled in lipoplasty. Some patients may have an adverse reaction to the anesthetic, and may develop redness or other pigment changes. ' "
How Much Does Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty Cost?,"'Ask to talk with a representative who can explain the costs of the procedure and payment options. Like other elective cosmetic procedures, UAL is not covered by health insurance plans. ''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic, Department of Plastic Surgery.''Edited by  Charlotte E.

Introduction to sudden cardiac arrest,"""A natural disaster hits, the power goes off and the lights go out. It's a common scene that plays out during hurricane and tornado seasons, and it's very similar in trying to explain ""'sudden cardiac arrest''. The ''heart'"" sustains an insult, the electricity is short circuited, the heart can't pump, and the body dies.""'The heart is an electrical pump, where the electricity is generated in special ''pacemaker'' cells in the upper chamber, or ''atrium'', of the heart. This electrical spark is carried through pathways in the heart so that all the muscle cells contract at once and produce a heart beat. This pumps blood through the heart valves and into all the organs of the body so that they can do their work.'""This mechanism can break down in a variety of ways, but the final pathway in sudden death is the same: the electrical system is irritated and fails to produce electrical activity that causes the heart to beat. The heart muscle can't supply blood to the body, particularly the brain, and the body dies. Ventricular ""'fibrillation'' (V Fib) is the most common reason for sudden death in patients. Without a coordinated electrical signal, the bottom chambers of the heart (ventricles) stop beating and instead, jiggle like Jello. Ventricular Fibrillation is treated with electrical ''shock'', but for it to be effective, the shock usually needs to happen within less than four to six minutes, not only for it to be effective, but also to minimize ''brain damage'' from lack of blood and oxygen supply. Automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) are commonly available in public places to allow almost anybody to treat sudden death. Less commonly, the heart can just stop beating. The absence of a heart beat is known as asystole (asystole: a=no + systole=beat).'  "
What are the causes of sudden cardiac arrest?,"'Sudden death is most often caused by ''heart disease''. When blood vessels narrow, the heart muscle can become irritated because of lack of blood supply. In ''heart attack'' (''acute myocardial infarction''), a blood vessel becomes completely blocked by a ''blood clot'', and there is enough irritability of the muscle to cause ventricular fibrillation. In fact, the reason many people with ''chest pain'' are admitted to the hospital is to monitor their heart rate and rhythm for signs that might lead to ventricular fibrillation. Sudden death may also be the first sign or symptom of ''heart disease''.''Congestive heart failure'' and heart valve problems, like ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the ''aortic valve'') also increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest.''Cardiomyopathy'' is a broad category of ''heart disease'"" where the heart muscle does not contract properly for whatever reason. Often it is ischemic, where part of the heart muscle doesn't get an adequate blood supply for a prolonged period of time and no longer can efficiently pump blood. People whose ejection fractions (the amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each heart beat) is less than 30% are at greater risk for sudden death (a normal ejection fraction is above 50%). In some people, ""'cardiomyopathy'' may develop in the absence of ischemic heart disease.''Inflammation of the heart muscle, known as ''myocarditis'' (myo=muscle + card=heart + itis= inflammation), can also cause rhythm disturbances. Diseases like ''sarcoidosis'', ''amyloidosis'', and infections can cause inflammation of the heart muscle. ''Some people are born with electrical conducting systems that are faulty, which place them at higher risk for rhythm disturbances. Some are due to the wiring, or electrical conduction system, like ''Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome'', while others are due to the structural basic structural problems within the heart, like ''Marfan syndrome''.''Pulmonary embolus or a ''blood clot'"" to the lung, can also cause sudden death. Clots form in the leg or arm and may break off and flow to the lung where they decrease the lung's ability to get oxygen from the air to the body. Risk factors for ""'blood clots'' include surgery, prolonged immobilization (for example, hospitalization, long car rides or plane trips), ''trauma'', or certain diseases like ''cancer''.''Blunt chest trauma, such is in a motor vehicle accident, may result in ventricular fibrillation. (please see commotio cordis below)' "
What about sudden cardiac arrest in the young?,"'In younger people, sudden death is a rare event, but since it often involves people involved in athletics, cases are often reported in the press. The most common cause is ''hypertrophic cardiomyopathy'' (hypertrophy=to grow abnormally large + cardio=heart + myopathy = diseased muscle). This disease is often hereditary, and the walls of the ventricle are larger than they should be. This makes the pumping chamber of the heart smaller, and the heart has to work harder to pump blood out of the heart. As well, the thickened muscle narrows the space for the blood to flow through the aortic valve and to the rest of the body. During ''exercise'', this decreased blood flow can irritate the heart muscle itself and cause ventricular fibrillation, collapse, and sudden death.''Anomalous coronary arteries can also cause sudden death in the young. The heart is a muscle itself, and like any muscle, it needs blood supply to provide oxygen for it to work. Normally, the coronary arteries lie on the surface of the heart. Anomalous arteries dive into the heart muscle itself and may be occluded when the heart muscle that surrounds the abnormally placed artery squeezes aggressively, as with ''exercise'', shutting off blood supply to part of the heart. This irritates the electrical system and can cause ventricular fibrillation and sudden death.''The pre-participation athletic physical examination is a useful tool to screen children andadolescents for their risk of sudden cardiac arrest.''Commotio cordis is a situation in which the heart stops when the chest is hit by an object. News stories occasionally report of baseball players who are hit in the chest by a ball and collapse because their heart stops beating. The heart sits behind the breastbone, and the electrical system can be short circuited when a direct blow is sustained. ' "
What are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest?,"'Cardiac arrest symptoms and signs are not subtle:'   The heart stops beating and blood is not supplied to the body.  Almost immediate loss of consciousness occurs, and the affected person will not be able to be aroused. 
	 The person will fall or slump over.  No pulse will is felt (palpable). There will be no signs of breathing."
How is sudden cardiac arrest diagnosed?,'Sudden cardiac arrest is an unexpected death in a person who had no known previous diagnosis of a fatal disease or condition. The person may or may not have heart disease.' 
What is the treatment for sudden cardiac arrest?,"'The vast majority of people whose heart stops beating unexpectedly have ventricular fibrillation. The definitive treatment for this is ''defibrillation'' using electricity to shock the heart back into a regular rhythm. With technological advances, AEDs are now a routine sight wherever people congregate.''Communities which institute public CPR education, use of AEDs, and rapid activation of 911 emergency medical services have dramatically increased survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest. Unfortunately, because the brain is so sensitive to the lack of oxygen and blood flow, unless treatment occurs within four to six minutes, there is a high risk of some permanent brain damage.''Should the patient survive to be transported to the hospital, the reason for collapse and sudden death will need to be diagnosed. Regardless, the ABCs of resuscitation will be re-evaluated. ''A''irway, ''B''reathing, and ''C''irculation (heart beat and ''blood pressure'') will be supported, and admission to an intensive care unit is most likely.''Diagnostic tests may include repeated electrocardiograms (EKGs), ''echocardiogram'' (ultrasounds of the heart), and ''cardiac catheterization'' and electrophysiologic studies, in which the electrical pathways of the heart are mapped.''Recent research involving the treatment of survivors of cardiac arrest suggests that prompt institution of ''hypothermia'' (cooling of the body) may prevent or lessen the degree of ''brain injury''. ''Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest are often candidates for ''implantable cardiac defibrillators''.' "
Can sudden cardiac arrest be prevented?,"'Death is best treated by ''prevention''. Most sudden death is associated with heart disease, so the at-risk population remains males older than 40 years of age who smoke, have ''high blood pressure'', and ''diabetes'' (the risk factors for heart attack). Other risks include ''syncope'' (''fainting'' or loss of consciousness) and known heart disease.'""Syncope, or loss of consciousness, is a significant risk factor for sudden death. While some reasons for passing out are benign, there is always a concern that the reason was an abnormal heart rhythm that subsequently spontaneously corrected. The fear is that the next episode will be a sudden cardiac arrest. Depending on the healthcare provider's suspicion based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and ""'EKG'', the healthcare practitioner may recommend inpatient or outpatient heart monitoring to try to find a clue as to whether the passing out was due to a deadly heart rhythm. Unfortunately, the potentially suspect rhythm may not recur and depending on the situation, prolonged outpatient monitoring lasting weeks and months may be necessary. Use of electrophysiologic testing may help identify high risk patients (the electrical pathways are mapped using techniques similar to heart catheterization).''In people with symptoms of ''chest pain'', aside from making the diagnosis, monitoring both the heart rate and rhythm are emphasized. The purpose of watching people with chest ''pain'' in a hospital setting is to prevent sudden cardiac arrest.''Using implantable defibrillators in high risk patients, especially those with markedly decreased ejection fractions can reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest. These devices are placed under the skin in the chest wall and have wires that are attached to the heart itself. When they detect ventricular fibrillation, a shock is automatically delivered to the heart, restoring a heart beat and averting sudden death.' "
What is the prognosis for sudden cardiac arrest?,"'The frequency of sudden cardiac arrest is related to the frequency of ''coronary artery disease''. If public health initiatives work to decrease risk the factors for heart disease, the risk for sudden death should decrease as well. ''In the adolescent population, increased awareness of hypertrophic ''cardiomyopathy'' and appropriate screening may decrease the frequency of sudden death.''Public education and widespread availability of AEDs will increase survival.' "
What is the glucose tolerance test?,"'Though no longer routinely used for diagnosing ''diabetes''.' The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was the gold standard for making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It is still commonly used during pregnancy for diagnosing gestational diabetes. With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least 8 hours, but not more than 16 hours). The next morning, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives a dose of oral glucose (the dose depends upon the length of the test). There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person drinks. Blood samples are taken up to four times at different time points after consumption of the sugar to measure the blood glucose."
How reliable is the glucose tolerance test?,"'For the glucose tolerance test to give reliable results, the person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a ''common cold''). Also, the person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital) and should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose.' In preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test, the person should eat and drink as they normally would. The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or consume caffeine."
What does the glucose tolerance test measure?,"'The classic oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels five times over a period of three hours. Some physicians simply take a baseline blood sample followed by a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without ''diabetes'', the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with ''diabetes'', glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast.''People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic levels have so-called ''impaired glucose tolerance'' (IGT). People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes.''Each year, 5% to 10% of people whose test results show impaired glucose tolerance actually develop diabetes. ''Weight loss'' and ''exercise'' may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as ''metformin'' (''Glucophage''), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes. Studies have shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the development of ''heart disease'', and whether impaired glucose tolerance turns out to be an entity that deserves treatment itself is something that physicians are currently debating.' "
What is the preparation for a glucose tolerance test?," As mentioned previously, preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test involves fasting overnight (from 8 to 16 hours) and participating normally in activities of daily living. The individual should eat and drink as they normally do prior to the test. The morning of the test, the person should not consume caffeine or smoke."
How are the results of the glucose tolerance test evaluated?,"'Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:' Normal response: A person is said to have a normal 
  response when the two hour glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values 
  between 0 and 2 hours are less than 200 mg/dl. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): A person is said to have impaired 
  glucose tolerance when the fasting plasma glucose is 
  less than 126 mg/dl and the two hour glucose level is between 140 and 199 
  mg/dl. This is sometimes referred to as ""prediabetes"" because people with IGT 
  have a higher risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes: A person has diabetes when two diagnostic 
  tests done on different days show that the blood glucose level is high. This means either the 
  two hour levels is greater than 200 mg/dl or the fasting glucose is noted as greater than 126 mg/dl.
  A 
  glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5% or more also supports a 
  diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes during pregnancy: A pregnant woman has diabetes 
	if she has a fasting plasma glucose of over 92 mg/dl, or a two hour glucose level 
	greater than 153 mg/dl."
What about glucose tolerance testing during pregnancy?,"'As mentioned previously, the glucose tolerance test is used for the diagnosis of ''gestational diabetes'' (diabetes that develops during pregnancy). It may be used if there are equivocal fasting or random blood glucose results, or to screen for gestational diabetes in pregnant women between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation who are not known to have diabetes.\t ''The test may also be used in the postpartum period to detect diabetes in women who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Women who had gestational diabetes do not always develop diabetes later in life, but they should undergo diabetes screening at least every three years throughout their life.\t ' "
Facts you should know about suicide," Suicide is the act of purposely ending one's own life. How societies view suicide varies by culture, religion, ethnic norms, and the circumstances under which it occurs. More than 800,000 people worldwide commit suicide each year -- nearly 45,000 as recently as in 2016 in the United States. Self-mutilation is the act of deliberately hurting oneself without meaning to cause one's own death. Physician-assisted suicide refers to a doctor ending the life of a person who is incurably ill in a way that is either painless or minimally painful for the purpose of ending the suffering of the individual. The effects of suicide on the loved ones of the deceased can be devastating, resulting in suicide survivors experiencing a variety of conflicting, painful emotions. Life circumstances that may immediately precede a suicide include recent discharge from a psychiatric hospital, a sudden change in how the person appears to feel, or a real or imagined loss. Firearms are the most common means by which people take their lives. Other common methods include overdose of medication, asphyxiation, and hanging. There are gender, age, ethnic, and geographical risk factors for suicide, as well as those based on family history, life stresses, and medical and mental health status. In children and teens, bullying and being bullied seem to be associated with committing suicide, and being bullied is apparently a risk for committing murder-suicide. Warning signs that an individual is imminently planning to kill him- or herself may include the making of a will, getting his/her affairs in order, suddenly visiting or writing letters to loved ones, buying instruments of suicide, experiencing a sudden change in mood, or writing a suicide note. Many people who complete suicide do not tell any health professional of their intent in the months before they do so. If they communicate a plan to anyone, it is more likely to be a friend or family member. The assessment of suicide risk often involves an evaluation of the presence, severity, and duration of suicidal thoughts as part of a mental health evaluation. Treatment of suicidal thinking or a suicide attempt involves adapting immediate treatment to the sufferer's individual needs. Those with a strong social support system, who have a history of being hopeful, and have a desire to resolve conflicts may need only a brief crisis-oriented intervention. Those with more severe symptoms or less social support may need hospitalization and long-term outpatient mental health services. Treatment of any underlying emotional problem using a combination of psychotherapy, safety planning, medication, lifestyle improvement, and increasing social support remains the mainstay of suicide prevention. People who are contemplating suicide are encouraged to talk to a doctor or other health professional, spiritual advisor, or immediately go to the closest emergency room or mental health crisis center for help. Those who have experienced suicidal thinking (ideation) are commonly directed to keep a list of people to call in the event that those thoughts return. In addition to mental health treatment, other strategies include having someone else hold all medications to prevent overdose, removing any weapons from the home, scheduling frequent stress-relieving activities, getting together with others, writing down feelings, and avoiding the use of alcohol or other drugs. Techniques for coping with the suicide of a loved one include nutritious eating, getting extra rest, writing about their emotions, talking to others about the experience, thinking of ways to handle painful memories, understanding their state of mind will vary, resisting pressure to grieve by anyone else's time table, and survivors doing what is right for them. To help children and adolescents cope with the suicide of a loved one, it is important to ensure they receive consistent caretaking, frequent interaction with supportive peers and adults, and an understanding of their feelings as they relate to their age."
What is suicide?,"""Suicide is the act of purposely ending one's own life. How societies view suicide varies widely according to culture and religion. For example, many Western cultures, as well as mainstream Judaism, Islam, and Christianity tend to view killing oneself as quite negative. One myth about suicide that may be the result of this view is considering suicide (suicidal ideation) to always be the result of a ""'mental illness''. Some societies also treat a suicide attempt as if it were a crime. However, suicides are sometimes seen as understandable or even honorable in certain circumstances, as in protest to persecution (for example, a hunger strike), as part of battle or resistance (for example, suicide pilots of World War II, suicide bombers), or as a way of preserving the honor of a dishonored person (for example, killing oneself to preserve the honor or safety of family members).''More than 800,000 people worldwide committed suicide in 2012, with many more suicide attempts annually. That translates into someone dying by suicide every 40 seconds somewhere in the world. As of 2016, nearly 45,000 people reportedly killed themselves in the United States, making it the 10th leading cause of death, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The true number of suicides is likely higher because some deaths that were thought to be an accident, like a single-car accident, overdose, or shooting, are not recognized as being a suicide. The higher frequency of completed suicides in males versus females is consistent across the life span, but the ratio of men to women who complete suicide decreases from 3:1 in wealthier countries to closer to 1.5:1 in less wealthy countries. In the United States, boys 10-14 years of age commit suicide twice as often as their female peers. Teenage boys 15-19 years of age complete suicide five times as often as girls their age, and men 20-24 years of age commit suicide 10 times as often as women their age. Gay, lesbian, transgender, and other sexual minority youth are more at risk for thinking about and attempting suicide than heterosexual teens.''There are trends regarding the means of committing suicide, as well. For example, the frequency of hanging, carbon monoxide poisoning, or other forms of self-suffocation increased from 1992 to 2006, while committing suicide by a gun has decreased during that period of time and has remained unchanged from 2012-2013. As of 2016, killing oneself with a gun remains the most frequent method, followed by suffocation/asphyxiation, then poisoning. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people 15-29 years of age. Teen suicide statistics for youths 15-19 years of age indicate that from 1950-1990, the frequency of suicides increased by 300%, and from 1990-2003, that rate decreased by 35%. However, the rate of suicide increased by about 1% per year from 2006 through 2014 in individuals from 10-24 years old, doubling between the years of 2007 and 2015. The suicide rate has increased by about 2% per year from 2006 through 2014 in the 25-64 years old age groups.''While the rate of murder-suicide remains low, the devastation it creates makes it a concerning public health issue.''The rates of suicide can vary with the time of year, as well as with the time of day. For example, the number of suicides by train tends to peak soon after sunset and about 10 hours earlier each day. Although professionals like police officers, manual laborers who work in isolation, physicians, nurses, and dentists are thought to be more vulnerable to suicide than others, these findings seem to vary.'""As opposed to suicidal behavior, self-mutilation is defined as deliberately hurting oneself without meaning to cause one's own death. Examples of self-mutilating behaviors include cutting any part of the body, usually of the wrists. Many people also cut themselves in places that are less visible, like on their thighs or abdomen. Self-tattooing is also considered self-mutilation. Other self-injurious behaviors include self-burning, head banging, pinching, and scratching.""'Physician-assisted suicide is defined as ending the life of a person who is terminally ill in a way that is either painless or minimally painful for the purpose of ending suffering of the individual. It is also called ''euthanasia'' and mercy killing. In 1997, the United States Supreme Court ruled against endorsing physician-assisted suicide as a constitutional right but allowed for individual states to enact laws that permit it to be done. As of April 2018, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Montana (by state supreme court ruling), Oregon, Washington, and Vermont were the only states with laws in effect that authorized physician-assisted suicide, but a number of other states are in the process of considering or passing it. Physician-assisted suicide seems to be less offensive to people compared to assisted suicide that is done by a nonphysician, although the acceptability of both means to end life tends to increase as people age and with the severity of medical illness and the number of times the person who desires their own death repeatedly asks for such assistance.' "
What are the effects of suicide?,"'The effects of suicidal behavior or completed suicide on friends and family members are often devastating. Individuals who lose a loved one to suicide (suicide survivors) are more at risk for becoming preoccupied with the reason for the suicide while wanting to deny or hide the cause of death, wondering if they could have prevented it, feeling blamed for the problems that preceded the suicide, feeling rejected by their loved one, and stigmatized by others. Survivors may experience a great range of conflicting emotions about the deceased, feeling everything from intense emotional ''pain'' and sadness about the loss, helpless to prevent it, longing for the person they lost, questioning of their own religious beliefs, and anger at the deceased for taking their own life to relief if the suicide took place after years of physical or mental illness in their loved one. This is quite understandable given that the person they are grieving is at the same time the victim and the perpetrator of the fatal act.''Individuals left behind by the suicide of a loved one tend to experience complicated ''grief'' in reaction to that loss. Symptoms of ''grief'' that may be experienced by suicide survivors include intense emotions, like ''depression'' and guilt, as well as longings for the deceased, severely intrusive thoughts about the lost loved one, extreme feelings of isolation and emptiness, avoiding doing things that bring back memories of the departed, new or worsened appetite or ''sleep problems'', and having no interest in activities that the sufferer used to enjoy.' "
What are some possible causes of suicide?,"'Although the reasons why people commit suicide are multifaceted and complex, life circumstances that may immediately precede someone committing suicide include recent discharge from a psychiatric hospital or a sudden change in how the person appears to feel (for example, much worse or much better). Examples of possible triggers (precipitants) for suicide are real or imagined losses, like the breakup of a romantic relationship, moving, death (especially if by suicide) of a loved one, or loss of freedom or other privileges.''Firearms are by far the most common methods by which people take their life, accounting for half of suicide deaths per year. Older people are more at risk for killing themselves using a gun compared to younger people. Another suicide method used by some individuals is by threatening police officers, sometimes even with an unloaded gun or a fake weapon. That phenomenon is commonly referred to as ""suicide by cop."" Although firearms are the most common way people complete suicide, trying to overdose on pills is the most common way that people attempt to kill themselves.'  "
What are the risk factors and protective factors for suicide?,"'Ethnically, the highest rates of completed suicides in the United States occur in non-Hispanic whites and in Native Americans. The lowest rates are in non-Hispanic blacks, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. Adults that identify as being of more than one race apparently attempt suicide most often. Former Eastern Bloc countries currently have the highest suicide rates worldwide, while South America has the lowest. Geographical patterns of suicides are such that individuals who live in a rural area versus urban area and the western United States versus the eastern United States are at higher risk for killing themselves. The majority of suicide completions take place during the spring.'""In most countries, women continue to attempt suicide more often, but men tend to complete suicide more often. Although the frequency of suicides for young adults has been increasing in recent years, elderly Caucasian males continue to have the highest rate of suicide completion. Other risk factors for taking one's life include poor access to mental health care, single marital status, unemployment, low income, mental illness, a history of being physically or sexually abused, a personal history of suicidal thoughts, threats or behaviors, or a family history of attempting suicide. A lack of access to mental health care has also been identified as increasing the likelihood of suicide. The means of attempting suicide can have particular risk factors as well. For example, individuals who attempt suicide by jumping from a height like a ""'bridge'' may be more likely to be single, unemployed, and psychotic, while those who use firearms may more often have a history of legal issues, ''alcoholism'', and certain personality disorders.''Data regarding mental illnesses as risk factors indicate that ''depression'', ''manic'' ''depression'', ''schizophrenia'', ''substance abuse'', ''eating disorders'', and severe ''anxiety'' increase the probability of suicide attempts and completions. Nine out of 10 people who commit suicide have a diagnosable mental health problem and up to three out of four individuals who take their own life had a physical illness when they committed suicide. Behaviors that tend to be linked with suicide attempts and completions include ''impulsivity'"", violence against others, and self-mutilation, like cutting one's wrists or other body parts, or burning oneself.""'Risk factors for adults who commit murder-suicide include male gender, older ''caregiver'', access to firearms, separation or divorce, ''depression'', and ''drug abuse'' or ''addiction''. In children and adolescents, bullying and being bullied seem to be associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors. Specifically regarding male teens who ultimately commit murder-suicide by school shootings, being bullied may play a significant role in putting them at risk for this outcome. Another risk factor that renders children and teens more at risk for suicide compared to adults is having someone they know commit suicide, which often is called contagion or cluster formation.''Generally, the absence of mental illness and substance abuse, as well as the presence of a strong social support system, decrease the likelihood that a person will kill him- or herself. Having children who are younger than 18 years of age also tends to be a protective factor against mothers committing suicide.' "
What are the signs and symptoms for suicidal behavior?,"'Warning signs that an individual is imminently planning to kill themselves may include the person making a will, otherwise getting his or her affairs in order, suddenly visiting friends or family members (one last time), buying instruments of suicide like a gun, hose, rope, pills, or other forms of medications, a sudden and significant decline or improvement in mood, or writing a suicide note. Contrary to popular belief, many people who complete suicide do not tell their therapist or any other mental health professional they plan to kill themselves in the months before they do so. If they communicate their plan to anyone, it is more likely to be someone with whom they are personally close, like a friend or family member.''Individuals who take their lives tend to suffer from severe ''anxiety'' or depression, symptoms of which may include moderate ''alcohol abuse'', ''insomnia'', severe ''agitation'', loss of interest in activities they used to enjoy (anhedonia), hopelessness, and persistent thoughts about the possibility of something bad happening. Since suicidal behaviors are often quite impulsive, removing guns, medications, knives, and other instruments people often use to kill themselves from the immediate environment can allow the individual time to think more clearly and perhaps choose a more rational way of coping with their ''pain'"". It can also allow the person's caregivers or loved ones time to intervene.""  "
How do health care professionals assess suicidal thoughts and behaviors?,"""The risk assessment for suicidal thoughts and behaviors performed by mental health professionals often involves an evaluation of the presence, frequency, severity, and duration of suicidal feelings in the individuals they treat as part of a comprehensive evaluation of the person's mental health. Therefore, in addition to asking questions about family mental health history and about the symptoms of a variety of emotional problems (for example, ""'anxiety'', depression, ''mood swings'"", bizarre thoughts, substance abuse, eating disorders, and any history of being traumatized), practitioners frequently ask the people they evaluate about any past or present suicidal thoughts (ideations), dreams, intent, and plans. If the individual has ever attempted suicide, information about the circumstances surrounding the attempt, as well as the level of dangerousness of the method and the outcome of the attempt, may be explored. Any other history of violent behavior might be evaluated. The person's current circumstances, like recent stressors (for example, end of a relationship, losing a job, family problems), sources of support, and accessibility of weapons are often probed. What treatment the person may be receiving and how he or she has responded to treatment recently and in the past, are other issues mental health professionals tend to explore during an evaluation.""'Sometimes professionals assess suicide risk by using an assessment scale. One such scale is called the SAD PERSONS Scale, which identifies risk factors for suicide as follows:' Sex (male) Age younger than 19 or older than 45 years of age Depression (severe enough to be considered clinically significant) Previous suicide attempt or received mental health services of any kind Excessive alcohol or other drug use Rational thinking lost Separated, divorced, or widowed (or other ending of significant relationship) Organized suicide plan or serious attempt No or little social support Sickness or chronic medical illness"
What is the treatment for suicidal thoughts and behaviors? What types of specialists treat people who are suicidal?,"""Those who treat people who attempt suicide tend to adapt immediate treatment to the person's individual needs. Those who have a responsive and intact family, good friendships, generally good social supports, and who have a history of being hopeful and have a desire to resolve conflicts may need only a brief crisis-oriented intervention. However, those who have made previous suicide attempts, have shown a high degree of intent to kill themselves, seem to be suffering from either severe depression or other mental illness, are abusing alcohol or other drugs, have trouble controlling their impulses, or have families who are unable or unwilling to commit to counseling are at higher risk and may need psychiatric hospitalization to prevent a repeat attempt in the days following the most recent attempt by providing close monitoring (for example, suicide watch) and long-term outpatient mental health services to achieve recovery from their suicidal thoughts or actions.""'Talk therapy (psychotherapy) that focuses on helping the person understand how their thoughts and behaviors affect each other (''cognitive behavioral therapy'') has been found to be an effective treatment for many people who struggle with thoughts of harming themselves. School intervention programs in which teens are given support and educated about the risk factors, symptoms, and ways to manage suicidal thoughts in themselves and how to engage adults when they or a peer expresses suicidal thinking have been found to decrease the number of times adolescents report attempting suicide.''Although concerns have been raised about the possibility that ''antidepressant'' medications increase the frequency of suicide attempts, mental health professionals try to put those concerns in the context of the need to treat the severe emotional problems that are usually associated with attempting suicide and the fact that the number of suicides that are completed by mentally ill individuals seems to decrease with treatment. While many youths who are treated with medication for depression may also respond to a ''sugar'' pill (placebo), this age group of individuals get better when they take an antidepressant medication, particularly when medication is combined with psychotherapy. In fact, concern has been expressed that the reduction of antidepressant prescribing since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required that warning labels be placed on these medications may be related to the 18.2% increase in U.S. youth suicides from 2003-2004 after a decade of steady decrease. While the use of specific ''antidepressants'' has been associated with lower suicide rates in adolescents over the long term, uncommon short-term side effects of serotonergic antidepressants (for example, ''fluoxetine'' [''Prozac''], ''sertraline'' [''Zoloft''], ''paroxetine'' [''Paxil''], ''escitalopram'' [''Lexapro''], or ''vortioxetine'"" [Trintellix]) may include an increase in suicide. Therefore, most practitioners consider antidepressant medication an important part of treating depression while closely monitoring their patients' progress to prevent suicide.""'Mood-stabilizing medications like ''lithium'' ''(''Lithobid'') -- as'' well as medications that address bizarre thinking and/or severe ''anxiety'', like ''clozapine'' (''Clozaril''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), and ''aripiprazole'' ''(''Abilify'') -- have'' also been found to decrease the likelihood of individuals killing themselves.'  "
How can people cope with suicidal thoughts?,"'In the effort to cope with suicidal thoughts, silence is the enemy. Suggestions for helping people survive suicidal thinking include engaging the help of a doctor or other health professional, a spiritual advisor, or by immediately calling a suicide hotline or going to the closest emergency room or mental health crisis center. In order to prevent acting on thoughts of suicide, it is often suggested that individuals who have experienced suicidal thinking keep a written or mental list of people to call in the event that suicidal thoughts come back. Other strategies include having someone hold all medications to prevent overdose, removing knives, guns, and other weapons from the home, scheduling ''stress''-relieving activities every day, getting together with others to prevent isolation, writing down feelings, including positive ones, and avoiding the use of alcohol or other drugs.' "
How can people cope with the suicide of a loved one?,"'Grief that is associated with the death of a loved one from suicide presents intense and unique challenges. In addition to the already significant pain endured by anyone who loses a loved one, suicide survivors may feel guilty about having not been able to prevent their loved one from killing themselves and the myriad conflicting emotions already discussed. Friends and family may be more likely to experience regret about whatever problems they had in their relationship with the deceased, and they may even feel guilty about living while their loved one is not. Therefore, individuals who lose a loved one from suicide are more at risk for becoming preoccupied with the reason for the suicide while perhaps wanting to deny or hide the cause of death, wondering if they could have prevented it, feeling blamed for the problems that preceded the suicide, feeling rejected by their loved one and stigmatized by others.'""Some self-help techniques for coping with the stress associated with the suicide of a loved one include avoiding isolation by staying involved with others, sharing the experience by joining a support group or keeping a journal, thinking of ways to handle it when other life experiences trigger painful memories about the loss, understanding that getting better involves feeling better some days and worse on other days, resisting pressure to get over the loss, and the suicide survivor's doing what is right for them in their efforts to recover. Many people, particularly parents of children who commit suicide, take some comfort in being able to use this terrible experience as a way to establish a memorial to their loved one. That can take the form of everything from writing a poem, planting a tree, or painting a mural in honor of the departed to establishing a scholarship fund in their loved one's name to teaching others about how to survive a child's suicide. Generally, coping tips for grieving a death through suicide are nearly as different and numerous as there are bereaved individuals. The bereaved person's caring for him- or herself through continuing nutritious and regular eating habits and getting extra, although not excessive, rest can help strengthen their ability to endure this very difficult event.""'Quite valuable tips for journaling as an effective way of managing ''bereavement'"" rather than just stirring up painful feelings are provided by the Center for Journal Therapy. While encouraging those who choose to write a journal to apply no strict rules to the process as part of suicide recovery, some of the ideas encouraged include limiting the time journaling to 15 minutes per day or less to decrease the likelihood of worsening grief, writing how one imagines his or her life will be a year from the date of the suicide, and clearly identifying feelings to allow for easier tracking of the individual's grief process.""""To help children and adolescents cope emotionally with the suicide of a friend or family member, it is important to ensure they receive consistent caretaking and frequent interaction with supportive adults. All children and teens can benefit from being reassured they did not cause their loved one to kill themselves, going a long way toward lessening the developmentally appropriate tendency children and adolescents have for blaming themselves and any angry feelings they may have harbored against their lost loved one for the suicide. For school-aged and older children, appropriate participation in school, social, and extracurricular activities is necessary to a successful resolution of grief. For adolescents, maintaining positive relationships with peers becomes important in helping teens figure out how to deal with a loved one's suicide. Depending on the adolescent, they even may find interactions with peers and family more helpful than formal sources of support like their school counselor."" "
Is it possible to prevent a suicide attempt?,"'For the population at large, suicide-prevention strategies include increasing access to health care, promoting mental health, avoidance of drug use, and restricting access to means to complete suicide. Responsible media reporting to raise mental health and suicide awareness, as well as how to report suicides and other violence that occurs are other suicide-prevention strategies that are often used in general populations.''Suicide-prevention measures for individuals who have a mental health history following a psychiatric hospitalization usually involve mental health professionals trying to implement a comprehensive outpatient treatment plan prior to the individual being discharged. This is all the more important since many people fail to comply with outpatient therapy after leaving the hospital. It is often recommended that all firearms and other weapons be removed from the home, because the individual may still find access to guns and other dangerous objects stored in their home, even if locked. It is further often recommended that sharp objects and potentially lethal medications be locked up as a result of the attempt.''Vigorous treatment of the underlying psychiatric disorder is important in decreasing short-term and long-term risk. Contracting with the person against suicide has not been shown to be especially effective in preventing suicidal behavior, but the technique may still be helpful in assessing risk, since hesitation or refusal to agree to refrain from harming oneself or to fail to agree to tell a specified person may indicate an intent to harm oneself. Contracting might also help the individual identify sources of support he or she can call upon in the event that suicidal thoughts recur.' "
What is the prognosis for someone who has made a suicide attempt or threat?,"'While most people who attempt suicide do not ultimately die by suicide, those who have tried to kill themselves are at much higher risk of completing suicide compared to those who have never attempted to do so. People who attempt suicide have been found to be at risk for developing symptoms of ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), with the suicide attempt being the traumatic event. This has been found to be more likely the more serious the suicide attempt and the more steps the person took in an effort to avoid detection before their demise. Given the potentially fatal prognosis of attempting suicide, the need for treatment is all the more important.' "

"
What is sun protection?,"'Sun protection is simply guarding a body from the adverse effects of sunlight. Aside from the hazards of heat, the sun poses the danger of ''sunburn'', which can permanently damage the skin and cause ''skin cancer'', ''precancerous'' changes in the skin, as well as premature wrinkling and signs of ''aging''. Exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun is a known risk factor for the development of both ''melanoma'' and nonmelanoma ''skin cancers''. A survey conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) and published in 2015 showed that despite public health warnings, only around one-third of Americans use sunscreen on a regular basis. Women were more likely than men to use sunscreen on the face, and sunscreen use was also more common in higher socioeconomic groups.' "
What are the best ways to prevent a sunburn?,"'The best ways to avoid ''sunburn'' are to do the following:'  Limit time in the sun, especially between the peak sunlight hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Wear protective clothing, includinga broad-brimmed hat,a shirt with sleeves that cover the arms, anda long skirt or pants with long legs. a broad-brimmed hat, a shirt with sleeves that cover the arms, and a long skirt or pants with long legs. Use a protective sunscreen to minimize the penetration of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. Use a water-resistant sunscreen if swimming or perspiring heavily."
What is sunscreen?,"'Sunscreen is any substance or material that protects the skin from UV ''radiation''. Sunscreens are available in the forms of topical lotion, cream, ointment, gel, or spray that can be applied to the skin; a salve or stick that can be applied to the lips, nose, and eyelids; a moistener in towelettes that can be rubbed against the skin; ''sunglasses'' that protect the eyes; certain types of sun-protection clothing; and film screen that can be affixed to the windows of a car, room, or office. Many facial moisturizers and ''cosmetics'' products also offer some degree of sun protection.' "
What is meant by SPF?,"'SPF, an abbreviation for sun-protection factor, is a number such as 15, 30, or 50 that indicates the degree of sunburn protection provided by sunscreens. SPF is related to the total amount of sun exposure rather than simply the length of sun exposure. It is a common mistake to assume that the duration of effectiveness of a sunscreen can be calculated simply by multiplying the SPF by the length of time it takes for him or her to suffer a ''burn'' without sunscreen, because the amount of sun exposure a person receives is dependent upon more than just the length of time spent in the sun. The amount of sun exposure depends upon a number of factors, including the length of exposure, time of day, geographic location, season, and weather conditions.''A common mistake is applying too little sunscreen, which can drastically reduce the effective SPF of the product. About 1 ounce (5-6 teaspoons) of sunscreen is recommended to cover the entire body. Further, sunscreen must be reapplied every two hours when staying outdoors for a prolonged period of time. Sunscreen should also be applied at least 30 minutes before going outdoors.''People with sensitive skin who ''burn'' quickly and must spend a lot of time outdoors should always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more. The U.S. FDA has also recommended that the maximum SPF value on sunscreen labels be ""50+"" because many scientists believe that there is insufficient evidence to show that products with SPF values higher than 50 provide greater protection for users than products with SPF values of 50.'""A major limitation of the SPF value is that these numbers are determined from a test that measures protection against sunburn caused by ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Therefore, SPF values only indicate a sunscreen's UVB protection and do not provide any information on the product's effectiveness in blocking the ultraviolet A (UVA) rays that contribute to the development of skin ""'cancers''. Rulings issued in 2011 require more accurate labeling of sunscreen products than was required in the past.' "
Are all sunscreens equally effective against UV radiation?,"""No. Some sunscreens protect against only one type of ultraviolet radiation: ultraviolet-B (UVB). Others protect against both types of ultraviolet radiation that reach earth's atmosphere from the sun: ultraviolet-B and ultraviolet-A (UVA). UVB rays account for only 5% of the UV rays reaching the surface of the earth. UVB rays cause sunburn and contribute to ""'aging'' of skin, skin cancers, and ''hyperpigmentation''. The majority (about 95%) of UV rays that reach earth are UVA rays. While these are less potent than UVB rays, they are also thought to promote skin cancers and skin aging.''Sunscreens that protect against both UVA and UVB, and are thus classified as ""broad spectrum,"" are recommended for everyone. There are new regulations in labeling of sunscreen products that allow consumers to better understand the degree of protection offered by a given product.'  "
"How do sunscreens work, and which sunscreen ingredients protect against both types of UV radiation?","'Physical sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide protect against UVB and UVA. However, zinc oxide blocks more UV radiation than titanium dioxide and, therefore, is the preferred ingredient. Some chemical sunscreens can also block UVA rays. Octocrylene is a chemical known as a cinnamate that has both UVA- and UVB-absorbing properties, and the benzophenones (such as avobenzone) can also absorb both UVA and UVB rays. In July 2006, the U.S. FDA approved an ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) sunscreen preparation known as Anthelios SX that contains the UVA filter ecamsule. Ecamsule is a potent UVA-blocking compound that has been sold in sunscreen products in Canada and Europe since 1993. Because in the U.S., sunscreens are regulated by the FDA as are ''drugs'', it is typically more difficult to gain approval for newer sunscreen products than in countries where sunscreens are legally cosmetics products.'

How should skin sunscreens be applied?,"""It's a good general rule to apply a sunscreen very liberally. Those who skimp won't receive full protection. Most people do not use enough sunscreen and do not apply frequently enough. The sunscreen should be applied about a half hour before going outside to allow time for the sunscreen to soak in and take effect. If you're not sure, it's better to over-apply than to apply too little. There is no damage or danger associated with using too much sunscreen.""'Many women use foundation ''makeup'' that contains sunscreen. However, this should be used as an extra layer of protection rather than the only source of sunscreen, because the amount of makeup that is needed usually is far below the amount that would be needed for effective sun protection.'""Applying sunscreen only on sunny days or when it is hot is a common mistake. While the sun may be stronger in summer, UV rays can penetrate clouds and fog and can cause damage even when the sun isn't bright."" "
"Do water or perspiration wash off sunscreen? 
How long does sunscreen last?","'Yes, water and ''perspiration'' can wash off sunscreen. Sunscreens must be reapplied frequently. Therefore, sunscreen should be reapplied at least every two hours when staying outdoors for a prolonged period and after swimming, bathing, perspiring heavily, or drying off with a towel or handkerchief. Water- and perspiration-resistant sunscreens are available. However, even their protection will not last indefinitely, and they should be reapplied frequently, as well.' "
Can sunscreens cause a skin reaction?,"'PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) was one of the original UVB-blocking products in sunscreens. Some people developed a skin reaction to this chemical, and it was also found to stain clothing. Over the years, PABA has been refined and modified into newer ingredients known as glycerol PABA, padimate A, and padimate O, all of which are UVB-blocking sunscreen ingredients. Other ingredients in sunscreens may also increase the risk of a skin reaction in certain people. Anyone can determine the suitability of a particular sunscreen without risk of serious harm by' clothing his or her body fully except for a small patch of skin; and then applying the sunscreen to the skin patch and exposing it to sunlight. If a reaction occurs, the user should not use that product. He or she should try another product."
Should everyone use sunscreen protection?,"'As a general rule, ''babies'' 6 months of age or younger should not have sunscreen applied to their skin because their bodies may not be capable of tolerating the chemicals in sunscreens. Instead, they should be kept away from sun exposure.''Everyone over 6 months of age should use a sunscreen regularly unless they and their doctors decide it would be better to protect the skin in other ways. Even with sunscreen use, wearing protective clothing and ''eyewear'' to shield UV rays are recommended. Sunscreen alone should not be regarded as complete protection from all UV radiation.' "
Can the labels on sunscreen products be trusted in the U.S.?,"'In the past, manufacturers\' claims on sunscreen packaging were largely unregulated. However, in 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued labeling regulations for over-the-counter sunscreens. According to these FDA guidelines, sunscreen labels were prohibited from making claims that are considered unproven or absolute such as ""waterproof"" and ""all-day protection."" Earlier regulations for sunscreens concerned protection against sunburn, which is primarily caused by ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from the sun, and did not address ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, which is a cause of skin cancers and early skin aging.''According to the FDA ruling, all products that claim to provide broad-spectrum sun protection must comply with the following rules:''The Environmental Working Group, in a 2015 study of over 1,700 sun-protection products, released a report stating that 80% of these products offer inferior sun protection or contain ""worrisome"" ingredients. They also note that most SPFs max out at about SPF 50 despite the fact that many sunscreens on the market claim to have much higher SPF ratings.' If a sunscreen is labeled as ""broad spectrum,"" it must pass a test that measures the product's ultraviolet A (UVA) protection relative to its ultraviolet B (UVB) protection. The label must indicate the degree of SPF or overall protection. Broad-spectrum SPF products with SPF values higher than 15 provide greater protection and may claim additional uses, as described below. Manufacturers of broad-spectrum sunscreens with SPF of 15 or higher may claim that these products reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging if used as directed with other sun-protection measures. Non-broad-spectrum sunscreens (those that do not pass the broad spectrum test described above) and broad-spectrum sunscreens with an SPF value between 2 and 14 can only claim to help prevent sunburn. Manufacturers cannot label sunscreens as ""waterproof"" or ""sweatproof"" or identify their products as ""sunblocks"" because these claims are exaggerations. No sunscreen can completely block the sun's rays. According to the FDA ruling, ""Sunscreens also cannot claim to provide sun protection for more than two hours without reapplication or to provide protection immediately after application (for example, instant protection) without submitting data to support these claims and obtaining FDA approval."" Manufacturers of sunscreens that claim to be water resistant must indicate on the product label whether the sunscreen remains effective for 40 minutes (""water resistant"") or 80 minutes (labeled ""very water resistant"") while swimming or sweating, based on standard testing. Products that are not water resistant must contain instructions on the label telling consumers to use a water-resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating."
What's the difference between sunscreen and sunblock?,"'As described above, there is no such thing as a true ""sunblock."" This is a marketing term formerly used to label sunscreens with high SPF. Manufacturers can no longer identify their products as sunblocks because these claims are inaccurate exaggerations. No sunscreen can completely block the sun\'s rays.' "
Do all tanning products contain sunscreens?,"""No, some don't. Tanning products such as self-tanners that don't contain sunscreen are required by the FDA to carry a warning label alerting consumers to the dangers of unprotected sunbathing."" "
"What kind of sunglasses 
offer protection against UV rays?","'Only those that provide 100% protection against UVA and UVB radiation, as stated on the label at the time of purchase, should be worn for protection.' "
Is sunscreen protection necessary in the winter?,"""Yes, UV radiation, though not as intense in the winter, still poses a threat, especially when rays reflect off snow. Skiers should also note that the degree of exposure to the sun's radiation increases 4% for every 1,000-foot increase in altitude. There is no safe time of year when it comes to UV radiation. The same applies to weather conditions. Even on a cloudy day, 80% of the sun's ultraviolet rays pass through the clouds and reach the earth."" "
Are a good sunscreen and sunglasses enough?,"'No, they are only one part of a complete sun-protection program. An effective program also includes limiting sun exposure and wearing protective clothing.' "
Do sunscreens expire?,"""Yes, sunscreens can lose effectiveness over time. Many sunscreen products are labeled with an expiration date to signal the limit of the product's effectiveness and stability. Sunscreens are typically designed to be stable for three years. Storing a sunscreen in the heat, however, can cause the active ingredients to lose effectiveness faster than storing it in a cool place. Discard any sunscreen that is past the stamped expiration date, and if you purchase a sunscreen without such a date, write the month and year of purchase on the bottle."" "
What is photosensitivity (sun sensitivity)?,"'Photosensitivity (or sun sensitivity) is inflammation of the skin induced by the combination of sunlight and certain medications or substances. This causes redness of the skin and may look similar to sunburn. Both the photosensitizing medication or chemical and light source have to be present in order for a photosensitivity reaction to occur.''Generally, these reactions can be divided into two mechanisms:''Phototoxic drugs are much more common than photoallergic drugs.' Phototoxic reactions, Photoallergic reactions. "
What is the difference between a photoallergic and a phototoxic reaction?,"""In phototoxic reactions, the drug may become activated by exposure to sunlight and cause damage to the skin. The skin's appearance resembles sunburn, and the process is generally acute (has a fast onset). Ultraviolet A (UVA) ""'radiation'' is most commonly associated with phototoxicity, but ultraviolet B (UVB) and visible light may also contribute to this reaction.''Rash from a phototoxic reaction is mainly confined to the sun-exposed area of the skin. A phototoxic reaction typically clears up once the drug is discontinued and has been cleared from the body, even after re-exposure to light.'""In photoallergic reactions, the ultraviolet exposure changes the structure of the drug so that is seen by the body's immune system as an invader (antigen). The immune system initiates an allergic response and cause inflammation of the skin in the sun-exposed areas. These usually resemble ""'eczema'' and are generally chronic (long-lasting). Many drugs in this family are topical drugs.''This type of photosensitivity may recur after sun exposure even after the drug has cleared from the system and can sometimes spread to areas of the skin unexposed to the sun.' "

What are the signs and symptoms of sun sensitivity (photosensitivity)?,"'Symptoms of phototoxic reaction''Individuals with phototoxic reactions may initially complain of a burning and stinging sensation. Redness typically occurs within 24 hours of the exposure to sun in the exposed areas of the body such as the forehead, nose, hands, arms, and lips. In severe cases, sun protected areas of skin may be also be involved.''The range of skin damage may vary from mild redness to swelling to ''blister'' formation in more severe cases. The rash from this photosensitivity reaction usually resolves with peeling and sloughing of (shedding) skin in the affected area within several days.''Individuals with photoallergic reactions may initially complain of ''itching''. This is then followed by redness and possibly swelling and eruption in the involved area. Because this is considered type of an allergic reaction, there may be no symptoms for many days when the drug is taken for the first time. Subsequent exposure to the drug and the sun may cause a more rapid response in 1-2 days.''Hyperpigmentation'' (darkening) of the affected area of the skin may develop after the resolution of a phototoxicity reaction, but it is rare in a ''photoallergic reaction''. In phototoxic reactions, high doses of the drug and long exposures to light may be required to cause the reaction.''Yes. Ultraviolet (UV) light is radiation energy in the form of invisible light waves. UV light is emitted by the sun and by tanning lamps.

What diseases or other health problems cause photosensitivity?,"'Some medical conditions are known to cause sensitivity to sun exposure.''Systemic lupus erythematosus'' (''SLE'') often causes a rash on the face which can be very sensitive to sunlight. This rash is typically seen on the nose and cheeks, called a malar rash, and is considered one of the hallmarks of ''lupus''.''Porphyria'' is another medical condition that may cause photosensitivity reactions. This is a hereditary condition with skin manifestation (cutaneous ''porphyria'') causing ''rashes'' and blisters in reaction to exposure to sunlight.''Vitiligo'' is a relatively common disorder that causes patches of white de-pigmented skin. These patches lack ''melanin'' and are extremely sensitive to UV rays.''Xeroderma pigmentosum is a disorder that appears to result from an ''inherited'' hypersensitivity to the ''cancer''-causing (carcinogenic) effects of ultraviolet light. Sunlight causes DNA damage that is normally repaired. Individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum have defective inability to repair the DNA after UV damage. Affected individuals are hundreds of times more vulnerable to developing ''skin cancer'' than other people. Their extreme skin photosensitivity predisposes them to pronounced skin damage and scarring and also to the early onset of ''skin cancer'' (basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas and ''malignant melanoma'').''Individuals with classic oculocutaneous ''albinism'' lack melanin in their skin and eyes - the term oculocutaneous"" comes from ""oculo"" for eyes, and ""cutaneous"" for skin. Without the protection of this pigment, their white skin and pink eyes are both highly sensitive to UV and susceptible to the rays\' damage.' "
How is sun sensitivity (photosensitivity) diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of sun sensitivity is mainly made by a thorough history, examination, and review of medications and duration of exposure to sun. It is important to ask when the medication was started and for how long the symptoms persisted.''There are no diagnostic tests available, although a photo-patch test may be performed. This test is typically performed by a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in diseases of the skin) by shining light onto different areas of the skin to see how long it will take for the light to cause redness. This test may be useful in evaluating photosensitivity to topical medications causing a photoallergic response. In cases of phototoxicity reactions, this test is generally not useful.' "
What is the treatment for a photosensitizing drug reaction?,"'Recognizing and discontinuing the photosensitizing drug is the most important step in treatment. In general, the usual sunburn ''prevention'' methods such as the use of sunscreens and avoidance of prolonged exposure to sun are important steps to take. Keeping the area of skin eruption moist and applying wet dressings may help relieve the symptoms. The reaction may last up to a few weeks.''Topical steroid creams may be helpful in treating the redness, and antihistamines are generally helpful in minimizing the itching.

What is a sunburn? Which radiation waves from the sun cause skin damage?,"'Sunburn is an inflammation of the skin caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun and tanning beds. A similar type of skin ''burn'' can follow overexposure to a tanning bed. UV radiation can also damage the eyes, although no surface ''burn'' is apparent.''Sunburn is very common. According to the CDC, in the United States, approximately 50% of adults age 18 to 29 report having at least one sunburn in the preceding year.''UV light is radiation energy in the form of invisible light waves. The sun and tanning beds give off UV light.''The sun discharges three types of ultraviolet radiation, 1) ultraviolet A (UVA), 2) ultraviolet B (UVB), and 3) ultraviolet C (UVC). Only UVA and UVB rays reach earth, and both types are dangerous' UVB rays usually affects the outer layer of the skin, and are more likely to damage the skin and cause skin cancer (melanoma, basal and squamous cell carcinoma). UVA rays are much less intense than UVB rays, but are about 50 times more likely to reach the deeper layers the skin and cause damage than do UVB rays. Tanning beds also produce UVA and/or UVB. These artificial rays affect the skin in the same way as do UVA and UVB from the sun. UV rays are most intense at noon and the hours immediately before and after (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), particularly in the late spring, summer, and early autumn. Although they are less concentrated at other times of the day and year, UV rays can still damage the skin and eyes - even in the dead of winter and on cloudy or rainy days. UV rays also increase in intensity in relation to altitude and latitude. The higher the altitude, the greater the concentration of UV rays. Likewise, UV rays are more powerful nearer to the equator. UV rays ""bounce"" off reflective surfaces - including water, sand, and snow. Thus, a skier, swimmer, angler, or beachcomber may be bombarded with UV rays from above and below."
"Pictures of sunburns, blisters, and peeling skin",'Following are pictures of various degrees of sunburn.' 
Can sunburns cause skin cancer or other skin problems?,"'Yes. Sunburn early in life increases the risk of developing ''skin cancer'' later. Overexposure to UV rays can cause three varieties of ''skin cancer'':''Basal and squamous cell carcinomas are very common, and if diagnosed properly and promptly, are curable. It is very important to have routine skin checks by a skin doctor (dermatologist) annually. Annual screening can help in early diagnosis of skin ''cancer'' or pre-cancerous conditions that may lead to skin ''cancer''.''Repeated overexposure to ultraviolet rays can also ''scar'', ''freckle'', dry out, and wrinkle the skin prematurely; moreover, frequent overexposure to ultraviolet rays can increase the risk of developing eye ''cataracts'' and ''macular degeneration'', a leading cause of ''blindness''.'""People with certain diseases and health problems can increase the skin's sensitive to the sun's UV radiation, or example, in people with ""'lupus'"", the sun's rays can cause flare-ups, including a worsening ""'rash'"". Other health problems that are more prone to the sun's UV radiation include albinism, porphyrias, ""'vitiligo'',and an ''inherited'' hypersensitivity to the cancer-causing effects of ultraviolet light (xeroderma pigmentosum).' Malignant melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer that can cause death. Basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are slow growing and are far less likely to spread to other parts of the body than melanoma. Both basal and squamous cell cancers can be cured in most cases if diagnosed early."
How can you tell if you have a mild or moderate sunburn (symptoms)?,"'Some of the immediate symptoms of sunburn after exposure include:''More subtle exposures to the sun may not have any obvious immediate symptoms such as the ones listed above. Most sunburns are mild causing only skin redness, pain, and irritation or possibly a rash due to involvement of the outer layer of skin (''first-degree burn''). This type of burn may be painful to touch.''A more moderate sunburn (''second-degree burn'') may cause the skin to become swollen (''edema''), and very red, with painful blisters. This type of sun rash may take longer to heal.''People who have chronic (long standing) exposure to sun can increase their chances of developing chronic skin damage from sun exposure (''wrinkles'', ''aging'', ''age spots'', ''freckles'', skin cancer, scarring, etc.).''The symptoms of sunburn can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending mainly on the following:'   The skin becomes red, tender, and hot. Touching or rubbing the skin causes pain. Because heat triggers fluid loss, a sunburn victim can also become dehydrated. For several days after exposure, the skin may itch, swell, blister, and peel. Some sufferers develop welts or rashes. Skin peeling can occur several days later after a sun rash develops and is a sign of healing and rebuilding of skin.

Medications the person has been taking (sun-sensitizing drugs may increase a person's susceptibility to a bad sunburn). Skin preparations (sunscreen) the person has been using."
How can you tell if you have a severe sunburn or sun poisoning (symptoms)?,"'In addition to the usual symptoms of sunburn, a severe sunburn or sun poisoning may cause''A severe sunburn also may be associated with ''heat exhaustion'' or heat ''stroke'', which is a ''medical emergency''. Severe cases of sunburn require emergency medical treatment.''A follow-up visit with a physician is not necessary unless the sunburn was severe. If you have had a significant sunburn talk to your doctor so that he or she can do a skin body exam to look closely for symptoms of skin cancer and other problems caused by a severe sunburn.' fever, nausea, chills, dizziness, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, dehydration, shock with loss of consciousness, and/or severe blisters or soreness."
What causes the skin to tan?,"'The skin contains a pigment called ''melanin''. It colors the skin, imparting a wide variety of skin tones. Melanin blocks some of the UV rays from penetrating the skin. After repeated or prolonged exposure to UV rays, the skin produces more melanin. Consequently, the skin darkens, or tans, which in turn protects the skin to a certain degree.' "
When to call a doctor for a moderate or severe sunburn,"'If you have symptoms of a severe sunburn call your doctor, or go to an urgent care facility, or emergency department. If you apply compresses the burned skin, dip them in cool or slightly ''cold'' water. Do not use cold water.''Sunburn symptoms are mild or moderate, drink plenty of water to replenish the fluids to avoid dehydration, and use natural or home methods to relieve pain, ''itching'', blisters, peeling, and inflamed skin.' "
What natural home remedies provide sunburn relief fast?,"'Home remedies can provide sunburn relief and help treat blisters, ''rashes'', burning, inflammation, and ''itching''.''Antioxidants are agents that can prevent certain harmful reactions in the body. One of these agents are free radicals, which is the formation of some potentially harmful molecules in the body. Antioxidants are natural agents that may prevent or reduce the formation of free radicals. Some sun damage is a result of this reaction. Oral or topical antioxidants (''vitamins'' A, C, and E, and ''green tea'') may theoretically protect the skin against sunburn. Clinical data is not sufficient to support their use instead of or in addition to, traditional sunscreen.'   Apply dampened cloths or compresses to reduce the heat and lessen the pain Soak in a bathtub of tepid, plain, soap-free water (soap can irritate the burn). Gently pat the skin dry afterward - do not rub it Apply a soothing cream, lotion, or another preparation approved by a doctor or pharmacistSome preparations, especially those that contain benzocaine (Endocaine, Hurricaine), can trigger an allergic reaction in some people, and certain ointments can slow healing by sealing off the skin from the air. Some preparations, especially those that contain benzocaine (Endocaine, Hurricaine), can trigger an allergic reaction in some people, and certain ointments can slow healing by sealing off the skin from the air. Headache may be caused by dehydration. Drink plenty of fluids (no caffeine or alcohol) to prevent dehydration while out in the sun for prolonged periods. Moisturize with creams or aloe Vera gel may also provide symptom relief."
Home remedies for blisters,"'If blisters form after sunburn, do not attempt to burst or ""pop"" them unless they are located in a very painful area, or are otherwise causing a lot of discomfort due to size. Most blisters will break by themselves if they are left alone. Blisters are better left uncovered as rubbing or placing a tight cover over them may cause infections and more discomfort. If blisters need to be covered because they cause discomfort by rubbing on clothes, use a loosely applied dressing.''Once a sunburn blister breaks, the area of the broken blister should be kept clean by washing it frequently with soap and water. The left over skin should be left alone, but cleaned, until it falls off. Broken blisters generally heal on their own, but topical antibiotic ointments should be applied to the area of broken blisters to prevent infections.''If a sun blister is uncomfortable or too large or located in a cosmetically unappealing area, consider breaking it carefully. This could be done by gently cleaning the area well with soap and water or rubbing alcohol and using a sterilized needle to punch a hole at the edge of the blister gently. The fluid inside can be pushed towards the hole and drained. The area should be cleaned again and covered with a loose dressing afterwards. Topical antibiotics can be applied to the broken blister to reduce the risk of infection.' "
What medications are used for the treatment of a sunburn?,"'Most of the medical treatments for a sunburn are only used to treat symptoms like pain, inflammation, itching, burning, ''blistering'', and peeling.''These medications also relieve ''headaches'' or body aches associated with a sunburn.''If you are ''pregnant'' and get a moderate to severe sunburn, contact your doctor to discuss what treatments are safe.'  Redness, pain, and discomfort: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in oral (ibuprofen, Motrin, Naprosyn, Advil etc.) or topical diclofenac 0.1% gel (Solaraze) forms have shown to reduce redness if applied before or immediately after UVB exposure. This benefit may be diminished after 24 hours. These medications may also help relieve the symptoms of sunburn such as pain and discomfort. Itching: Topical over-the-counter (OTC) moisturizer creams, especially if you apply it right after a shower or bath, can help relieve itching. Topical anesthetics like benzocaine may help relieve other painful symptoms."
What type of skin type is most susceptible to sunburn?,"'People with certain pigment disorders (such as albinism) and those with fair skin are at the highest risk of suffering a mild to severe sunburn. The American Academy of Dermatology classifies skin types into six categories (in terms of susceptibility to sunburn) for skin colors ranging from fair to black. This is called the Fitzpatrick classification.''Types 1 and 2: High Susceptibility to Sunburn ''Types 3 and 4: Moderate Susceptibility to Sunburn''Types 5 and 6: Minimal or No Susceptibility to Sunburn'""It is often difficult to accurately determine an individual's skin type simply by looking at the color of the skin. It is best to ask the person how quickly they may burn and how easily they tan. The response can determine the person's skin type."" People with Skin Type 1 have very fair skin (pale or milky white), blonde or red hair, and possibly freckles. These people can suffer a burn in less than one-half hour when exposed to summer sunlight at midday. People with Skin Type 1 never tan. People with Skin Type 2 have very light brown skin and possibly freckles. They burn in a short time in the sun, although they can achieve a very light tan. People with Skin Type 3 (called ""average Caucasians"" by The American Academy of Dermatology) have skin that is slightly more brown than the skin of a Type 2. They can develop a moderate sunburn and a light brown tan. People with Skin Type 4 have olive-colored skin. Ordinarily, they develop only a minor sunburn while acquiring moderate tan. People with Skin Type 5 have brown skin and can develop a dark tan, rarely burning. People with Skin Type 6 have black skin and never burn."
What strengths of sunscreens work best?,"'Sunscreens protect the skin by absorbing or reflecting the UV radiation, and may be classified into two groups, physical sunscreens, and chemical sunscreens. Many available sunscreens mainly protect against UVB radiation rays, and may not adequately protect against long standing UVA radiation exposure.''The most recommended practice for adequate protection from UV radiation exposure is a combination of physical and chemical sunscreens.''SPF'', or ''Sun Protection'' Factor, is the measurement of how well an agent may protect against sunburn. SPF can be calculated from the amount of time it takes to develop mild redness or burning in an unprotected person. For example, if someone develops mild sunburn-related redness in 20 minutes, he or she may develop the same degree of redness in 300 minutes (5 hours) with an SPF 15 sunscreen (15 multiplied by 20 minutes) when properly applied.''Traditionally, the SPF is rated for sun damage by UVB rays only. However, in 2012, the FDA implemented a regulation that required the sunscreen industry to change their labels to include ""broad spectrum"" information on the protective potential against UVA radiation. This was an important labeling regulation because UVA is responsible for a large portion of sun damage to a person’s skin. These FDA labeling provisions include:''Sunscreen sprays are available, and generally are effective; however, there is a concern about the amount of spray that actually sticks to the skin after it is applied. The spray can be dispersed by wind, an insufficient amount may be sprayed, or the sunscreen may be sprayed too far from the body. It is recommended that sunscreen sprays be used in conjunction with other more traditional topical sunscreens or sunblocks for the best sun protection. Moreover, there are concerns about the amount of sunscreen that may be inhaled unintentionally, and if that poses any health risks.''Sunscreens may degrade over time or after long exposure to sun and heat. The bottle should not be kept in the car or under direct sun exposure for a long period. If the expiration date has passed, the product should be discarded. Sunscreens generally expire or lose their effectiveness after about three years.'  Sunscreen products that are not ""broad spectrum"" with SPF values from 2 to 14 will be labeled with a warning that reads, ""Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert."" Water resistant sunscreen claims must have information about how much time a person can expect to have the declared SPF level of protection while sweating or swimming. Two times will be permitted on the labels: 40 or 80 minutes. Manufactures can no longer make claims that sunscreens are ""waterproof"" or ""sweat proof"" or identify their products as ""sunblocks."" Sunscreens cannot claim protection immediately on application (for example, ""instant protection"") or protection for more than two hours without reapplication. SPF 15 sunscreen is the minimum requirement for most people. Stronger sunscreens or sunblocks are recommended for people who easily burn in the sun, and have spent longer amounts of time in the sun. Apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before you go out in the sun, and reapply it every 1 to 2 hours. Some doctors encourage more frequent reapplication, especially shortly after being exposed to the sun. Apply sunscreen liberally; spreading the product too thin may not achieve the desired degree of protection. A general recommendation is to apply an amount similar to the size of a golf ball for a person of average build. Exposure to water may wash off sunscreen, so reapply it after you your body is dry."
7 tips to prevent a sunburn and skin cancer,"'The best methods of preventing sunburn, and hopefully skin cancer are to:' Limit the amount of time of sun exposure and avoiding the peak sunshine hours of late morning to early mid-day, generally 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and do not spend too much time in the sun, especially in direct sunlight in the middle of the day. Wear protective clothing such as a broad-brimmed hat, UV protected sunglasses and clothing; long pants, and shirts with sleeves that cover the arms (thicker fabrics and dark clothing in general protect better compared with light clothing - there are clothing products available that offer ""UV"" protection). Be aware sunburn can occur even on a cloudy day (clouds don't stop ultraviolet rays), and even when you are in the water. Remember that sand, water, and snow reflect the sun's rays and increase the chance of burning during beach activities or skiing. Use a protective sunscreen to minimize the penetration of UV rays. Sunscreens with a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 are recommended for everyone, even dark-skinned individuals, exposed to the sun. Light-skinned people should use a higher SPF when in direct sun. Apply several minutes before going into the sun and reapply often. Drink plenty of water or hydrating drinks to avoid dehydration. Do not drink alcoholic drinks because they will dehydrate you more. Do not use tanning beds and sun lamps."
What is superior vena cava syndrome?,"'The superior vena cava is a large vein located in the upper chest, which collects blood from the head and arms and delivers it back to the right ''atrium'' of the heart. If this vein is compressed by outside structures, or if a thrombus or clot develops within it, return blood flow to the heart is impeded. When blood flow to the heart is restricted, the increased pressure in the veins of the face and arms causes ''edema'' (fluid buildup) in these areas. This condition is referred to as superior vena cava syndrome.''Because the superior vena cava, like all veins, has a thin wall (there are no muscles in the walls of a vein as compared to the walls of an artery), and because there is little pressure inside the vein, it can be easily compressed by outside structures. The superior vena cava lies next to the upper lobe of the right lung and within the mediastinum [the space that contains the central structures of the chest: the heart, the trachea, the ''esophagus'' and the great vessels (''aorta'', vena cava)]. Abnormalities within any of these structures can cause the compression.' "
What causes superior vena cava syndrome?,"'The most common cause of superior vena cava syndrome is ''cancer''. Primary or metastatic ''cancer'' in the upper lobe of the right lung can compress the superior vena cava. ''Lymphoma'' or other tumors located in the mediastinum can also cause compression of the superior vena cava.''Less often, the superior vena cava can become blocked with a ''blood clot'' from within. As more invasive medical procedures are being performed on patients, this cause of superior vena cava syndrome is being seen more frequently. ''Blood clot'' (thrombus) formation that causes superior vena cava syndrome is a complication of ''pacemaker'' wires,''dialysis'', and other intravenous catheters that are threaded into the superior vena cava.''Historically, and in other parts of the world, infection (''syphilis'' and ''tuberculosis'') is another cause of superior vena cava syndrome. ''Sarcoidosis'' (a disease that results in masses of inflamed tissue) may also cause this syndrome.' "
What are the symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome?,"'Initially, there are few symptoms, however, over time, symptoms of superior vena cava gradually develop. As the compression becomes more severe, the patient may develop shortness of breath and swelling of the arms and face. The symptoms occur because blood cannot return to the heart. ''Without adequate blood return, it is hard for the heart to pump newly oxygenated blood to meet the metabolic needs of the body. If blood cannot return to the heart, it starts to back up and causes swelling of the areas where the backup occurs.''Less common symptoms include:'   dilation of veins on the skin surface as the body tries to establish new circulatory pathways to bypass the blockage, and a blue tinge to the skin (because the backed up blood doesn't have enough oxygen content) cough,  shortness of breath,  chest pain, and hoarseness."
How is superior vena cava syndrome diagnosed?," A plain chest x-ray may show abnormal enlargement of the mediastinum or may reveal a tumor in the lung. Ultrasound may be used to look for blood clots in the arm leading into the chest. Computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the chest is most often used to diagnose superior vena cava syndrome. While it will show the blockage and may show a tumor, it will not necessarily diagnose the type of tumor. If a tumor is the cause of the obstruction, often a surgical procedure will be required to obtain a biopsy (a small piece of tissue), to help make the specific diagnosis as to the type of tumor."
How is superior vena cava syndrome treated?,"'Rarely does superior vena cava syndrome constitute a medical emergency. The ABCs of care are always a priority, insuring that the ''A''irway is well maintained, ''B''reathing is adequate and the ''C''irculation (''blood pressure'' and heart rate) is stable. The patient may feel more comfortable in an upright position. ''Furosemide'' (''Lasix'') is a diuretic that will decrease the volume of fluid within the bloodstream. With less pressure pushing against the obstructed superior vena cava, symptoms may be temporarily relieved.''Treatment needs to be directed to the underlying cause. ''If the cause is a tumor or ''cancer'"", the treatment plan will need to be customized to the patient's condition and desires. Options include ""'radiation'' with or without ''chemotherapy''. Even with aggressive treatment with radiation, only 10 % of ''lung cancer'' patients with this syndrome survived to 30 months. Without any treatment, survival may be less than a month.''Steroids [for example, ''methylprednisolone'' (''Medrol'', ''Depo-Medrol'') or ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred'')], may be considered to decrease the swelling of a tumor pressing on the superior vena cava and help relieve symptoms.''If the cause of superior vena cava syndrome is a blood clot, anticoagulation with (''warfarin'') ''Coumadin'' may be indicated. The use of thrombolytic ''drugs'' [for example, ''alteplase'' (''Activase'', TPA) or TNK] to break up the clot, or placement of a ''stent'' to keep the vein open may also be considered.'""In children, superior vena cava syndrome is most often caused bynon-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The compression of the superior vena cava may be associated with compression of the trachea as well. The trachea (windpipe) in children is relatively narrow, flexible, and soft as compared with an adult. ""'Airway'' obstruction may occur and manifest as:'   difficulty breathing, stridor (high-pitched, abnormal breathing sounds heard when breathing in), and  wheezing."
What is the prognosis for superior vena cava syndrome?,'The outcome and prognosis is dependent upon the underlying cause of the superior vena cava syndrome.' 
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
What is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'The ''heart'' is a two-stage electrical pump. A coordinated electrical signal is required for the heart muscle cells to contract in a coordinated way and generate a heartbeat. Normally, an electrical signal is generated in special ''pacemaker'' cells found in the sinoatrial (SA) node located in the ''right atrium'' or upper chamber of the heart. This impulse spreads to the whole atrial muscle causing it to contract and push blood into the ventricle or the lower chamber of the heart. The electrical signal continues to a junction box between the ''atrium'' and ventricle (the ''AV node''), where there is a slight delay that allows the ventricle to fill before it contracts and pumps blood to the body. The signal continues throughout the ventricles and causes them to beat and push blood to the body. '  "
What causes paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'In paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), abnormal conduction of that electricity causes the ''atrium'', and secondarily the ventricles, to beat very rapidly. It is referred to as paroxysmal, because the rapid rate can occur sporadically and without warning and may also stop on its own. The rapid heartbeat may last a few seconds or many hours. Often the PSVT resolves before the patient reaches a health care professional.''In many patients with PSVT, there is a “wiring” problem in the ''AV node'' and instead of having just one pathway for electricity to travel to the ventricle, there are two. This allows electricity to circle back and cause the ''atrium'' to beat more quickly than it should normally. PSVT is one of many electrical abnormalities that cause the atrium to beat too quickly. These abnormalities were once lumped together and called paroxysmal atrial tachycardia or PAT but, as more has been learned about the electrical wiring of the heart, terminology has been updated to better reflect the specific abnormal rhythm.''Some examples include''As well, there are numerous abnormalities in the ''AV node'' that cause rapid heartbeats and ''palpitations''. PSVT and other electrical abnormalities located in the atrium or AV node should not be confused with ventricular tachycardia, which arises from the ventricle and is potentially life-threatening.' atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome."
What are the symptoms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'One of the most common symptom of\xa0PSVT is heart ''palpitations'', often described as a ""rapid heartbeat."" There can also be a fullness in the throat that is associated with the rapid heartbeat.''Other symptoms include the following:''The symptoms of PSVT usually occur while the heart is beating quickly, but the ''fatigue'' can persist after the heartbeat returns to normal. By its nature, PSVT is intermittent and its onset cannot be predicted. As well, once the heart starts to beat quickly, there is no way of predicting if and when it will return to normal rhythm on its own. Some patients are unaware that their heart is beating quickly and PSVT is found only when the patient presents for care and is found to have a rapid heartbeat.'   Lightheadedness, Weakness and fatigue Shortness of breath Chest pressure Syncope (passing out)"
How is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of PSVT is based upon interpretation of the heart rate monitor and ''electrocardiogram''.'""Sometimes the diagnosis is difficult because the rapid heart rate resolves before the patient presents for medical care. In these cases, where there is a recurrent pattern of palpitations, the healthcare professional may suggest monitoring the patient's heart rate and rhythm as an outpatient. A Holter monitor is a small device that can be worn for 24 or 48 hours that records every heartbeat and may give a clue as to the underlying cause of the palpitations.""'A 30-day event monitor may also be considered, which gives a longer window to detect the rhythm. Again, a small monitor is worn, but with this device the patient triggers the recording when the palpitations begin. In some cases, specialized electrophysiology tests may be necessary to monitor the heart and try to reproduce abnormal rhythms.''For infrequent events, an implantable device (LINQ) can be placed just under the skin, and can scan for a month looking for rare rhythm changes.'  "
What is the treatment for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'There is a stepwise approach to treating the rapid heartbeat of PSVT. ''Vasovagal'"" maneuvers stimulate the vagus nerve and can slow the heart rate. Some options include holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement or splashing ""'cold'' water on the face. A care professional might cautiously ''massage'' the carotid artery in the neck, but in older patients, there is a risk of ''stroke'' and this procedure is usually reserved for younger patients.''Depending upon the heart rhythm, medications can be injected intravenously to reset the AV node or to decrease heart muscle excitability. Adenosine is a short-acting medication that is commonly used as a first-line drug to treat PSVT. Other treatment options for other atrial tachycardias include ''calcium channel blockers'', ''beta blockers'', ''digoxin'', and ''amiodarone''.''If the PSVT does not convert with intravenous medication or if the patient has ''low blood pressure'' or complains of ''chest pain'' or shortness of breath, ''cardioversion'' may be required. This means that an electrical ''shock'"" is given that resets the heart's electrical system to beat with a regular rate and rhythm.""  "
How can paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) be prevented?,"'PSVT can result because of underlying medical conditions or because of foods and medications that are ingested. ''Caffeine'', ''alcohol'', and ''over-the-counter'"" (OTC) cold medications that contain pseudoephedrine can stimulate and irritate the heart's electrical conduction system and precipitate an episode of PSVT. Decreasing or avoiding use of these chemicals completely may prevent PSVT. ""'Electrolytes'' abnormalities can cause heart electrical irritability. Abnormal thyroid levels can also precipitate ''abnormal heart rhythms''.''Medications can be used to minimize the recurrence of PSVT, including calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or other antiarrhythmic medications.'""If PSVT continues to recur, an electrophysiologic study (EPS) can be done by a cardiologist and the electrical system of the heart can be mapped. If abnormal tracts or short circuits are found, they can be ablated or destroyed with high frequency radio waves and hopefully, prevent future episodes of PSVT. This is often a highly effective modality for patients with recurrent episodes who don't wish to have to take long-term medication."" "
What is an echocardiogram? What is the definition of echocardiogram?,"'The ''heart'' is a two-stage electrical pump that circulates blood throughout the body. The anatomy includes four chambers and four valves. For the heart to function normally these structures need to be intact and the heart muscle needs to beat in a coordinated fashion, so that blood flows in and out of each chamber in the proper direction.''An echocardiogram (echo=sound + card=heart + gram=drawing) is an ''ultrasound'' test that can evaluate the structures of the heart, as well as the direction of blood flow within it. Technicians specially trained in ''echocardiography'' produce the images and videos, often using a special probe or transducer that is placed in various places on the chest wall, to view the heart from different directions. Cardiologists, or heart specialists, are trained to evaluate these images to assess ''heart function'' and provide a report of the results.The echocardiogram is just one of the many tests that can be done to evaluate heart anatomy and function.''An ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ''ECG'') is the most common heart tracing done. Electrodes are placed on the chest wall and collect information about the electrical activity of the heart. Aside from the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat, the EKG can provide indirect evidence of blood flow within arteries to heart muscle and the thickness of heart muscle.''Cardiac catheterization'' is an invasive test performed by a cardiologist, where a catheter is threaded into the coronary arteries (those arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood) through the femoral artery in the groin, the radial artery in the wrist, or the brachial artery in the elbow. Dye is injected into the coronary arteries looking for blockage. In some instances, the blockage can be corrected by ''balloon angioplasty'' where a balloon is inflated at the level of blockage, re-establishing blood flow. A ''stent'' can be used to keep the artery open. This test can also assess the size and function of the heart chambers and valves, and the major arteries and veins that enter and leave the heart.' "
What are the different types of echocardiograms?,"   Transthoracic echocardiogram: In the transthoracic echocardiogram procedure, the echocardiographer places the transducer, or probe, on the chest wall and bounces sound waves off the structures of the heart. The return signals are received by the same transducer and converted by a computer into the images seen on the screen. Transesophageal echocardiogram: In some situations, a clearer view of the heart is required and instead of placing the transducer on the chest wall, a cardiologist will direct the probe through the mouth into the esophagus. The esophagus is located right next to the heart in the middle of the chest and the sound waves can travel to the heart without the interference of the ribs and muscles of the chest wall.This test usually requires intravenous medications to sedate the patient. Because of the sedation, monitors will also be used to measure blood pressure and oxygen levels in the blood. This test usually requires intravenous medications to sedate the patient. Because of the sedation, monitors will also be used to measure blood pressure and oxygen levels in the blood. Doppler echocardiogram: In addition to sound waves bouncing off the solid structures of the heart, they also bounce off the red blood cells as they circulate through the heart chambers. Using Doppler technology, the echocardiogram can assess the speed and direction of blood flow, helping increase the amount and quality of information available from the test. The computer can add color to help the doctor appreciate that information. Color flow Doppler is routinely added to all echocardiogram studies and is the same technology used in weather reports. Stress echocardiogram: A stress echocardiogram helps uncover abnormalities in the function of the heart wall muscle. The patient may be asked to exercise by either walking on a treadmill or riding an exercise bicycle. The echocardiogram is performed before exercise as a baseline, and then immediately after the test. When coronary arteries narrow due to atherosclerotic heart disease, the heart muscle may not receive enough blood supply during exercise. During a stress echocardiogram, the areas of heart muscle not receiving enough blood flow may not squeeze as well as other parts of the heart, and will appear to have motion abnormality. This can indirectly indicate narrowing, or stenosis, of the coronary arteries. This can cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or you may have no symptoms. For a stress echocardiogram to be effectively interpreted, the exercise done needs to achieve certain minimum intensity. If the patient is unable to exercise adequately, medications can be injected intravenously to chemically make the heart respond as if exercise is occurring. Contrast may be injected into the patient's vein to help enhance the images and increase the information that is obtained. The contrast material (Optison, Density) are microscopic protein shells filled with gas bubbles. The decision to use contrast depends upon the patient's specific situation."
What is an echocardiogram used to diagnose?,"'The purpose of an echocardiogram is to assess the structure and function of the heart. It is recommended as a noninvasive procedure as part of assessing potential and established heart problems.''Regarding structure, the test can assess the general size of the heart, the size of the four heart chambers, and the appearance and function of the four heart valves. It can look at the two septa of the heart; the atrial septum separates the right and ''left atrium'' and the ventricular septum separates the right and left ventricles. It can also assess the pericardium (the sac that lines the heart) and the ''aorta''.''Regarding function, the echocardiogram can determine how the heart valves open and close. It can evaluate whether the heart muscle squeezes appropriately and how efficiently. Cardiac output measures how much blood the heart pumps. Ejection fraction measures what percent of blood within the heart is pumped out to the body with each heartbeat. It can also measure how well the heart relaxes in between beats, when the heart fills for the next pump.''Some heart issues that the echocardiogram can help evaluate include the following:'  Heart valve disorders: Stenosis (narrowed), insufficiency or regurgitation (leaking), and endocarditis (infection of the valves) Abnormalities of the septum: Atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patent foramen ovale Wall motion abnormalities: Cardiomyopathy, atherosclerotic heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease), and trauma Diseases of the pericardium (the sac that lines the heart): This includes pericardial effusion (assessment of fluid in the pericardial sac)"
How should you prepare for an echocardiogram?,"'There is no preparation for a transthoracic echocardiogram.''When a transesophageal echocardiogram is performed, the patient usually requires some sedation to tolerate the procedure. The stomach should be empty to prevent ''vomiting'' and aspiration into the ''lungs''. For that reason, the patient should have nothing to eat or drink for many hours before the procedure. Due to the sedation, the patient will need a family member or friend to escort the patient home.''For a stress echocardiogram, the patient may need to walk on a treadmill or ride a bicycle. Comfortable shoes are recommended.'  "
What happens during an echocardiogram test?,"'An echocardiogram is an office or outpatient procedure. Electrodes are placed on the chest wall to monitor heart rate and rhythm. The lights in the room may be dimmed to help see the images on the computer monitor. If contrast is used, an intravenous line will need to be started.''In transthoracic echocardiogram, the patient\'s chest will need to be exposed. The technician will press the transducer or probe firmly on the chest wall to get the heart images. The patient may be asked to roll on their left side take deep breaths to help the probe better ""see"" the heart. The patient will be monitored because of the need for intravenous sedation. A heart monitor and oxygen monitor will be placed; supplemental oxygen is usually provided by prongs placed in the nose and an intravenous line will be started. Once sedated, the cardiologist will pass a tube, with the transducer on its tip, through the mouth and position it in the esophagus at a level near the heart. The patient may or may or remember the procedure because many of the sedative medicines have an amnestic effect; but once the patient is fully awake, they may be discharged home with an escort.' "
What are the potential risks of having an echocardiogram?,"'There are no risks associated with a transthoracic echocardiogram.''The risks of a transesophageal echocardiogram are due to the sedation required to perform the procedure or, very rarely, damage to the esophagus.' "
What will the results of an echocardiogram indicate?,"'The purpose of the echocardiogram is to assess the structure and function of the heart. The results will provide information that can help the health care professional make a diagnosis that involves the heart.''Echocardiograms may be repeated over time, monitoring heart function and the results may help decide whether previous treatment has been effective and whether any changes in that treatment program are required.'  "
What is an electromyogram?,"'An electromyogram (EMG) is a test that is used to record the electrical activity of muscles. When muscles are active, they produce an electrical current. This current is usually proportional to the level of the muscle activity. An EMG is also referred to as a myogram.''EMGs can be used to detect abnormal electrical activity of muscle that can occur in many diseases and conditions, including muscular dystrophy, inflammation of muscles, pinched nerves, peripheral nerve damage (damage to nerves in the arms and legs), ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'' (''ALS''), ''myasthenia gravis'', ''disc herniation'', and others.'  "
Why is an EMG test done?,"'An EMG is often performed when patients have unexplained muscle ''weakness''. The EMG helps to distinguish between muscle conditions in which the problem begins in the muscle and muscle weakness due to nerve disorders. The EMG can also be used to detect true weakness, as opposed to weakness from reduced use because of ''pain'' or lack of motivation. EMGs can also be used to isolate the level of nerve irritation or injury.'  "
How is an intramuscular EMG done?,"'A needle is inserted through the skin into the muscle. The electrical activity is detected by this needle (which serves as an electrode). The activity is displayed visually on an oscilloscope and may also be detected audibly with a speaker.''Since skeletal muscles are often large, several needle electrodes may need to be placed at various locations to obtain an informative EMG.''After placement of the electrode(s), the patient may be asked to contract the muscle (for example, to bend the leg).''The presence, size, and shape of the wave form (the action potential) produced on the oscilloscope provide information about the ability of the muscle to respond to nervous stimulation. Each muscle ''fiber'' that contracts produces an action potential. The size of the muscle fiber affects the rate (how frequently an action potential occurs) and the size (the amplitude) of the action potential.' "
Is an EMG painful?,"'Yes. There is some discomfort at the time the needle electrodes are inserted. They feel like shots (intramuscular injections), although nothing is injected during an EMG. Afterwards, the muscle may feel a little sore for up to a few days.'  "
How do you prepare for an intramuscular EMG?,"""For adults, no special preparation is needed. For infants and children, the physical and psychological preparation depends on the child's age, behavior, and prior experience. (For instance, has the child been traumatized by another medical or dental procedure?)"" "
What other test is done during an intramuscular EMG?,"""A nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test is often done at the same time as an EMG. In this test, the nerve is electrically stimulated while a second electrode detects the electrical impulse 'down-stream' from the first. This is usually done with surface patch electrodes (they are similar to those used for an ""'electrocardiogram'') that are placed on the skin over the nerve at various locations. One electrode stimulates the nerve with a very mild electrical impulse. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to calculate the speed of impulse transmission (nerve conduction velocity). A decreased speed of transmission indicates nerve disease.''The NCV test can be used to detect true nerve disorders (such as neuropathy) or conditions whereby muscles are affected by nerve injury (such as ''carpal tunnel syndrome''). Normal body temperature must be maintained for the NCV test, because low body temperatures slow nerve conduction.''Previous contributing authors and editors: Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor: Barbara K. Hecht, Ph.D.' "
What is a breast biopsy?,"'A breast biopsy is a procedure in which part or all of a suspicious area in the breast is removed and examined, usually for the presence of ''breast cancer''. The growth sample is suctioned out through a needle or cut out using a surgical procedure. A pathologist then examines and evaluates it under a microscope to identify noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (''malignant'') tissue.''Words used to refer to the abnormal area or growth before and after diagnosis may include lump, mass, lesion, calcification, and ''tumor''.''Imaging studies such as ''mammography'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI), or ultrasound may be used to guide the procedure, known as an image-guided breast biopsy. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses a special mammography machine to help guide the biopsy equipment to the site of the breast abnormality.''The following are the different types of breast biopsy procedures:'   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA): A thin needle suctions out cells from an abnormal area; a physician examines the cells to see if cancer cells are present. Hollow or core needle biopsy: This thicker needle is used to remove a small cylinder of tissue from the abnormal area. Biopsy with a vacuum-powered device Surgical excision of tissue: This may be an excisional biopsy, in which all the abnormal area is excised or removed, or an incisional biopsy, which removes only a portion of the abnormal area for examination by the pathologist."
What is the purpose of a breast biopsy?,"'The breast biopsy is used to determine whether or not a worrisome abnormality or area of calcification is ''cancer'' and, if it is ''cancer'', what type it is and how to develop a treatment plan. When no ''breast cancer'' is detected, the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring. The percentage of breast biopsies that are positive for cancer varies according to the individual hospital or clinic, but in general, only about 20% of ''breast lumps'' are cancerous. The majority of breast biopsies do not detect cancer.' "
"What specialties of physicians and 
other health care professionals perform breast biopsies?","'Many physicians and health care professionals can be involved in evaluating a woman for a breast biopsy.' For example, breast abnormalities during a physical examination might be noticed by a family physician, internist, gynecologist, or nurse practitioner. Women themselves are frequently the first to detect abnormalities in their breasts. Radiologists are specialists in interpreting X-rays such as mammograms, as well as other imaging studies. Radiologists or surgeons often perform the procedure to obtain these breast tissue samples. Anesthesiologists (specialists in administering anesthesia and monitoring a patient's vital signs) are sometimes necessary during some surgical procedures. Pathologists are physician specialists who examine and identify under a microscope the type of cells in the samples and determine whether or not cancer is present."
Who should have a breast biopsy?,"'Anyone, female or male, with a suspicious breast growth, abnormality detected on imaging study, or other ''symptoms of breast cancer'' should undergo a biopsy. Ninety-nine percent of all breast ''cancers'' occur in females, however, males can and do get breast cancer. Therefore, men should regularly examine their breasts as females do for lumps or other ''cancer symptoms''. (Males with the ''genetic disorder'' ''Klinefelter syndrome'', which is associated with increased breast development, have approximately the same risk of developing breast cancer as females.)'  "
In what setting is the breast biopsy done?,"""Breast biopsies are performed in the doctor's office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital operating room. The setting depends on the size and location of the growth, the patient's general health, and the type of biopsy performed. Because physicians can perform biopsies in a short time with minimal risk of serious complications, the patient usually does not need to remain hospitalized overnight unless an underlying health problem requires close monitoring. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses mammography images to guide the location of the biopsy. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may also be used to guide the breast biopsy procedure."" "
What may a benign result indicate?,"'Among the most common benign growths in the breast are ''cysts'' (sacs filled with fluid or semisolid material), intraductal papillomas (small wart-like growths that project above a tissue surface), and lumps formed by fat necrosis (the death of tissue often as a result of ''trauma'' to the breast). A fibroadenoma is the most common type of benign (noncancerous) breast tumor and is found in young women.' "
How is a suspicious breast growth discovered?,"""A suspicious breast growth may be found by a patient's self-examination, a physician's clinical examination, or a screening procedure such as a ""'mammogram''. Small calcium deposits, known as calcifications, are often identified in imaging studies of breast cancers and precancers. These may also be present in benign lesions.' "
What breast symptoms should I be concerned about?,"'Females and males (regardless of age) who discover a lump in a breast should see a doctor for testing. They also should see a doctor if they find a lump in an armpit or above a collarbone (either of which could indicate the presence of spreading cancer).''A doctor or health care professional should be consulted if a person has''It is important to remember that these signs and symptoms do not necessarily indicate the presence of cancer.' red or irritated breast skin, scaly skin on the breast, dimpling skin on the breast, swelling breast skin, nipple discharge other than milk, nipple retraction or inversion, nipple itching, a change in the size or shape of a breast, or breast pain."
What should the patient tell the doctor about the growth?,"'The patient should tell the health care professional when the growth appeared, what its size was at the time of discovery compared to its present size, and where it is located. The patient should also outline any family history of breast cancer, as well as any personal history of breast problems of any kind.' "
How does a health care professional confirm the presence of a breast growth?,"'A physician confirms the presence of a growth by taking a medical history (and asking numerous questions), performing a clinical examination that includes palpating (feeling) the breast, and interpreting the results of a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes other imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI.''Ultrasound sends sound waves into the breast that bounce back to a receiver that can record an image on a computer screen to visualize interior structures. This technique can help distinguish between a ''cyst'' and a solid growth. The physician may also order the laboratory analysis of any nipple discharge (other than milk) to examine for the presence of atypical or cancer cells. After confirming the presence of a suspicious growth or mass, the physician orders a biopsy.' "
"Is anesthesia needed for a 
breast biopsy?","'For nonsurgical biopsies, the patient may need no anesthesia at all or just a local anesthetic (one that numbs the suspicious area only). Sometimes, a patient receives a sedative (calming drug) with the local anesthesia.''For surgical biopsies, the patient may receive a local anesthetic (with or without a sedative) or general anesthesia (one that induces ''sleep''). Patients requiring general anesthesia may have to fast eight to 12 hours before undergoing a biopsy.' "
What are the possible complications from a breast biopsy?,"'Except for a minor sting from the injected anesthesia, patients usually feel no ''pain'' before or during a procedure.''The risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding, is small for nonsurgical procedures and slightly higher for surgical procedures.' "
How long is the recovery time after breast biopsy?,"'After a procedure, some patients may experience some soreness and ''pain'' as well as ''bruising'' and minor skin discoloration of the breast that usually resolves within a week or so. Usually, an ''over-the-counter'' drug such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is sufficient to alleviate any discomfort.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nonsurgical procedures versus surgical breast biopsies?,"'Generally, nonsurgical biopsies are less stressful, do not disfigure the skin, leave no internal ''scar'' to interfere with the accuracy of future mammograms, and minimize the risk of complications.''However, nonsurgical biopsies are not always as reliable as surgical biopsies in producing a diagnosis, and the results at times may be inconclusive. For this reason, some patients who undergo a nonsurgical biopsy must also undergo a follow-up surgical biopsy.' "
What are the different types of breast biopsy procedures and what do they involve?,"'Breast biopsy procedures include''These procedures are described in greater detail later in this article.'   fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and surgical biopsy."
How is a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) done?,"'A fine needle aspiration biopsy can be done in several different ways:''By analyzing the samples immediately after their withdrawal, a doctor may be able to determine that they came from a cyst and simply discard them, diagnosing the growth as benign. In all other cases, fluid and tissue samples are placed on slides and then analyzed by a pathologist in a laboratory. Atypical cells found in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may signal that cancer is present or that repeat biopsies are necessary.' Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for palpable growths: A palpable growth is one that can be felt. The patient usually sits up while the doctor inserts a small hollow needle with a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) fluid and cells from the growth for testing. The doctor simply feels (palpates) the suspicious area to the needle to the site. When the needle reaches the mass, the doctor suctions out a sample with the syringe. The doctor repeats this procedure several times. If the mass is a cyst, the withdrawn samples will consist mainly of fluid and the cyst may collapse, relieving any pain the patient feels. If the mass is solid, the samples will consist primarily of tissue cells. Guided FNA for non-palpable growths: When a growth is too small or deep to palpate (feel), the doctor must locate it with one of several imaging techniques. First, the patient lies face-down on a table with the breasts suspended through an opening. With stereotactic mammography, mammograms of the suspicious breast site are taken from different angles to form a virtual three-dimensional (stereotactic) image that precisely pinpoints the location of the suspicious area. The computer then uses a motor to guide a small hollow needle to the site to remove the samples. The withdrawn samples are then analyzed for the presence of cancer. Ultrasound and MRI are other imaging techniques that may be used to guide breast biopsies."
How is a core needle biopsy done?,"'A core needle biopsy can also be done in several different ways:' Core needle biopsy for palpable growths: This procedure is similar to FNA for palpable growths except that that the needle used has a wider diameter and is equipped with a cutter that removes cores of tissue up to a ½ inch long. A key advantage of this procedure is that the samples are larger than in FNA and thus enhance the possibility of making an accurate laboratory analysis. Guided core needle biopsy for non-palpable growths: This procedure also uses a wide needle with a cutter that removes cores of tissue large enough to enhance the accuracy of laboratory analysis. However, because the growth is deep in the breast or otherwise not palpable, stereotactic imaging, ultrasound, or MRI is used to locate the growth."
How is a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy done?,"'Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is procedure that uses a special instrument and imaging guidance to remove breast tissue samples through a single small skin incision. This technique allows the surgeon to remove more tissue through a single incision than is possible with a traditional core biopsy and is a much less invasive procedure than an open surgical biopsy.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy involves the placement of a biopsy probe using radiology imaging studies for guidance. Stereotactic mammography, ultrasound, and MRI have all been successfully used to identify the abnormal areas to be sampled by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Once the biopsy probe has been positioned, a vacuum pulls the breast tissue through an opening in the probe into the sampling chamber of the device. Then a rotating cutting device in the instrument removes the tissue sample, which is carried through the biopsy probe to a tissue collection receptacle.''The surgeon or radiologist then turns a control knob on the biopsy probe that moves the sampling chamber to a new position. This procedure is repeated until all desired areas have been sampled. In this way, samples can be taken all around a suspicious area through a single insertion of the biopsy probe. With a traditional core biopsy, sampling of multiple areas would involve repeated insertions of the biopsy instrument.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia and leaves a small incision that does not require ''stitches'' for closure. It takes less than an hour to perform, and patients can usually return to normal activities soon after the procedure.' "
"How is a 
surgical biopsy of the breast done?","'A surgical biopsy can be an excisional (removing the entire abnormal area) or an incisional (removing only part of the abnormal area) biopsy. The surgical biopsy can be done in different ways:''The doctor closes the opening with ''sutures'' or clips that remain in place for about a week. Patients who receive general anesthesia rather than a local will require about an hour to recover from drowsiness after the surgery.' Surgical biopsy of palpable growths (lumpectomy): This procedure removes part or all of a breast growth, or lump. The doctor makes an incision 1 or 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 cm) across and removes the sample. If the lump is small and measures 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less across, the doctor usually removes the entire lump for testing (excisional biopsy). If the lump is large, the doctor usually removes only a portion of it for testing (incisional biopsy). If cancer is found, the rest of the lump can be removed at the time of the biopsy or at a later time. Surgical biopsy for non-palpable lumps: This procedure is similar to lumpectomy except that the growth is first located by mammography or other imaging studies and then ""marked."" The doctor inserts a needle that conveys a wire with a hook on the end into the breast, all the while using the image as a guide. After anchoring the hooked wire to the lump, the doctor withdraws the needle and performs the surgery. Another option is to inject a dye to mark the spot rather than using a hooked wire."
What is the time frame for receiving the results of a breast biopsy?,"'For small biopsies and fine-needle aspirations, the results may be available the next day. The results of most breast biopsies will be available within a few days. Sometimes special testing must be performed, and the results may be delayed and take longer. This does not necessarily mean that a cancer is present. For example, sometimes the tissue sections must be recut to reveal deeper layers of the tissue to allow for optimal evaluation by the pathologist. In other cases, special tissue stains may be necessary to help the pathologist assess the tissue sample under the microscope. The radiologist or surgeon performing the procedure will be able to give you a better idea of the approximate time frame and how the result will be communicated to you.' "
What is fundoplication?,"   Fundoplication is the standard surgical method for treating gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD causes inflammation, pain (heartburn), and other serious complications (such as scarring and stricture) of the esophagus. GERD results when acid refluxes (regurgitates, or backwashes) from the stomach back up into the esophagus. Under normal conditions, there is a barrier to the reflux of acid from the stomach. One part of this barrier is the lower-most muscle of the esophagus (called the lower esophageal sphincter). Most of the time, this muscle is contracted (constricted, or tight), which closes off the esophagus from the stomach. In patients with GERD, the sphincter does not function normally. The muscle is either weak or relaxes inappropriately. Fundoplication is a surgical technique that strengthens the barrier to acid reflux when the sphincter does not function normally."
What happens during fundoplication?,"'During the fundoplication procedure, the part of the stomach that is closest to the entry of the esophagus (the fundus of the stomach) is gathered, wrapped, and sutured (sewn) around the lower end of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter. (The gathering and suturing of one tissue to another is called plication.) This procedure increases the pressure at the lower end of the esophagus and thereby reduces acid reflux.''Also, during fundoplication, other surgical steps frequently are taken that also may reduce acid reflux. For instance, if the patient has a ''hiatal hernia'' (which occurs in 80% of patients with GERD), the contents of the ''hernia'' sac (the stomach) may be pulled down from the chest and the opening the ''diaphragm'' (the hiatus) through which the esophagus passes from the chest into the abdomen sutured so that stomach remains within the abdomen. Fundoplication may be done using a large incision (laparotomy in the abdomen or thoracotomy in the chest) or a laparoscope, which requires only several small punctures in the abdomen. The advantage of the laparoscopic method is a speedier recovery and less post-operative ''pain''.' "
What are alternatives to fundoplication?,"'Although fundoplication is the standard surgical method for treating GERD, endoscopic methods for treating GERD are being developed. ''Endoscopy'' utilizes endoscopes, which are long flexible tubes that are passed by the doctor through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach. The inside of the esophagus can be viewed through the endoscope and various instruments can be passed through channels in the endoscope.''In one endoscopic method for treating GERD, an instrument is inserted that delivers an electrical current to the lower esophageal sphincter. This results in scarring which tightens the sphincter. In asecond method, ''sutures'' are placed in the sphincter to tighten the sphincter. Another treatment for GERD invloves placing a ring around the lower esophageal sphincter to prevent acid from refluxing into the esophagus. This is called the LINX procedure.''Other methods also have been employed experimentally. Endoscopic methods offer a simpler way of treating GERD than fundoplication. As more data is being accumulated as to how effective, safe, or long-lasting they are, their use is increasing.' "
What is the operation (procedure) that is recommended?,"'Ask your surgeon for a simplified explanation of the type of operation, technique used, and reasons it should be performed. (Pictures and drawings can tell patients and family a great deal.) Why was this specific procedure chosen over possible alternatives?' "
What is the surgeon's experience with this procedure?,"'It is reasonable to ask how often the surgeon performs the particular procedure. Ask the surgeon about his/her experience with this procedure, its outcome, and the hospital or setting in which the operation will be performed. Is the ''nursing'' staff accustomed to caring for patients who have had this procedure?'  "
What is the reason that this procedure is necessary at this time?,"'Is the procedure being done to relieve ''pain'', diagnose a condition, correct deformity, for cosmetic reasons, or what exact purposes? Must the procedure be performed immediately?' "
What are the options if this procedure is not done?,"'What are the nonsurgical or medical treatments available to help the condition? What will/might happen if the operation is not done? If the operation is not done at this time, can it be done later? What are the consequences if the procedure is postponed or delayed?' "
What is the anticipated outcome of the procedure?,'What exactly are the expected or possible benefits of doing the procedure? How likely is it that these benefits will result from the procedure?' 
Where will the doctor perform the surgery?,"'Surgical procedures may be performed in a hospital operating room or in an outpatient surgical facility, which may be located in a hospital or sometimes in medical offices.' "
What kind of anesthesia is required for the procedure?,'Is a general anesthetic necessary? Can the procedure be performed under local or regional anesthesia? Are ''sedatives'' or other medications required prior to the procedure? What are the risks of the type of anesthesia to be used?' 
What are the specific risks that this procedure involves?,"'What are the problems, complications, or conditions that are the risks of the procedure? How common are these complications and potential adverse events? If complications occur, how can they be treated? Is hospitalization required, or can the procedure be performed on an outpatient basis? If hospitalization is recommended, how long is a typical hospital stay?' "
What about a second opinion?,"'Obtaining a second opinion is very reasonable for an elective (voluntary, or non-emergency) surgical procedure. This will not be a problem with the first surgeon, who will recognize this as commonplace. Second opinions can reassure anxious patients (and family members) and make the whole process easier for all involved.' "
What is the recovery process after this procedure?,'Procedures vary in terms of ''wound'' recovery time and length of rehabilitation programs. It is very important for patients to know the long-term program ahead of time for the best planning. Will ''pain'' control medications be necessary? How long will it be until you can resume normal functioning? When can you return to work and recreational activities?' 
Is this procedure covered by my insurance plan?,"""Will physician's fees, associated costs, hospital services, rehabilitation programs, and pain medications be covered by my insurance plan?

What Is Bowel Diversion Surgery?,"'Bowel diversion surgery allows ''stool'' to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the ''large intestine'' is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any part of the small or ''large intestine''.''Some bowel diversion surgeries (those called ostomy surgery)divert the bowel to an opening in the abdomen where a ''stoma'"" is created. A surgeon forms a stoma by rolling the bowel's end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. An ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect ""'stool''.''Other bowel diversion surgeries reconfigure the ''intestines'' after damaged portions are removed. For example, after removing the colon, a surgeon can create a colon like pouch out of the last part of the small intestine, avoiding the need for an ostomy pouch.''Cancer'', ''trauma'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''), bowel obstruction, and ''diverticulitis'' are all possible reasons for bowel diversion surgery.''' "
Which Parts of the Gastrointestinal Tract Are Affected by Bowel Diversion Surgeries?,"'Bowel diversion surgeries affect the large intestine and often the small intestine.''Small Intestine''''The small intestine runs from the stomach to the large intestine and has three main sections: the duodenum, which is the first 10 inches; the jejunum, which is the middle 8 ''feet''; and the ileum, which is the final 12 ''feet''. Bowel diversion surgeries only affect the ileum.''''\xa0''Large Intestine''''The large intestine is about 5 feet long and runs from the small intestine to the anus. The colon and rectum are the two main sections of the large intestine. Semisolid digestive waste enters the colon from the small intestine. Gradually, the colon absorbs moisture and forms stool as digestive waste moves toward the rectum. The rectum is about 6 inches long and is located right before the anus. The rectum stores stool, which leaves the body through the anus. The rectum and anus control bowel movements.' "
What are the different types of bowel diversion surgery?,"'Several surgical options exist for bowel diversion.''Some people only need a temporary bowel diversion; others need permanent bowel diversion.' Ileostomy diverts the ileum to a stoma. Semisolid waste flows out of the stoma and collects in an ostomy pouch, which must be emptied several times a day. An ileostomy bypasses the colon, rectum, and anus and has the fewest complications. Colostomy is similar to an ileostomy, but the colon (not the ileum)is diverted to a stoma. As with an ileostomy, stool collects in an ostomy pouch. Ileoanal reservoir surgery is an option when the large intestine is removed but the anus remains intact and disease-free. The surgeon creates a colonlike pouch, called an ileoanal reservoir, from the last several inches of the ileum. The ileoanal reservoir is also called a pelvic pouch or J-pouch. Stool collects in the ileoanal reservoir and then exits the body through the anus during a bowel movement. People who have undergone ileoanal reservoir surgery initially have about six to 10 bowel movements a day. Two or more surgeries are usually required, including a temporary ileostomy, and an adjustment period lasting several months is needed for the newly formed ileoanal reservoir to stretch and adjust to its new function. After the adjustment period, bowel movements decrease to as few as 4 to 6 a day. Continent ileostomy is an option for people who are not good candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery because of damage to the rectum or anus but do not want to wear an ostomy pouch. As with ileoanal reservoir surgery, the large intestine is removed and a colon-like pouch, called a Kock pouch, is made from the end of the ileum. The surgeon connects the Kock pouch to a stoma. A Kock pouch must be drained each day by inserting a tube through the stoma. An ostomy pouch is not needed and the stoma is covered by a patch when it is not in use."
Which bowel diversion surgery is appropriate?,"'The type, degree, and location of bowel damage, and personal preference, are all factors in determining which surgery is most appropriate. For example, people whose disease affects the ileum are poor candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery or continent ileostomy because of the increased risk of disease recurrence and the need for pouch removal.''Discussing treatment options with a doctor and seeking the advice of an ostomy nursea (specialist who cares for people with bowel diversions)are highly recommended.' "
Concerns Related to Bowel Diversion,"'Although bowel diversion surgery can bring great relief, many people fear the practical, social, and psychological issues related to bowel diversion. An ostomy nurse is trained to help patients deal with these issues both before and after surgery. People living with an ostomy or who need bowel diversion surgery may also find useful advice and information through local or online support groups.' "
Bowel Diversion Surgery at A Glance," Bowel diversion surgery allows stool to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the large intestine is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any portion of the small or large intestine. The type, degree, and location of bowel damage, and personal preference, are all factors in determining which bowel diversion surgery is most appropriate. An ostomy nurse can help patients deal with the practical, social, and psychological issues related to bowel diversion."
Hope through Research,"'The National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases conducts and supports basic and clinical research into many digestive disorders, including ''inflammatory bowel disease'' and ''diverticular disease''.''Participants in ''clinical trials'' can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research.

Lap band (gastric banding) introduction,"'Obesity'' is a growing concern. By medical standards, ''obesity'' is defined as having a ''body mass index'' (''BMI'') of over 30 kg/m2. While lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone for treatment, surgical options are becoming more popular. One of the surgical treatments for obesity is called gastric banding, commonly known as lap-band surgery. Some of the specifics of gastric banding will be addressed in this article.' "
What is gastric banding?,"'Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of an adjustable belt around the upper portion of the stomach using a laparascope. The band is made of silicone and can be tightened by adding saline to fill the band (like blowing air into a doughnut-shaped balloon). The band is connected to a port that is placed under the skin of the abdomen. This port is used to introduce or remove saline into the band.''LAGB ultimately restricts the size of the stomach and the amount of food it can hold. It also slows the passage of food to the intestine. By doing so, signals to the brain from the gut allow for a sensation of fullness and satiety with the consumption of less food. This signal is sent from a small pouch created by the band in the upper stomach. When the pouch fills, the same signal is sent to the brain that occurred previously when the entire stomach filled.' "
What is a lap band?,"'The LAP BAND® is a specific device brand name and is made by Allergan Inc. The term is often used in the lay community interchangeable with gastric banding (similar to the way we interchange the brand name Kleenex for facial tissue). There are different sizes and models of the LAP BAND. There are also other companies that make gastric banding devices such as the REALIZE® adjustable gastric band (by Ethicon), the MIDBAND®, and the Heliogast® gastric band (which are not available in the US).' "
Who are candidates for the lap band system?,"'Generally, candidates for LAGB have a body mass index over 40 kg/m2, or are more than 45 kilograms over their ideal body weight. LAGB can be performed on a person with a ''BMI'' of 35-40 kg/m2 if there are problematic medical conditions that are weight-related, such as ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'') or ''diabetes''.''Most surgeons and programs will want to note a history of failed ''weight loss'' in the past using more conventional approaches. The procedure is indicated for adults only, and is not to be performed on those less than 18 years old. All patients must demonstrate an understanding of the procedure, and be willing to adhere to the lifestyle changes that are needed to make this procedure successful. Most large centers have a psychological assessment to assure that this last criteria is met.''LAGB is usually contraindicated if the potential patient has difficulty understanding the procedure, is emotionally unstable, or is dependent on ''drugs'' or ''alcohol''. Those potential cases with a history of gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers need to be reviewed carefully. Similarly, those that have underlying medical conditions that make them high risk for surgery- such as ''heart'' or lung conditions- may be refused the procedure. Associated with these risks is a BMI of greater than 50kg/m2. In this group, there may be a request to ''lose weight'' prior to the procedure (although this seems paradoxical). Again, the risks of the procedure in this subgroup of ''obese'' patients may outweigh the benefits of surgery. By dropping the BMI under 50 kg.m2, outcomes may be better.''While there is growing discussion about offering LAGB to those with a BMI of 30-35 who have ''diabetes'', there are no current guidelines for this.' "
How is the lap band (LAGB) procedure performed?,"'Lap band or LAGB is a surgical procedure done under full general anesthesia and takes about 1 to 2 hours to perform. It is done using a laparoscopic technique. This involves making 3 to 5 small incisions, each about 1 inch in length. The surgeon inserts a small camera attached to a tube into one of these incisions and views the procedure on a screen. The other incisions allow for the use of surgical instruments and placement of the band. The gastric band is placed around the upper part of the stomach and set into position with ''sutures''. The port is then placed in the wall of the abdomen and sutured in place.' "
How do I prepare for lap band surgery?,"'Depending on the surgeon or the program, the preparation for surgery will vary. Many centers like to see a commitment from the patient to the necessary lifestyle changes even before surgery. It may be suggested that the patient start eating 5 to 6 small meals a day to prepare for the changes ahead. It may be recommended to wean off ""slippery"" high calorie foods such as ice cream or milk shakes (since these will continue to be easily absorbed after the procedure).''If the BMI is greater than 50, or if there are other medical issues, medical risk reduction may be needed preoperatively and should be discussed in detail. In addition, a ''weight loss'' of 5% to 10% prior to surgery has been shown to improved post operative outcomes, and may be a goal that your surgeon or preoperative care team will discuss with you.' "
How long is the recovery after lap band surgery?,"'Recovery varies with each individual. However, in general, LAGB offers a shorter hospitalization and quicker recovery than gastric bypass procedures. In general, most people can return to work 1 week after surgery (if their job is not too physically demanding). Normal activity can usually resume after 6 weeks.' "
What is a lap band fill?,"'A lap band ""fill"" is the common term for gastric band adjustments. Once surgery is performed, there is a period of healing that must take place before the first adjustment. Usually, the first fill takes place around 6 to 8 weeks. It involves injecting saline into the port just under the skin which is connected to the band. Prior to this, there may be little change in appetite. Fills are painless and are usually performed by the surgeon who performed the procedure. These adjustments may take place to enhance ''weight loss'', especially if there is a plateau phase in ''weight loss'', and they may to performed to overcome side effects such as ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' (in this latter case, the band is loosened).' "
What can I expect my lifestyle to be after lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'Immediately after surgery, there will be some ''pain'' and discomfort that can be controlled with medications. This is part of the normal recovery phase after any surgical procedure. After 6 to 8 weeks, one can generally return to normal activities. ''Weight loss'' with LAGB is a gradual process. Initially, the ''weight loss'' may be more dramatic- say 2 to 3 pounds per week. However, this generally slows to a pound or so weekly over the long-term. Naturally, the food choices made will govern this weight loss rate. After about 18 months, the weight loss tends to slow significantly. The average weight loss for this procedure is 40% of excess body weight in the first year, with an additional 10% to 20% in the second year. Patients are usually asked to keep in contact with their surgeon regularly during this time period as further band adjustments may be needed. ' "
What are the side effects of lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'Side effects include ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ulceration at the band site, ''esophageal reflux'' (''indigestion''), weight regain, and ''dehydration''. Since this type of surgery is restrictive and does not cause malabsorption of nutrients, vitamin deficiencies are not usually seen. However, many centers recommend multivitamin supplementation. ''Constipation'' is commonly encountered.' "
What are the risks and complications of lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'LAGB has a low risk of surgical complications compared to other weight reduction procedures. The mortality (death) rate is about 1 in 2000. There is the possibility of the band slipping or eroding into the stomach and of mechanical malfunction. Other complications may include infection, bleeding, and/or ''abdominal pain''. ' "
What type of surgeon performs lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'When choosing a surgeon, it is important to search for one who is a qualified bariatric surgeon. In general, practice makes perfect, and the more surgeries performed the better. A surgeon performing 100 or more procedures annually is likely going to have better outcomes. A surgeon who is part of a clinical team of nutritionists, nurses, psychologists, and physicians in general can provide better counseling and support in the pre- and postoperative period. ' "

What is endoscopic sinus surgery? Is it painful?,"'Traditional sinus surgery involves the precise removal of diseased and/or obstructing sinus tissue (nasal obstruction removal) with improvement in the natural drainage channels by the creation of a pathway for infected material to drain from the sinus ''cavities''. In most situations, the surgeon will employ endoscopic techniques that allow better and more precise visualization without the need for external incisions. As a result, there is less swelling, bleeding, and discomfort, and a faster recovery from sinus surgery. However, you should expect some nasal and sinus pressure and pain for several days after surgery. Endoscopic sinus surgery may have additional terms such as ""functional"" and ""bilateral"" attached -- functional means the surgery aims to return sinuses to normal while bilateral means that both right and left sinuses are involved.  ''Sinus surgery, unlike other types of surgery where a diseased part or organ is removed, involves the re-routing of existing sinus pathways in addition to removal of diseased tissue. ''It cannot be emphasized more strongly that post-operative care is as equally important as the surgery itself.'' One of the most common causes of failure of this procedure is poor post-operative care and follow-up. The doctor can only do so much. It is up to the patient to share in the responsibility of caring for this chronic illness. The following instructions are designed to help patients recover from sinus surgery as easily as possible and to prevent complications. It is very important that patients read these instructions or those provided by their surgeon and follow them carefully.''This information is provided to help people prepare for sinus surgery and to help them understand more clearly the associated beliefs, risks, and complications of sinus surgery. However, ask your doctor if you have questions to help you better understand the procedure.'  "
What do the sinuses look like (pictures)?, 
"What are the risks, side effects, and complications of sinus surgery?","""The following complications and risks of sinus surgery have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is here for patient information only - not to make patients overly concerned - but to make them aware and more knowledgeable concerning potential aspects of sinus surgery. The surgeon will review the risks and benefits of the surgery when obtaining consent for the operation and will be able to discuss the chance of these complications with respect to an individual's potential risks of surgery at that time."" Failure to resolve the sinus infections or recurrence of sinus problems and/or polyps. Bleeding. In very rare situations, a need for blood products or a blood transfusion may be required. Patients have the right, should they choose, to have autologous (using their own stored blood) or designated donor blood prepared in advance in case an emergency transfusion is necessary. Patients are encouraged to consult with their doctor regarding these issues if they are interested. 
	Chronic nasal drainage with excessive dryness or crusting of the nose (empty 
	nose syndrome). Need for further and more aggressive surgery. Need for allergy evaluation, treatments, or environmental controls. Surgery is not a cure for or a substitute for good allergy control or treatment. Failure to improve or resolve concurrent respiratory illness such as, but not limited to, asthma, bronchitis, or cough. Failure to resolve associated ""sinus or nasal"" headaches. The exact cause of headaches can be difficult to determine and may have many different causes that are not sinus-related. The patient or physician may require consultation with another specialist such as a neurologist. Damage to the eye and its associated structures. 
	Damage to the skull base with resultant meningitis, brain abscess, or 
	leakage of spinal fluid Secondary atrophic rhinitis Permanent numbness of the upper teeth, palate, or face. Nasal obstruction due to failure to control infection or polyps. Prolonged pain, impaired healing, and the need for hospitalization. Failure to restore or worsening of the sense of smell or taste."
What is empty nose syndrome?,"'Empty nose syndrome is a condition that may occur after facial ''trauma'' and/or sinus surgery (for example, ''septoplasty'', turbinate reduction or removal) that results in a sensation of being unable to breathe and/or having nasal blockage. The nose appears dry and crusty but drains constantly. The upper nasal mucosa swells and produces ''mucus'', but the turbinates function poorly to warm and humidify the air, if at all, resulting in a dry lower nose that drips constantly from the swollen upper nasal mucosa, often into the throat.' "
How do you prepare for sinus surgery? What happens before surgery?,"""In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either the hospital or a surgical center (surgicenter). In both facilities, quality care can be provided without the inconvenience of an overnight stay. An anesthesiologist will review the patient's medical history before surgery, and will monitor anesthesia of the patient throughout the procedure. If the doctor has ordered pre-operative laboratory studies, the patient should arrange to have these done several days in advance, and bring all lab results to the hospital the day of surgery for review.""'Arrange for someone to spend the first night after surgery with the patient, if possible in case the patient needs to remain overnight.''After surgery, the doctor will usually advise the patient to start using saline irrigation. There are many different ways to irrigate the sinuses; depending on the surgery that was performed, the surgeon will advise the patient on the best method for this to be done.''In general, patients that have sinus surgery should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days prior to the date of surgery. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''Advil'') should not be taken within 7 days of the date of surgery. Many ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or Advil-like ''drugs''. Therefore, it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question, call the doctors that prescribed the medications (surgeon, primary care physician, cardiologist or other specialists) or consult your pharmacist. Depending on the planned surgery, the surgeon may have the patient refrain from such medications for a longer period. ''Acetaminophen'' (Tylenol) is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Usually the surgeon will give prescriptions for post-surgery pain medications at the preoperative visit. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of surgery.''In most pre-operative preparations, patients must not eat or drink anything 8 hours prior to the time of surgery; the surgeon or hospital/surgical center will let the patient know the specific details regarding what time to stop eating and drinking. This includes even water, candy, or chewing gum. ''Smokers'' should make every effort to stop ''smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes as much in advance of surgery as possible. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding.''If a person is sick or has a fever the day before surgery, they should inform the surgeon. If a patient wakes up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. The surgeon and the anesthesiologist will decide if it is safe to proceed with surgery.' "
What happens on the day of sinus surgery?," It is important that patients know precisely what time they are to check-in with the surgical facility, and that they allow sufficient preparation time. Bring all papers and forms, including any preoperative orders and history sheets. Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes that do not have to be pulled over their head. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home, including earrings, watches, rings, etc. Remove all make-up with a cleansing cream. Patients should thoroughly wash their face with soap and water. Do not apply make-up or cream to the face. If possible, avoid using hair clips or other materials to hold up hair. Do not take any medication unless instructed by the doctor or the anesthesiologist. Usually, in the pre-operative holding room, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) and the patient may be given a medication to help them relax."
What happens during the sinus surgery procedure?,"'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a ''gas'' and an intravenous medication to put the patient to ''sleep'' and to maintain anesthesia at a safe and comfortable level. During the procedure, the patient will be continuously monitored. The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room. The whole procedure usually takes several hours. The surgeon will come to the waiting room to talk with any family or friends once the patient is safely in the recovery room.' "
What happens after sinus surgery (pictures)?,"""After surgery, the patient will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor the patient's vital signs. Usually, patients will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once they have fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. Patients will need a friend or family member to pick them up from the surgical facility. Someone (a responsible adult) should spend the first night after surgery with the patient in case any post-surgical problems develop.""'On arrival at home from the surgical facility, the patient should go to bed and rest with their head elevated on two to three pillows. By keeping the head elevated above the ''heart'', ''edema'' and swelling from the sinus surgery can be minimized. Patients may get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom but should avoid straining with bowel movements because this may cause some surgical site bleeding. If the person is constipated, they should take a ''stool softener'' or a gentle ''laxative''.''Some patients may have noticeable swelling of the nose, upper lip, cheeks, or around the eyes for several days after surgery. This swelling is normal and will gradually go away. People can help reduce it by putting an ice pack on the face, ''bridge'' of the nose, and eyes as much as tolerated. This will also help with postoperative edema and pain. Some patients have found frozen vegetables in packages (for example ''bags'' of frozen peas) to be a convenient ice pack which nicely conforms to the face. The frozen material should be separated from the skin by a towel or similar barrier to avoid any skin damage. Many clinicians suggest periods of 15 minutes of such ice-pack treatment followed by 15 minutes of removal to not damage the skin.''Moderate bleeding from the nose is normal and will gradually decrease. The gauze dressing (""mustache dressing"") will collect blood and should be changed as needed. It is not unusual to change these dressings every hour during the first 24 hours after surgery. It is recommended to purchase gauze pads prior to surgery so that the patient will have enough for dressing changes. After a few days the patient will probably not need to use the dressing any longer. Do not take aspirin, aspirin-containing medications, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen''/Advil, ''Naprosyn'', and others) for as long as the surgeon has instructed following surgery, because such medications may increase bleeding and slow clotting at the surgical site.''It is best to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated once the patient has recovered fully from the anesthetic. Avoid hot liquids for several days. Even though people may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to go slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, patients may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery. If ''vomiting'' persists, please contact the surgeon; the doctor may prescribe medication to reduce or eliminate vomiting. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''Patients may be prescribed antibiotics after surgery and should finish all the pills that have been ordered. Some form of a narcotic may also be prescribed and is to be taken as needed for pain. If the patient requires narcotics, they should not drive and should consider having a responsible person stay with them. In some situations, the doctor may give steroids to be taken either before and or after surgery. Take this medication as prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. The steroids are instrumental in facilitating proper healing. If patients have any questions or they feel that they are developing a reaction to any of these medications, he or she should consult their doctor immediately. Patients should not take any other medication, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless they have discussed it with the doctor.' "
How long does it take to recovery from sinus surgery?,"'How long it takes for recovery depends on the extent of the surgery. Recovery may take a few days. It may take up to 3 to 5 days to feel completely back to normal. Patients should refrain from activities that increase heart rate or ''blood pressure'' such as ''running'', exercising, ''weight lifting'', or other similar activities. It is imperative to obtain guidance from the surgeon as to when they may resume all normal activities. Until this time, patients should rest and limit physical exertion to improve recovery.'  "
What are the general instructions and follow-up care after sinus surgery?,"""In many cases, packs or nasal packing is placed in the nose to control postoperative bleeding. The surgeon will tell the patient when to return to the office to have these packs removed. Patients may need to call the office to schedule this postoperative appointment. Please arrange for someone to drive the patient to and from the office for this first visit in case any complications (for example, additional bleeding) develop. Patients should eat a light meal before coming and avoid taking excessive pain medications. In addition, most patients will also have several subsequent office visits scheduled to assess healing, remove crusts, and insure a speedy recovery. These visits are very important as the surgeon may use the endoscope (camera to look in the nose) to clean up the sinuses and perform further debridement if necessary. This post-operative surveillance by the surgeon is very crucial in the individual's long-term success with the surgery.""""After the packing has been removed, individuals may breathe through their nose, but should not blow or sneeze through it for 7 to 10 days to reduce the chance of bleeding. If a person must sneeze, they should try to sneeze through an open mouth. Many surgeons tell patients to expect some light blood-tinged drainage from the nose for several days. If bleeding becomes excessive, apply an ice pack (described previously) and rest quietly with head elevated while applying mild to moderate pressure to the nose. If bleeding continues, call the doctor's office.""'One of the most important things patients can do after surgery (post-op care) is nasal irrigation. Immediately after the nasal packs are removed patients should use a saline nasal spray such as ""Ocean Spray"" several times per day to prevent crusting and nasal dryness from forming in the nose. The surgeon will tell patients when to discontinue the nasal spray and will let them know the best way to irrigate the sinuses.''Patients should go back to work or school only when the doctor says you can and should plan on resting for several days following surgery. Avoid excessive talking, smiling, hard chewing, strenuous activities, and lifting heavy objects, bumping the nose, and bending over. Try not to rest ''eyeglasses'' on the bridge of the nose until soreness and swelling subside. People may wear ''contact lenses'' once eye swelling and any eye irritation has resolved. Alcohol and tobacco should be avoided because they may prolong swelling and healing. Smoke, dust, and fumes may irritate the nose and cause an infection. In general, people may use usual make-up any time after surgery, as long as the structures (for example, eyelids) with make-up are relatively normal and are not irritated by the application of make-up. Be gentle while brushing the upper ''teeth''. They will often be tender for several weeks, and some people may have some numbness of the teeth and palate for several months.''Patients should plan to remain in the general area where the surgery was performed for 3 weeks to allow for postoperative care and in case bleeding occurs, the patient can be seen by the surgeon that did the procedure and who should best be able to treat the patient.' "
What natural home remedies should you use after sinus surgery?,"'It is important for all patients with chronic sinus disease to understand that they have a chronic illness. Successful sinus surgery will only help control the complications and discomfort of chronic sinus disease. The following three areas of prevention should always be remembered:' Maximize 
	moisture. Patients should always remember to maximize moisture in their nose. Keeping sinuses moist makes mucus thinner, allowing the sinuses to drain better. This drainage in turn helps prevent infection. Use a humidifier, drink plenty of water, avoid drying substances such as alcohol and caffeine, try to avoid smoke, which dries out sinus linings, and use plenty of saline irrigation. Avoid 
	allergy particles (allergens). People may want to wear a mask when they clean or are exposed to dust. Sit in the non-smoking sections of restaurants. Avoid exposure to pollens during peak season and keep an air-conditioner on during allergy season. Prevent 
	colds. Avoid exposure to colds and flu whenever possible; obtain a yearly flu vaccination."
When should you call your surgeon for complications following endoscopic sinus surgery?," A sudden increase in the amount of bleeding from the nose unrelieved by pressure, ice, and head elevation. A fever greater than 101.5 F (38.6 C) that persists despite increasing the amount of fluid intake and acetaminophen (Tylenol) use. Persistent sharp pain or headache that is not relieved by the prescribed pain medication. Increased swelling or redness of the nose or eyes. Drainage of a thin, clear fluid in large quantities from usually only one side of the nose. This would be different from the clear, thicker mucus drainage normally produced by the nose."
What Is Ulcerative Colitis?,"'Ulcerative colitis'' is a chronic (long-term) inflammatory disease. It affects the lining of the ''large intestine'', or colon, and rectum. The rectum is the last section of the colon and is located just above the anus. People with ''ulcerative colitis'' have tiny ulcers and abscesses in their colon and rectum. These flare up periodically and cause bloody stools and ''diarrhea''. ''Ulcerative colitis'' may also cause severe ''abdominal pain'' and ''anemia''. ''Anemia'' is marked by low levels of healthy ''red blood cells''.''Ulcerative ''colitis'' has alternating periods of flare-ups and remission. During remission the disease seems to have disappeared. The periods of remission can last from weeks to years.''The inflammation usually begins in the rectum. It then spreads to other segments of the colon. How much of the colon is affected varies from person to person. If the inflammation is limited to the rectum, the disease is called ulcerative proctitis.' "
"How Is Ulcerative Colitis Diagnosed?
","'Ulcerative colitis'' closely resembles '""Crohn's disease"""". Crohn's is another ""'inflammatory bowel disease''. Often the only thing that distinguishes ''ulcerative colitis'"" is that it affects only the colon. Crohn's may affect any part of the ""'digestive system'', including the mouth. '""Crohn's disease""' also is particularly destructive to the small intestine, known as the ileum.''A doctor may order several different types of tests when considering ''ulcerative colitis'' as a diagnosis. These include:' Blood tests Stool sample tests Imaging tests, such as a CT scan Colonoscopy Sigmoidoscopy 
	Pill camera"
"How Common Is Surgery for Ulcerative Colitis?
","'About 25% to 40% of people with ulcerative ''colitis'' will have to have surgery to remove their colons. The reasons that surgery becomes necessary include:''In some cases, surgery to remove the colon is recommended if other treatments do not work or if the side effects of medications are harming the patient.' Medical treatment -- for instance, drug therapy -- fails to provide results. There may be a risk of cancer without surgery. The colon has ruptured. The patient experiences a severe, sudden onset of the disease. There is extensive bleeding. Treatment causes side effects severe enough to compromise the patient's health. Toxic megacolon has set in. In this dangerous condition, the muscles of the large intestine are dilated, and the colon can rupture."
What Types of Surgery Can Treat Ulcerative Colitis?,"'Surgery to remove the entire colon is called a colectomy. Surgery to remove both the colon and rectum is a proctocolectomy. Both can be used to treat ulcerative colitis. These surgeries are also performed to eliminate the threat of ''colon cancer''. Colon ''cancer'' is common in people with ulcerative colitis. Proctocolectomy is considered the standard treatment when surgery for ulcerative colitis is needed.''If the entire colon is removed, the surgeon may create an opening, or ''stoma'', in the abdominal wall. The tip of the lower small intestine is brought through the stoma. An external bag, or pouch, is attached to the stoma. This is called a permanent ileostomy. Stools pass through this opening and collect in the pouch. The pouch must be worn at all times.''Another procedure is the pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). This is a procedure that does not require a permanent stoma. This surgery is also called a restorative proctocolectomy. The patient is still able to eliminate ''stool'' through the anus. In this procedure, the colon and rectum are removed. Then the small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir -- called a J-pouch -- that will serve as a new rectum. This pouch is connected to the anus. This procedure is frequently done in two operations. In between the operations the patient needs a temporary ileostomy.''The ''continent ileostomy'"", or Kock pouch, is an option for people who would like their ileostomy converted to an internal pouch. It's also an option for people who do not qualify for the IPAA procedure. In this procedure, there is a stoma but no bag. The colon and rectum are removed, and an internal reservoir is created from the small intestine. An opening is made in the abdominal wall, and the reservoir is then joined to the skin with a ""'nipple'"" valve. To drain the pouch, the patient inserts a catheter through the valve into the internal reservoir. This procedure, however, is not the preferred surgical treatment for ulcerative patients. That's because of its uncertain results and the potential need for additional surgery."" "
What Are the Benefits of Ulcerative Colitis Surgeries?,"'If the entire colon is removed, ulcerative colitis is cured. This should put an end to the ''diarrhea'', ''abdominal pains'', ''anemia'', and other symptoms.''In addition, the surgical procedures prevent colon ''cancer''. Overall, an estimated 5% of ulcerative colitis patients will develop ''cancer''. The elimination of the ''colon cancer'' threat is especially significant for people who have ulcerative colitis that affects the entire colon. In these cases, as opposed to cases of ulcerative colitis that affects only the lower colon and the rectum, the ''cancer'' risk without surgery could be up to 32 times the normal rate.' "
"What Are the Complications of Ulcerative Colitis Surgeries?
","'Complications from ileoanal anastomosis may include:''WebMD Medical Reference' More frequent and more watery bowel movements Inflammation of the pouch (pouchitis) Blockage of the intestine (bowel obstruction) from internal scar tissue, called 
	adhesions, caused by surgery Pouch failure, which happens in about 8% to 10% of patients with IPAA If the pouch fails, the patient will need to have a permanent ileostomy."
What Is Epilepsy Surgery?,"'Most people with ''epilepsy'' can control their ''seizures'"" with medication. But they aren't effective for about 30% of patients. In some cases, brain surgery may be an option.""'Epilepsy'' surgery is an operation on the brain to control ''seizures'"" and improve the person's quality of life. There are two main types of ""'epilepsy'' surgery:''Surgery is considered only if the area of the brain where the seizures start, called the ''seizure'' focus, can be clearly identified, and if the area to be removed is not responsible for any critical functions, such as language, sensation and movement. Extensive evaluation and testing are necessary to determine if surgery is appropriate.' Surgery to remove the area of the brain producing seizures. Surgery to interrupt the nerve pathways through which seizure impulses spread within the brain."
Who Is a Candidate for Epilepsy Surgery?,"""Surgery may be an option for people with epilepsy whose seizures are disabling and/or are not controlled by medication, or when the side effects of medication are severe and greatly affect the person's quality of life. Patients with other serious medical problems, such as ""'cancer'' or ''heart disease'', usually are not considered for epilepsy surgery.' "
What Surgical Options Are Available?,"'Different surgical procedures are available to treat epilepsy. The type of surgery used depends on the type of seizures and the area of the brain where the seizures start. The surgical options include:' Lobe resection: The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections, called lobes -- the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in which the seizure focus is located within the temporal lobe, is the most common type of epilepsy in teens and adults. In a temporal lobe resection, brain tissue in the temporal lobe is resected, or cut away, to remove the seizure focus. The anterior (front) and mesial (deep middle) portions of the temporal lobe are the areas most often involved. Extratemporal resection involves removing brain tissue from areas outside of the temporal lobe. Lesionectomy: This is surgery to remove isolated brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect such as a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that are responsible for seizure activity. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed. 
 Corpus callosotomy: The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the two halves (hemispheres) of the brain. A corpus callosotomy is an operation in which all or part of this structure is cut, disabling communication between the hemispheres and preventing the spread of seizures from one side of the brain to the other. This procedure, sometimes called split-brain surgery, is for patients with extreme forms of uncontrollable epilepsy who have intense seizures that can lead to violent falls and potentially serious injury. Functional hemispherectomy: This is a variation of a hemispherectomy, a radical procedure in which one entire hemisphere, or one half of the brain, is removed. With a functional hemispherectomy, one hemisphere is disconnected from the rest of the brain, but only a limited area of brain tissue is removed. This surgery generally is limited to children younger than 13 years old who have one hemisphere that is not functioning normally. Multiple subpial transection (MST): This procedure is used to help control seizures that begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (transections) in the brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the movement of seizure impulses but do not disturb normal brain activity, leaving the person's abilities intact."
How Effective Is Epilepsy Surgery?,"'The effectiveness varies, depending on the type of surgery. Some people are completely free of seizures after surgery. For others, the frequency of seizures is significantly reduced. In some cases, surgery may not be successful and a second surgery (re-operation) may be recommended. Most patients will need to continue taking anti-seizure medication for a year or more after surgery. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
What Are the Risks of Epilepsy Surgery?,"'The risks of epilepsy surgery include:' Risks associated with surgery: These include infection and bleeding, as well as the risk of an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. Risk of neurological deficits: Surgery can worsen existing problems or create new problems with the way the brain functions. Neurological deficits include loss of functions such as vision, speech, memory or movement. Risk of surgery failure: Even with careful pre-surgical evaluation, surgery may not eliminate or reduce seizures. Before undergoing surgery your doctor will discuss the potential risks and benefits of the procedure. Before undergoing surgery your doctor will discuss the potential risks and benefits of the procedure."
Re-operations,"'In some cases, isolated seizures may occur immediately following surgery. This does not necessarily mean the operation was not successful. Occasionally, a second operation, or re-operation, is needed to remove brain tissue that is later found to be a source of seizure activity.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Introduction to birth control,"'\tThe terminology used to describe ''birth control methods'' include: ''contraception'', ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from an abundance of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of ''birth control'' available\xa0today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.''\tIn simple terms, all methods of ''birth control'"" are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested all the time. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'\tUnfortunately, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Permanent methods of contraception (surgical sterilization),"'\tSterilization is considered a permanent method of contraception. In certain cases, sterilization can be reversed, but the success of this procedure is not guaranteed. For this reason, sterilization is meant for men and women who do not intend to have children in the future.' "
Vasectomy,"'\tA ''vasectomy'' is a form of sterilization of a man. A vasectomy ensures that no sperm will exit from his penis when he ejaculates during sexual intercourse.''\tA vasectomy is usually performed by either a ''urologist'' or a general surgeon. Under local anesthesia, the vas deferens (tubes that carry sperm from the testicles into the urethra, also known as ductus deferens) from each testicle is severed. The open ends are then closed off. A vasectomy can be performed in the clinic and involves making two small openings in the scrotum. After a vasectomy, the man may feel tenderness or ''bruising'' around the incision site.''\tA vasectomy does not interfere with the ability of a man to have an erection or the quantity of his ejaculation fluid. After a man has a vasectomy, another second form of birth control should be used until his ejaculate fluid is found to be free from sperm. This usually takes 10 to 20 ejaculations.''\tVasectomy reversals are possible, but they tend to be expensive and are not guaranteed to be effective. A vasectomy should be considered a permanent form of birth control.''\tA vasectomy does not protect a man or his partner from sexually transmitted infections.' "
Tubal ligation (tubes tied),"'Tubal ligation is also known as ""having one\'s tubes tied,"" or having a ""tubal."" Tubal ligation is for women, and like a vasectomy, should be considered a permanent form of birth control.'""A tubal ligation is performed under general, regional, or local anesthesia and can be performed as an outpatient procedure. The surgeon or OB/GYN\xa0uses one of several procedures in order to access a woman's Fallopian tubes (which run from the top part of her uterus to each ovary). A ""'laparoscopy'' is a procedure in which a small incision is made\xa0just below the navel. A viewing tube (scope) can then be inserted through this incision to view and reach the Fallopian tubes. A minilaparotomy is a small incision in the lower abdomen is sometimes used for tubal ligation as an alternative to a laparoscopic procedure.'""Once the doctor has access to a woman's Fallopian tubes, they are closed off by using a clip, tying and cutting, or cauterizing (burning) the tubes. The procedure takes anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes.""'Side effects of a tubal ligation may include infection, bleeding (hemorrhage), and any effects or complications associated with being under general anesthesia.'""A tubal ligation blocks a woman's Fallopian tubes. As a result of the procedure, about 1 inch of each tube is blocked off. An egg can no longer travel down the tube to the uterus, and sperm cannot make contact with the egg. Tubal ligation should have no effect on a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' or hormone production.'""A woman's tubal ligation can be surgically reversed, usually with more success than in men who have had a vasectomy. About 14% of women in the US seek information about a reversal of tubal ligation.""'A tubal ligation does not protect a woman or her partner from sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or ''STDs''). It is also not an absolute method of birth control because a small percentage of women become ''pregnant'' after a tubal ligation. Pregnancy after tubal ligation is uncommon (occurring in less than 2% of women), and the risk of pregnancy appears to be related to age (younger women have more post-tubal ligation ''pregnancies'') as well as the type of procedure used for the sterilization.' "
Hysteroscopic sterilization,"""\tHysteroscopic sterilization is a nonsurgical form of permanent birth control in which a physician inserts a 4-centimeter (1.6 inch) long metal coil into each one of a woman's two Fallopian tubes via a scope passed through the cervix into the uterus (hysteroscope), and from there into the openings of the Fallopian tubes. Over the next few months, tissue grows over the coil to form a plug that prevents fertilized eggs from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus.""""\tThe procedure takes about 30 minutes, can be done in a doctor's office, and usually requires only a local anesthetic. During a 3-month period after the coils are inserted, women must use other forms of birth control until their physician verifies by an imaging test known as a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) that the Fallopian tubes are completely blocked.""'\tLike tubal ligation, this form of sterilization is permanent (not reversible) and is designed as an alternative to surgical sterilization which requires general anesthesia and an incision. About 6% of women who have the procedure develop side effects, mainly due to improper placement of the coils.''\tThis form of sterilization, like other methods of surgical sterilization, does not protect a woman or her partner from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
Hysterectomy,"'A ''hysterectomy'"" is the surgical removal of a woman's uterus and, depending on her overall health status and the reason for the operation, perhaps her ovaries as well. For practical purposes, no woman who has had a hysterectomy can become pregnant; it is an irreversible method of birth control and absolute sterilization. A laparoscopic hysterectomy (removal of the uterus through tiny incisions in the abdomen through which instruments are placed) is possible when there are no complications and no suspicion of ""'cancer''. A supra-cervical hysterectomy, which spares the cervix and removes the upper part of the uterus, is also a common surgical technique.''If a woman has other chronic medical problems that may be helped by a hysterectomy (such as abnormally excessive menstrual bleeding, ''uterine fibroids'', ''uterine growths''), than this may be an appropriate procedure for her to consider. Otherwise, contraception should be considered a secondary benefit and not a sole reason to have the procedure.' "
What is leukemia?,"'Leukemia is a ''cancer of the blood'' cells and bone marrow. There is an abnormally high production of white bloodless (cells that fight infection and provide immunity), which are unable to mature properly leading to the symptoms in leukemia.''Based on the origin, they can be divided into two broad types, namely, myeloid and lymphoid:''Based on how fast it progresses, it is divided into\xa0acute\xa0and\xa0chronic\xa0leukemia:' Myeloid leukemia (myelogenous leukemia) arises from the myeloid line of the white blood cells. Normal myeloid cells undergo differentiation to form leukocytes. Lymphoid leukemia (lymphoid or lymphoblastic leukemia) arises from the lymphoid line of cells in the bone marrow. Acute leukemia: Most of the abnormal blood cells are immature and don’t function normally. It progresses very quickly. Chronic leukemia: There are some immature cells, but others are normal and function normally. It is slowly progressive."
What are the types of leukemia?,"'Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL):''Acute myeloid leukemia'' (AML):''Chronic lymphocytic leukemia'' (CLL):''Chronic myeloid leukemia'' (CML):''Hairy cell leukemia'' (HCL):''Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS):''A group of closely related diseases in which the bone marrow produces very few healthy, functioning ''red blood cells'', white blood cells, platelets, or any combination of the three.' It progresses rapidly and spreads to other organ systems through the blood. It mostly occurs in children and above the age of 45 years. It is the second most common leukemia in adults and rapidly progressive. It is commonly seen in adults aged over 55-60 years. The myeloid cells mutate, forming defective cells, and prevent the formation of normal, healthy blood cells (white, red, and platelets). It is slow-growing cancer that begins in the lymphocyte cells present in the bone marrow. There is abnormally high multiplication of the lymphocyte cells that are immature and do not function properly.  It is associated with a chromosomal abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The upper part of chromosome 22 breaks off and attaches to the lower part of chromosome 9. The upper part of chromosome 9 attaches to the lower part of chromosome 22. It is a rare subtype of CLL that progresses slowly. The bone marrow produces a high number of B-Cells, a type of white blood cell that fights against infection-causing a decrease in healthy blood cells."
What are the signs and symptoms?,"'Some common signs and symptoms include:' Fever Frequent infections Fatigue Pale skin and nails Nausea and vomiting Body pain Bleeding gums Nosebleeds Prolonged bleeding following injuries and during menstruation  Easy bruising Swollen lymph nodes around the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin Loss of appetite and weight"
How is leukemia treated?,"'Treatment involves one or a combination of the following treatment modalities:' Chemotherapy: Single drug or a combination of different drugs to kill cancer cells.  Radiation therapy: Radiation is used to damage, kill, and inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Bone marrow transplant: Diseased bone marrow is replaced with healthy bone marrow from the patient (autologous transplantation) or a donor (allologous transplantation).  Immunotherapy: They modulate the body’s immune system attacking cancer cells. Treatment of pain, anemia, and infections Nutritional supplementation  Palliative care in untreatable cases: Interdisciplinary medical care to improve quality of life, reduce pain, and suffering. Treatment of side effects of cancer treatment such as nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and inflammation of the skin. Psychological support"
What are the four types of heart valves?,"'The heart is made up of four pumping chambers:'""There are valves between each of the heart's pumping chambers that open and close in coordination with each other. Their action keeps blood flowing forward through the heart. There are four valves in the heart:"" Two atria: Upper chambers of the heart Two ventricles: Lower chambers of the heart Tricuspid valve: Between the right atrium and the right ventricle Pulmonary valve: Between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery Mitral valve: Between the left atrium and the left ventricle Aortic valve: Between the left ventricle and the aorta"
When do you need heart valve replacement surgery?,"'A ''heart valve disease'' develops when the valve becomes either stiff, narrow (stenosis), or leaky (regurgitation). These two disease states of the valve disrupt the flow of blood in and out of the heart.''Heart valve diseases can be present by birth (congenital) or occur as a complication of other health conditions, such as rheumatic ''heart disease''.''Many people who have ''heart valve disease'' may never experience any symptoms. Sometimes, the valve disease is diagnosed when a woman is ''pregnant''. Doctors may still recommend heart valve replacement surgery to prevent the worsening of the heart condition.''With a diseased valve, heart valve replacement surgery becomes an emergency if you experience:' Chest pain Fatigue Dizziness Shortness of breath  Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin) Syncope (sudden loss of consciousness)"
How is a heart valve replacement surgery performed?,"'Heart valve replacement surgery can be performed via any of the two approaches:''The diseased valves may be replaced by any of the artificial valves that include:''Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of the available surgical options as well as of the types of valves.' Open-heart surgery: Traditional method of heart surgery in which a large incision is made in the chest; the heart is stopped for a time so that the surgeon can repair or replace the valve. Minimally invasive heart surgery: These are the newer techniques in which the doctors make smaller incisions over the chest to replace the heart valves. Manufactured mechanical valve: Made up of carbon-coated plastic, the mechanical valve is the most durable type of valve that will usually last for your entire lifetime. Donor’s valve: This is an actual human valve taken from a donor and implanted in your heart (donor valve implantation). It usually lasts for anywhere between 10 to 20 years. Tissue valve: Created from animal valves or tissues, this type of heart valve is expected to stay healthy for 10 to 20 years after the surgery."
What are the risks involved in heart valve replacement surgery?,"'Heart valve replacement surgery is a major surgery that can turn life-threatening at times. The possible risks of this surgery include:' Bleeding during or after the surgery Blood clots that can get lodged in the arteries of Heart (and cause a heart attack) Brain (and cause stroke) Lungs (and causes extreme difficulty in breathing) Infection of the operative wound Infection of lungs, such as pneumonia Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) Malfunctioning of the new (implanted) valve"
What is a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)?,"'A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a type of a battery-operated, mechanical pump that is used in patients with end-stage ''heart failure''. The doctor surgically implants the LVAD, which then helps the main pumping chamber of the heart (''left ventricle'') pumps blood to the rest of the body. LVADs work by pumping blood from the left ventricle (lower part of the heart) and pushing it out the ''aorta'', a blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. In other words, it assists the weakened heart. The pump is implanted inside the body to your heart and is connected to a protected electrical wire that runs outside of the body, which is connected to a power source. LVADs can be used as:''An LVAD restores normal blood flow to a person whose heart has been weakened by\xa0''heart disease''. This relieves symptoms, such as being constantly tired or short of breath, and sometimes, it lets the heart recover to normal function by giving it a chance to rest.' Bridge to transplant therapy: This is a life-saving therapy for patients awaiting a heart transplant. Patients use the LVAD until a heart becomes available. In some cases, the LVAD can restore the failing heart, eliminating the need for a transplant. Destination therapy: Some patients are not candidates for heart transplants. In this case, patients can receive long-term treatment using an LVAD, which can prolong and improve patients' lives."
Who is a candidate for an LVAD?,"'LVADs are for people with heart failure who meet certain criteria. Generally, these are people with advanced heart failure who are considered Class III or IV by the New York Heart Association classification system (see below).''New York Heart Association Classification (Classes III & IV):''LVADs are not appropriate for some people with advanced heart failure if they also have other conditions, such as ''kidney failure'', ''liver disease'', lung disease, or blood clotting disorders.' Class III: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in significant limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable only at rest. Class IV: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in an inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or angina (chest pain) may be present even at rest. Any physical activity causes an increase in discomfort."
What are the risks of an LVAD?,"'As with any surgery, there are risks with having an LVAD implanted. They include:' Infection Internal bleeding Heart failure Mechanical breakdown of the LVAD Stroke Death Respiratory failure Kidney failure"
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of anal cancer?,"'If a doctor suspects that a patient has ''anal cancer'', the examining health care professional will first take a medical history and conduct a physical exam, including both inspection of the anal area and a digital rectal exam in which a gloved finger is inserted through the anus and into the rectum. Next, the anal canal can be examined with an anoscope -- a short, lubricated tube with a light on it. The physician can see and inspect the anus, anal canal, and lower rectum with the anoscope. A proctoscopy exam with a flexible endoscope also may be used with less discomfort. Other types of scopes, both rigid and flexible, examine the lower colon, rectum, and anal regions. Their use is called ''endoscopy''. Endo-anal or endo-rectal ''ultrasound'' (ultrasound probe insertion into the rectum) can detect abnormal rectal structures and the extent of spread.''A diagnosis of ''cancer'' is only definitively made by a physician called a pathologist who analyzes tissue in a laboratory. The tissue is obtained by biopsy, which refers to the technique of removing a piece of the abnormal appearing or suspicious tissue. This is done under direct visualization either with or through an endoscope, or if directly visible, using a type of biopsy needle under local anesthesia.''The pathologist analyzes the tissue and creates a report describing the type of ''cancer'' and its extent within the biopsy specimen.' "
How do health care professionals determine anal cancer staging?,"'Staging defines the extent of the primary cancerous ''tumor'' as well as the presence or absence and extent or spread of the ''cancer'"". This staging classification helps the patient's doctors to decide on the best approach to treatment. Staging also helps to estimate the patient's likelihood of survival or prognosis. Finally, it allows doctors who treat these diseases to more accurately compare the results of treatment using various techniques. Such comparisons require that the doctors treat the same extent of cancer from the outset to make their conclusions valid.""'Staging techniques include direct visualization and measurement of the cancer and imaging techniques which can include standard ''X-rays'' as well as, ultrasound, CAT scan, ''MRI'', and PET scans.''By convention, the stage of the cancer is described using the TNM system as described by the International Union Against Cancer and in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. T describes the extent of the tumor. N denotes the presence, or absence, and extent of ''lymph node'' metastases. M refers to the presence or absence of distant metastases. ''Anal cancer'' stages are as follows:''Consequently, stages can be written in detail as shown in the examples below with the cancer stage increasing in aggressiveness as the stages progress from 0 to IV:' TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed T0: No evidence of primary tumor T1s: Carcinoma in situ (for example, Bowen's disease, high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and anal intraepithelial neoplasia II to III) T1: Tumor less than or equal to 2 cm in greatest dimension T2: Tumor greater than 2 cm but less than 5 cm in greatest dimension T3: Tumor greater than 5 cm in greatest dimension T4: Tumor of any size which invades adjacent organ(s), for example, vagina, urethra, bladder NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed N0: No regional lymph node metastases N1: Metastases present in perirectal lymph node(s) N2: Metastases in unilateral internal iliac and/or inguinal lymph node(s) N3: Metastases in perirectal and inguinal lymph nodes and/or bilateral internal iliac and/or inguinal lymph nodes M0: No distant metastases M1: Distant metastases present 0: T1sN0M0 I: T1N0M0 II: T2N0M0, T3N0M0 IIIA: T13N1M0 IIIB: T4N1M0, any T, N2, or N3M0 IV: Any T, any N, M1"
What types of health care professionals diagnose and treat anal cancer?,"'Anal ''cancers'"" often need a team of health care professionals that collaborate in the treatment of anal cancers.

Why is wound closure important?,"'The ability to close a skin wound is an important surgical skill learned by medical care providers. Whether a fall in the street or a scalpel made the skin injury in an operating room, the decision as to how and when to repair the damage needs to be individualized for each patient and situation.''The skin has many layers from the ''epidermis'' on the outside, to the deeper subcutaneous tissues and the dermis in between. Each of these layers has other sub-layers that help the skin perform its functions. The skin provides a barrier to the outside world and the dangers of infection, environmental hazards and chemicals, and temperature. It contains melanocytes that can darken or tan the skin while protecting the body from ultraviolet ''radiation''. It also plays an important role in temperature and fluid regulation.''Different options exist for repairing lacerated skin and providing a nice cosmetic outcome. There are two important steps that need to occur before the skin is closed.''The purpose of ''wound care'' is not simply to yield a good-looking ''scar''. All wounds will eventually heal over time, although closing the skin edges will make that healing time shorter. The primary purpose of seeking medical care from a health care professional is to get the wound properly cleaned and make certain everything is in good working order beneath the damaged skin.''When a laceration occurs, there are some reasonable ''first aid'' and home care steps to consider. Washing with tap water to clean the wound is always helpful. Studies show that plain tap water is as good as any special fluids used in hospitals for cleaning wounds. Lightly bandage the wound and elevate it if possible.''The amount of blood supplied to different parts of the body varies. A wound on the face, ''scalp'', or hand may bleed profusely while one on the shin or back may not. Bleeding will often stop with direct pressure at the bleeding site and elevation of the injured part of the body.' Exploration: A doctor will need to examine and explore most wounds need to their full depth, looking for dirt and debris that may have entered, and making certain that the anatomic structures beneath the damaged skin are intact and not injured. For example, in a hand or finger laceration, the care provider will want to make certain that the blood vessels, nerves, and tendons beneath the skin have not been cut. This is done both by physical examination of the hand and finger, evaluating their power and motion, blood supply and nerve sensation, and also by looking inside the wound, identifying the tendon and perhaps the artery and nerve bundles to make certain that they are intact. Cleaning: When the skin is broken, the outside world invades the body and may cause infection. Before closing the skin, a doctor must wash out or thoroughly irrigate a wound to prevent the occurrence of an infection. Sometimes, it's necessary to cut out a small amount of dirty tissue (a process called debridement)."
How does the health care professional assess a wound?,"""Lacerations are common injuries treated in physicians' offices, walk-in clinics, and emergency departments. The approach to the injury is often the same. The history taken by the health care provider is very important to decide whether the benefit of repairing the wound outweighs the potential risk of complications. Infection is the most common worrisome complication. The provider will want to know the circumstances of the injury.""'Physical examination is key to making certain that underlying structures are undamaged. This is especially important in the extremities where arteries, nerves, and tendons run beneath the skin. When there is damage to skin over a ''broken bone'', it is called an open ''fracture'', and often patients with such a fracture require surgery and are taken to the operating room so that the wound can be extensively cleaned to prevent ''osteomyelitis'' (an infection of the bone). This same situation may also occur if the laceration goes deep into a joint.''It may be necessary to take ''X-rays'' to look for foreign material that may be imbedded in the laceration. While metal objects are easier to see, it may also be possible to identify nonmetallic foreign objects.''A doctor has many options when it comes to repairing a wound: sutures, staples, glue, Steri-Strips, and Band-Aids. First, the wound needs to be prepared for sewing (or suturing or stitching; the words all describe the same procedure).' Where did the accident occur? Was it washing dishes in the sink, or did it occur in a farm field, cleaning dirty equipment covered in mud? When did it happen? The older the wound, the higher the potential for infection since there is more time for bacteria to invade the wound and begin the infection/inflammation process. Was it due to a fall or other trauma? Is there damage to other parts of the body? Were there unusual circumstances, like an animal bite, or did it occur underwater in a river or lake (both situations posing a high risk for infection)? One can imagine a variety of scenarios that may greatly increase the infection risk. Ideally, the injured area is exposed and cleaned with water, saline (salt water), and/or soap. A health care provider administers a local anesthetic to allow full exploration of the wound, looking for foreign objects or damage to underlying structures. Minimizing the pain in the area allows for better exploration and visualization of the underlying anatomy. A health care provider may wash or irrigate a wound a second time to try to minimize the risk of infection."
How do health care providers choose the type of closure material?,"'The purpose of repairing a wound is to provide good cosmetic results. All wounds will eventually heal by themselves; however, bringing the edges together and without tension will allow for a better result. All lacerations will leave a scar, and a good wound closure will minimize the visibility of that scar.''Since there are many layers of skin, a doctor uses layers of suture to bring those layers together. A deep wound increases the risk of infection, and if only the skin is closed, empty spaces may exist beneath the outer skin layer. Fluid can accumulate within these empty spaces, and stagnant fluid can increase the risk for infection.''For skin sutures, the hope is to cause minimal inflammation so that the scar will form nicely. When a doctor places deep sutures, that suture material gradually disintegrates or dissolves as part of the inflammatory response of the body.''The strength of the suture depends upon the thickness of the suture material. Some suture materials used to repair nerves may be so thin that the surgeon needs a microscope to see the suture and be able to sew. Some suture material is as thick as string. The thinner the suture, the less tension it can tolerate and the more stitches need to be placed closer together, to keep the wound from breaking open as it heals.''Doctors use different types of needles depending upon the situation. The two major kinds are cutting and non-cutting. The cutting needles have a diamond-shaped tip designed to ""cut"" through skin. The non-cutting needle tips are circular and designed for use on deep tissues that do not have the resistance of skin. There are different shapes of the needle curve as well to help guide the needle and the attached suture on its path.''Almost all suture material is preloaded on a needle and does not need to be hand-threaded. The care provider will specify the type of suture, the thickness, and the type of needle when planning to repair a laceration.' "
How do doctors close a wound?,"'Most frequently, the closure of choice for the skin layer repair is a single filament suture, meaning that it is not braided. This non-absorbable suture does not cause irritation and inflammation, minimizing scar formation. The two main choices are nylon and ''polypropylene'"" (Prolene). Doctors may use staples when potential scarring isn't as important. They often use staples to close scalp wounds. Often surgeons who have made a long incision on the abdomen, back, or extremity use staples to close the skin.""'If the laceration follows the crease lines of the body (lines of Langerhans) and is not under ''stress'' or stretch, Steri-Strips or butterfly Band-Aids may be considered. Dermabond or skin glue is another potential option for repairing the skin. For this option, the wound must be superficial and run along the crease lines, not be under ''stress'' or stretch, and not have blood or hair present at the wound site. If a doctor uses Steri-Strips or Dermabond, the principles of wound cleaning and exploration still are important considerations.''In some circumstances, doctors use very thin absorbable sutures to close the skin. A medical professional may use material made of polyglycolic acid (Dexon), polyglactic acid (Vicryl), poliglecaprone (Monocryl), or polydioxanone (PDS II) just beneath the epidermis (subcuticular area) to allow for good skin closure. The decision to use absorbable suture in the skin depends upon the situation and the skill and experience of the provider performing the repair.' "
How do doctors repair wounds to deep tissues?,"'If the laceration requires layered closures in which it will not be possible to remove the sutures, dissolvable suture material may be used. Polyglycolic, polyglactic acid, poliglecaprone, and polyglyconate (Maxon) may be considered. Other materials may include silk or catgut (chromic). Depending upon the type of material and the circumstances, absorbable suture may take from 3 weeks to 3 months to dissolve.' "
What actually happens when a medical professional places stitches?,"""Once a doctor decides to sew or stitch up a wound, a medical professional brings an instrument tray to the patient's side. The tray usually contains the following items:""'The care provider will need to decide the type of suture or thread required, including whether it is absorbable or non-absorbable and its thickness. (The thicker the suture, the higher its tensile strength, and the stronger it is.) Another decision is the size and type of needle; this also affects the size of needle holder required. Tinier needles need smaller instruments to guide them through tissue and skin.''The first step is to clean the wound and inject local anesthetic. Wound exploration and cleansing follows.''How a doctor closes an incision depends upon how the wound was made. A wound created due to a sharp scalpel in the operating room will need less planning for closure than one with a jagged wound edge because of a burst laceration from a fall.''The medical professional needs to bring the skin edges close together with minimal tension. The doctor grasps one side of the wound skin edge with the forceps and brings it near to the other edge. If possible, the doctor passes the needle through both skin edges and by pulling on the suture thread, brings the skin edges together. It is important that there is not too much pulling because the stitch can pull right through the skin.''The skin edges need to be everted, meaning that the undersides of the skin, the layer just below the epidermis, on each side of the laceration need to contact each other. When a health care provider ties and knots the stitch, the edges tend to relax, and the epidermis tends to lay flatter. Without eversion, the scar can cave in and potentially appear ''depressed''.''It is important that a doctor ties the knot with the right amount of tension; too loose and the wound edges separate, widening the scar, but too tight and the skin edges can strangulate and cause damage to the skin surface.''There are different types of stitches, depending upon the situation and the expertise of the care provider. Examples include the following:''Knot tying is very important. The stitch needs to be secure so that it does not unravel and fall out prematurely. The surgical knot really consists of multiple layered knots to prevent the suture from falling out. A doctor needs to tie a knot to make removal easy when the time comes. Tying the knot too tightly results in skin damage from the knot itself.''The equipment used in urgent care or the emergency department to stitch a wound is the same as that found in the operating room. Surgical sutures in the operating room are the same as those used as an outpatient. Those used inside the body for specific purposes may be of different sizes and made of different materials, depending on the tissue they are being used to repair, from arteries and nerves to muscles and bowel and everything in between.''While the surgical incision in the skin is all the patient and family can see, it is the surgical sutures located deep in the body that a doctor really needs to place precisely. Those stitches cannot fail to hold tissue together because a doctor cannot replace them without another surgical procedure.' A needle holder (to grasp the needle and suture material) Forceps (medical tweezers) to help grasp the wound edges Scissors to cut the suture. A syringe with local anesthetic Sponges Cleansing liquids Simple interrupted suture Simple running or continuous suture Purse-string suture Horizontal mattress suture Vertical mattress suture Subcuticular running suture"
When and how do medical professionals remove sutures?,"'The optimal time for suture removal depends upon both the location of the laceration and how much stress one places on the laceration. For example, a knee laceration will require the suture to remain in place longer than on the thigh, since the skin will be stressed each time the knee flexes and extends with ''walking'', sitting, and standing.''Sutures form a loop that surrounds the laceration and when pulled tight cause the wound to close. The body can start to form a scar around the suture itself, and it is important to remember this when deciding the appropriate time to remove the sutures. This scarring tends to occur within 7 to 8 days and can have an appearance resembling crosshatching or railroad tracks.''Follow-up for suture removal on the face usually occurs within 3 to 5 days, since there is such good blood supply in this region and healing occurs more quickly. The goal is to minimize scarring; therefore, the risk of the sutures causing a scar in their own right is balanced against the strength and potential ''weakness'' of the healing laceration. Elsewhere on the body, health care providers may leave sutures in for 7 to 10 days. In some circumstances, in which scarring is not an issue or if there is concern that wound is under mechanical stress (like a laceration over a joint), the sutures may be left in longer.' "
What happens to the site after suture removal?,"'After suture removal, the scar continues to mature over time. For the first 3 months, there will be a raised, red healing ridge at the laceration site. Over the next 2 to 3 months, the ridge will flatten and then will start to weather and lighten. It may take 6 to 8 months or longer before a patient can appreciate the result of the laceration repair.'  "
Are there any special considerations regarding wound repair?,"'People with ''diabetes'' or those with ''peripheral vascular disease'' may have delayed healing and increased risk of infection.''Animal bites are especially prone to infection, and the decision to repair a bite with sutures must balance the risk of infection with the benefit of a better-looking scar. Approximately 50% of dog bites, 80% of cat bites, and 100% of human bites will develop infections.''When the risk of infection is high, the health care provider may choose from different options to allow wound healing. When a health care provider cleanses and dresses a laceration but does not repair it, it will gradually heal on its own. This called healing by secondary intention. (Primary closure describes a wound that is sutured or stitched.)''Another alternative is delayed primary closure, in which a health care provider cleans and dresses a dirty or contaminated wound and then evaluates it in a few days (usually 2 or 3). If the wound is not infected, it might be possible to then suture it closed, as if it is a new injury.' "
What is superior vena cava syndrome?,"'The superior vena cava is a large vein located in the upper chest, which collects blood from the head and arms and delivers it back to the right ''atrium'' of the heart. If this vein is compressed by outside structures, or if a thrombus or clot develops within it, return blood flow to the heart is impeded. When blood flow to the heart is restricted, the increased pressure in the veins of the face and arms causes ''edema'' (fluid buildup) in these areas. This condition is referred to as superior vena cava syndrome.''Because the superior vena cava, like all veins, has a thin wall (there are no muscles in the walls of a vein as compared to the walls of an artery), and because there is little pressure inside the vein, it can be easily compressed by outside structures. The superior vena cava lies next to the upper lobe of the right lung and within the mediastinum [the space that contains the central structures of the chest: the heart, the trachea, the ''esophagus'' and the great vessels (''aorta'', vena cava)]. Abnormalities within any of these structures can cause the compression.' "
What causes superior vena cava syndrome?,"'The most common cause of superior vena cava syndrome is ''cancer''. Primary or metastatic ''cancer'' in the upper lobe of the right lung can compress the superior vena cava. ''Lymphoma'' or other tumors located in the mediastinum can also cause compression of the superior vena cava.''Less often, the superior vena cava can become blocked with a ''blood clot'' from within. As more invasive medical procedures are being performed on patients, this cause of superior vena cava syndrome is being seen more frequently. ''Blood clot'' (thrombus) formation that causes superior vena cava syndrome is a complication of ''pacemaker'' wires,''dialysis'', and other intravenous catheters that are threaded into the superior vena cava.''Historically, and in other parts of the world, infection (''syphilis'' and ''tuberculosis'') is another cause of superior vena cava syndrome. ''Sarcoidosis'' (a disease that results in masses of inflamed tissue) may also cause this syndrome.' "
What are the symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome?,"'Initially, there are few symptoms, however, over time, symptoms of superior vena cava gradually develop. As the compression becomes more severe, the patient may develop shortness of breath and swelling of the arms and face. The symptoms occur because blood cannot return to the heart. ''Without adequate blood return, it is hard for the heart to pump newly oxygenated blood to meet the metabolic needs of the body. If blood cannot return to the heart, it starts to back up and causes swelling of the areas where the backup occurs.''Less common symptoms include:'   dilation of veins on the skin surface as the body tries to establish new circulatory pathways to bypass the blockage, and a blue tinge to the skin (because the backed up blood doesn't have enough oxygen content) cough,  shortness of breath,  chest pain, and hoarseness."
How is superior vena cava syndrome diagnosed?," A plain chest x-ray may show abnormal enlargement of the mediastinum or may reveal a tumor in the lung. Ultrasound may be used to look for blood clots in the arm leading into the chest. Computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the chest is most often used to diagnose superior vena cava syndrome. While it will show the blockage and may show a tumor, it will not necessarily diagnose the type of tumor. If a tumor is the cause of the obstruction, often a surgical procedure will be required to obtain a biopsy (a small piece of tissue), to help make the specific diagnosis as to the type of tumor."
How is superior vena cava syndrome treated?,"'Rarely does superior vena cava syndrome constitute a medical emergency. The ABCs of care are always a priority, insuring that the ''A''irway is well maintained, ''B''reathing is adequate and the ''C''irculation (''blood pressure'' and heart rate) is stable. The patient may feel more comfortable in an upright position. ''Furosemide'' (''Lasix'') is a diuretic that will decrease the volume of fluid within the bloodstream. With less pressure pushing against the obstructed superior vena cava, symptoms may be temporarily relieved.''Treatment needs to be directed to the underlying cause. ''If the cause is a tumor or ''cancer'"", the treatment plan will need to be customized to the patient's condition and desires. Options include ""'radiation'' with or without ''chemotherapy''. Even with aggressive treatment with radiation, only 10 % of ''lung cancer'' patients with this syndrome survived to 30 months. Without any treatment, survival may be less than a month.''Steroids [for example, ''methylprednisolone'' (''Medrol'', ''Depo-Medrol'') or ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred'')], may be considered to decrease the swelling of a tumor pressing on the superior vena cava and help relieve symptoms.''If the cause of superior vena cava syndrome is a blood clot, anticoagulation with (''warfarin'') ''Coumadin'' may be indicated. The use of thrombolytic ''drugs'' [for example, ''alteplase'' (''Activase'', TPA) or TNK] to break up the clot, or placement of a ''stent'' to keep the vein open may also be considered.'""In children, superior vena cava syndrome is most often caused bynon-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The compression of the superior vena cava may be associated with compression of the trachea as well. The trachea (windpipe) in children is relatively narrow, flexible, and soft as compared with an adult. ""'Airway'' obstruction may occur and manifest as:'   difficulty breathing, stridor (high-pitched, abnormal breathing sounds heard when breathing in), and  wheezing."
What is the prognosis for superior vena cava syndrome?,'The outcome and prognosis is dependent upon the underlying cause of the superior vena cava syndrome.' 
What is dysphagia?,"'Dysphagia is the medical term for the symptom of difficulty swallowing, derived from the Latin and Greek words meaning difficulty eating.''Swallowing is a complex action.''Considering its complexity, it is no wonder that swallowing, beginning with the contraction of the upper pharynx, has been ""automated,"" meaning that no thought is required for swallowing once swallowing is initiated. Swallowing is controlled by automatic reflexes that involve nerves within the pharynx and esophagus as well as a swallowing center in the brain that is connected to the pharynx and esophagus by nerves. (A reflex is a mechanism that is used to control many organs. Reflexes require nerves within an organ such as the esophagus to sense what is happening in that organ and to send the information to other nerves in the wall of the organ or outside the organ. The information is processed in these other nerves, and appropriate responses to conditions in the organ are determined. Then, still other nerves send messages from the processing nerves back to the organ to control the function of the organ, for example, the contraction of the muscles of the organ. In the case of swallowing, processing of reflexes primarily occurs in nerves within the wall of the pharynx and esophagus as well as the brain.)''The complexity of swallowing also explains why there are so many causes of dysphagia. Problems can occur with:''The problems may lie within the pharynx or esophagus, for example, with the physical narrowing of the pharynx or esophagus. Dysphagia also may be due to diseases of the muscles or the nerves that control the muscles of the pharynx and esophagus or damage to the swallowing center in the brain. Finally, the pharynx and the upper third of the esophagus contain muscle that is the same as the muscles that we use voluntarily (such as our arm muscles) called skeletal muscle. The lower two-thirds of the esophagus is composed of a different type of muscle known as smooth muscle. Thus, diseases that affect primarily skeletal muscle or smooth muscle in the body can affect the pharynx and esophagus, adding additional possibilities to the causes of dysphagia.''There are two symptoms that are often thought of as problems with swallowing (dysphagia) that probably are not. These symptoms are odynophagia and globus sensation.''Odynophagia means painful swallowing. Sometimes it is not easy for individuals to distinguish between odynophagia and dysphagia. For example, food that sticks in the esophagus often is painful. Is this dysphagia or odynophagia or both? Technically it is dysphagia, but individuals may describe it as painful swallowing (i.e., odynophagia). Moreover, patients with ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') may describe dysphagia when what they really have is odynophagia. The ''pain'' that they feel after swallowing resolves when the inflammation of GERD is treated and disappears and is presumably due to ''pain'' caused by food passing through the inflamed portion of the esophagus.''Odynophagia also may occur with other conditions associated with inflammation of the esophagus, for example, viral and ''fungal infections''. It is important to distinguish between dysphagia and odynophagia because the causes of each may be quite different.''A globus sensation refers to a sensation that there is a lump in the throat. The lump may be present continuously or only when swallowing. The causes of a globus sensation are varied, and frequently no cause is found. Globus sensation has been attributed variously to abnormal function of the nerves or muscles of the pharynx and GERD. The globus sensation usually is described clearly by individuals and infrequently causes ''confusion'' with true dysphagia.'   Food is first chewed well in the mouth and mixed with saliva. The tongue then propels the chewed food into the throat (pharynx). The soft palate elevates to prevent the food from entering the posterior end of the nasal passages, and the upper pharynx contracts, pushing the food (referred to as a bolus) into the lower pharynx. At the same time, the voice box (larynx) is pulled upwards by muscles in the neck, and, as a result, the epiglottis bends downwards. This dual action closes off the opening to the larynx and windpipe (trachea) and prevents passing food from entering the larynx and trachea. The contraction of the muscular pharynx continues as a progressing, circumferential wave into the lower pharynx pushing the food along. A ring of muscle that encircles the upper end of the esophagus, known as the upper esophageal sphincter, relaxes, allowing the wave of contraction to push the food from the lower pharynx on into the esophagus. (When there is no swallow effort, the muscle of the upper sphincter is continuously contracted, closing off the esophagus from the pharynx and preventing anything within the esophagus from regurgitating back up into the pharynx.) The wave of contraction, referred to as a peristaltic wave, progresses from the pharynx down the entire length of the esophagus. Shortly after the bolus enters the upper esophagus, a specialized ring of muscle encircling the lower end of the esophagus where it meets the stomach, known as the lower esophageal sphincter, relaxes so that when the bolus arrives it can pass on into the stomach. (When there is no swallow the muscle of the lower sphincter is continuously contracted, closing off the esophagus from the stomach and preventing contents of the stomach from regurgitating back up into the esophagus.) After the bolus passes, the lower sphincter tightens again to prevent contents of the stomach from regurgitating back up into the esophagus. It remains tight until the next bolus comes along. the conscious initiation of swallowing, propulsion of food into the pharynx, closing of the nasal passages or larynx, opening of the upper or lower esophageal sphincters, physical blockage to the passage of food, and transit of the bolus by peristalsis through the body of the esophagus."
What causes swollowing problems?,"'As discussed previously, there are many causes of dysphagia. For convenience, causes of dysphagia can be classified into two groups;''Causes also can be classified differently into several groups.'   oropharyngeal (meaning that the cause is a problem in the mouth or pharynx) and esophageal."
Physical obstruction of the pharynx or esophagus," Benign and malignant tumors of the pharynx and esophagus. Most commonly these tumors are malignant. Tumors of the tissues surrounding the pharynx and esophagus. These tumors can compress the pharynx and esophagus leading to obstruction. This is an unusual cause of dysphagia. An example would be thyroid cancer. Narrowing (strictures) of the esophagus. The strictures usually are due to GERD and are located in the lower esophagus. These strictures are the result of ulcerations of the esophagus that heal, with scarring as a result. Less common causes of strictures include ingestion of acid or lye during attempts at suicide, some pill medications that may stick in the esophagus and cause ulceration and scarring, for example,potassium chloride ( K-Dur, K-Lor, K-Tab, Kaon CL, Klorvess, Slow-K, Ten-K, Klotrix, K-Lyte CL), doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox and others),quinidine (Quinidine Gluconate, Quinidine Sulfate), biphosphonates used for treating osteoporosis), radiation therapy, and infections of the lower esophagus, particularly in people with AIDS. Schatzki's rings. These rings are benign, very short narrowings (millimeters in size) at the lower end of the esophagus. The cause of Schatzki's rings is unknown though some physicians believe they are caused by GERD. Infiltrating diseases of the esophagus. The most common infiltrative disease is a disease in which the wall of the esophagus fills with eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in inflammation. This disease is called eosinophilic esophagitis. The wall of the esophagus becomes stiff and cannot stretch as the bolus of food passes. As a result, the bolus sticks. Diverticuli (outpouchings) of the pharynx or esophagus. The diverticuli can expand when it fills with swallowed food and can compress the pharynx or esophagus. The diverticuli can be at the upper end of the esophagus (Zenker's diverticulum) or, less commonly, at the middle or lower end of the esophagus. Cricopharyngeal bars. These bars represent a part of the upper esophageal sphincter that has hypertrophied, that is, expanded. The bar does not stretch normally as the bolus passes. The cause of cricopharyngeal bars is unclear. Small bars that do not interfere with swallowing are quite common. Cervical osteophytes. Rarely, arthritis of the neck results in an overgrowth of bone that extends anteriorly out from a vertebra (an osteophyte). Since the vertebrae of the neck lie immediately behind the lower pharynx and uppermost esophagus, the osteophyte may impinge on the pharynx and esophagus. Congenital abnormalities of the esophagus. These abnormalities are present from birth and are almost always discovered in infants because of problems when oral feeding begins."
Diseases of the brain," Stroke. The most common disease affecting swallowing is a stroke (cerebrovascular accidents) that affect the swallowing center. Tumors of the brainstem. These tumors interfere with the transmission of nerves that carry information between the esophagus and the swallowing center in the brain. Degenerative diseases of the brain. The three most common degenerative diseases are Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Degenerative diseases of the motor nerves. Motor nerves are nerves that control the contraction of skeletal muscle. Poliomyelitis (polio, caused by a virus) is an example of a degenerative disease of motor nerves in the brain that impairs swallowing by interfering with the control of skeletal muscle in the pharynx."
Diseases of the smooth muscle of the esophagus," Achalasia. Achalasia is a condition that affects the smooth muscle portion of the esophagus, that is, the lower esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter. Specifically, the peristaltic wave disappears, and the lower sphincter does not relax. As a result of this ""double whammy,"" the food bolus sticks in the esophagus. With prolonged obstruction the esophagus enlarges (dilates) causing additional problems. The cause of achalasia is not clear but probably involves abnormalities of the nerves within the smooth muscle that lead to abnormal function of the muscle. In one sense, therefore, achalasia may be considered primarily a neurological problem. There is a parasitic infectious disease, called Chagas disease that mimics achalasia and occurs with a higher prevalence among individuals from Central and South America. In Chagas disease, the parasite appears to destroy the nerves that control the smooth muscle. Ineffective peristalsis. Ineffective peristalsis is not really a disease but rather a condition in which the force of the peristaltic wave of contraction is reduced to the point that the wave no longer is strong enough to push the bolus of food through the esophagus and into the stomach. By itself, ineffective peristalsis usually does not cause a serious problem. The reason for this is that almost all meals are eaten in the upright position, and the effect of gravity on the bolus provides an additional and important force that alone can propel most boluses into the stomach. Severe problems only occur when a second impediment to passage of the bolus occurs such as a stricture of the esophagus. Ineffective peristalsis usually occurs by itself but it may be associated with other diseases such as collagen-vascular diseases (for example, scleroderma) and diabetes. Theoretically, ineffective peristalsis could be due to either muscular or neurological problems within the smooth muscle. Spastic motility disorders. Spastic motility disorders are a group of conditions of unknown cause in which contractions of the esophagus are not orderly. Rather than a progressing, peristaltic wave, contraction of all or a large portion of the esophagus is simultaneous (spastic), and thus the bolus of food is not propelled forward. Other disorders that are classified with the spastic disorders include peristaltic pressures that are abnormally high and spontaneous contractions of the esophagus, that is, contractions that are not triggered by a swallow. In addition to dysphagia, the spastic motility disorders may cause severe chest pain mimicking heart pain (angina) that occurs spontaneously, that is, unassociated with eating. The most common spastic disorder is referred to as ""nutcracker"" esophagus, a term that emphasizes the appearance of the esophagus on X-rays that is due to very high peristaltic pressures rather than spasm. The second most common spastic disorder is diffuse esophageal spasm, a name that emphasizes the spasm."
Diseases of skeletal muscle of the pharynx," Polymyositis. Polymyositis is a disease of unknown cause in which skeletal muscle becomes inflamed and degenerates. It can affect skeletal muscle of the body as well as the pharynx. Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a disease in which there is abnormal transmission of signals between motor nerves and the skeletal muscles they control. The skeletal muscle of the pharynx may be affected. Muscular dystrophies. The muscular dystrophies are a group of inherited (genetic) diseases that are caused by the production of abnormal proteins in skeletal muscle cells. The abnormal proteins result in degeneration of the muscle cells and their replacement with scar tissue or fat. The primary symptoms of the muscular dystrophies are muscle weakness and spasm. Examples of muscular dystrophies include myotonic dystrophy, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, and Becker's muscular dystrophy. Metabolic myopathies. Metabolic myopathies are a group of rare, inherited (genetic) diseases that are caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzymes in skeletal muscle cells that are important for generating the energy that is necessary for contraction of the muscle. The most common symptom of the metabolic myopathies is easy tiring of muscles and muscle cramps."
Miscellaneous diseases," Reduced saliva. Saliva facilitates swallowing by acting as lubrication for the bolus. Some medications, diseases (for example, Sjogren's syndrome), and radiation therapy to the head and neck that affects the salivary glands, all reduce the production of saliva, and can cause dysphagia, though usually it is mild. Alzheimer's disease"
Swallowing-related symptoms,"'With neurological problems, there may be difficulty initiating a swallow because the bolus cannot be propelled by the tongue into the throat. Elderly individuals with ''dentures'' may not chew their food well and therefore swallow large pieces of solid food that get stuck. (Nevertheless, this usually occurs when there is an additional problem within the pharynx or esophagus such as a stricture.) ''The most common swallowing symptom of dysphagia, however, is the sensation that swallowed food is sticking, either in the lower neck or the chest. If food sticks in the throat, there may be ''coughing'' or choking with ''expectoration'"" of the swallowed food. If food enters the larynx, more severe coughing and choking will be provoked. If the soft palate is not working and doesn't properly seal off the nasal passages, food—particularly liquids--can regurgitate into the nose with the swallow. Sometimes, food may come back up into the mouth immediately after being swallowed.""  "
Non-swallowing-related,"'Food that sticks in the esophagus may remain there for prolonged periods of time. This may create a sensation of the chest filling up as more food is eaten and result in an individual having to stop eating and possibly drinking liquids in an attempt to wash the food down. The inability to eat larger amounts of food may lead to loss of weight. In addition, the food that remains in the esophagus may regurgitate from the esophagus at night while the individual is sleeping, and the individual might be awakened by coughing or choking in the middle of the night that is provoked by the regurgitating food. If food enters the larynx, trachea, and/or ''lungs'', it may provoke episodes of ''asthma'' and even lead to infection of the lungs and aspiration\xa0''pneumonia''. Recurrent ''pneumonia'' can lead to serious, permanent, and progressive injury to the lungs. Occasionally, individuals are not awakened from ''sleep'' by the regurgitating food but awaken in the morning to find regurgitated food on their pillow.''Individuals who retain food in their esophagus may complain of ''heartburn''-like (GERD) symptoms. Their symptoms may indeed be due to GERD but are more likely due to the retained food and do not respond well to treatment for GERD.''With the spastic motility disorders, individuals may develop episodes of ''chest pain'' that may be so severe as to mimic a ''heart attack'' and cause the individuals to go to the emergency room. The cause of the pain with the spastic esophageal disorders is unclear although the leading theory is that it is due to spasm of the esophageal muscles.' "
How causes swallowing problems?,"'Odynophagia and globus sensation. ''The occasional difficulty in distinguishing dysphagia from odynophagia already has been discussed, as well as the difference between dysphagia and a globus sensation.''Tracheo-esophageal fistula.'' One disorder that can be confused with dysphagia is tracheo-esophageal fistula. A tracheo-esophageal fistula is an open communication between the esophagus and the trachea that often develops due to ''cancers'' of the esophagus but which may also occur as a congenital (inborn) birth defect. Swallowed food may provoke coughing that mimics the coughing due to dysfunction of the muscles of the pharynx that allows food to enter the larynx; however, in the case of a fistula, the coughing is due to the passage of food from the esophagus through the fistula and into the trachea.''Rumination syndrome.'' Rumination syndrome is a syndrome in which food regurgitates effortlessly back into the mouth after a meal is completed. It usually occurs in younger women and conceivably could be confused with dysphagia. There is no sensation of food sticking after swallowing, however.''Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).'' People with more severe GERD may have food regurgitate from the stomach into the esophagus or mouth, particularly when activities increase pressure in the abdomen, for example, with coughing and bending. Regurgitation also may occur at night while persons with GERD are sleeping as in those with swallowing disorders who have food collect in their esophagus.''Heart disease''.'' The spastic motility disorders that cause dysphagia can be associated with spontaneous chest pain, that is, chest pain not associated with swallowing. Despite the presence of dysphagia, spontaneous chest pain always must be assumed to be due to ''heart disease'' until heart disease has been excluded as the cause of the chest pain. Therefore, it is important to test carefully for heart disease before considering the esophagus as the cause of chest pain when a patient with dysphagia complains of episodes of spontaneous chest pain.' "
What tests and procedures diagnose the cause of swallowing problems?,"'The history from an individual with dysphagia often provides important clues to the underlying cause of the dysphagia.''The nature of the symptom or symptoms provides the most important clues to the cause of dysphagia. Swallowing that is difficult to initiate or that leads to nasal regurgitation, ''cough'', or choking is most likely due to an oral or pharyngeal problem. Swallowing that results in the sensation of food sticking in the chest (esophagus) is most likely due to an esophageal problem.''Dysphagia that progresses rapidly over weeks or a few months suggests a ''malignant tumor''. Dysphagia for solid food alone suggests a physical obstruction to the passage of food, whereas dysphagia for both solid and liquid food is more likely to be caused by a disease of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. Intermittent symptoms also are more likely to be caused by diseases of smooth muscle than obstruction of the esophagus since dysfunction of the muscle often is intermittent.''Preexisting diseases also provide clues. Those with diseases of skeletal muscle (for example, polymyositis), the brain (most commonly ''stroke''), or the nervous system are more likely to have dysphagia on the basis of dysfunction of the oropharyngeal muscles and nerves. People with collagen vascular diseases, for example, ''scleroderma'', are more likely to have problems with the esophageal muscles, especially ineffective peristalsis.''Patients with a history of GERD are more likely to have esophageal strictures as the cause of their dysphagia, though about 20% of patients with strictures have minimal or no ''symptoms of GERD'' before the onset of dysphagia. It is believed that reflux that occurs at night is more injurious to the esophagus. There also is a higher risk of ''esophageal cancer'' among individuals with long-standing GERD.''Loss of weight can be a sign of either severe dysphagia or a malignant ''tumor''. More often than losing weight, people describe a change in their eating pattern—smaller bites, additional chewing—that prolongs meals so that they are the last one at the table to finish eating. This latter pattern, if present for a prolonged period of time, suggests a non-malignant, relatively stable or slowly progressive cause for the dysphagia. Episodes of chest pain that are not due to heart disease suggest muscular diseases of the esophagus. Birth and residence in Central or South America is associated with Chagas disease.''The physical examination is of limited value in suggesting causes for dysphagia. Abnormalities of the neurological examination suggest neurologic or muscle diseases. By observing an individual swallowing, one can determine if there is difficulty in initiating swallows, a sign of neurological disease. Tumors in the neck suggest the possibility of compression of the pharynx. A trachea that cannot be moved from side to side with the hand suggests a tumor lower down in the chest that has entrapped the trachea and possibly the esophagus. Observing atrophy (reduced size) or fasiculations of the tongue (fine ''tremors'') also suggest diseases of the nervous system or skeletal muscle.''Endoscopy. '' Endoscopy involves the insertion of a long (one meter), flexible tube with a light and camera on its end through the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and into the stomach. The lining of the pharynx and esophagus can be evaluated visually, and biopsies (small pieces of tissue) can be obtained for examination under the microscope or for bacterial or viral cultures.'""Endoscopy is an excellent means of diagnosing tumors, strictures, and Schatzki's rings as well as infections of the esophagus. It also is very good for diagnosing diverticuli of the middle and lower esophagus but poor for diagnosing diverticuli in the upper esophagus (Zenker's diverticulum).""'It is possible to observe abnormalities of esophageal muscular contraction, but esophageal manometry is a test that is much better suited for evaluating function of the esophageal muscles. Resistance passing the endoscope through the lower esophageal sphincter combined with a lack of esophageal contractions is a fairly reliable sign of achalasia or Chagas disease (due to the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax), but it is important when there is resistance to exclude the presence of a stricture or ''cancer'' which also can cause resistance. Finally, there is a characteristic appearance of the esophageal lining when infiltrated with eosinophils that strongly suggests the presence of eosinophilic ''esophagitis''.''X-rays.'' There are two different types of X-rays that can be done to diagnose the cause of dysphagia. The ''barium swallow'"" or esophagram is the simplest type. For the barium swallow, mouthfuls of barium are swallowed, and X-ray films are taken of the esophagus at several points in time while the bolus of barium traverses the esophagus. The barium swallow is excellent for diagnosing moderate-to-severe external compression, tumors, and strictures of the esophagus. Occasionally, however, Schatzki's rings can be missed.""""Another type of X-ray study that can be done to evaluate swallowing is the video esophagram or video swallow, sometimes called a video-fluoroscopic swallowing study. For the video swallow, instead of several static X-ray images of the bolus traversing the esophagus, a video X-ray is taken. The video study can be reviewed frame by frame and is able to show much more than the barium swallow. This usually is not important for diagnosing tumors or strictures, which are well seen on barium swallow, but it is more effective for suggesting problems with the contraction of the muscles of the esophagus and pharynx (though esophageal manometry, discussed later, is still better for studying contraction), milder external compression of the esophagus, and Schatzki's rings. The video study can be extended to include the pharynx where it is the best method for demonstrating osteophytes, cricopharyngeal bars, and Zenker's diverticuli. A modified barium swallow is a version of the test evaluating the oropharyngeal phases of swallowing. A speech pathologist is usually involved with the evaluation to determine subtle sequence and phase abnormalities.""'The video swallow also is excellent for diagnosing penetration of barium (the equivalent of food) into the larynx and trachea due to neurological and muscular problems of the pharynx that may be causing coughing or choking after swallowing food.''Esophageal manometry.'' Esophageal manometry, also known as esophageal motility testing, is a means to evaluate the function of pharyngeal and esophageal muscles. For manometry, a thin, flexible catheter is passed through the nose and pharynx and into the esophagus. The catheter is able to sense pressure at multiple locations along its length in both the pharynx and the esophagus. When the pharyngeal and esophageal muscles contract, they generate a pressure on the catheter which is sensed, measured and recorded from each location. The magnitude of the pressure at each pressure-sensing location and the timing of the increases in pressure at each location in relation to other locations give an accurate picture of how the muscles of the pharynx and esophagus are contracting.''The value of manometry is in diagnosing and differentiating among diseases of the muscle or the nerves controlling the muscles that result in muscle dysfunction of the pharynx and esophagus. Thus, it is useful for diagnosing the swallowing dysfunction caused by diseases of the brain, skeletal muscle of the pharynx, and smooth muscle of the esophagus.''Esophageal impedence.'' Esophageal impedence testing utilizes catheters similar to those used for esophageal manometry. Impedence testing, however, senses the flow of the bolus through the esophagus. Thus, it is possible to determine how well the bolus is traversing the esophagus and correlate the movement with concomitantly recorded esophageal pressures determined by manometry. (It also can be used to sense reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus among patients with GERD.) Multiple sites along the length of the esophagus can be tested to assess the movement of the bolus and presence of reflux, including how high up it extends.''Esophageal acid testing.'' Esophageal acid testing is not a test that directly diagnoses diseases of the esophagus. Rather, it is a method for determining whether or not there is reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus, a cause of the most common esophageal problem leading to dysphagia, esophageal stricture. For acid testing, a thin catheter is inserted through the nose, down the throat, and into the esophagus. At the tip of the catheter and placed just above the junction of the esophagus with the stomach is an acid-sensing probe. The catheter coming out of the nose passes back over the ear and down to the waist where it is attached to a recorder. Each time acid refluxes (regurgitates) from the stomach and into the esophagus it hits the probe, and the reflux of acid is recorded by the recorder. At the end of a prolonged period, usually 24 hours, the catheter is removed and the information from the recorder is downloaded into a computer for analysis. Most people have a small amount of reflux of acid, but individuals with GERD have more. Thus, acid testing can determine if GERD is likely to be the cause of the esophageal problem such as a stricture, as well as if treatment of GERD is adequate by showing the amount of acid that refluxes during treatment is normal.''An alternative method of esophageal acid testing uses a small capsule containing an acid-sensing probe that is attached to the esophageal lining just above the junction of the esophagus with the stomach. The capsule wirelessly transmits the presence of episodes of acid regurgitation to a receiver carried on the chest. The capsule records for two or three days and later is shed into the esophagus and passes out of the body in the ''stool''.''Other tests\xa0''The diagnosis of muscular dystrophies and metabolic myopathies usually involves a combination of tests including blood tests that can suggest muscle injury, electromyograms to determine if nerves and muscles are working normally, biopsies of muscles, and genetic testing.' "
How are swollowing problems treated?,"'The treatment of dysphagia varies and depends on the cause of the dysphagia. One option for supporting patients either transiently or long-term until the cause of the dysphagia resolves is a feeding tube. The tube for feeding may be passed nasally into the stomach or through the abdominal wall into the stomach or small intestine. Once oral feeding resumes, the tube can be removed.''Treatment for obstruction of the pharynx or esophagus requires removal of the obstruction.''Tumors usually are removed surgically although occasionally they can be removed endoscopically, totally or partially. Radiation therapy and ''chemotherapy'' also may be used particularly for malignant tumors of the pharynx and its surrounding tissues. If malignant tumors of the esophagus cannot be easily removed or the tumor has spread and survival will be limited, swallowing can be improved by placing ''stents'' within the esophagus across the area of obstruction. Occasionally, obstructing tumors can be dilated the same way as strictures. (See below.)'""Strictures and Schatzki's rings usually are treated with endoscopic dilation, a procedure in which the narrowed area is stretched either by a long, semi-rigid tube passed through the mouth or a balloon that is blown up inside the esophagus.""'The most common infiltrating disease causing dysphagia is eosinophilic esophagitis which usually is successfully treated with swallowed ''corticosteroids''. The role of ''food allergy'' as a cause of eosinophilic esophagitis is debated; however, there are reports of using elimination diets to identify specific foods that are associated with ''allergy''. Elimination of these foods has been reported to prevent or reverse the infiltration of the esophagus with eosinophils, particularly in children.''Diverticuli of the pharynx and esophagus usually are treated surgically by excising them. Occasionally they can be treated endoscopically. Cricopharyngeal bars are treated surgically by cutting the thickened muscle. Osteophytes also can be removed surgically.''Congenital abnormalities of the esophagus usually are treated surgically soon after birth so that oral feeding can resume.''As previously discussed, ''strokes'' are the most common disease of the brain to cause dysphagia. Dysphagia usually is at its worst immediately after the ''stroke'', and often the dysphagia improves with time and even may disappear. If it does not disappear, swallowing is evaluated, usually with a video swallowing study. The exact abnormality of function can be defined and different maneuvers can be performed to see if they can counter the effects of the dysfunction. For example, in some patients it is possible to prevent aspiration of food by turning the head to the side when swallowing or by drinking thickened liquids (since thin liquids is the food most likely to be aspirated).'""Tumors of the brain, in some cases, can be removed surgically; however, it is unlikely that surgery will reverse the dysphagia. Parkinson's disease and ""'multiple sclerosis'' can be treated with ''drugs'' and may be useful in patients with dysphagia.''Achalasia is treated like a stricture of the esophagus with dilation, usually with a balloon. A second option is surgical treatment in which the muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter is cut (a myotomy) in order to reduce the pressure and obstruction caused by the non-relaxing sphincter. Drugs that relax the sphincter usually have little or a transient effect and are useful only when achalasia is mild.''An option for individuals who are at high risk for surgery or balloon dilation is injection of botulinin toxin into the sphincter. The toxin paralyzes the muscle of the sphincter and causes the pressure within the sphincter to decrease. The effects of botulinin toxin are transient, however, and repeated injections usually are necessary. It is best to treat achalasia early before the obstruction causes the esophagus to enlarge (dilate) which can lead to additional problems such as food collecting above the sphincter with regurgitation and aspiration.''In other spastic motility disorders, several drugs may be tried, including anti-cholinergic medications, peppermint, ''nitroglycerin'', and ''calcium channel blockers'', but the effectiveness of these drugs is not clear and studies with them are nonexistent or limited.''For patients with severe and uncontrollable symptoms of pain and/or dysphagia, a surgical procedure called a long myotomy occasionally is performed. A long myotomy is similar to the surgical treatment for achalasia but the cut in the muscle is extended up along the body of the esophagus for a variable distance in an attempt to reduce pressures and obstruction to the bolus.''There is no treatment for ineffective peristalsis, and individuals must change their eating habits. Fortunately, ineffective peristalsis infrequently causes severe dysphagia by itself. When moderate or severe dysphagia is associated with ineffective peristalsis it is important to be certain that there is no additional obstruction of the esophagus, for example, by a stricture due to GERD, that is adding to the effects of reduced muscle function and making dysphagia worse than the ineffective peristalsis alone. Most causes of obstruction can be treated.''There are effective drug therapies for polymyositis and myasthenia gravis that should also improve associated dysphagia. Treatment of the muscular dystrophies is primarily directed at preventing deformities of the joints that commonly occur and lead to immobility, but there are no therapies that affect the dysphagia. Corticosteroids and drugs that suppress immunity sometimes are used to treat some of the muscular dystrophies, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated.''There is no treatment for the metabolic myopathies other than changes in lifestyle and ''diet''.''Diseases that reduce the production of saliva can be treated with artificial saliva or ''over-the-counter'' and prescription drugs that stimulate the production of saliva.''There is no treatment for '""Alzheimer's""' disease.'  "
What is the prognosis for dysphagia?,"'With the exception of dysphagia caused by stroke for which there can be marked improvement, dysphagia from other causes is stable or progressive, and the prognosis depends on the underlying cause, its tendency to progress, the availability of therapy, and the response to therapy.' In general, the prognosis for non-malignant obstruction of the esophagus is good with treatment. Even dysphagia caused by malignant obstruction can be palliated with endoscopic resection of part of the tumor and/or stenting. Neurologic and muscular diseases causing dysphagia are a mixed bag. Treatment of achalasia is quite effective, treatment for spastic motility disorders much less so. As mentioned previously, ineffective peristalsis by itself usually does not cause important or progressive dysphagia. Progressive neurologic and skeletal muscle diseases are the most difficult to treat and carry the worst prognosis."
What does the future offer for dysphagia?,"'Recent developments in the diagnostic arena are beginning to bring new insights into esophageal function, specifically, high resolution and 3D manometry, and ''endoscopic ultrasound''.''High resolution and 3D manometry''High resolution and 3D manometry are extensions of standard manometry that utilize similar catheters. The difference is that the pressure-sensing locations on the catheters are very close together and ring the catheter. Recording of pressures from so many locations gives an extremely detailed picture of how esophageal muscle is contracting. The primary value of these diagnostic procedures is that they ""integrate"" the activities of the esophagus so that the overall pattern of swallowing can be recognized, which is particularly important in complex motility disorders. In addition, their added detail allows the recognition of subtle abnormalities and hopefully will be able to help define the clinical importance of subtle abnormalities of muscle contraction associated with lesser degrees of dysphagia.''Endoscopic ultrasonography has been available for many years but has recently been applied to the evaluation of esophageal muscle diseases. ''Ultrasound'' uses sound waves to penetrate tissues. The sound waves are reflected by the tissues and structures they encounter, and, when analyzed, the reflections give information about the tissues and structures from which they are reflected. In the esophagus, endoscopic ultrasonography has been used to determine the extent of penetration of tumors into the esophageal wall and the presence of metastases to adjacent ''lymph nodes''. More recently, endoscopic ultrasonography has been used to obtain a detailed look at the muscles of the esophagus. What has been found is that in some disorders, particularly the spastic motility disorders, the muscle of the esophagus is thickened. Moreover, thickening of the muscle sometimes can be recognized only by ultrasonography even when spastic abnormalities are not seen with manometry. The exact role of endoscopic ultrasonography has not yet been determined but is an exciting area for future research.' "
What is the sweat chloride test?,"'The sweat chloride test is a common and simple test used to evaluate a patient who is suspected of having ''cystic fibrosis'' (CF), the most common lethal ''genetic disease'' affecting Caucasians. Cystic fibrosis is often clinically suspected when there is poor growth during infancy or recurrent serious intestinal or respiratory diseases in a toddler or young child. The genetic defect in cystic fibrosis affects the way chloride moves in and out of cells, and sweat contains chloride in the form of sodium chloride (salt). Measurement of the chloride in sweat has been the standard method for diagnosing cystic fibrosis for over 40 years.  Because cystic fibrosis is so common, many states include testing for the cystic fibrosis gene as part of the ''Newborn'' Screen; however, sweat testing is still required to confirm the diagnosis.'

Summary,"'Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is a skin condition characterized by ''fever'', inflammation of the joints (''arthritis'""), and painful skin lesions that appear mainly on the face, neck, back and arms. Although middle-aged women are most likely to develop this condition, it may also affect men, older adults and even infants. The exact cause of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis often isn't known. It is suspected that it can be a reaction of the body to certain exposures (sun), infections (""'Streptococcus'' bacteria, ''Campylobacter''), or medications (''azathioprine'', nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications). This condition can also occur with some types of ''cancer'"" and other serious health problems. Most often, it isn't serious and will clear on its own in a few months. Healing is much more rapid; however, with treatment, such as ""'corticosteroid'' use.' "
Symptoms,"'The most obvious signs of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis are distinctive skin lesions that usually develop according to a specific pattern. Typically, a series of small red ''bumps'' appear suddenly on the back, neck, arms and face, often after a ''fever'' or upper ''respiratory infection''. The bumps grow quickly in size, spreading into clusters called plaques that may be a centimeter in diameter or larger. The eruptions are tender or painful and may develop ''blisters'', pustules or even ulcers. Lesions may persist for weeks to months and then disappear on their own, without medication. With medical treatment, the skin lesions may resolve in just a few days.''Other signs and symptoms of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis may include:''Sometimes other areas of the body are affected, such as the bones, nervous system, kidneys, ''intestines'', ''liver'', heart , ''lungs'', muscles, and spleen.' Moderate to high fever Pink eye (conjunctivitis) or sore eyes Tiredness Aching joints and headache Mouth ulcers Headache"
Cause,"'In many cases, the cause of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is unknown (idiopathic). But sometimes, it can be a sign of an immune system response to one of the following:' An upper respiratory tract infection, such as a chest infection or strep throat Blood disorders, especially acute myelogenous leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow Inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease Bowel or breast cancer Pregnancy Rheumatoid arthritis An injury at the site where the rash appears, such as an insect bite or needle prick Certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"
Treatment,"'Left untreated, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis not associated with a more serious condition may disappear on its own within one to three months. Medications, such as ''corticosteroids'' (''prednisone'' or ''prednisolone''), can improve skin lesions and associated symptoms in just two or three days, with the worst of the lesions disappearing within one to four weeks. Doctors usually prescribe systemic corticosteroids (which are taken by mouth) to treat this condition. These medications reduce redness, ''itching'', swelling and ''allergic'' reactions.''If an underlying cause can be identified, it should be treated (i.e. surgical removal of solid tumors, treatment of infections, or discontinuation of medications). Successful therapy of the underlying disorder may promote resolution of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis and prevent recurrences.''With or without treatment, the lesions rarely leave a mark or ''scar'' when they eventually disappear. Even after the lesions have resolved, treatment may continue, as recurrence of the condition is common.' "
Find a Specialist,"'If you need medical advice, you can look for doctors or other healthcare professionals who have experience with this disease. You may find these specialists through advocacy organizations, ''clinical trials'', or articles published in medical journals. You may also want to contact a university or tertiary medical center in your area, because these centers tend to see more complex cases and have the latest technology and treatments.'""If you can't find a specialist in your local area, try contacting national or international specialists. They may be able to refer you to someone they know through conferences or research efforts.

"What is ""swimmer's ear"" infection in children and adults?","'External otitis or ""swimmer\'s ear"" in children and adults is an infection of the skin covering the outer ear and ear canal. The ear infection can be short-term (acute) or chronic, which lasts for a long period.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of swimmer's ear in children and adults?,"'Other signs and symptoms of an outer ear infection in children include severe pain when the ear is moved, touched, or itched, and irritability. Outer ''ear infections'' in children also can be causes by middle ''ear infections'' (''otitis media'') or objects placed in the ear.'   The first symptom of infection is the ear feeling full, and it may itch. The ear canal swells, and fluid or puss may come from the ear. Swimmer's ear is very painful, especially with movement of the outside portion of the ear. The ear canal can swell shut, and the side of the face can become swell. A sense of fullness in the ear The lymph nodes of the neck may enlarge, making it difficult or painful to open the jaw. People with swimmer's ear may experience some temporary hearing loss in the infected ear."
What causes acute swimmer's ear infection in children an adults?,"""Acute external otitis (acute swimmer's ear) is a common bacterial infection caused by ""'Streptococcus'', ''Staphylococcus'', or ''Pseudomonas'' bacteria. Usually, bacterial ear infections in children and adults are transmitted through excessive water exposure from swimming, diving, surfing, kayaking, or other water sports. When water collects in the ear canal (frequently trapped by wax), the skin can become soggy, which is an incubator for bacteria to collect and grow. ''Cuts'' or abrasions in the lining of the ear canal (for example, from cotton swab injuries) also can expose the ear canal to a bacterial infection.''Itchy'' ears can drive a person crazy. It can be the first sign of an infection, but if the problem is chronic, it is more likely caused by a chronic ''dermatitis'' of the ear canal. ''Seborrheic dermatitis'' and ''eczema'' can both affect the ear canal. There is really no cure for this problem, but it can be made tolerable with the use of steroid drops and creams. People with these problems are more prone to acute infections as well. Use of ear plugs, alcohol drops, and non-instrumentation of the ear is the best ''prevention'' for infection. Other treatments for ''allergies'' may also help itchy ears.' "
"What are the symptoms, signs, and causes of chronic swimmer's ear?","""Chronic (long-term) swimmer's ear is otitis externa that persists for longer than four weeks or that occurs more than four times a year.

However, in people with ''diabetes'"" or those with suppressed immune systems, chronic swimmer's ear can become a serious disease (""'malignant'' external otitis). Malignant external otitis is a misnomer because it is not a ''tumor'' or a ''cancer'', but rather an aggressive bacterial (typically ''Pseudomonas'') infection of the base of the skull.' bacterial infection, a skin condition (eczema or seborrhea), fungal infection (Aspergillosis), chronic irritation (such as from the use of hearing aids, insertion of cotton swabs, etc.), allergy, chronic drainage from middle ear disease, tumors (rare), or it may simply follow from a nervous habit of frequently scratching the ear."
"Can objects, bugs, or insects in the ear cause outer ear infections?","'Young children often will put foreign objects their ear by accident or while scratching or trying to clean their ear. Often, children who put objects in their ear also have swimmer’s ear (external ear infection). Do not try to remove objects stuck in the ear because it can be difficult. Call your pediatrician to have the object safely removed. Usually this can be done in the office, but sometimes, general anesthesia may be necessary to remove the lodged object if it is stuck deeply in the ear or if the child or adult is uncooperative.''Insects or bugs can be trapped in the ear, for example, small gnats can be caught and stuck in the ''earwax''. Often, bugs and insects can washed out with warm water. Larger insects or bugs may not be able to turn around in the narrow canal. If the insect or bug is still alive, first kill it by filling the ear with mineral oil. This will suffocate the insect, and then see your doctor to have it removed.' "
"What natural home remedies, eardrops, or antibiotics treat and cure swimmer's ear?","""Swimmer's ear is a treatable condition that usually goes away quickly with appropriate treatment. Usually, swimmer's ear can be easily treated with antibiotic eardrops. However, regardless of the cause, moisture and irritation will prolong healing of the infected ear.""""Natural and home care for swimmer's ear includes measures such as:""""The doctor may advise using a wick to administer medication while the ear canal is swollen. Chronic swimmer's ear may require more intensive treatment. Swimmer's ear typically does not have any long-term or serious complications.""   Remove water from the ears after swimming or water exposure. Keep the ears dry. While showering or swimming use an earplug (one that is designed to keep water out), or use cotton with Vaseline on the outside to plug the ears. Scratching the inside of the ear or using cotton swabs should be avoided. This will only aggravate the irritated skin, and in most situations will make the condition worse. A hearing aid should be left out as much as possible until swelling and discharge stops. Follow your doctor's instructions for use of medications and do not stop using the medications until instructed to do so by your doctor. Use of a wick may be necessary for antibiotic treatment if the ear canal is very swollen. A homemade ear drip mix of 50% rubbing alcohol, 25% white vinegar, and 25% distilled water can be used to slightly acidify the ear canal can be used for prevention of infections as well as mild infection caused by bacteria or fungus. Treatment for swimmer’s ear in children include antibiotics, pain medications, and sometimes, antihistamines to reduce itching. Your doctor can determine whether your child's ear pain is due to swimmer's ear or another condition."
What is the prevention for swimmer's ear?,"   Decrease exposure to water. If you are prone to infections, it's recommended that you use an ear plug when you bathe or swim. Swimmer's ear drops or alcohol drops (Swim-EAR®) used in the ear after water exposure followed by drying the ear with a hair dryer held at arm's length will often help keep the ear free of moisture Do not insert instruments, scratch, or use cotton swabs in the ears. Try to keep the ear free of wax. This may require visits to the doctor to have your ears cleaned. Do not attempt to put anything into the ear canal (such as a swab) to try to remove earwax that is deep within the ear canal. If you already have an ear infection, or if you have a hole in your eardrum, or if you have had ear surgery or ear tubes, first consult your doctor prior to swimming and before you use any type of eardrop. An easy and inexpensive eardrop solution can be made by mixing equal parts of rubbing alcohol and white vinegar (50:50 mixture). This solution will increase the rate of evaporation of water in the ear canal and has antibacterial properties. Using this solution to rinse the ear before and after water exposure can serve as a protective measure against infection. Mineral oil eardrops can be used to protect the ear from water when a dry crusty skin condition exists. A 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide can be used for occasional ear cleaning to help remove earwax that can cause water to build up in the ear. Apply using an ear dropper (about half full). The solution will fizz slightly. Turn your head to the side and pull back on the top of your ear so that the solution fills the ear canal. Afterward, make sure to use one of the methods described above for drying the ear. You can also use a hair dryer on low setting to dry the ear canal. This also can be done after using the drying eardrops."
What is the swine flu?,"'Swine flu (swine influenza) is a respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that infect the respiratory tract of pigs, resulting in nasal secretions, a barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine flu produces most of the same symptoms in pigs as human flu produces in people. Swine flu can last about one to two weeks in pigs that survive. Swine influenza virus was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in the U.S. and has been recognized by pork producers and veterinarians to cause infections in pigs worldwide. In a number of instances, people have developed the swine flu infection when they are closely associated with pigs (for example, farmers, pork processors), and likewise, pig populations have occasionally been infected with the human flu infection. In most instances, the cross-species infections (swine-origin virus to man; human flu virus to pigs) have remained in local areas and have not caused national or worldwide infections in either pigs or humans. Unfortunately, this cross-species situation with influenza viruses (human infections with swine viruses) has had the potential to change. Investigators decided the 2009 so-called ""swine flu"" strain, first seen in Mexico, should be termed novel H1N1 flu since it was mainly found infecting people and exhibits two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1). The eight RNA strands from novel H1N1 flu have one strand derived from human flu ''strains'', two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains.''The main swine flu viruses in pigs in the recent years are swine triple reassortant (tr; it means a viral strain with genes from three different organisms) H1N1, trH3N2, and trH1N2. However, in August 2018, China first reported a new swine flu outbreak in pigs in Liaoning province. The pig flu strain known as African swine flu (although some researchers think it originated in Russia), almost 100% fatal to pigs, was the cause. This strain is highly infectious, survives in heat and ''cold'' environments, and can remain viable and infectious on surfaces for days to weeks. Currently, there is no effective ''vaccine'"" or drug to stop its spread, so the disease is treated by immediate slaughter of infected pigs. China has about 50% of the world's pig population and relies on pork to provide a large amount of protein for the Chinese population. Culling the pig population in China may result in China needing to import pork that would likely be a large economic blow to China's economy. This virus has not yet been detected in the U.S. This flu strain reportedly does not spread to humans."" "
How is swine flu transmitted? Is swine flu contagious?,"'Swine influenza is transmitted from person to person by ''inhalation'' or ingestion of droplets containing virus from people ''sneezing'' or ''coughing''; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork products. The newest swine flu virus that has caused swine flu is influenza A H3N2v (commonly termed H3N2v) that began as an outbreak in 2011. The ""v"" in the name means the virus is a variant that normally infects only pigs but has begun to infect humans. There have been small outbreaks of H1N1 influenza since the pandemic; a recent one is in India where at least three people have died.' "
What is the incubation period for swine flu?,"'The incubation period for swine flu is about one to four days, with the average being two days; in some people, the incubation period may be as long as about seven days in adults and children.' "
What is the contagious period for swine flu?,"'The contagious period (human-to-human viral infection) for swine influenza in adults usually begins one day before symptoms develop in an adult and it lasts about five to seven days after the person becomes sick. However, people with weakened immune systems and children may be contagious for a longer period of time (for example, about 10 to 14 days).' "
How long does the swine flu last?,"'In uncomplicated infections, swine flu typically begins to resolve after three to seven days, but the malaise and cough can persist two weeks or more in some patients. Severe swine flu may require hospitalization that increases the length of time of infection to about nine to 10 days.' "
What causes swine flu?,"'The cause of the 2009 swine flu was an influenza A virus type designated as H1N1. In 2011, a new swine flu virus was detected. The new strain was named influenza A (H3N2)v. Only a few people (mainly children) were first infected, but officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) reported increased numbers of people infected in the 2012-2013 flu season. Currently, there are not large numbers of people infected with H3N2v. Unfortunately, another virus termed H3N2 (note no ""v"" in its name) has been detected and caused flu, but this strain is different from H3N2v. In general, all of the influenza A viruses have a structure similar to the H1N1 virus; each type has a somewhat different H and/or N structure.' "
Why is swine flu now infecting humans?,"'Many researchers now consider that two main series of events can lead to swine flu (and also avian or ''bird flu'') becoming a major cause for influenza illness in humans.'""First, the influenza viruses (types A, B, C) are enveloped RNA viruses with a segmented genome; this means the viral RNA genetic code is not a single strand of RNA but exists as eight different RNA segments in the influenza viruses. A human (or bird) influenza virus can infect a pig respiratory cell at the same time as a swine influenza virus; some of the replicating RNA strands from the human virus can get mistakenly enclosed inside the enveloped swine influenza virus. For example, one cell could contain eight swine flu and eight human flu RNA segments. The total number of RNA types in one cell would be 16; four swine and four human flu RNA segments could be incorporated into one particle, making a viable eight RNA-segmented flu virus from the 16 available segment types. Various combinations of RNA segments can result in a new subtype of virus (this process is known as antigenic shift) that may have the ability to preferentially infect humans but still show characteristics unique to the swine influenza virus (see Figure 1). It is even possible to include RNA strands from birds, swine, and human influenza viruses into one virus if a single cell becomes infected with all three types of influenza (for example, two bird flu, three swine flu, and three human flu RNA segments to produce a viable eight-segment new type of flu viral genome). Formation of a new viral type is considered to be antigenic shift; small changes within an individual RNA segment in flu viruses are termed antigenic drift (see figure 1) and result in minor changes in the virus. However, these small genetic changes can accumulate over time to produce enough minor changes that cumulatively alter the virus' ""'makeup'' over time (usually years).''Second, pigs can play a unique role as an intermediary host to new flu types because pig respiratory cells can be infected directly with bird, human, and other mammalian flu viruses. Consequently, pig respiratory cells are able to be infected with many types of flu and can function as a ""mixing pot"" for flu RNA segments (see figure 1). Bird flu viruses, which usually infect the gastrointestinal cells of many bird species, are shed in bird feces. Pigs can pick these viruses up from the environment, and this seems to be the major way that bird flu virus RNA segments enter the mammalian flu virus population. Figure 1 shows this process in H1N1, but the figure represents the genetic process for all flu viruses, including human, swine, and avian strains like H1N2 (bird flu).' "
What are swine flu symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of swine flu are similar to most influenza infections: ''fever'' (100 F or greater), cough (usually dry), nasal secretions, ''fatigue'', and ''headache'', with ''fatigue'' being reported in most infected individuals. Some patients may also get a ''sore throat'', ''rash'', body (muscle) aches or pains, ''headaches'', ''chills'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. In Mexico, many of the initial patients infected with H1N1 influenza were young adults, which made some investigators speculate that a strong immune response, as seen in young people, may cause some collateral tissue damage. The incubation period from exposure to first symptoms is about one to four days, with an average of two days. The symptoms last about one to two weeks and can last longer if the person has a severe infection.''Some patients develop severe respiratory symptoms, such as ''shortness of breath'', and need respiratory support (such as a ventilator to breathe for the patient). Patients can get ''pneumonia'' (bacterial secondary infection) if the viral infection persists, and some can develop ''seizures''. Death often occurs from secondary bacterial infection of the ''lungs''; appropriate antibiotics need to be used in these patients. The usual mortality (death) rate for typical influenza A is about 0.1%, while the 1918 ""Spanish flu"" epidemic had an estimated mortality rate ranging from 2%-20%. Swine (H1N1) flu in Mexico had about 160 deaths and about 2,500 confirmed cases, which would correspond to a mortality rate of about 6%, but these initial data were revised and the mortality rate worldwide was estimated to be much lower. Fortunately, the mortality rate of H1N1 remained low and similar to that of the conventional flu (average conventional flu mortality rate is about 36,000 per year; projected H1N1 flu mortality rate was 90,000 per year in the U.S. as determined by the president\'s advisory committee, but it never approached that high number).''Fortunately, although H1N1 developed into a pandemic (worldwide) flu strain, the mortality rate in the U.S. and many other countries only approximated the usual numbers of flu deaths worldwide. Speculation about why the mortality rate remained much lower than predicted includes increased public awareness and action that produced an increase in hygiene (especially hand washing), a fairly rapid development of a new vaccine, and patient self-isolation if symptoms developed.'  "
What types of health care professionals treat swine flu?,"""Almost all uncomplicated patients with swine flu can be treated at home or by the patient's pediatrician, primary care provider, or emergency-medicine doctor. For more complicated and/or severe swine flu infections, specialists such as critical care specialists, lung specialists (pulmonologists), and infectious-disease specialists may be consulted."" "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose swine flu?,"""Swine flu is presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patient's history of association with people known to have the disease and their symptoms listed above. Usually, a quick test (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) is done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A or B virus. Most of the tests can distinguish between A and B types. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or positive for ""'type A'' and B. If the test is positive for type B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu. If it is positive for type A, the person could have a conventional flu strain or swine flu. However, the accuracy of these tests has been challenged, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not completed their comparative studies of these tests. However, a new test developed by the CDC and a commercial company reportedly can detect H1N1 reliably in about one hour; the test was formerly only available to the military. In 2010, the FDA approved a commercially available test that could detect H1N1 within four hours. Most of these rapid tests are based on ''PCR'' technology.'""Swine flu is definitively diagnosed by identifying the particular antigens (surface proteins) associated with the virus type. In general, this test is done in a specialized laboratory and is not done by many doctors' offices or hospital laboratories. However, doctors' offices are able to send specimens to specialized laboratories if necessary. Because of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu viruses), the CDC recommended only hospitalized patients' flu virus strains be sent to reference labs to be identified. H3N2v flu strains and other flu virus strains are diagnosed by similar methods."" "
What is the treatment for swine flu?,"'The best treatment for influenza infections in humans is prevention by vaccination. Work by several laboratories has produced ''vaccines''. The first H1N1 vaccine released in early October 2009 was a nasal spray vaccine that was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2-49. However, the use of nasal spray has not been recommended since 2016. The injectable vaccine, made from killed H1N1, became available in the second week of October 2009. This vaccine was approved for use in ages 6 months to the elderly, including ''pregnant'' females. The CDC approved both of these ''vaccines'' only after they had conducted ''clinical trials'' to prove that the ''vaccines'' were safe and effective.''Almost all vaccines have some side effects. Common side effects of H1N1 vaccines (alone or in combination with other flu viral strains) are typical of flu vaccines used over many years and are as follows:''The flu shot (vaccine) is made from killed virus particles so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot. However, the nasal spray vaccine contains live virus that have been altered to hinder its ability to replicate in human tissue. People with a suppressed immune system should not get vaccinated with the nasal spray. Also, most vaccines that contain flu viral particles are cultivated in eggs, so individuals with an ''allergy'' to eggs were cautioned about getting the vaccine unless tested and advised by their doctor that they are cleared to get it. However, more refined vaccine preparations have contained very few egg allergens, so the egg ''allergy'' factor of vaccines has been almost eliminated. Like all vaccines, rare events may occur in some rare cases (for example, swelling, ''weakness'', or shortness of breath). About one person in 1 million who gets the vaccine may develop a neurological problem termed Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause weakness or ''paralysis'', difficulty ''breathing'', bladder and/or bowel problems, and other nerve problems. If any symptoms like these develop, see a physician immediately.''Several antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu. The most used are zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu), both of which are also used to prevent or reduce influenza A and B symptoms. These ''drugs'' should not be used indiscriminately, because viral resistance to them can and has occurred. Also, they are not recommended if the ''flu symptoms'' already have been present for 48 hours or more, although hospitalized patients may still be treated past the 48-hour guideline. The CDC has suggested in their guidelines that pregnant females can be treated with the two antiviral agents. Severe infections in some patients may require additional supportive measures such as ventilation support and treatment of other infections like ''pneumonia'' that can occur in patients with a severe flu infection. Two other new antiviral drugs (Rapivab and Xofluza) may also be used under certain conditions. Some researchers suggest the data on Tamiflu and Relenza are not correct and suggest the antivirals are not effective.''On Dec. 22, 2014, the FDA approved the first new anti-influenza drug (for H1N1 and other influenza virus types) in 15 years, peramivir injection (Rapivab). It is approved for use in the following settings:''Diarrhea'', skin infections, ''hallucinations'', and/or altered behavior may occur as side effects of this drug.''Another new drug, baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), is an oral antiviral approved in 2018 for use in children 12 years and older.'   Flu shot: Soreness, redness, minor swelling at the shot site, muscle aches, low-grade fever, and nausea do not usually last more than about 24 hours. Nasal spray: runny nose, low-grade fever, vomiting, headache, wheezing, cough, and sore throat Intradermal shot: redness, swelling, pain, headache, muscle aches, fatigue Adult patients for whom therapy with an intravenous (IV) medication is clinically appropriate, based upon one or more of the following reasons:The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy, ordrug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible, orthe physician decides that IV therapy is appropriate due to other circumstances. The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy, or drug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible, or the physician decides that IV therapy is appropriate due to other circumstances. Pediatric patients for whom an intravenous medication is clinically appropriate because:The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy, ordrug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible. The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy, or drug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible."
What is the history of swine flu in humans?,"'In 1976, there was an outbreak of swine flu at Fort Dix. This virus was not the same as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, but it was similar insofar as it was an influenza A virus that had similarities to the swine flu virus. There was one death at Fort Dix. The government decided to produce a vaccine against this virus, but the vaccine was associated with rare instances of neurological complications (Guillain-Barré syndrome) and was discontinued. Some individuals speculate that formalin, used to inactivate the virus, may have played a role in the development of this complication in 1976. One of the reasons it takes a few months to develop a new vaccine is to test the vaccine for safety to avoid the complications seen in the 1976 vaccine. Individuals with active infections or diseases of the nervous system are also not recommended to get flu vaccines.''Early in the spring of 2009, H1N1 flu virus was first detected in Mexico, causing some deaths among a ""younger"" population. It began increasing during the summer 2009 and rapidly circulated to the U.S. and to Europe and eventually worldwide. The WHO declared it first fit their criteria for an epidemic and then, in June 2009, the WHO declared the first flu pandemic in 41 years. There was a worldwide concern and people began to improve in hand washing and other prevention methods while they awaited vaccine development. The trivalent vaccine made for the 2009-2010 flu season offered virtually no protection from H1N1. New vaccines were developed (both live and killed virus) and started to become available in September 2009-October 2009. The CDC established a protocol guideline for those who should get the vaccine first. By late December to January, a vaccine against H1N1 was available in moderate supply worldwide. The numbers of infected patients began to recede and the pandemic ended. However, a strain of H1N1 was incorporated into the yearly trivalent vaccine for the 2010-2011 flu season because the virus was present in the world populations.''As stated in the first section of this article, a new strain of swine flu, (H3N2)v, was detected in 2011; it has not affected any large numbers of people in the current flu season. However, another antigenically distinct virus with the same H and N components (termed H3N2 (note no ""v"") has caused flu in humans; viral antigens were incorporated into the 2013-2014 seasonal flu shots and nasal spray vaccines.''In India in 2015-2016, a large outbreak of swine flu killed more than 1,900 people. During 2016, the numbers of infected people and deaths due to swine flu dropped, but now in 2017 there is a marked resurgence of the disease. The new outbreak of swine flu that began in January 2017 has resulted in 22,186 people being diagnosed with the infection. There have been 1,094 recorded deaths in 8 months, and the spread of the infection shows no signs of slowing. In the first three weeks of August 2017, 342 deaths were due to swine flu. Unfortunately, private hospitals and clinics do not have to report the number of swine flu diagnoses or deaths, so it is possible according to one medical director of a private clinic, that the current statistics represent ""possibly just the tip of the iceberg."" In the U.S., the 2017-2018 flu season was termed a high severity season by the CDC because an estimated 80,000 people died of flu and its complications.' "
"What 
are the risk factors for swine flu?","'Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for people who are at increased risk for severe complications from influenza or at higher risk for influenza-related doctor or hospital visits. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to the following people since these populations have a higher risk for H1N1 and some other viral infections according to the CDC:'   All children 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of age All people 50 years of age and older Adults and children who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma) or cardiovascular (except isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurological, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) People who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by HIV) Women who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities American Indians/Alaska natives People who are morbidly obese (BMI ≥40) Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, health care personnel treating patients) Household contacts and caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 50 years of age and older, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children less than 6 months age Household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza"
Is it possible to prevent swine flu with a vaccine?,"'The CDC recommends for the 2018-2019 flu season that everyone 6 months old and older should get a flu shot to prevent or reduce the chance of getting the flu. The best way to prevent novel H1N1 swine flu is vaccination. The CDC recommendations that apply to H1N1, H3N2, and other flu viruses are almost identical to those above-mentioned recommendations for patients at risk when vaccine doses are limited and are as follows:''The CDC occasionally makes changes and updates its information on vaccines and other recommendations about any current flu pandemics. The CDC states, ""for the most accurate health information, visit http://www.cdc.gov or call 1-800-CDC-INFO, 24/7."" Caregivers should check the vaccine package inserts for more detailed information on the vaccines when they become available.''The CDC says that a good way to prevent any flu disease is to avoid exposure to the virus; this is done by frequent hand washing, not touching your hands to your face (especially the nose and mouth), and avoiding any close proximity to or touching any person who may have flu symptoms. Since the virus can remain viable and infectious for about 48 hours on many surfaces, good hygiene and cleaning with soap and water or ''alcohol''-based hand disinfectants are also recommended. Some physicians say face masks may help prevent getting airborne flu viruses (for example, from a cough or sneeze), but others think the better use for masks would be on those people who have symptoms and sneeze or cough.''The use of Tamiflu, Relenza, or other antivirals may help prevent the flu if taken before symptoms develop or reduce symptoms if taken within about 48 hours after symptoms develop. Some investigators say that administration of these drugs is still useful after 48 hours, especially in high-risk patient populations. However, taking these drugs is not routinely recommended for prevention for the healthy population because investigators suggest that as occurs with most drugs, flu strains will develop resistance to these medications. During the H1N1 pandemic, the CDC made further suggestions about the use of these antiviral medications and developed the interim guidelines for use of Tamiflu, Relenza, and recently updated information for new antivirals peramivir (Rapivab) and Xofluza as follows:''In general, people who have symptoms often undertake preventive measures to prevent the spread of flu. Symptomatic people should stay at home, avoid crowds, and take off from work or school until the disease is no longer transmittable (about two to three weeks) or until medical help and advice is sought. Sneezing, coughing, and nasal secretions need to be kept away from other people; simply using tissues and disposing of them will help others. Quarantining patients is usually not warranted, but such measures depend on the severity of the disease. The CDC recommends that people who appear to have an influenza-like illness upon arrival at work or school or become ill during the day be promptly separated from other people and be advised to go home until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever (100 F [37.8 C] or greater), or signs of a fever, without the use of fever-reducing medications. The novel H1N1 swine flu disease takes about seven to 10 days before ''fevers'' stop, but research data suggests waiting until the cough is gone since many people are still infectious about one week after fever is gone. However, the CDC did not extend their recommendations to stay home for that extra week.' Are aged 6 months through 4 years (59 months) Are aged 50 years and older Have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) Are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus) Are or will be pregnant during the influenza season Are aged 6 months through 18 years and receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who therefore might be at risk for experiencing Reye's syndrome after influenza virus infection Are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities Are American Indians/Alaska Natives Are morbidly obese (body-mass index is 40 or greater) Are health care personnel Are household contacts and caregivers of children aged younger than 5 years and adults aged 50 years and older, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children aged younger than 6 months Are household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza As in previous recommendations, all children aged 6 months to 8 years of age who receive a seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time should receive two doses. Children who received only one dose of a seasonal influenza vaccine in the first influenza season should receive two doses rather than one in the following influenza season. A newly approved inactivated trivalent vaccine containing 60 mcg of hemagglutinin antigen per influenza vaccine virus strain (Fluzone High-Dose [Sanofi Pasteur]) is an alternative inactivated vaccine for people 65 years of age and older. Patients with high-risk factors should discuss flu symptoms and when to use antiviral medications; doctors should provide a prescription for the antiviral drug for the patient to use if the patient is exposed to flu or develops flu-like symptoms without having to go in to see the doctor. ""Watchful waiting"" was added as a response to taking antiviral medications, with the emphasis on the fact that those people who develop fever and have a preexisting health condition should then begin the antiviral medication. The antiviral medications are the first-line medicines for treatment of novel H1N1, H3N2, and H3N2v flu, and many viruses are to date susceptible to Tamiflu, Relenza, Rapivab, and Xofluza."
Is it possible to prevent swine flu if the swine flu vaccine (or other flu strain vaccines) is not readily available?,"'Although vaccination is the best way to prevent the swine flu, there may be times in the future when the swine ''flu vaccine'"" may not be available. There are no shortages of the trivalent flu vaccine that contains H1N1 antigens. However, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, this situation did occur so people wanted to know what they could do to protect themselves. If, in the future, vaccine supplies do not meet demands, there are some things people can do to try and prevent infection. Without vaccination, the best strategy is to not allow any virus type to contact a person's ""'mucus''. Quarantining any virus-infected people is an extreme measure that may work in some instances (for example, China used this method), but even with quarantining, the virus may still spread by people who have minimal or no symptoms.''The next step, that is easier to be implemented by individuals, is for people with the disease to self-quarantine until they become noninfectious (about seven to 10 days after flu symptoms abate). Infected people can wear surgical masks to reduce the amount of droplet spray from ''coughs'' and sneezes and throw away contaminated tissues. Unfortunately, these approaches depend on the compliance of many other people, and the likelihood that such methods will be highly successful in preventing flu virus infections, at best, is only fair. Such methods did not stop the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, although they may have some benefit for a few individuals.'""Yet there are still some other methods available to individuals. Perhaps the best way for individuals to try to prevent flu virus infection is a combination of methods that are aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle that if the virus doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, infection will be prevented. The methods are as follows:""'These six steps can help prevent individuals from getting H1N1 and other types of infection, but for many people, adherence to them may be difficult at best. However, there are some additional strategies that may also help prevent viral infections in unvaccinated people according to some investigators. Saline nasal washes and gargling with saline (or a commercial product) as a way to reduce or eliminate viral virus from mucus membranes has been suggested. Proponents of these methods base their rationale on the fact that flu viruses usually take about two to three days to proliferate in nasal/throat cells. While nasal washes and gargling may be soothing to some people, there are no studies that indicate H1N1 or other viruses are killed, inactivated, or completely removed by these methods; conversely, there are no data suggesting these methods cannot have any effect on H1N1. However, with long-term nasal washes using Neti pots, ''sinus infection'' with other pathogens may be encouraged.''Other investigators and physicians have offered additional methods that may help reduce exposure to H1N1 virus. For example, Dr. Gerberding, a former CDC director, had several suggestions about how to avoid H1N1 infection on an airplane. She suggested the following:''Variations of her suggestions may be applicable in many different social or work, or travel situations, but there are no data to prove these methods are effective. In addition, common-sense precautions such as not drinking or eating things touched by others, avoiding casual physical contacts (for example, handshakes, social hugs or kisses, public water fountains [these are OK if you touch nothing and lips only touch flowing water], banisters on stairways, and restroom door handles) will limit exposure to H1N1 and other viruses. Again, these common-sense suggestions lack data substantiation.''Many investigators suggest that people stay well hydrated, take ''vitamins'"", and get plenty of rest, but these precautions will not prevent H1N1 or other viral infections, although they may help reduce the effects of infection by strengthening the person's immune system to fight infection. Similarly, current antiviral medications (described in the preceding section) act on H1N1 and other viruses that have already infected cells; they work by preventing or reducing viral particles from aggregating and being released from infected cells. Timing is important; if only a few cells are infected and the antiviral medications are administered quickly (usually before flu symptoms develop or within 48 hours), the viruses are reduced in number (they cannot easily bud out from the cell surface), so few, if any, other respiratory or mucus membrane cells become infected. This can result in either no flu symptoms or, if a larger number of cells were initially infected, less severe symptoms. The overall effect for the person is that the H1N1 or other viral infection was prevented (it was not; the symptoms were prevented from developing) or that symptoms were reduced.""'In the strictest sense of the word prevention, even effective vaccines do not ""prevent"" infections. What they do accomplish is to alert the immune system to be on guard for certain antigens that are associated with a specific disease-causing agent (for example, H1N1 virus, pneumococcal bacteria). When the agent first infects the host, its antigens are recognized, and these cause a rapid immune response to occur that prevents the pathogen from spreading and developing symptoms in the host. People, including physicians and researchers, often term this complex response to vaccination as ""prevention of infection,"" but what actually occurs is the prevention of further infection so well that symptoms do not develop or are minimal in the host.'""In summary, if H1N1 or other viruses fail to contact cells they can infect, the disease will be prevented. As stated above, this is difficult, but not impossible, to do in almost all societies. Prevention of flu symptoms of infection is possible with antiviral medications if these are given very early in the infection. There are many other methods that may reduce the chance of getting the virus on a person's mucosal surface, but most methods have not been backed up with objective data. Most doctors and investigators suggest that items that help boost or allow the immune response to function well will help people resist H1N1 and other viral infections and reduce symptoms, but these also do not prevent infections. Consequently, while waiting for a specific antiviral vaccine to be developed or become available, there are some ways individuals can improve their chances of preventing or reducing the ""'symptoms of flu'' virus infections. All of these suggestions apply to H3N2v-caused swine flu as well. Because H3N2v flu has been more closely related to pigs, pig farming and county fairs, people who are at higher risk (see above) should avoid contacting pigs in these settings.' Kill or inactivate the virus before it reaches a human cell by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing clothing and taking a shower will do the same for the rest of your body. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available, and use sanitizers on objects that many people may touch (for example, doorknobs, computer keyboards, handrails, phones), although some researchers suggest that such sanitizers are generally ineffective. Do not touch your mouth, eyes, nose, unless you first do items 1 or 2 above. Avoid crowds, parties, and especially people who are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing droplets do not travel more than 4 feet, so experts suggest 6 feet away is a good distance to stay). If you cannot avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain aware of people around you and use the 6-foot rule with anyone coughing or sneezing. Do not reach for or eat snacks out of canisters or other containers at parties. Avoid touching anything within about 6 feet of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the droplets that contain virus fall and land on anything usually within that range. Studies show that individuals who wear surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation of some H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 50% of airborne exposures and offer no protection against surface droplets. However, masks on H1N1 infected people can markedly reduce the spread of infected droplets. If a person is next to you or near (within 6 feet) and is coughing/sneezing, ask the flight attendant to offer the person a mask. If there are available seats 6 feet or more away from the coughing/sneezing person, ask to change your seat (planes are good means of travel because the air is recirculated through HEPA filters that can capture viruses, but even the filters will not help if people touch areas where droplets have landed; HEPA filters are usually not available in buses, cars, ships, or trains). Turn away from the coughing/sneezing person and turn the air vent toward the person to blow the droplets away from yourself."
Are there home remedies for swine flu?,"'There are many flu ""cures"" and ""treatments"" described on the Internet (for example, how cayenne pepper, menthol, or ''ginseng'' can be used to treat the flu); before using any of these substances, check with a doctor. However, there are many over-the-counter medications, such as ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'' and others) and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), to reduce fever and discomfort, lozenges to sooth a ''sore throat'', and decongestants to help manage mucus production and coughing. These medications help manage flu symptoms but do not cure the viral disease.' "
Was swine flu (H1N1) a cause of an epidemic or pandemic in the 2009-2010 flu season?,"'Yes. An epidemic is defined as an outbreak of a contagious disease that is rapid and widespread, affecting many individuals at the same time. The swine flu outbreak in Mexico fit this definition. A pandemic is an epidemic that becomes so widespread that it affects a region, continent, or the world. On June 11, 2009, WHO officials determined that H1N1 2009 influenza A swine flu reached WHO level 6 criteria (person-to-person transmission in two separate WHO-determined world regions) and declared a swine flu pandemic, the first flu pandemic in 41 years. The H1N1 flu reached over 200 different countries on every continent except Antarctica in the 2009-2010 flu season; fortunately, the severity of the disease did not increase. The following is the CDC data for mortality and morbidity of the 2009 epidemic in the U.S.: Final estimates were published in 2011 and state that from April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, approximately 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (8,868-18,306) occurred in the United States due to H1N1. An outbreak in India that became widespread in that country lasted until late 2016. However, in 2017 another outbreak occurred.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) and complications for patients who get swine flu?,"'In general, the majority (about 90%-95%) of people who get the disease feel terrible (see symptoms) but recover with no problems, as seen in patients in Mexico, the U.S., and many other countries.''People with suppressed immune systems historically have worse outcomes than uncompromised individuals; investigators suspect that as swine flu spreads, the mortality rates may rise and be high in this population. Current data suggest that pregnant individuals, children under 2 years of age, young adults, and individuals with any immune compromise or debilitation are likely to have a worse prognosis. Complications of swine flu may resemble severe viral pneumonia or the ''SARS'' (''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' caused by a coronavirus strain) outbreak in 2002-2003 in which the disease spread to about 10 countries with over 7,000 cases, caused over 700 deaths, and had a 10% mortality rate. At the beginning of the pandemic, the numbers of people with ''flu-like'' illness were higher than usual and the illness initially affected a much younger population than the conventional flu. As the pandemic progressed, more young children became infected than usual, but the mortality statistics became more similar to the conventional flu mortality rate, with an older population (especially ages 50-64) having the highest death rate. Pneumonia (viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia), is the most serious complication of the flu as it can cause death. Other complications include sinus and ''ear infections'', ''asthma'' exacerbations, and/or ''bronchitis''.' "

Is it safe for pregnant women to get a flu shot?,"'The seasonal flu shot has been given to millions of pregnant women over many years. Flu shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their ''babies''. The 2009 H1N1 flu shot is made in the same way and in the same places as the seasonal flu shot. It is very important for pregnant women to get both the seasonal flu shot and the 2009 H1N1 flu shot. ''Anybody who will be taking care of babies younger than 6 months of age should get a seasonal flu shot and a 2009 H1N1 flu shot to protect against the flu.

How is 2009 H1N1 flu treated?," 2009 H1N1 flu is treated with antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu® (oseltamivir) 
or Relenza® (zanamivir). Antiviral drugs are prescription pills, liquids or an 
inhaled powder that fight against the flu by keeping the germs from growing in 
your body. These medicines work best if they are taken as soon as you have 
symptoms of the flu. For that reason, it is important that you call your doctor 
as soon as you notice flu-like symptoms.  If your doctor prescribes an antiviral to treat your flu, you will need to 
take it for 5 days. The medicine can make you get better faster and make your 
symptoms milder.  At this time, there have been no reports to show harm to the pregnant woman 
or her unborn baby. Flu can cause serious illness and even death in pregnant 
women. Taking antiviral medicine can help prevent these severe outcomes.  Antiviral medicines can be taken at any stage during pregnancy.  Treat any fever right away. Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) is best for a pregnant

Why does CDC advise pregnant women to receive the 2009 H1N1 influenza (flu) vaccine (shot)?,"'Getting the flu shot is the single best way to protect against the flu. It is important for a pregnant woman to receive both the 2009 H1N1 flu shot and the seasonal flu shot. A pregnant woman who gets any type of flu has a greater chance for serious health problems. Compared with people in general who get 2009 H1N1 flu (formerly called ""''swine flu''""), pregnant women with 2009 H1N1 flu are more likely to be admitted to hospitals. Pregnant women are also more likely to have serious illness and death from 2009 H1N1 flu. When a pregnant woman gets a flu shot, it can protect both her and her baby. Research has found that pregnant women who had a flu shot get sick less often with the flu than do pregnant women who did not get a flu shot. Babies born to mothers who had a flu shot in pregnancy also get sick with flu less often than do babies whose mothers did not get a flu shot. ' "
Will the seasonal flu shot also protect against the 2009 H1N1 flu?,"'Seasonal flu and 2009 H1N1 flu are caused by different viruses. The seasonal ''flu vaccine'' will not protect against the 2009 H1N1 flu. Also, the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine will not protect against seasonal flu. ' "
Are there flu vaccines that pregnant women should not get?,"'The seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccines can be given by shot or by nasal spray. Pregnant women should get the ""flu shot"" - a vaccine made with killed flu virus. This one is given with a needle, usually in the arm. The other type of flu vaccine - a nasal spray - is not approved for pregnant women. This vaccine is made with live, weakened flu virus. Nasal spray flu vaccine should be used only in healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant. The nasal spray vaccine is safe for women after they have delivered, even if they are ''nursing''.' "
"Can the seasonal flu shot and the 2009 H1N1 flu shot be given at the same 
time?","'Seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu shots can be given on the same day but should be given at different sites (e.g., one shot in the left arm and the other shot in the right arm). If a woman is getting her vaccines after delivery, she can get the nasal spray flu vaccine. However, she should not get the seasonal and 2009 H1N1 nasal spays on the same day; they should be given 4 weeks apart.' "
Is the 2009 H1N1 flu shot safe for pregnant women?,"'The seasonal flu shot has been given to millions of pregnant women over many years. Flu shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies. The 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine is being made in the same way and at the same places where the seasonal flu vaccine is made. ''Studies to test the 2009 H1N1 flu shots in healthy children and adults and pregnant women are being done now. Results are available from some of the studies done in non-pregnant adults and children. These results show that the immune system responded well to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and the safety results were very similar to those seen in studies of seasonal flu vaccine. These studies are being conducted by the National Institute of ''Allergy'' and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the vaccine manufacturers. ''There is no evidence that thimerosal (a mercury preservative in vaccine that comes in multi-dose vials) is harmful to a pregnant woman or a fetus. However, because some women are concerned about thimerosal during pregnancy, vaccine companies are making preservative-free seasonal flu vaccine and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine in single-dose syringes for pregnant women and small children. CDC advises pregnant women to get flu shots either with or without thimerosal. ''Adjuvants are agents that are sometimes added to a vaccine to make it more effective. There are no adjuvants (such as squalene) in either the 2009 H1N1 or seasonal flu shot used in the United States. ''Both seasonal flu shots and 2009 H1N1 flu shots are recommended for pregnant women at any time during pregnancy.''The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of one shot for full protection for persons 10 years and older. Therefore, a pregnant woman is recommended to get one dose of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. ''A pregnant woman who had a flu-like illness at any time in the past should still get the 2009 H1N1 shot because she cannot assume that the illness she had was caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus. Pregnant women who had flu symptoms in the past do not need to be tested now, but should get the vaccine. ' "
What are the possible side effects of the 2009 H1N1 flu shots?,"'The side effects from 2009 H1N1 flu shots are expected to be like those from seasonal flu shots. The most common side effects after flu shots are mild, such as being sore and tender and/or red and swollen where the shot was given. Some people might have ''headache'', muscle aches, fever, and ''nausea'' or feel tired. If these problems happen, they usually begin soon after the shot and may last as long as 1-2 days. Some people may faint after getting any shot. Sometimes, flu shots can cause serious problems like severe ''allergic'' reactions. But, life-threatening allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare. A person who has a severe (life-threatening) ''allergy'' to eggs or to anything else in the vaccine should not get the shot, even if she is pregnant. Pregnant women should tell the person giving the shots if they have any severe ''allergies'' or if they have ever had a ''severe allergic reaction'' following a flu shot.''In 1976, an earlier type of swine flu vaccine was associated with cases of a severe paralytic illness called ''Guillain-Barre Syndrome'' (GBS) at a rate of approximately 1 case of GBS per 100,000 persons vaccinated. Some studies done since 1976 have shown a small risk of GBS in persons who received the seasonal ''influenza'' vaccine. This risk is estimated to be no more than 1 case of GBS per 1 million persons vaccinated. Other studies have shown no increase in risk of GBS. Pregnant women should tell the person giving the shots if they have ever had GBS.' "
What about the H1N1 nasal spray vaccine?,"'Pregnant women should not receive nasal spray for the seasonal or 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine, but it is okay for a pregnant woman to be around a family member or another close contact who has received nasal spray flu vaccine. The nasal spray vaccine can be used in healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant and in women after they deliver, even if they are nursing. ''Yes. No special precautions are needed. Nurses and doctors should wash their hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub before and after giving the vaccine.''The nasal spray flu vaccine has not been approved for pregnant women. It differs from the flu shot because it is made with live, weakened virus. However, sometimes a pregnant woman might get the nasal spray flu vaccine—for example, before she knew she was pregnant. If this happened, she would not be expected to have any additional problems. The weakened, live flu virus has never been shown to be passed to the unborn baby. However, if a woman does get the nasal spray vaccine while she is pregnant, she should talk to her healthcare provider.''Yes. Besides protecting her from infection, the shot may also help protect her infant. Flu shots are only given to infants 6 months of age and older. Everyone who lives with or gives care to an infant less than 6 months of age should get both the seasonal flu and 2009 H1N1 vaccines. A woman can get either the shots or the nasal spray after she delivers. ' "
What about breastfeeding and the H1N1 influenza and vaccination safety?,"""Yes. Both seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccines should be given to breastfeeding mothers and breastfeeding women can receive either the shot or the nasal spray form of the vaccine. Breastfeeding is fully compatible with flu vaccination, and preventing the flu in mothers can reduce the chance that the infant will get the flu. Also, by breastfeeding, mothers can pass on to the infant the antibodies that their bodies make in response to the flu shots, which can reduce the infant's chances of getting sick with the flu. This is especially important for infants less than 6 months old, who have no other way of receiving vaccine antibodies, since they are too young to be vaccinated.""""Take everyday precautions such as washing your hands with plain soap and water before feeding your baby. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub to clean your hands before feeding your baby. In addition, try not to cough or sneeze in the baby's face while feeding your baby, or any other time you and your baby are close. If possible, only family members who are not sick should care for infants. If you are sick and there is no one else to care for your baby, wear a facemask, if available and tolerable, and cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when ""'coughing'' or ''sneezing''. ''Infants are thought to be at higher risk for severe illness from 2009 H1N1 infection and very little is known about ''prevention'' of 2009 H1N1 flu infection in infants. If you are breastfeeding or giving your baby ''infant formula'', a cautious approach would be to protect your baby from exposure to the flu virus in the following ways:'""There are many ways that breastfeeding and breast milk protect babies' health. Flu can be very serious in young babies. Babies who are not breastfed get sick from infections like the flu more often and more severely than babies who are breastfed.""""Since this is a new virus, we don't know yet about specific protection against it. Mothers pass on protective antibodies to their baby during breastfeeding. Antibodies are a type of protein made by the immune system in the body. Antibodies help fight off infection. ""'If you are sick with flu and are breastfeeding, someone who is not sick can give your baby your expressed milk. ''No. Because mothers make antibodies to fight diseases they come in contact with, their milk is custom-made to fight the diseases their babies are exposed to as well. This is really important in young babies when their immune system is still developing. It is OK to take medicines to prevent the flu while you are breastfeeding. You should make sure you wash your hands often and take everyday precautions. However, if you develop symptoms of the flu such as fever, cough, or ''sore throat'', you should ask someone who is not sick to care for your baby. If you become sick, someone who is not sick can give your baby your expressed milk.''Yes. Mothers who are breastfeeding and taking medicine to treat flu because they are sick should express their breast milk for bottle feedings, which can be given to your baby by someone who is not sick. Mothers who are breastfeeding and are taking medicines to prevent the flu because they have been exposed to the virus should continue to feed their baby at the breast as long as they do not have symptoms of the flu such as fever, cough, or ''sore throat''.''Yes. One of the best things you can do for your sick baby is keep breastfeeding. ' Ask for help from someone who is not sick to feed and care for your baby, if 
possible.  If there is no one else who can take care of your baby while you are 
	sick, try to wear a face mask at all times when you are feeding or caring 
	for your baby. You should also be very careful about washing your hands and 
	taking everyday precautions to prevent your baby from getting flu. 
Using a cloth blanket between you and your baby during feedings might also help. 
	 If you are breastfeeding, someone who is not sick can give your baby your 
expressed milk. Ideally babies less than about 6 months of age should get their 
feedings from breast milk. It is OK to take medicines to treat the flu while you 
are breastfeeding.  Do not stop breastfeeding if your baby is sick. Give your baby many chances 
to breastfeed throughout the illness. Babies who are sick need more fluids than 
when they are well. The fluid babies get from breast milk is better than 
anything else, even better than water, juice, or Pedialyte® because it also 
helps protect your baby's immune system.  If your baby is too sick to breastfeed, he or she can drink your milk from a 
cup, bottle, syringe, or eye-dropper. "
What is swine flu?,"'Swine flu'' is a term that is being replaced by the designation ''H1N1'' ''influenza'' and refers to a particular type of influenza virus that has a genetic makeup that includes viral genes that are associated with the infection of pigs. Swine ''flu'' was the cause of an influenza outbreak that was considered to be a pandemic in 2009. The term swine flu came about because the type of influenza virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic, H1N1, contained genetic elements of influenza virus that were mainly thought to be characteristic for influenza strains that caused ''flu-like symptoms'' in pigs but had genetically changed to be able to cause flu in humans.''Additionally, another type of swine flu virus, H3N2v, has been discovered. It is not as ''contagious'' as H1N1, but there are reports of this virus spreading from pigs to humans. In general, this swine flu is similar in most aspects to the disease caused by H1N1, but it is apparently less severe and is not easily spread from person to person. This article will focus on the swine flu virus H1N1.' "
Is swine flu (H1N1) contagious?,"'Swine flu is contagious from person to person. It can be spread through the air by droplets produced by ''sneezing'', ''coughing'', or by direct contact with saliva or mucus secretions. In addition, the virus can survive for a short time outside the infected individual, so people can indirectly contact H1N1 by touching areas (desks, utensils, cups, tabletops, for example) where droplets have recently landed after an infected person with the virus has inadvertently contaminated a surface.' "
What is the contagious period for swine flu (H1N1)?,"'The contagious period for H1N1 is about one day before symptoms develop to about a week after symptoms develop in individuals who spontaneously overcome the infection. In severely infected people and in some children, some contagious ''viruses'' may be shed for a few weeks.' "
How will I know if I have swine flu?,"'Symptoms of swine flu (H1N1) begin like regular ''flu symptoms'' and include ''fever'', ''sore throat'', ''cough'', body aches, ''headaches'', ''chills'', and ''fatigue''. Some individuals may also have ''diarrhea'' and ''vomiting''. The majority of people with swine flu are not diagnosed definitively with tests. Unfortunately, these symptoms can be similar to those produced by other diseases so usually a person finds out that they have swine flu (H1N1) after contacting their physician, who can run several different blood tests and other viral identification tests to determine what type of flu or other illness may be present. The tests are usually run on those with more severe symptoms.' "
How is swine flu transmitted?,"'Swine flu (H1N1) is spread by person-to-person contact by either touching surfaces contaminated by an infected person or by encountering expelled droplets produced when a person is coughing or sneezing. Consequently, swine flu is spread both directly and indirectly by infected individuals to others. However, the spread of swine flu is not 100% effective, as researchers have suggested that people living in the same house with someone infected by the H1N1 virus will have only an 8%-19% chance of getting infected.' "
How will I know if I am cured of swine flu?,"'The majority of people who get swine flu (H1N1) spontaneously ""cure"" themselves with their effective immune response. Others may benefit from the use of antiviral medications and/or supportive therapy, which can include hospitalization for those patients who have severe infections. Unfortunately, even though individuals can be cured of a specific viral type, influenza viruses (including ones that fall into the general category of swine flu viruses) mutate fairly rapidly so that immune protection against one viral type does not mean that a person will be fully or even partially protected against other influenza virus types. This is the reason that each year a new ''vaccine'' is typically produced for the flu season that is designed to protect vaccinated people against the predominant influenza types expected to be present in the population.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about swine flu (H1N1)?,"'Most people who become infected with H1N1 viruses do not need to contact a medical ''caregiver'"" because the symptoms abate and the infected individual recovers over a period of about a week or so. However, if the symptoms become serious (for example, the patient's symptoms worsen), it is important to contact a physician urgently or possibly emergently. Anyone with symptoms of ""'shortness of breath'', ''confusion'', rapid ''breathing'', reduced responsiveness, or bluish skin (especially in children) should be taken to an emergency department.''Those with suppressed immune function, those who have multiple medical problems, or who are ''pregnant'' and suspect they have become infected with swine flu (H1N1) should contact their physician immediately. If they have any of the more severe symptoms listed above, they should consider going to an emergency department.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'The symptoms of swollen feet and swollen ankles depend on the underlying causes mentioned above.'   In general, swelling caused by dependent edema, pregnancy, medications, and most diseases produce swelling that is bilateral (present in both feet or ankles ) and usually begins as a soft, puffy skin enlargement in the feet that spreads rapidly (often within hours) to the ankles. The skin is easily indented when pressed down with a finger and slowly returns to its more puffy state when the finger pressure is removed. Indentations seen in the puffy skin when shoes or socks are removed are classic signs of swelling. The skin color with this swelling is often normal or slightly pale; indentation marks are slightly darker than the surrounding swollen tissue. Many individuals can simply position themselves on their backs, elevate their feet and ankles higher than their hearts, and after some time (often a few hours), the swelling may resolve completely. However, in some chronic diseases and with some medications taken for long time periods, the swelling becomes chronic and the skin becomes more rigid, reddish and sometimes mildly discolored or mottled and will not return to normal after a few hours of elevation. For example, many people with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) will have chronic bilateral swelling of feet and ankles with skin changes."
What are common causes of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Swollen ankles and swollen feet have numerous causes. Medically, the word ""swollen"" means protuberant or abnormally distended. Thus, if an ankle or foot is swollen, means it is increased in size. In most common situations, when the word swollen is used in reference to feet and ankles, the user implies the distention or size increase is due to an increase of fluid in the tissues (also termed edema). However, the broad definition includes any factors that increase ankle or foot size (for example increased or excess fluids, increased inflammatory cells or both). Because the majority of factors that cause foot swelling also may cause ankle swelling, this article will discuss swelling as a general topic to cover both foot and ankle swelling. Some of the few exceptions where only foot or ankle swelling occur without both being involved will be discussed. Swollen feet and ankles usually are a symptom or sign of some underlying problem, the majority of which are not a major cause for concern. However, in some instances, foot, ankle, and toes swelling may warn a person that an underlying problem needs immediate medical attention.''The causes of swollen feet and ankles are numerous; examples of the most of the major causes include:''Picture of ''pitting edema'   Dependent swelling (or edema): swelling due to standing or walking (usually over some time period that varies from person to person) Pregnancy: the normal swelling that most pregnant women experience during pregnancy Medications (side effects): Many medications have the side effects of fluid retention that manifests as swelling. Although the reader is advised to check their individual medications for side effects of swelling, general drug categories that may cause swelling include anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and NSAIDs), hormones, medications for people with diabetes, antidepressants, and many calcium channel blockers (anti-hypertensive and cardiac medications). Injury: Any trauma to the foot or ankle (usually sprains or fractures) can result in swelling. Diseases: heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease (all of these diseases can influence fluid mobilization in the body by physical, metabolic and electrolyte-water interactions) Infection: any infection, either localized (abscess) or diffuse (cellulitis) Lymphedema: swelling due to lymph vessel or lymph node blockage of lymph fluid Blood clot(s): blockage of blood vessels (usually venous) that cause fluid to leak out of vessels into tissue"
Who is at risk for swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'A large number of people are at risk for swollen ankles and feet. Below are listed the causes and those people at risk:' Dependent swelling (or edema): people who are standing or walking for long periods like salespersons, mothers with children, construction workers, obese individuals, and individuals with underlying health problems (see below) Pregnancy: most normal pregnant females, especially in the last trimester. Medications (side effects): people taking anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and NSAIDs), hormones, medications for people with diabetes, antidepressants, and many calcium channel blockers (anti-hypertensive and cardiac medications). Injury: any person with trauma to the foot or ankle Diseases: Patients with heart disease (especially congestive heart failure), liver disease, kidney disease (all of these diseases can influence fluid mobilization in the body by physical, metabolic and electrolyte-water interactions) Infection: any person infected, either localized (abscess) or diffuse (cellulitis)of the foot or ankle Lymphedema: Persons with lymph vessel or lymph node blockage of lymph fluid, due to infections, trauma or surgical procedures Blood clot(s): People with blockage of blood vessels (usually venous) that cause fluid to leak out of vessels into tissue There are other causes that are less frequent and intermittent (for example, gout or hairline ankle fractures)."
What medical conditions cause symptoms of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Occasionally, ''specific medical problems'' will show additional or relatively unique symptoms, for example:''Injury or infection'' of the ankle is usually unilateral, but can be bilateral. Injury or infection is often, in the early stages, limited to either the foot or the ankle, but may spread to each other. Swelling due to trauma usually is localized to the injured area (for example, ''ankle sprain'' or ''plantar fasciitis'' in the foot); in some instances, the swollen skin area may be damaged by ''abrasion'', ''laceration'', or ''bruised''. ''Pain'' usually accompanies traumatic foot or ankle injury. Some infections of the foot or ankle may show localized swelling due to abscess formation (tight smooth skin, warm, and sometimes oozing pus) while other infections (cellulitis) show generalized swelling and warm skin, often with redness of the skin. ''Pain'' often is present where infection is located.' Symptoms of gout include swelling of the big toe with redness, warmth and pain, arthritis with swelling and joint pain, or electrolyte imbalance with low magnesium causing foot and leg cramps. Sudden appearance of bilateral feet and ankle swelling during pregnancy (usually after 20 weeks) can be the first symptoms noticed in females with preeclampsia. Unilateral swelling of the foot or ankle usually has the same symptoms described above if the underlying cause is unilateral lymphedema, venous insufficiency or blood clots. However, with blood clots there is often pain generated when the swollen area has pressure applied to the area. Chronic venous insufficiency often has skin changes in color and texture as described above but may also develop skin ulcers or secondary infections."
How do medical professionals diagnose swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"""Clinical observation and examination is the way swollen feet and ankles are diagnosed. A health care professional will likely ask questions about the swelling to obtain specific information and gain insight into the underlying cause of the swelling; once the cause is determined, treatments can be designed to help the patient. Simple observation and a patient's verbal description of the swollen area may be enough to presumptively diagnose the cause. For example:""'Laboratory tests are usually not used to diagnose feet and ankle swelling; however, they may be needed to be ordered in some patients to help diagnose underlying causes of the swelling. ''X-rays'' may be used to determine underlying fractures while ''CTs'' or ''MRI''s may reveal the extent of tissue damage.''Some mild hand and/or foot swelling can resolve without treatment, while other patients can be treated by their primary care doctors. Depending on the underlying cause of the swelling, such specialists as internal medicine, orthopedics, sports medicine, infectious disease, OB/GYN and cardiologists are some examples of specialists that may be consulted.' a swollen ankle that the patient ""twisted"" a day ago is probably due a sprain; a swollen foot that is warm with reddish skin in a person with diabetes, with a small cut on the foot is likely caused by an infection; a bilateral foot and ankle swelling in a cardiac patient who did not take the prescribed diuretics is probably caused by a combination of dependent edema, poor fluid management and decreased cardiac function."
What is the treatment for swollen feet and swollen ankles?,"'The treatment for swollen feet and ankles depends on the underlying cause(s). For many people, simply raising their feet above their ''heart'' or simply getting off their feet regularly during the day will reduce or eliminate the swelling. However, for many other people, treatment of the underlying cause of the swelling may include antibiotics for infections, a splint or wrap for a sprain, taking appropriate medications for ''CHF'' or ''gout''.''Emergent and urgent treatment is infrequent for foot or ankle swelling itself, but does occur for certain underlying causes where feet and ankle swelling or localized swelling is an important symptom and sometimes the major symptom. Examples include''Anytime the swelling is accompanied by other major symptoms such as ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'' or ''fever'', a health care professional (emergency department or EMS) should be contacted immediately.'   preeclampsia in pregnancy, heart failure exacerbations, liver failure, kidney failure, foot and ankle fractures, abscesses, cellulitis, and gout exacerbations."
What home remedies help soothe symptoms of swollen ankles or feet?,"""One of the best home remedies for swollen ankles, feet, and toes is to elevate the swollen extremity slightly above the level of the heart. This is easily done by having the person lie down face up on a bed or couch, and then place pillows under the heels so the feet and ankles so they are higher than the person's chest.""'Sitting on a plane seat or on the office chair (or for hours at a time anywhere!) may cause lower extremity swelling. Periodic leg muscle movement by extension and contraction by simply by occasionally walking will help. Some physicians also recommend wearing support hose or compression stockings. Other suggestions are listed in the prevention section below.'  "
What are the complications of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Swollen feet and ankles can lead to discomfort and pain when walking or ''running'' is attempted. Chronic swelling can lead to skin color changes and skin ulcers. The skin ulcers can occasionally become infected. The skin infections can be further complicated by abscess formation, cellulitis, ''necrotizing fasciitis'', and death.' "
Is it possible to prevent swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'In many situations, the swelling in feet and ankles can be reduced or prevented. The following is a list of ways to reduce or prevent ankle and feet swelling:''Because there are so many underlying causes of feet and ankle swelling, there are numerous ways to avoid or reduce the chances for their development. The reader is urged to follow up on this article by reading about ways to prevent underlying causes of swelling.' Exercise to improve circulation and fluid distribution Eat a healthy diet; too much salt may cause fluid retention, high blood pressure (hypertension), and swelling Interrupt sitting or standing several times a day and elevate the feet and ankles above the heart Lose excess weight to lessen water retention and decrease the build-up of pressure on muscles and joints Consider using support stockings or hose Examine prescription and other medications; consult with the doctor if medication may be responsible for fluid retention Avoid smoking, alcohol and other substances that can lead to underlying causes of swelling"
What is the prognosis for swollen feet and swollen ankles?,"'The majority of people with swollen feet and ankles have a good to excellent outcome because the swelling is usually reversible and has no lasting complications. However, a significant number of patients who have underlying causes that are chronic and refractory to treatment have a wider range of prognosis (good to poor) depending on how well the patient responds to both lifestyle changes and medications.' "
What should I know about swollen lymph nodes (glands)?," Lymph nodes, also referred to as lymph glands, are important part of the immune system. Lymph nodes are located throughout the body but are visible and able to be felt (palpable) only when they are enlarged or swollen. Lymph nodes are regional, and each group of them corresponds to a particular region of the body and reflects abnormalities in that region. Common areas where swollen lymph nodes are more prominent and more readily noticeable are:Behind the earIn the neckThe groinUnder the chinIn the armpits Behind the ear In the neck The groin Under the chin In the armpits Doctors and other health care professionals check these areas for enlarged or swollen lymph nodes. A wide variety infections are the most common causes of swelling of the lymph nodes, for example, strep throat, ear infections, and mononucleosis. More serious medical problems such as HIV infection, lymphomas (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) or other cancers, or lupus may cause swollen lymph glands. Rarely, a medication can cause the problem. Symptoms associated with lymph node swelling and related diseases can include pain in the area of the swelling, fever, and fatigue. Not all swollen lymph nodes are abnormal."
What are lymph nodes? What do they do?," Lymph nodes are an important part of the body's immune system and to help fight infections. Swollen lymph nodes usually caused by infection are referred to as lymphadenitis. Lymph nodes (sometimes called lymph glands) are small, soft, round, or oval structures found throughout the body and connected to each other in chain- Lymph is a watery fluid that circulates within the lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are found near these vessels. Within the capsule, lymph nodes contain certain kinds of immune cells. These cells are mainly lymphocytes, which produce proteins that capture and fight viruses and other microbes, and macrophages, which destroy and remove the captured material."
Where are the lymph nodes located in the body (pictures)?,"'Lymph nodes are located throughout the body. Some are directly under the skin while others are deep inside the body. Even the most superficial (close to the skin) lymph nodes usually are not visible or palpable (felt by touching), unless they are swollen or enlarged. Lymph nodes are connected to each other by loosely bound lymphatic essels. Lymph nodes generally coalesce in different regions in the body where they are responsible for filtering the blood and performing their immunologic function for that particular area of the body. Fluid from the lymphatic vessels eventually feeds into the venous system (veins) in the body.' "
Are swollen lymph nodes painful?,"'In general, swollen lymph nodes caused by infections, inflammation, or cancers can be painful or tender. Some benign causes of swollen lymph nodes may not be painful.' "
Common locations of swollen lymph nodes,"'Lymph nodes in various parts of the body may become swollen for different reasons. People can often see swollen lymph nodes''Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw:'' Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw are the most common. They may represent an infection around that area, such as a tooth infection or ''abscess'', throat infection, viral illness, or ''upper respiratory infection''. Most of the causes of swollen lymph nodes in this area are benign (noncancerous) but sometimes swelling of these lymph nodes may also suggest a ''cancer'' in the head and neck area.''Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear and in the occipital area (base of the skull):'' Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear or in the base of the skull may correspond to an infection around the ''scalp'' or possibly an eye (''conjunctival'') infection. The most common cause of swollen scalp lymph nodes are ''skin conditions'' affecting the scalp, such as ''dandruff'' (''seborrheic dermatitis''); or an abscess, or soft tissue infection.''The lymph nodes in the underarm (armpit, axilla):'' The lymph nodes in the underarm are anatomically important in ''breast cancer''. They are often checked physically in patients undergoing investigation for ''breast cancer''. They also play an important role in staging (determining the extent) and predicting the outcome of ''breast cancer'' during removal of the ''cancer'' tissue from the breast. Many cancers including lymphoma and ''leukemia'' can cause enlargement of these lymph nodes. (Lymphomas are cancers that originate in the lymph nodes.) These lymph nodes can also become reactive and enlarge due to ''trauma'' to or an infection of the arm on the same side.''Enlarged lymph nodes'' above the collarbone:'' Enlarged lymph nodes above the collarbone (supraclavicular ''lymphadenopathy'') are always considered abnormal. These generally suggest a ''cancer'' of or an infection in the region close by. Examples include lung infection, ''lung cancer'', lymphoma in the chest ''cavity'', or breast cancer. Occasionally cancers that are more distant may seed these lymph nodes, such as genital cancers or ''colon cancer''. Some inflammatory causes of the swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone (clavicle) can include ''tuberculosis'' or ''sarcoidosis''.''Swollen lymph nodes in the groin:'' Swollen lymph nodes in the groin may be normal in young people but they could also result from some ''sexually transmitted diseases'', local infections, infections of a lower extremity (including the foot and toes), or genital cancers.' on the neck, behind the ear, at the base of the skull (occipital area), under the jaw, above the collar bone, under the arms, and around the groin."
How do you check for swollen lymph nodes?,"'Usually lymph nodes are not visible. Once they enlarge, they can become visible in certain areas of the body. Especially behind the ear, or in your neck or groin, you might notice them as enlarged ""''bumps''."" Enlarged lymph glands can also often be felt by slowly moving your hands around the swollen area. You can determine if they are tender or not.' "
What infections and viruses cause swollen lymph nodes?,"'There are many causes for swollen lymph nodes, sometimes referred to as ""swollen glands"" (lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis). In general, lymph nodes become swollen when they are active due to either a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, inflammation, or cancer.''Viral infections are the most common causes of swollen lymph nodes. The most common cause is viral upper respiratory infections such as the ''common cold''.''Viruses that can cause swollen lymph nodes include:'

"Inflammatory diseases, cancers, and other conditions that cause swollen lymph nodes","'Inflammatory and immunologic causes of swollen lymph nodes include diseases such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''lupus'' as well as sensitivity to some medications.''Many cancers can also cause swelling of lymph nodes. These cancers may originate from the lymph nodes or blood cells such as lymphomas and some types of ''leukemia''. They may also be cancers that spread from another organ in the body (metastatic cancers). For example, breast cancer may spread to the nearest lymph nodes in the underarm (axilla), or ''lung cancer'' may spread to the lymph nodes around the collarbone.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic ''lipid'' storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, ''sarcoidosis'', and many other conditions.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic lipid storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, sarcoidosis, and various other conditions.''Lymph node swelling is not always a sign of an underlying disease. Sometimes swollen lymph nodes can be normal. For example, small (less than 1 centimeter), flat lymph nodes under the jaw (submandibular lymph nodes) in healthy children and young adults or small (up to 2 centimeters), groin lymph nodes (inguinal lymph nodes) in young individuals may be normal.''In many instances, a definitive cause for swollen lymph nodes may not be determined even after performing through examination and testing.' "
Signs and symptoms of swollen lymph nodes,"'Symptoms of swollen lymph nodes vary widely. A person could be completely free of symptoms (asymptomatic) and swollen lymph nodes are may only be found when a doctor notes them during a general physical examination.''Sometimes, swollen lymph nodes can be extremely tender, painful, and disfiguring.''Other signs and symptoms related to an underlying disease that accompany the lymph node swelling may be more significant and clinically relevant than the lymph node swelling alone. Signs and symptoms of more serious medical conditions that may cause swollen lymph nodes may include:'   Fever Night sweats Weight loss Loss of appetite Abdominal pain Swelling of multiple lymph nodes or only an isolated one Localized red patches of the skin over the lymph nodes Hard lumps or masses felt under the skin in the area of the swollen lymph node Sore throat or runny nose Local infections (toothache, sore throat)"
When should I see the doctor for swollen lymph nodes?," If you notice swollen lymph nodes, see your primary care doctor for an evaluation and possible treatment. Depending on the reason for the swelling of the lymph nodes, you might need treatment by a hematologist/oncologist (if the swollen lymph nodes can't be explained or are due to an underlying cancer) or an infectious disease specialist (if they are due to a complicated infection). Sometimes you might be referred to a surgeon to biopsy or remove the lymph node. If swollen lymph nodes are associated with fevers, night sweats, or weight loss, and the person does not have any obvious infection, he or she may need a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. People who were appropriately treated for an infection but have persistent swollen lymph nodes should see their doctor. If a person has a known cancer, or was treated for one in the past and new lymph nodes in the general area of the cancer are noted, see a doctor."
How is the cause of swollen lymph nodes diagnosed?,"""Swollen lymph nodes closer to the surface of the body are generally diagnosed by a doctor's examination and feeling for areas known to have coalescence of lymph nodes, for example, swollen lymph nodes under the arms (axillary lymph nodes), swollen lymph nodes in the sides of the neck (cervical lymph nodes), or swollen lymph nodes in the groin (inguinal lymph nodes). These swollen lymph nodes can be seen and felt easily.""'Other times, deeper lymph nodes could be seen on imaging studies, such as ''CT scan'' (computed tomography), of different parts of the body.''Tonsils'' in the back of the throat are also lymph nodes, and they are the most visible ones in the body.''Diagnosing the cause of swollen lymph nodes may be challenging. The most important component of evaluating a swollen lymph node is a thorough medical history and a complete physical examination by a doctor. The doctor may ask about symptoms such as ''sore throat'', fever and ''chills'', ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'"", a complete list of medications, sexual activity, vaccination history, recent travels, and the patient's own and his/her family's previous history of cancers if any.""'A group of lymph nodes in a particular area of the body reacts to disturbances in that general region. If there is a specific infection in the region of the swollen lymph nodes, that may be the most likely cause of swelling. For instance, infections of the leg or some sexually transmitted diseases can cause swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin area.''Physicians usually examine the lymph nodes by feeling them and characterize them based upon what the lymph nodes feel like. They could be characterized, for example, as:''These characteristics can be useful in suggesting the cause of the lymph node swelling. For example, a hard, nontender, non-moveable lymph node may be more characteristic of a cancer spread to that node. On the other hand, a soft, tender, moveable lymph node could more likely represent an infection.''If the enlarged lymph nodes are suspected to be related to a cancer, then a biopsy of the lymph node may determine the cancer type. For example, a swollen lymph node around the collar bone (supraclavicular lymph node), may signify lung cancer in a person who may have other clinical clues suggestive of lung cancer.'   Large or small Tender or non-tender Fixed or mobile Hard or soft Firm or rubbery"
What are treatments and remedies for swollen lymph nodes?,"'There is no specific treatment for swollen lymph nodes. The underlying cause needs to be treated, which may result in the resolution of the swollen lymph node.' If an enlarged lymph node causes local discomfort, home remedies include a warm, wet compress to help with pain relief. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used to help reduce swelling and pain. Prescription corticosteroid medications such as Prednisone, Medrol or Decadron may also be used for swelling. Viral infections may be treated with antiviral medications. Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for cancer may consist of chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Medications to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus may be prescribed."
How long does it take swollen lymph nodes to resolve (go away )?,"'The time it takes for a swollen lymph node to go away varies widely and depends on the underlying cause.' If an infection causes swollen lymph nodes, they may resolve in a few weeks. However, it is common for lymph nodes to remain enlarged for time even after an infection has been treated. If swollen lymph nodes are a result of an autoimmune disorder, they may shrink in size during periods of remission and then enlarge again when the illness flares up. If swollen lymph nodes are due to cancers, it depends on the type and stage of the cancer and whether it has metastasized (spread) to other parts of the body and the lymph nodes may remain enlarged for the duration of the treatment."
What are the complications of swollen lymph nodes?,"'There may be complications associated with enlarged lymph nodes. If the lymph node swelling is related to an infection that is not treated, then an abscess (a pus-containing ''cavity'') may result, which may require incisional drainage and antibiotics. The skin underlying the enlarged lymph node may also become infected.''In other cases, the lymph node may become very large and compress other nearby structures in the body. This could be a serious and debilitating problem that may require immediate medical or surgical attention. For example, the lymph node in the underarm (axilla) can compress the blood vessels and nerves supplying the arm. An enlarged lymph node inside the abdomen may compress the ''intestines'' and cause an obstruction of the intestines.'  "
What are anal cancer statistics?,"'Anal cancer'' is far more rare than ''colorectal cancer''. ''Anal cancer'' will be found in about 5,530 women and 2,770 men in 2019. It will result in about 1,280 deaths in 2019. It is more common today than it was 30 years ago.''In contrast, ''colorectal cancer'' is projected to be diagnosed in over 70,000 men and 64,000 women in 2017. It will result in about 50,000 deaths in 2017, far more than anal ''cancer''.' "
What causes anal cancer?,"'Anal ''cancer'' is most commonly caused by infection of the anal lining tissues by a high-risk type of ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'') such as ''HPV''-16. It is also more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with ''HIV'' (''human immunodeficiency virus'', the virus that can lead to ''AIDS''). ''Cigarette'' ''smokers'' also get more anal ''cancer'' than nonsmokers. Other risk factors for anal cancer usually will be those associated with the likelihood of acquiring HPV infection. Certainly, there are also cases of anal cancer for which doctors can find no certain cause.' "
What are the risk factors for anal cancer?,"'Anal ''cancer risk factors'' include the following:' Age over 50 Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection Many sexual partners Receptive anal intercourse/anal sex Smoking Conditions that impair the immune system including HIV viral infection and immunosuppressive medicines History of other pelvic cancers caused by HPV infection Recurrent anal irritation with pain and redness Race and gender: Anal cancer is more common in women than men in most ethnic groups. In African Americans, it is more common in men than women."
What are the symptoms and signs of anal cancer?,"'The symptoms and signs of anal cancers may include one or more of the following:''Many of these symptoms are easily mistaken for ''hemorrhoids''. When first encountered, these symptoms are best evaluated by a health care professional. Even if a person has known ''hemorrhoids'', a change in such symptoms and signs, such as their failure to resolve or a worsening, should also prompt examination.''Most anal cancer is found at an early or localized stage. In the unfortunate event that the disease is already spread outside of the anus, then symptoms and signs of more advanced disease can develop. These can include'   A lump or mass near the anus A tumor or lump found on self-examination Anal bleeding A sense of pressure or foreign body sensation in the anal area A change in bowel habits, such as constipation, incontinence (leakage of bowel movements), and/or diarrhea Anal discharge, which may be jelly-like and comprised of mostly mucus (It may also have a white or yellow appearance.) Yellow discharge or a white discharge from anus Mucus in stool Itchy anus: Anal pruritus is a condition where the anus feels itchy. Some people who get anal cancer report having an itching anus. However, there are a number of other conditions that can cause an itchy anus, including diet, medications, and bowel leakage. Painful defecation, anal pain, or pain in the perianal area abdominal pain, low back pain, and weight loss."
What's involved with anal cancer screening (early detection)?,"'Looking for a disease or condition in people with no symptoms or signs is called screening. Screening is performed to find cancers at an early stage when treatment can be most beneficial. As anal cancer is rare, routine screening of the general public for this condition is not recommended.''In groups at higher risk for anal cancer and especially ''precancerous'' lesions called anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), screening is appropriate. This includes men who have sex with men regardless of ''HIV'' status, women with histories of cervical and vulvar cancers, all HIV positive patients, post-transplant patients on immunosuppressive medicine, and those with a history of anal ''warts''. Anal ''warts'' are not themselves considered precancerous, but imply HPV infection is present. Certain dangerous HPV subtypes may indicate the presence of cancer or lead to cancer development.''The screening technique for AIN is called an anal ''pap smear'"" and uses the same technique used for women's pap smears. A swab is taken from the anal canal and a smear from the swab is submitted for microscopic evaluation by cytology technique. More recently, lab techniques are used to measure the presence and levels of the dangerous HPV (16 and 18) subtypes or the presence of mutations.""'Screening frequency recommendations are still being established. For now, men who have sex with men and are HIV negative should be screened every 2-3 years. If they are HIV positive, then they should be screened yearly. If an anal pap smear is positive for AIN, the patient should be referred to a surgeon for a biopsy.' "
What is multiple sclerosis (MS)?," Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks myelinated axons in the brain and spinal cord nerve fibers (central nervous system), damaging or destroying the myelin (demyelination) and/or the axons (nerve tissue). Sclerosis means abnormal hardening or thickening of tissue, often due to inflammation. Myelin is a fatty substance that covers, surrounds, and protects the nerves. Think of myelin as a conduit in an electrical system that ensures messages sent by axons (nerve fibers) are not lost en route. MS often progresses slowly over many years (about 25 years). Multiple sclerosis is most commonly diagnosed in females ages 20 to 40 but may occur at any age and both genders. Usually, multiple sclerosis in children and teens (pediatric MS) goes undiagnosed; however, medical professionals have diagnosed about 8,000 to 10,000 children and teens in the United States with the disease. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis in children, teens, and adults may have common symptoms or similar first symptoms, for example:WeaknessFatigueTinglingBlurred visionPain Weakness Fatigue Tingling Blurred vision Pain Other symptoms and signs of MS in children and teens include seizures and/or mental status changes like lethargy. People with MS often suffer intermittent attacks followed by periods of symptom remissions. Due to the intermittent nature and variety of symptoms, MS can often be a challenging diagnosis for health care providers. MS attacks can last for days or months at a time followed by remissions; some individuals however, may continue to get worse without periods of remission."
At what age does multiple sclerosis start?,"'The early signs and early ''symptoms of multiple sclerosis'' usually begin between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. However, it is possible to have MS begin in childhood (termed pediatric MS, which includes infancy to 18) or over 40 years of age, but it occurs less frequently in these age groups. Only about 2%-5% of all people diagnosed with MS (MS patients or MSers) have symptoms before age 18. ''Multiple sclerosis'' in children and teens is difficult to diagnose, so its true frequency of occurrence is only estimated. In some MS patients, there is evidence that infection with the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' may help trigger MS disease.' "
Does multiple sclerosis cause pain?,"'About two-thirds of people with MS report ''pain'' as a symptom of their disease. The most common types of ''pain'' experienced by people with MS are ''headache'', ''back pain'', extremity ''pain'', and ''muscle spasms''. Because the pain comes from the nerves, common pain medicines like ''aspirin'' have little or no effect; however, other medications may be effective. Lhermitte\'s sign is sometimes experienced by MS patients; it\'s a sharp ""electrical"" sensation that occurs in the back and into the limbs and/or runs up and down the spine (spinal cord) when the head is bent forward.' "
5 early signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis,"'Because the autoimmune inflammatory response may attack some of the myelinated axons in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) almost anywhere, the location (and severity) of each attack can be different. Consequently, the symptoms of an MS attack may be quite variable from patient to patient and can appear almost anywhere in the body. The usual first sign and symptom is often a change in sensory perception (paresthesias) almost anywhere in the body. Other early common symptoms include the following:''Because of the highly variable symptoms, this is a disease that is difficult to diagnose when symptoms first appear. The rest of the article will present symptoms that arise from various parts of the body that can be due to MS. Unfortunately, many of the symptoms described can occur in other disease processes so it is important to have a diagnosis of MS in part by ruling out other conditions.''The diagnosis of MS usually involves a ''neurologist'' who will take your medical history, do blood tests, tests to measure electrical activity in the brain and other areas, an ''MRI'', and an analysis of spinal cord fluid.

These include:' Brain surgery Brain injury Brain tumors Cancer therapy (radiation/radiotherapy and chemotherapy) Anorexia nervosa (nutritional deficiencies in eating disorders) Infections such as tuberculosis Brain aneurysm (bulging of blood vessels) Genetic disorders (Prader-Willi syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, and familial diabetes insipidus) Inflammatory disease (paraneoplastic syndrome and neurosarcoidosis)"
How is a malfunctioning hypothalamus diagnosed?,"'To diagnose if the hypothalamus is malfunctioning, laboratory tests are done that examine the patient’s blood and urine for hormones:''Other diagnostic tests include:' Cortisol Estrogen Pituitary hormonesAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH])Growth hormone (GH)Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)Luteinizing hormone (LH)Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)Prolactin Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH]) Growth hormone (GH) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Luteinizing hormone (LH) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Prolactin Testosterone Thyroid hormones Sodium levels Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  Computed tomographic (CT) scan Visual field tests (in case of a tumor) Genetic tests"
How is a malfunctioning hypothalamus treated?,"""Treatment depends on the cause of the malfunctioning hypothalamus and the patient's presenting signs and symptoms."" Hormonal deficiencies: Hormone replacement therapy (replacing the missing hormones with manmade hormonal pills, for example, levothyroxine tablets for hypothyroidism) Tumors: Surgery or radiation  Nutritional deficiency: Nutritional counseling and medications that control the patient’s appetite Kallmann syndrome: Lifelong sex hormone replacement therapy"
What are the complications of a malfunctioning hypothalamus?,"'Hormonal deficiencies due to a malfunctioning hypothalamus can cause complications such as:''If the cause of a malfunctioning hypothalamus is a ''brain tumor'', the complications can be as follows:' Growth problems (short stature) Heart problems Obesity and faulty eating habits Low blood pressure Disturbances in the water and salt levels in the body Inability to deal with stress (such as during surgery or infection) Osteoporosis (thin or fragile bones) Erection problems Infertility Difficulty during labor Breastfeeding problems A decrease in sex response Early or late puberty Mood disorders Sleep disorders Seizures (convulsions) Disturbances in vision Blindness"
What does an IBS attack feel like?,"'The most common ''symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome'' or ''IBS'' are:''Other symptoms of ''inflammatory bowel syndrome'' include''IBS symptoms'' often get worse in women during their menstrual periods. Although ''IBS'' causes considerable discomfort, it does not lead to other health problems or damages the gut.' Pain or cramps in the abdomen often related to the bowel movements Changes in the bowel movements which may be diarrhea, constipation, or both occurring alternately depending upon the type of IBS a person has Bloating or distention (a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen) Feeling that you have not finished a bowel movement Whitish, sticky discharge (mucus) in the stool Symptoms of indigestion such as nausea, heartburn, and gas"
What is IBS?,"'IBS'' or ''irritable bowel syndrome'' is a medical condition affecting the large bowel. \xa0It is a type of functional bowel or gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. This means that although it causes disturbing symptoms, it does not cause any structural damage to the bowel. Functional GI disorders are caused by problems with how the brain and\xa0gut\xa0work together (brain-gut interaction). Thus, a faulty brain-gut interaction in some people with IBS may cause the food to move too slowly or too quickly through the gut. This causes changes in bowel movements. IBS refers to a group of symptoms occurring together, including repeated ''pain'' in the abdomen, cramping, bloating, and changes in the bowel movements, which may be ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'', or both. The typical feature of IBS is that these symptoms occur without any visible signs of damage or disease in the gut. IBS can cause a huge amount of discomfort, however, it does not damage the ''intestines''.''IBS is a long term or chronic disorder. The ''symptoms of IBS'' may come and go. It is a common condition affecting about twice as many women as men. IBS is most often reported in people younger than 45 years of age. The exact cause of IBS is not known. The condition does not have any specific test for diagnosing it. Tests may be done to exclude other conditions such as Crohn’s disease, ''ulcerative colitis'', and certain ''cancers''.\xa0Most cases of IBS are effectively managed with ''diet'', ''stress management'', ''probiotics'', and medicine.' "
What are the different types of IBS?,"'Based on different patterns of changes in the bowel movements or the presence of abnormal bowel movements, IBS is of three types. Certain diets or medications may work for one type of IBS but not for the other or may make other types worse. People with IBS often have normal bowel movements on some days and abnormal bowel movements on other days.\xa0''The three types of IBS are:''IBS with ''constipation'' (IBS-C)'': It is also called constipation-predominant IBS. It presents with the following symptoms on days when the person has at least one abnormal bowel movement:''IBS with ''diarrhea'' (''IBS-D''):'' It is also known as diarrhea-predominant IBS. In ''IBS-D'', on days when the person has at least one abnormal bowel movement:''IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M)'': It is also called alternating type IBS or IBS-A. In this type of IBS, on days when there is at least one abnormal bowel movement:' more than a quarter of the stools are hard or lumpy less than a quarter of the stools are loose or watery more than a quarter of the stools are loose or watery and less than a quarter of the stools are hard or lumpy more than a quarter of the stools are hard or lumpy and more than a quarter of the stools are loose or watery"
What causes hypereosinophilic syndrome?,"'The disease is more commonly seen in male patients aged 20-50 years; the children may be affected as well.''In approximately 75% of cases, the underlying cause is still unknown. In other cases, the following could be the causes:' Myeloproliferative disorders: These are slow growing cancers that affect the red cells, white cells, and platelets in the bone marrow. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is often a part of these disorders. Genetic conditions: FIP1L1/PDGFRA gene mutation is seen in about 20% of patients of HES. This causes a particularly aggressive disease course. Increased production of a substance called interleukin-5 produced by white blood cells is implicated in a form of HES called lymphocytic HES. Sometimes, the HES runs in the family. This is due to a change (mutation) in an unknown gene passed down through a family. This form is called familial HES. If one parent has the disease, there is a 50% chance that the child will be having it. Some cases have new mutations in the gene. These people have no history of hypereosinophilia syndrome in their families."
Is hypereosinophilic syndrome curable?,"'Stem cell transplant offers a potential cure for HES; however, it clearly needs more research, and currently, it is not without its own significant risks and limitations.''At present, hypereosinophilic syndrome is manageable (but not curable) with proper ''drugs'' and ''chemotherapy''.''HES is fatal if not treated, hence early intervention and proper medication must be sought. The outcome of the treatment and organ involvement differ from person to person. You must discuss the treatment protocol with your doctor for the best guidance over this.''FIP1L1/PDGFRA\xa0mutation must be treated aggressively. Imitinib mesylate (Gleevac) is the drug of choice here, which has an excellent response rate in almost all patients.''In the patients without FIP1L1/PDGFRA\xa0mutation, the Glucocorticoids (a type of steroid medication) are used as the drug of choice. If there is no response to these, then drugs like Vincristine, ''Hydroxyurea'', or ''Cyclophosphamide'' may be used.''In cases of increased IL-5 subtypes of HES, Mepolizumab, Alemtuzumab, and Reslizumab medications show promising results.''Regular follow up tests for the ''liver'' and kidney function, serum, Vitamin B12 levels, erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR), and serum tryptase levels is a must in all patients. Even in the patients treated for the disease in the past, regular follow up with the doctor for blood tests is required to watch out for recurrence.' "

What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas, which is about the size of a hand, is located in the abdomen, just behind the stomach. It is surrounded by other organs including the small intestine, ''liver'', and spleen. The pancreas plays a vital role in converting the food into the energy essential for the body. It mainly consists of two functions: an exocrine function that helps in ''digestion'' and an endocrine function that controls blood ''sugar'' levels. Because of the deep location of the pancreas, tumors of the pancreas may be difficult to locate.''The exocrine pancreas produces natural juices called pancreatic enzymes to break down food. These enzymes travel via tubes or ducts to reach the duodenum. The pancreas makes about eight ounces of digestive juice filled with enzymes every day. The different enzymes are:''Unlike enzymes, hormones are released directly into the bloodstream. Pancreatic hormones include:' Lipase: Along with bile, these enzymes break down fats. Poor absorption of fat leads to diarrhea and fatty bowel movements. Protease: It breaks down protein in the food. Amylase: It helps to break down starch into sugar, which is then converted to energy to meet the body’s demand. Undigested carbohydrates can cause diarrhea. Insulin: This hormone is produced in the beta cells of the pancreas and helps the body to use sugar for energy. Lack of insulin can increase the blood sugar levels in the blood and then develop diabetes. Glucagon: Alpha cells produce the hormone glucagon. If blood sugar gets too low, glucagon helps to raise it by sending a message to the liver to release the stored sugar. Gastrin and amylin: Gastrin helps the stomach to make gastric acid whereas amylin helps to control appetite and stomach emptying."
What to do if your pancreas is not working properly?,"'If you observe any symptoms of the diseased pancreas, consulting a specialist is important. Pancreatic dysfunction can be debilitating.''Treatment of ''pancreatitis'' include:''Treatment of ''pancreatic cancer'' include:''Therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (''ERCP'') may be used by the physician to:' Administering intravenous fluid Antibiotics Medication for pain Surgical removal of gallstones or gallbladder Surgery Radiation Chemotherapy Enlarge duct opening Remove pancreatic or bile duct stones Dilate the narrowed pancreatic or bile duct"
How soon do early pregnancy symptoms start?,"'Some women may experience early signs and symptoms within the first weeks of pregnancy in the ''first trimester'', while others may develop symptoms later on in the pregnancy. The first signs and symptoms of early pregnancy can also be similar to symptoms experienced prior to the ''menstrual period'', so a woman may not recognize the symptoms as related to pregnancy.' "
Are pregnancy symptoms the same for every woman?,"'Symptoms of pregnancy'' can vary among different women. They may vary in quality or severity, and even the same woman may not experience the same symptoms in every pregnancy. The first signs and symptoms of pregnancy may also be noticed or begin at different points in the pregnancy. A ''pregnancy test'' is based on levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the urine or blood, and is the characteristic diagnostic test for pregnancy. hCG is a hormone produced after the fertilized egg has implanted in the wall of the uterus. Modern home ''pregnancy tests'' may sometimes be positive before a ''missed menstrual period''. Blood tests can detect pregnancy earlier than urine pregnancy tests.''This article describes the most common symptoms of pregnancy in its early and later stages.'

  "
16 Early pregnancy signs and symptoms,"'A number of symptoms begin in the early ''stages of pregnancy'':' Missed (late) period: A missed menstrual period is the hallmark symptom of pregnancy, and menstruation is absent throughout the pregnancy. Sometimes, the mild cramping and spotting experienced at the time of implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus (see later) can be mistaken for a menstrual period. Women whose menstrual cycles are irregular may also not immediately notice the absence of a menstrual period. It is uncommon for signs and symptoms of pregnancy to appear before the missed period, but if a woman’s cycles are irregular, this may happen. Implantation bleeding or cramping: Mild bleeding or spotting may occur when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining, anywhere from 6 to 12 days after fertilization. Mild cramping can also occur at this time. Implantation bleeding may sometimes be mistaken for a menstrual period, although it is usually much lighter than a regular period. Vaginal discharge: Some women may notice a thick, milky discharge from the vagina in early pregnancy. This occurs in the first weeks of pregnancy as the vaginal walls thicken. This discharge may occur throughout the pregnancy. If there is an unpleasant odor associated with the discharge, or if it is associated with burning and itching, this is a sign of a yeast or bacterial infection. You should contact your health-care professional if this occurs. Breast changes: Many women experience changes in the breasts as early as the first weeks of pregnancy. These changes can be felt as soreness, tenderness, heaviness, fullness, or a tingling sensation. The discomfort typically decreases after several weeks. Darkening of the areola: The areola, or area around the nipple, may darken in color. Fatigue: While this symptom is very nonspecific and may be related to numerous factors, pregnant women often describe feelings of fatigue from the earliest weeks of pregnancy. Morning sickness, nausea, and vomiting: This is actually a misnomer because the nausea of pregnancy can occur at any time of day. Some women never experience morning sickness, while others have severe nausea. Its most typical onset is between the 2nd and 8th weeks of pregnancy. Most women experience relief from the symptoms around the 13th or 14th week, but others may have nausea persistent throughout the pregnancy (hyperemesis gravidarum). Sensitivity to certain smells: Certain smells may bring on nausea or even vomiting early in pregnancy. Increased urination: Starting about the 6th to 8th week, some women will have more frequent urination due to hormonal changes. If other symptoms occur, such as burning on urination, you should see your health care professional make sure you are not suffering from a urinary tract infection. Dizziness or fainting: Perhaps related to hormonal changes affecting glucose levels or blood pressure, dizziness, lightheadedness, and feeling faint can occur in early pregnancy. Constipation: Hormone levels can also cause some women to have constipation in early pregnancy. Headaches: Headaches, as well, maybe related to changing hormone levels and may occur throughout pregnancy. Food aversions or cravings: Cravings may begin in early pregnancy and may last throughout the pregnancy. Likewise, food aversions (feeling nausea or distaste for a particular food) can also occur. Back pain: Often considered more a symptom of late pregnancy, low back pain can actually begin in the early stages of pregnancy. Women can experience some degree of back pain throughout pregnancy. Mood changes: Mood swings are relatively common during the first trimester of pregnancy due to changing hormone levels. They may also be related to stress or other factors. Shortness of breath: Increased oxygen demand by the body (to support a growing fetus) may leave some women feeling short of breath, although this symptom is more common in later stages of pregnancy."
8 Later symptoms and signs of pregnancy,"'Many of the early symptoms of pregnancy can persist during the second and third ''trimesters'', for example:''Certain symptoms, like tender breasts and nausea, often improve as pregnancy advances.''Additional symptoms of later pregnancy are related to the size of the growing uterus and weight gain in the ''second trimester'' until giving birth. As with symptoms of early pregnancy, not all women experience all these symptoms, and women do not experience them to the same degree.'

   Mood changes Headaches Increased urination Backache Food cravings Fatigue Weight gain: Most women gain a total of about 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. Weight gain is due to the growing fetus, placenta, breast enlargement, and increased blood and fluid volume. Your Obstetrician will follow your weight closely during your prenatal visits. Breast changes: The breasts expand throughout pregnancy; late in pregnancy, there may be an expression of colostrum (a yellowish fluid that is produced immediately after delivery) from the nipples. Heartburn: Pressure from the growing uterus may push the stomach upward and out of its normal location, leading to symptoms of heartburn. In addition, hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause relaxation of one of the sphincters controlling the reflux of acid from the stomach. Swollen feet and ankles: Pressure from the enlarged uterus may slow down the blood flow of veins in the legs, leading to fluid buildup. Varicose veins: Increased blood volume may lead to the formation of varicose veins, hemorrhoids, or small spider veins. Leakage of urine: Pressure from the uterus on the bladder leads to frequent urination (which may have begun early in pregnancy due to hormonal changes). Sometimes, women notice leakage of urine when straining during laughing, sneezing, or coughing. Shortness of breath: The uterus enlarges and pushes the diaphragm further up toward the chest, possibly causing you to become out of breath easier than before. Braxton-Hicks contractions: In the weeks before delivery, many women experience uterine contractions. Unlike true labor contractions, Braxton-Hicks contractions are weak and do not occur at regular intervals. Labor contractions increase in frequency and intensity."
What options help soothe and relieve pregnancy symptoms?,"'There are a number of home remedies and self-care strategies that can help relieve some of the unpleasant symptoms of pregnancy. Many medications, including some kinds of antibiotics, are also safe to take during pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about considering taking, or taking any ''over-the-counter'', prescription medicine, or any ''supplements'' or ''vitamins''.''The following are some self-care measures can help alleviate some of the symptoms that may be troubling:' 

Read Doctor's View
  Proper diet and exercise can help lessen symptoms by keeping weight gain under control and strengthening and toning your abdominal muscles. After the first trimester, avoid exercises that involve lying on the back for a prolonged time. A pregnancy girdle or sling can help support your abdomen. Wear comfortable shoes that are not too tight, particularly if you have swelling of the legs. Exercise caution when lifting your other children or heavy objects. Be sure to bend the knees when lifting and try to keep the back straight. Sleep on a firm mattress. Lying on your side with a pillow between your legs may be a comfortable position that provides some relief. Wear a bra that provides good support if breasts are tender or sore. Eat lots of fiber to keep the bowels moving and avoid constipation. This means fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Taking fiber or stool softeners may help. Eat small, frequent meals to combat nausea, and avoid foods that trigger nausea. Avoid fatty foods and drink plenty of fluids. Small, frequent meals can also help prevent heartburn."
Pregnancy symptoms vs. PMS (premenstrual syndrome)," Many of the symptoms of early pregnancy, like breast tenderness, fatigue, mood swings, mild cramping, back pain, and others, are also symptoms that women may experience with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or after ovulation in the days prior to their menstrual period. Until the menstrual period begins or a pregnancy test is positive, there is no way to tell whether these symptoms are related to PMS or pregnancy."
What are natural methods of contraception?,"'Natural methods of ''contraception'' are considered ""natural"" because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.''The ''fertility'' awareness methods'' (FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicate ''ovulation'' has occurred or is about to occur.'""On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next ""'menstrual period''. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days in ''fertile'' mucus), the actual time during which a woman may become ''pregnant'' is measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.''FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control. Although these methods were developed to prevent pregnancy, they can equally be well used by a couple to increase fertility and promote ''conception''.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of natural birth control?,"'Natural methods are typically very inexpensive compared to other methods of birth control unless a woman chooses to purchase ovulation test kits.' A woman does not need to take medication or use hormonal manipulation. No procedures or fittings by a physician are required. It can be difficult to estimate or know precisely when a woman is fertile, allowing increased chances for unplanned conception. Natural methods are not as effective as some forms of contraception. Ovulation test kits are used by some couples using natural methods of contraception, and the cost of these kits is another potential disadvantage. Being unable to have intercourse at certain times of the month is a disadvantage for some women."
Calendar rhythm method,"""The calendar rhythm method to avoid pregnancy relies upon calculating a woman's fertile period on the calendar. Based upon her 12 previous menstrual cycles, a woman subtracts l8 days from her shortest menstrual cycle to determine her first fertile day, and 11 days from her longest menstrual cycle to determine her last fertile day. She can then calculate the total number of days during which she may ovulate. If a woman's menstrual cycles are quite irregular from month to month, there will be a greater number of days during which she might become pregnant.""'The calendar method is only about 80% effective in preventing pregnancy and when used alone, it is considered outdated and ineffective.' "
Basal body temperature method,"""The basal body temperature (BBT) method is based upon the fact that a woman's temperature drops 12 to 24 hours before an egg is released from her ovary and then increases again once the egg has been released. Unfortunately, this temperature difference is not very large. It is less than 1 degree F (about a half-degree C) when the body is at rest.""'The basal body temperature method requires that a woman take her temperature every morning before she gets out of bed. A special thermometer that is more accurate and sensitive than a typical oral thermometer must be used, and the daily temperature variations carefully noted. This must be done every month. Online calculators are available to help a woman chart her basal body temperature.''To use the basal body temperature as a birth control method, a woman should refrain from having sexual intercourse from the time her temperature drops until at least 48 to 72 hours after her temperature increases again.' "
Mucus inspection method,"'The mucus inspection method depends on the presence or absence of a particular type of cervical mucus that a woman produces in response to estrogen. A woman will generate larger amounts of more watery mucus than usual (like raw egg white) just before release of an egg from her ovary. This so-called egg-white cervical mucus (EWCM) stretches for up to an inch when pulled apart. A woman can learn to recognize differences in the quantity and quality of her cervical mucus by examining its appearance on her underwear, pads, and toilet tissue; or she may gently remove a sample of mucus from the vaginal opening using two fingers.''She may choose to have intercourse between the time of her ''last menstrual period'' and the time of change in the cervical mucus. During this period, it is recommended that she have sexual intercourse only every other day because the presence of seminal fluid makes it more difficult to determine the nature of her cervical mucus. If the woman does not wish to become pregnant, she should not have sexual intercourse at all for 3 to 4 days after she notices the change in her cervical mucus.' "
Symptothermal method,"'The symptothermal method combines certain aspects of the calendar, the basal body temperature, and the mucus inspection methods. Not only are all these factors taken into consideration, but also are other symptoms such as slight cramping and breast tenderness. Some women experience lower abdominal discomfort (in the area of the ovaries) during the release of an egg (ovulation).' "
Ovulation indicator testing kits,"""A woman can use an ovulation prediction kit to determine when she is most likely to ovulate. This special kit measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. Because luteinizing hormone promotes the maturation of an egg in the ovary, the amount of LH usually increases 20 to 48 hours before ovulation. This increase is called the luteinizing hormone surge, which can then be detected in a woman's urine 8 to 12 hours later. The ovulation prediction kit is designed to measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine.""'There are a number of ovulation prediction kits sold at pharmacies that range from simple to complex. In the simplest, the woman urinates onto a test stick and the amount of luteinizing hormone is indicated by a color change. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of luteinizing hormone in her urine. A woman begins testing her urine 2 to 3 days before she expects to ovulate based upon the dates of her previous monthly cycles.''The optimum days for ''fertilization'' are the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. The greatest chance of ''becoming pregnant'' is if intercourse occurs within 24 hours after the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovulation prediction kits are used primarily to increase the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, but they can also indicate to the woman that she is about to ovulate and should take appropriate ''contraceptive'' precautions.' "
Withdrawal method,"""Using the withdrawal method, the man withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina before he ejaculates so that the sperm released from his penis does not enter her vagina. Withdrawal is also called ""'coitus interruptus''.'""There are problems with using withdrawal as a contraceptive method. First, a man may release small amounts of sperm before actual ejaculation. Secondly, a man needs self-control and a precise sense of timing to be able to withdraw his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. Because this can be difficult for the man to complete successfully, the withdrawal method is only about 75%-80% effective in preventing pregnancy."" "
Lactational infertility,"'Lactational ''infertility'' is based upon the idea that a woman cannot become pregnant as long as she is ''breastfeeding'' her baby. It is true that a woman may not ovulate quite as soon after giving birth as she would if she were not breastfeeding. Women who are breastfeeding usually start ovulating again between 10-12 weeks after delivery.''However, the method is not considered appropriate as a sole contraceptive measure. A ''nursing'' mother may start ovulating again and not realize she is fertile, as ovulation can occur prior to the return of her menstrual period. If this happens and the mother has unprotected sexual intercourse, she can become pregnant at the same time she is still breastfeeding her baby. If a nursing mother does not wish to become pregnant again, she must start to use an appropriate method of contraception.' "
Douching and urination,"'Vaginal ''douching'"" is the use of a liquid solution to wash out mucus and other types of bodily debris from a woman's vagina. Many women choose to make regular douching a part of their routine for maintaining vaginal hygiene. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not recommend the practice.""""Regardless of whether a woman does it for hygienic reasons, vaginal douching does not work as a contraception method. During intercourse, active sperm can reach a woman's cervix and even the upper part of her uterus within five minutes of ejaculation. Douching after intercourse cannot be done soon enough to have any contraceptive benefits, and the douching could even force sperm higher up into the uterus. In addition, if a woman douches within a 6-8 hour period after using a spermicide, she may actually reduce the effectiveness of this contraceptive method.""'Some women used to think that standing up and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse might reduce the chances of them becoming pregnant. They hoped that gravity might make it more difficult for sperm to swim ""uphill"" to the uterus and that the stream of urine ''running'' over their vaginal area would wash away sperm, similar to the process of douching. However, just like douching, urination after intercourse does not have any contraceptive value.' "
Abstinence,"""Abstinence from sexual activity means not having any sexual intercourse at all. No sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex means that there is no chance that a man's sperm can fertilize a woman's egg.""""A man or a woman can practice abstinence from sexual activity for a specific period of time, or continuously throughout one's lifetime. Abstinence is essentially 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Another significant benefit of abstinence is that it markedly reduces the likelihood of contracting a ""'sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').''In this context, abstinence means refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity because sexually transmitted infections can be passed from one person to another in any and all of these ways. It should be noted that sexual activity such as mutual ''masturbation'"" and touching of the other partner's genitals can, in some instances, transfer sperm during heavy mutual foreplay possibly leading to pregnancy."" "
What is fainting?,"'Fainting, ""blacking out,"" or syncope is the temporary loss of consciousness followed by the return to full wakefulness. This loss of consciousness may be accompanied by loss of muscle tone that can result in falling or slumping over. To better understand why fainting can occur; it is helpful to explain why somebody is awake.''The brain has multiple parts, including two hemispheres, the cerebellum, and the brain stem. The brain requires blood flow to provide oxygen and glucose (''sugar'') to its cells to sustain life. For the body to be awake, an area known as the reticular activating system located in the brain stem needs to be turned on, and at least one brain hemisphere needs to be functioning. For fainting or syncope to occur, either the reticular activating system loses its blood supply, or both hemispheres of the brain are deprived of blood, oxygen, or glucose. If blood ''sugar'' levels are normal blood flow must be briefly disrupted to the whole brain or to the reticular activating system for fainting to occur.''Fainting is not caused by head ''trauma'', since loss of consciousness after a head injury is considered a ''concussion''. However, fainting can cause injury if the person falls and hurts themselves, or if the faint occurs while participating in an activity like driving a car.''Fainting is differentiated from ''seizure'', during which the person may lose consciousness.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of fainting?,"'When a person faints they don’t know that they have passed out and fallen to the ground. Afterward, they understand what has happened.''Before the fainting episode the person ''may feel'':'""Pre-syncope or near fainting have the same symptoms, but they don't quite lose consciousness. During the fainting episode, the person may lose conscious, and there may a few twitches, which can be confused with a ""'seizure''.''The person may become confused after waking up, but it should resolve within a few seconds.''After a syncopal episode, the person should return to normal mental function. However, there may be other signs and symptoms of fainting depending on the underlying cause of fainting. For example, if the person is having a ''heart attack'', may complain of ''chest pain'' or pressure.'   Lightheaded Nausea Sweaty Weak Dizzy or the is room spinning (vertigo) Vision may fade or becomes blurred Hearing may be muffled Tingling sensations in the body"
What causes fainting?,"'Fainting causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain because'   The heart fails to pump the blood. The blood vessels don't have enough tone to maintain blood pressure to deliver the blood to the brain. There is not enough blood or fluid within the blood vessels. A combination of reasons one, two, or all three."
Vasovagal (vagal nerve) syncope,"'Vasovagal syncope is one of the most common causes of fainting. In this situation, the balance between the chemicals adrenaline and acetylcholine is disrupted. Adrenaline stimulates the body, including making the heart beat faster and blood vessels narrower, thereby increasing blood pressure. Acetylcholine does the opposite. When the vagus nerve is stimulated, excess acetylcholine is released, the heart rate slows and the blood vessels dilate, making it harder for blood to defeat gravity and be pumped to the brain. This temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain causes the fainting episode.''Pain'' can stimulate the vagus nerve and is a common cause of fainting (vasovagal syncope). Other noxious stimuli can do the same thing, including situational stressors. Commonly, medical and ''nursing'' students faint when observing their first operation, ''autopsy'', or when a person or someone else is bleeding. Some people pass out when they hear bad news; others pass out when they experience the sight of blood or needles. In the Victorian age this was known as a ""swoon.""''Other situations commonly cause the heart rate to temporarily slow and cause a faint. Straining with urination, bowel movement, or ''coughing'' can cause a vagal response, increase acetylcholine levels and decrease blood flow to the brain.' "
"Low blood pressure (postural hypotension), dehydration, and anemia","'Fainting is related to ''pregnancy''. Likely explanations include compression of the inferior vena cava (the large vein that returns blood to the heart) by the enlarging uterus and by ''orthostatic hypotension''.''Low blood pressure'' (orthostatic ''hypotension'')''Blood vessels need to maintain their tone so that the body can withstand the effects of gravity with changes in position. When the body position changes from lying down to standing, the autonomic nervous system (the part of the brain not under conscious control), increases tone in the blood vessel walls, making them constrict, and at the same time increases the heart rate so that blood can be pumped upward to the brain. As people age, blood vessels may become less resilient, and orthostatic ''hypotension'' (relative ''low blood pressure'' with standing) may occur and cause syncope.''Anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'""), whether it occurs acutely from bleeding or gradually for a variety of reasons, can cause fainting because there aren't enough ""'red blood cells'' to deliver oxygen to the brain.''Dehydration'', or lack of water in the body can similarly cause fainting or syncope. This can be caused by excessive ''loss of water'' from ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', ''sweating'', or by inadequate fluid intake. Some illnesses like ''diabetes'' can cause ''dehydration'' by excess loss of water in the urine.' "
Sudden cardiac arrest and heart valve and structural conditions,"'In young people, especially athletes, fainting or syncope can occur because of abnormal thickening of parts of the heart muscle (''hypertrophic cardiomyopathy''). This may obstruct blood when it tries to leave the heart, especially when the heart is asked to beat harder during ''exercise''. Sudden death in athletes may be foreshadowed by episodes of syncope.''Abnormalities with the heart valves can also cause fainting or syncope. The valves allow blood to go in the proper direction when the heart pumps. Valve diseases may include abnormal narrowing (stenosis) or leakage (insufficiency or regurgitation). Either situation can cause issues with maintaining adequate blood flow to the body.'""Structural problems with the heart can cause fainting or syncope, either because there is a problem with the ability of the heart to adequately pump blood or because of valve problems. When the heart muscle becomes damaged or inflamed it may not have the ability to pump blood to meet the body's needs. Examples include a heart attack (""'myocardial infarction'') or ''cardiomyopathy'', in which the heart muscle weakens.' "
Heart rhythm changes (rapid heartbeat and tachycardia) ," Heart rhythm changes are the most common causes of passing out, fainting, or syncope. Frequently, fainting episodes are caused by a temporary change in normal body function. Heart rhythm changes like tachycardia are more dangerous and potentially life-threatening causes of fainting. A rapid heart rate or tachycardia (tachy = fast + cardia = heart) is an abnormal heart rhythm that is generated in either the upper or lower chambers of the heart, and can be life-threatening because the heart beats too fast and may not be enough time for it to fill with blood in between heart beats, which then causes a decrease in the amount of blood that can be delivered to the body. Tachycardias can occur at any age and may not be related to atherosclerotic heart disease."
Vertebrobasilar artery disease,"'Blood vessels to the brain are no different than any other blood vessels in the body and are at risk for narrowing with age, ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', and ''diabetes''. While most people are aware of the carotid arteries that supply the thinking parts of the brain, another set of arteries supply the base of the brain. This vertebrobasilar system is also at risk for narrowing, and should there be a temporary disruption in the blood flow to the midbrain and the reticular activating system, fainting or syncope may occur. The vertebral arteries run to the brain in the back of the neck and are encased in bony tunnels. If blood flow in these arteries is disrupted, the brain stem and reticular activating system may turn off, causing syncope.''Electrolyte'' and hormone abnormalities may also be responsible for syncope; however, these causes are due to their effects on the heart and blood vessels.''Other medications or ''drugs'' may also be potential causes of fainting or syncope including those with ''high blood pressure'' that can dilate blood vessels, ''antidepressants'' that can affect heart electrical activity, and those that affect mental status like ''pain'' medications, ''alcohol'', and ''cocaine''.' "
How are the causes of fainting diagnosed?,"'Many conditions and events cause fainting, for example:' Physical exam Diagnostic tests Heart monitor, for example, a Holter monitor) Electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG) CBC (complete blood count) Glucose levels Kidney function blood tests Thyroid blood tests Tilt-table test CT (computerized tomography) MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)"
"Heart monitors, tilt-table tests, and imaging to diagnose causes of fainting","'Abnormal heart rhythm symptoms may go away shortly, and it is not always evident at time of the examination. Occasionally, a heart monitor (Holter monitor) can be worn as an outpatient for 24 or 48 hours or for up to 30 days (event monitor). ''Abnormal heart rhythms'' and rates may be uncovered as the potential cause of fainting.''A tilt-table test can be used to uncover orthostatic ''hypotension'' and usually is performed on an outpatient basis. The patient is placed at an angle on a table for 30-45 minutes (every institution has its own protocol) and blood pressure and pulse rate are measured with the patient in different positions.''Depending on the suspicions that the doctor and the healthcare team have for the cause of a fainting episode, imaging of the brain may be using computerized tomography (''CT scan'') or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).''Often these tests are normal so a healthcare team presumes that the cause fainting is not life-threatening. However, the doctor and patient will decide whether more testing is needed in the hospital or as an outpatient. In some people, a watchful waiting to decide whether further testing is needed.' "
"Medical history, exams, and heart monitoring to diagnose the causes of fainting","""Patient's medical history: """"As with most medical conditions, the history is the key in finding out why a person faints. Most fainting episodes don't happen when a person is wearing a heart monitor in front of the doctor. Often, people nearby often witness the fainting episode.""'Physical exam: ''The doctor will look for signs or symptoms to help diagnose the cause of the fainting episode.''Causes of fainting can be diagnosed with:''Heart monitoring:'' Heart monitoring may be done to look for heart rhythm disturbances.'   Electrocardiogram (EKG) Screening blood tests, for example: Complete blood count (CBC) Electrolytes Glucose Kidney function tests Thyroid blood tests Low blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension) Blood pressure may be checked both lying and standing to see if the episode was caused by orthostatic hypotension. The heart, lung, and neurologic system may diagnose potential causes if they are abnormal."
What is the treatment for fainting?,"'Fainting is not normal, although the cause may not be serious. If the person is not ''breathing'' or has no pulse, call 911 or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department. ''If an AED (automated external ''defibrillator'') is available, have a bystander begin CPR.'   If the fainting episode is resolves quickly, and the person returns to normal function with no evidence of injury, it may be appropriate to contact a primary care doctor to discuss care options. Often, if the fainting episode does not go away quickly, the person will be placed on a heart monitor, have intravenous line (IV) fluids, and oxygen supplied. A fingerstick blood sugar may be checked to test for low blood (sugar hypoglycemia). Treatment for the cause of fainting will be tailored to each person."
Can fainting be prevented?,"'Depending upon the cause, there may be opportunity to prevent fainting spells. For example:' People who have had a vasovagal episode may be aware of the warning signs and be able to sit or lie down before passing out and prevent the fainting episode. Older people with orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when sitting or lying down) can be prevented by waiting a few seconds after changing positions, which may be all that is needed to allow the body's reflexes to react. If the episodes are caused by medications, they may be adjusted if they are thought to be the potential cause of fainting. If dehydration is the cause, drinking plenty of fluids may be enough to prevent dehydration. There is an increased awareness of syncope and sudden death in younger athletes due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A variety of screening tests are available to assess potential risk for sudden death, but no consensus yet as to who and when to screen athletes has emerged."
What is Asperger's syndrome?,"""Asperger's syndrome, also known as Asperger disorder or Asperger syndrome, is one of a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that have effects on an individual's behavior, use of language and communication, and pattern of social interactions. Asperger disorder was formerly characterized as one distinct ""'autism'' spectrum disorder (others included autistic disorder, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and ''pervasive developmental disorder'""-not otherwise specified [PDD-NOS]), although Asperger's syndrome was considered to be at the milder, or higher-functioning, range of this spectrum. There is still some controversy as to whether Asperger's syndrome should be regarded as a separate clinical entity or simply represents a high-functioning form of ""'autism''. In the revised ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-5'"") published in May 2013, Asperger's syndrome and autistic disorder have been combined into one condition for diagnostic purposes, known as ASD. This change was controversial, because many experts believe that people formerly diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome will not meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD. Also, many experts feel that Asperger's syndrome should be preserved as a separate diagnostic entity to represent a condition related to, but not the same as, autism. Those diagnosed with Asperger's disorder were felt to have a higher-functioning form of autism or autism-related condition. People with Asperger's syndrome typically have normal to above-average intelligence but typically have difficulties with social interactions and often have pervasive, absorbing interests in special topics.""'Asperger\'s syndrome is named for Dr. Hans Asperger, an Austrian pediatrician, who first described the condition in 1944. Dr. Asperger described four boys who showed ""a lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversation, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements."" Because of their obsessive interests in and knowledge of particular subjects, he termed the boys ""little professors."" The American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognized Asperger disorder as a specific entity and published diagnostic criteria in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV'' (''DSM-IV'') in 1994. Most recently, after significant deliberation, the APA recommended ""subsuming"" Asperger\'s Disorder into Autism Spectrum Disorders for the next edition of the ''DSM-V''.''Today, many experts in the field ''stress'' the particular gifts and positive aspects of Asperger syndrome and consider it to represent a different, but not necessarily defective, way of thinking. Positive characteristics of people with Asperger syndrome have been described as beneficial in many professions and include:''Dr. Temple Grandin, a noted engineer, author, and professor who suffers from Asperger disorder believes that her condition has been an asset in her professional life. Her life and story was featured in a film that first aired in 2010.'""Although the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome is not possible without direct testing and observation of an individual, it has been suggested by some authors that many successful historical figures may have had Asperger's syndrome, including Mozart, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Marie Curie. Of course, definitive diagnosis of historical figures with Asperger's syndrome is not possible, and many of the traits exhibited by people with Asperger's syndrome can also occur because of intellectual giftedness or even ""'attention deficit disorder'' (''ADD'').'   the increased ability to focus on details, the capacity to persevere in specific interests without being swayed by others' opinions, the ability to work independently, the recognition of patterns that may be missed by others, intensity, and an original way of thinking."
What causes Asperger's syndrome?,"""If one accepts the conclusion that Asperger's syndrome is one of the autistic disorders, then the causes of Asperger's syndrome would be expected to be the same as the causes of autism. The precise causes of autistic disorders have not been identified, although an ""'inherited'"" (genetic) component is believed to be involved. Supporting this idea is the fact that Asperger's syndrome has been observed to run in families. In some cases, autistic disorders may be related to toxic exposures, teratogens, problems with ""'pregnancy'' or birth, and ''prenatal'' infections. These environmental influences may act together to modify or potentially increase the severity of the underlying genetic defect.''Some authors have suggested a causal role for ''vaccine'' exposure (particularly ''measles'' vaccine and thimerosal, a mercury preservative used in some ''vaccines'') in autism. However, the overwhelming majority of epidemiologic evidence shows no evidence for an association between immunizations and autism, and experts have discredited this theory.' "
How common is Asperger's syndrome?,"""Asperger's syndrome is five times more common in boys than in girls. In recent years, the number of autism spectrum disorders has increased dramatically in the U.S. The reason for the increase is not fully clear, but is likely due to both improvements and modifications in the diagnostic process that result in an increase in the number of children being identified, as well as some degree of true increase in the incidence of the disorders themselves. The CDC notes one out of every 59 children in the U.S. has an autism spectrum disorder.""""Asperger's syndrome has been estimated to affect two and a half out of every 1,000 children, based upon the total number of children with autistic disorders."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of Asperger's syndrome?,"""Social-behavioral symptoms can begin as early as infancy. Characteristic differences are seen in social development, but these changes are hard to identify in toddlers and may be attributed to another condition or not perceived as abnormal. Most cases of Asperger's syndrome are identified when the child is school-aged or older; studies have shown an average age at diagnosis of 11 years. Some of the symptoms that may be present are:""""Another defining characteristic of Asperger's syndrome is the presence of perseverative and obsessive interests in special topics (such as cars or trains, or even more narrow topics such as vacuum cleaners), which may be of little interest to others.""""Language development in children with Asperger's syndrome is generally normal, in contrast to other autistic conditions. Children with Asperger's syndrome have normal scores on tests for language function involving vocabulary, syntax, and grammar. In fact, some experts believe the presence of normal language development distinguishes Asperger's syndrome from high-functioning autism. However, the use or application of language skills is altered in people with Asperger's syndrome:""""In school, children with Asperger's syndrome tend to excel with the rote learning often required in the early grades. As they get older, they may have more difficulties in school due to the nature of reading comprehension and written assignments. Special education support is sometimes, but not always, necessary.""'Sometimes, people with Asperger disorder have other associated psychiatric conditions or may show behaviors that are typical for other conditions. Some common associated conditions include the following (but these are not always present):'   lack of social awareness; lack of interest in socializing/making friends; difficulty making and sustaining friendships; inability to infer the thoughts, feelings, or emotions of others; either gazing too intently or avoiding eye contact; lack of changing facial expression, or use of exaggerated facial expressions; lack of use or comprehension of gestures; inability to perceive nonverbal cues or communications; failure to respect interpersonal boundaries; unusually sensitive to noises, touch, odors, tastes, or visual stimuli; inflexibility and over-adherence to or dependence on routines; and stereotypical and repetitive motor patterns such as hand flapping or arm waving. These interests are unusually repetitive and intense when compared to other children's interests. Specific or narrow interests remain the focus of the child's interest and conversation in spite of efforts to redirect the child's attention. Their speech may be disorganized or not relevant to the discussion, or they may focus too intently on their defined area of interest (see above) in conversations. The child may switch topics for no apparent reason in conversation, often in an attempt to steer the conversation toward his or her area of interest. Changes in voice and speaking (for example, speaking too loudly or dramatically, using an invariant tone or incorrect intonation, loud pitch, or speaking too rapidly or too slowly) can also be seen. Language may be interpreted literally, and difficulties can arise with interpreting language in a specific context. There are difficulties with understanding the subtle use of language, such as irony or sarcasm. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Anxiety disorder Oppositional defiant disorder or other disruptive behavior disorders Depression or other mood disorders"
How do medical professionals diagnose Asperger's syndrome?,"'Diagnosis is based upon interviews and observation of the individual along with interviews of his/her family members and sometimes teachers or counselors. The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' is published by the American Psychiatric Association and includes the diagnostic criteria for all recognized psychiatric conditions.''The ''DSM-IV'"" had specific diagnostic criteria for Asperger's syndrome. However, revision of the ""'DSM-IV'' was carried out, with a fifth edition (''DSM-V'"") published in May 2013. In this new version, Asperger's syndrome is included in the same diagnostic group as people with autism and pervasive developmental disorders.""  "
What are the risks or complications of Asperger's syndrome?,"""As mentioned before, Asperger's syndrome may coexist with other psychiatric conditions such as ""'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') or ''anxiety'' disorder. Even when ''anxiety'"" disorder is not present, people with Asperger's syndrome may suffer from ""'anxiety'' or hypersensitivity to certain stimuli such as loud noises. In some cases, disruptive behaviors (tantrums, self-injury, and ''aggression'') and/or ''depression'"" may occur in response to the anxiety and frustration experienced by sufferers of Asperger's syndrome. Other behaviors that have been reported in people with Asperger's syndrome include obsessive-compulsive behaviors and difficulties with anger management.""""As with any condition, the degree of severity of symptoms can vary widely among individuals, and not all persons with Asperger's syndrome will experience associated psychiatric disorders, ""'depression'', or disruptive behaviors.' "
What are the treatments for Asperger's syndrome?,"""Treatment of Asperger's syndrome involves a multidisciplinary approach.""""Medical therapy is not effective in treating Asperger syndrome, although medications may be prescribed to help control troubling symptoms or symptoms of other psychiatric conditions that may coexist with Asperger's syndrome. In some cases, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are used for relief of anxiety or depression. Medical treatments for ""'ADHD'' may also be tried if there is significant ''hyperactivity'' and/or distraction.'""A number of behavioral therapies and educational interventions can help people with Asperger's syndrome, although all of these may not be necessary in a given individual. The type of interventions chosen must be based upon the individual's age and needs. Types of interventions that have been shown to be of benefit include:""  efforts to reduce overstimulation or overload of sensory input; supporting executive function skills by provision of an environment that is predictable, structured, and organized; organization skills training; speech/language therapy that addresses the ambiguous use of language and the use of language in social settings; social skills training programs, including training in the awareness of social cognition, use of gestures and facial expressions, and conversational language; adaptive skills or life-skills training; educational supports such as assistance with organization, note-taking, allowing oral rather than written testing, use of scripts, and assistance with reading comprehension and subtlety of language use; and self-advocacy training."
What is the prognosis for Asperger's syndrome?,"""An estimation of the prognosis of Asperger's syndrome is difficult, if not impossible, since affected individuals have variable degrees of impairment, and the provision of treatment can dramatically improve the long-term outlook for people with Asperger's syndrome. In general, when social, behavioral, and educational support is provided as needed, people with Asperger's syndrome can be expected to lead happy and productive lives."" "
What is campomelic dysplasia?,"'Campomelic dysplasia is a severe disorder that affects the development of the skeleton and reproductive system. This condition is often life-threatening in the ''newborn'' period. The term ""campomelic"" comes from the Greek words for ""bent limb."" Affected individuals are typically born with bowing of the long bones in the legs, and they are occasionally born with bowing in the arms. Bowing can cause characteristic skin dimples to form over the curved bone, especially on the lower legs. People with campomelic dysplasia also usually have short legs, dislocated hips, underdeveloped shoulder blades, 11 pairs of ribs instead of 12, bone abnormalities in the neck, and ''feet'' that are abnormally rotated (clubfeet). When affected individuals have features of this disorder but do not have bowed limbs, they are said to have acampomelic campomelic dysplasia.''Many people with campomelic dysplasia have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia). Approximately 75 percent of affected individuals with a typical male chromosome pattern (46,XY) have ambiguous genitalia or normal female genitalia. Internal reproductive organs may not correspond with the external genitalia; they can be male (testes), female (ovaries), or a combination of the two.''Affected individuals have distinctive facial features, including a small chin, prominent eyes, and a flat face. They also have a large head compared to their body size. A particular group of physical features, called Pierre-Robin sequence, is common in people with campomelic dysplasia. Pierre-Robin sequence includes an opening in the roof of the mouth (a ''cleft palate''), a tongue that is placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). People with campomelic dysplasia are often born with weakened cartilage that forms the upper respiratory tract. This abnormality, called laryngotracheomalacia, partially blocks the ''airway'' and causes difficulty ''breathing''. Laryngotracheomalacia contributes to the poor survival of infants with campomelic dysplasia.''Only a few people with campomelic dysplasia survive past infancy. As these individuals age, they may develop an abnormal curvature of the spine (''scoliosis'') and other spine abnormalities that compress the spinal cord. People with campomelic dysplasia may also have ''short stature'' and ''hearing loss''.' "
How common is campomelic dysplasia?,"'The prevalence of campomelic dysplasia is uncertain; estimates range from 1 in 40,000 to 200,000 births.' "
What genes are related to campomelic dysplasia?,"'Mutations in or near the SOX9 gene cause campomelic dysplasia. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many different tissues and organs during embryonic development. The SOX9 protein regulates the activity of other genes, especially those that are important for development of the skeleton and reproductive organs.''Most cases of campomelic dysplasia are caused by mutations within the SOX9 gene. These mutations prevent the production of the SOX9 protein or result in a protein with impaired function. About 5 percent of cases are caused by chromosome abnormalities that occur around the SOX9 gene. These chromosome abnormalities disrupt regions of DNA that normally regulate the activity of the SOX9 gene. All of these genetic changes prevent the SOX9 protein from properly controlling the genes essential for normal development of the skeleton, reproductive system, and other parts of the body. Abnormal development of these structures causes the signs and symptoms of campomelic dysplasia.' "
How do people inherit campomelic dysplasia?,"'Campomelic dysplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in or near the SOX9 gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, affected individuals inherit a chromosome abnormality from a parent who may or may not show mild signs and symptoms of campomelic dysplasia.' "
What other names do people use for campomelic dysplasia?, Campomelic dwarfism Campomelic syndrome Camptomelic dysplasia
Facts you should know about cauda equina syndrome," Cauda equina syndrome is complication from the compression of the nerves at the end of the spinal cord within the spinal canal. Cauda equina syndrome can be caused by any condition that results in direct irritation or pinching of the nerves at the end of the spinal cord. Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome include low back pain, numbness and/or tingling in the buttocks and lower extremities (sciatica), weakness in the legs, and incontinence of bladder and/or bowels. Cauda equina syndrome is diagnosed based on the characteristic symptoms and confirmed by neurologic and radiology testing. Cauda equina syndrome is a medical emergency generally requiring a surgical decompression operation. The outlook for patients affected by cauda equina syndrome is determined by the extent of damage to involved nerve tissue."
What is cauda equina syndrome?,"'Cauda equina syndrome is an uncommon compression of the nerves at the end of the spinal cord within the spinal canal. The terminology, ""cauda equina,"" literally means tail of horse and refers to the normal anatomy of the end of the spinal cord in the low back where it divides into many bundles of nerve tracts resembling a horse\'s tail. Compression of the spinal cord at this level can lead to a number of typical symptoms of the syndrome (low back ''pain'', ''sciatica'', saddle sensory changes, bladder and ''bowel incontinence'', and lower extremity motor and sensory loss).'  "
What are the causes of cauda equina syndrome?,"'Cauda equina syndrome can be caused by any condition that results in direct irritation or pinching of the nerves at the end of the spinal cord. Causes of cauda equina syndrome include herniation of ''lumbar'' intervertebral discs, abnormal growths (''tumor'' or ''cancer'') adjacent to the lower spinal cord, localized infection near the spinal cord (epidural ''abscess'', and localized bleeding (epidural ''hematoma'') causing pressure on the spinal cord in the low back. ''Localized lumbar tumors that can lead to cauda equine syndrome include ependymomas, metastatic ''cancer'', and '""Paget's disease""' of bone. Localized infection near the spinal cord can be caused by ''staphylococcus'' bacteria, ''tuberculosis'' bacteria (''Mycobacterium ''tuberculosis'"" from Pott's disease), and others.""  "
What are the symptoms of cauda equina syndrome?,"'Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome include ''low back pain'', numbness and/or tingling in the buttocks and lower extremities (''sciatica''), ''weakness'' in the legs, and ''incontinence'' of bladder and/or bowels. The numbness of cauda equina syndrome typically is in the distribution of where the body would touch a saddle when sitting upon a horse, and is referred to as ""saddle anesthesia.""''Partial cauda equina syndrome is the terminology that applies when there is incomplete compression of the nerves of the lower spinal cord. This can elicit various degrees and combinations of the symptoms listed above. With complete cauda equina syndrome, the array of symptoms listed above is commonplace.'  "
How do doctors diagnose cauda equina syndrome?,"'Cauda equina syndrome is clinically diagnosed based on the characteristic symptoms described above. Often, the physical examination can reveal hyperactive reflexes of the lower extremities. Because the syndrome is a medical emergency, neurosurgery or spinal surgery consultants should be notified immediately. Cauda equina syndrome can be confirmed with neurologic and radiology testing but such testing should not be delayed.''Specialized neurologic nerve testing of the lower extremities, such as nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and electromyography (''EMG'') tests can indicate nerve irritation effects in the low back. Radiologic testing such as CT (computerized axial tomography) and ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'') scanning can document the compressed spinal cord tissue.' "
What is the treatment for cauda equina syndrome?,"'Cauda equina syndrome is a medical emergency. Compression of the spinal nerves of the spinal cord can lead to permanent dysfunction of the lower extremities, bladder, and bowels. Once the precise cause of cauda equina syndrome is determined (see above), generally aggressive operative intervention with surgical decompression is initiated. If infection is present, antibiotics are given, usually intravenously. If a ''tumor'' is responsible for compression, after surgical decompression, radiotherapy or ''chemotherapy'' may be needed.''The long-term management of cauda equina syndrome depends on whether or not there are persisting symptoms after surgical decompression of the irritated nerve tissue. This can require ''pain'' medicine, physical therapy, supportive ''braces'', urinary catheters, and other treatments etc. until optimal nerve and muscle recovery occurs.' "
Is it possible to prevent cauda equina syndrome?,"'Cauda equina syndrome occurs as a result of conditions which are not predictable and is therefore not a preventable syndrome. However, cauda equina syndrome caused by infections initiated by IV ''drug abuse'' can be prevented by not using illegal IV ''drugs''.' "
What is the prognosis for cauda equina syndrome?,"'Ultimately, the outlook for patients affected by cauda equina syndrome is determined by the extent of damage to involved nerve tissue. In general, the longer the duration of the compression of the spinal cord, the longer the recovery period and less likely complete recovery can occur.' "
What is compartment syndrome?,"'Compartment syndrome is a condition that occurs when injury causes generalized painful swelling and increased pressure within a compartment to the point that blood cannot supply the muscles and nerves with oxygen and nutrients. Muscles in the forearm, lower leg and other body areas are surrounded by fibrous bands of tissues. This creates distinct compartments. The fibrous tissue is very inflexible and cannot stretch to accommodate the generalized swelling. If left untreated, muscles and nerves fail and may eventually die.''While most often occurring in the forearm and lower leg, compartment syndrome can rarely occur in other parts of the body that have muscles contained in compartments, including the hands and ''feet''. ''Compartment syndrome may occur acutely due to swelling that arises from injury, or it may be chronic because of exertion such as ''exercise''.' "
What causes compartment syndrome?,"'Muscles are contained in compartments covered by thick fibrous bands of tissue or fascia. Because of injury, pressure can increase within the compartment to swelling (fluid accumulation) or bleeding. In non-contracting muscle, the compartment pressure is normally about 0-15 mmHg of pressure. If the pressure within the compartment increases (usually greater than about 30 -45mmHg; or are within 30 mm of the diastolic ''blood pressure'') most individuals develop compartment syndrome. When these high compartment pressures are present, blood cannot circulate to the muscles and nerves to supply them with oxygen and nutrients. Symptoms such as ''pain'' and swelling will result.''As the muscle cells lose their blood and oxygen supply, they begin to die. If the condition is not recognized and treated, the whole muscle can die, ''scar'' down, and contract. Similarly, nerve cells that are damaged may fail causing numbness and ''weakness'' in the structures beyond the injury site. If infection or necrosis develops, the individual may need the limb amputated to prevent death.' "
What are the risk factors for compartment syndrome?,"'Acute compartment syndrome occurs as a complication of an injury. Often it is due to a fracture of the radius or ulna in the forearm or the tibia and fibula in the lower leg that causes significant bleeding in one or more of the compartments. Bleeding can also be due to a badly bruised muscle. Crush injuries may cause both bleeding and swelling of a muscle.''Some injuries can be more subtle. If a person is incapacitated and immobile for a prolonged period of time, for example, due to ''alcohol'' or drug intoxication, swelling or muscle damage may occur because a blood vessel was compressed. The weight of an object (or the weight of the body itself) compressing a muscle group can cause ''rhabdomyolysis'' (muscle breakdown).''Compartment swelling may occur after the blood supply is re-established (reperfusion swelling) to an area that has lost it for a period of time. Two examples are: 1) a person is in an auto accident where their legs are trapped and compressed with heavy debris, which are subsequently freed from the debris after a period of time; 2) when a blood vessel is damaged and subsequently repaired through surgery. ''Compartment syndrome may be a complication of bandages or casts that are applied too tightly, or due to swelling that occurs after casting.''Other abrupt causes of compartment syndrome include ''burns'', snake bites and other envenomation, and anabolic steroid use. Individuals taking ''anticoagulants'' have a higher risk for compartment syndrome after ''trauma'' due to bleeding that cannot clot normally. Because there is some controversy about when fasciotomy is required (especially with snake bites) immediate consultation with a surgeon is recommended by most experts.''Chronic compartment syndrome occurs because of excessive ''exercise'', where repetitive motion and muscle use cause localized swelling and irritation. Most often, symptoms in the legs are seen with runners and bicyclists and in the arms of swimmers. Symptoms resolve with rest and very rarely progress to an acute limb threatening situation. ' "
What are the symptoms and signs of compartment syndrome?,"'The symptoms of compartment syndrome, plus the circumstances that led to their development assistance to make the clinical diagnosis.''Historically, the mnemonic memory device for compartment syndrome is the ""5 Ps"" (pain, paresthesia [change in sensation], pallor [pale coloration], ''paralysis'', and poikilothermia [inability to control temperature]; some authors include pulselessness), but this should not be relied upon to make a diagnosis. Only pain and change in sensation (paresthesia) may be symptoms that point to the diagnosis of a developing compartment syndrome.''The diagnosis should be always considered when there is either an associated fracture, high-velocity injuries like a gunshot ''wound'', or a crush injury. Individuals who are taking ''anticoagulant'' medications such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') or ''enoxaparin'' (''Lovenox'') are at higher risk for bleeding into a compartment spontaneously or after injury.''Examination of the extremity often reveals tense and shiny skin that may be significantly bruised. Pain occurs with a minimal range of motion of the foot, hand, or any of the extremity with compartment syndrome. The patient may have difficulty moving the extremity without assistance and pain is provoked when the care practitioner takes the affected limb through any range of motion''In chronic compartment syndrome, there may be pain with range of motion of the extremity and muscle bulging may be noticed. Numbness is common but all symptoms usually resolve within a few minutes of discontinuing the ''exercise''.'   Pain out of proportion to the injury (or physical examination of the muscle compartment) often is the clue to make the diagnosis of compartment syndrome. Increased pressure within the muscle compartment causes loss of blood supply and nerve inflammation. This causes significant pain and numbness or paresthesia. (para=abnormal + ethesia=feeling)."
When should I seek medical care for compartment syndrome?,"'Acute compartment syndrome is a true emergency. If the pressure within the compartment is not released within a few hours, permanent muscle and nerve damage may occur.''Medical care should be accessed when numbness, tingling, ''weakness'', or excessive pain occurs after an injury. While compartment syndrome is most often due to injuries of the forearm and lower leg, it may also occur in the hand, foot, or buttocks after a ''broken bone'' or crush injury.' "
How is compartment syndrome diagnosed?,"""While it is uncommon, the health care practitioner has to have a high index of suspicion for acute compartment syndrome if a patient presents with excessive pain, numbness, and a tense extremity after an injury. The patient's history of an injury to the extremity often is all that is necessary for a diagnosis.""'While blood tests may be ordered to look for chemical markers of muscle injury (for example, myoglobin and lactate levels) and kidney damage, the definitive diagnosis of compartment syndrome is confirmed by measuring the pressure within the compartments of the affected limb. A sterile needle is inserted directly into the muscle compartment and attached to a pressure monitoring device (see second-last reference for picture). Usually, pressure measurements (see values listed above) are taken in each compartment in the affected limb and this may require multiple needle sticks.''Chronic compartment syndrome may be diagnosed clinically but compartment pressures may be measured before and after ''exercise'' to confirm the diagnosis. The health care professional should also explore other potential causes of pain due to exercise, including ''stress'' ''fractures'', ''shin splints'', or tendon inflammation.'  "
What is the treatment for compartment syndrome?,"'Prevention'' is the first step in the treatment of compartment syndrome. Significant injuries of the arms and legs that require casting or splinting should always be elevated and iced to minimize the potential for swelling.''Chronic or exercise-induced compartment syndrome rarely requires any treatment; the pain and other symptoms usually stop minutes to hours after the activity is stopped. However, some individuals, over time, find the chronic compartment syndrome to be very limiting, especially if it causes them to stop a favorite sport (for example, ''running'', tennis, or football). Rarely, such individuals may have a surgeon cut open some of the fasciae that surround the compartment to reduce or stop the symptoms.'   Elevation should be above the level of the heart. Ice therapy may even be considered even if a cast or splint has been placed."
Surgery (fasciotomy),"'The treatment for acute compartment syndrome is surgery (fasciotomy). The surgeon (either an orthopedic or general surgeon) will perform a fasciotomy, an operation where the thick, fibrous bands that line the muscles are filleted open, allowing the muscles to swell and relieve the pressure within the compartment (similar to splitting open the casing of a sausage). Depending upon the amount of swelling (''edema''), a second operation may be required later to close the skin after the swelling has resolved.''Once acute compartment syndrome has occurred, there is no non-surgical alternative. Hyperbaric oxygen may be considered as an adjunct treatment after surgery to promote healing.''Treatment will also be directed to the underlying cause of the compartment syndrome and to try to prevent other associated complications including ''kidney failure'' due to ''rhabdomyolysis''.'  "
What are the complications of compartment syndrome?,"'Left unrecognized or untreated, the complications of acute compartment syndrome are irreversible. As swelling increases and muscle loses its blood supply, cells eventually die and muscle necrosis occurs. Complications include:''Complications due to chronic or exercise induced compartment syndrome are rare but may include any of the above, especially if the person requires surgery to alleviate the chronic condition.'   muscle scarring, contracture and loss of function of the limb; infection; amputation; permanent nerve damage; and/or rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) and kidney damage."
What is the prognosis for compartment syndrome?,"'Acute compartment syndrome is a potentially devastating condition. Return of normal function and minimizing injury depends upon quick recognition of the situation and prompt surgical fasciotomy to resolve the increased pressure. The longer the delay to surgery, the more potential for permanent loss of muscle and nerve function. The prognosis for chronic compartment syndrome is usually excellent.' "
What is cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS)?,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a disorder that causes recurrent episodes of ''nausea'', vomiting, and ''tiredness'' (lethargy) that are also termed as “paroxysmal and stereotypic”. This condition is diagnosed most often in young children, but it can affect people of any age. It was first described by Samuel Gee in 1882; the etiology and pathophysiology is unknown but researchers suggest genetic component may play a significant role in this syndrome. CVS is characterized by episodes of rapid vomiting followed with periods of completely normal health - clinicians suggest this off and on again stereotypic vomiting pattern that usually consists of four phases is the diagnostic feature of the syndrome.' "
4 Phases of cyclic vomiting syndrome,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome has four phases:' Symptom-free interval phase: This phase is the period between episodes when no symptoms are present. Prodromal phase: This phase signals that an episode of nausea and vomiting is about to begin. Often marked by nausea -- with or without abdominal pain -- this phase can last from just a few minutes to several hours. Sometimes, taking medicine early in this phase can stop an episode in progress. Sometimes there is no warning. A person may simply wake up in the morning and begin vomiting. Vomiting phase: This phase consists of nausea and vomiting; an inability to eat, drink, or take medicines without vomiting; paleness; drowsiness; and exhaustion. Recovery phase: This phase begins when the nausea and vomiting stop. Healthy color, appetite, and energy return."
Cyclic vomiting syndrome symptoms and signs,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is characterized by attacks of intense nausea, vomiting, and lethargy that last anywhere from an hour to 10 days. A person may vomit several times per hour, potentially leading to a dangerous loss of fluids (''dehydration''). Additional symptoms can include unusually ''pale skin'' (pallor or paleness), ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', ''headache'', and an increased sensitivity to light (''photophobia'') or to sound (phonophobia). In most affected people, the signs and symptoms of each attack are quite similar. Consequently, the person with cyclic vomiting syndrome may have one or more of these symptoms and signs:''Cyclic vomiting syndrome attacks can be debilitating, making it difficult for an affected person to go to work or school. Unfortunately, these symptoms and signs listed above can occur with many other diseases; the alternating pattern of symptoms and periods of remission is the major sign of cyclic vomiting syndrome. In addition, most individuals with cyclic vomiting syndrome exhibit the same pattern of symptoms during each cycle of severe nausea and vomiting.'   Repeated vomiting or retching Heaving or gagging (dry vomiting) Abdominal pain Diarrhea Fever Dizziness Pale skin Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) Headaches Loss of appetite Thirst Reduced or less urination Motion sickness Fatigue or exhaustion"
"Causes, triggers, and risk factors","'Episodes of nausea and vomiting can be caused and triggered by several different factors.''Migraine headache'':'' Researchers have suggested ''migraine''-related mechanisms may be involved. For example, patients with CVS have a family prevalence of ''migraine'' ''headaches'' and many patients with CVS that eventually resolved developed migraine ''headaches'' in adulthood.''Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA)'' also may play a role. Researchers have demonstrated that 86% of children with CVS and neuromuscular disease had mothers with a history of migraine. In children with CVS, mDNA showed high frequency of polymorphic changes in mDNA termed16519T and 3010A.''Sympathetic nerve hyper-responsiveness and autonomic dysfunctions:'' Patients with CVS appear to have sympathetic nerve hyper-responsiveness and autonomic dysfunction. Symptoms include flushing, paleness to the skin, ''fever'', lethargy, increased saliva production, and ''diarrhea'' are at higher risk for developing CVS.''Stress'' response:'' Psychological, physical, and infectious episodes are known triggers of this syndrome.''Chronic recreational ''marijuana'' use: ''Chronic ''marijuana'' use has been associated with CVS episodes and may be linked to nausea/vomiting through the endocannabinoid system, which is thought to play a role in nausea, vomiting, and ''stress'' control. Some researchers suggest that males younger than 19 years of age with CVS-like symptoms should always be asked about marijuana use.''The brain-gut connection or theory'' has been mentioned as a cause of CVS, especially in the early literature. Although the theory has some support (for example, ''stress'' and/or ''migraines'' triggers vomiting) other factors (physiological or genetic) may equally trigger the disease. Some others suggest the gut bacteria may trigger CVS if bacterial overgrowth of the normal bacterial flora in the gut occurs but good evidence for this theory is lacking.''Consequently, it is not clear which factors comprise the highest risk factors for CVS. However, most researchers consider the problem to either be caused by, or to have increased risk for CVS when several factors converge (genetic, autonomic, environmental and/or nerve/brain functions) thus resulting in multifactorial causes and risk factors for it. Currently, most researchers conclude the cause(s) are unknown.'   The most common causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome are infections (chronic sinusitis, tooth decay, for example) and emotional excitement (panic attacks, anxiety, holidays, parties) with positive situations outnumbering negative. Other triggers can include periods without eating (fasting), temperature extremes of hot or cold, lack of sleep, overexertion, allergies, ingesting certain foods (chocolate, cheese, monosodium glutamate), overeating, alcohol consumption, and menstruation."
Who gets cyclic vomiting syndrome?,"'The exact prevalence of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown; estimates range from 3.15 to 2,000 per 100,000 children. The condition is diagnosed less commonly in adults, although recent studies suggest that the condition could be as common in adults as in children.' "
Is it genetic (inherited)?,"'In most cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, affected people have no known history of the disorder in their family, but many CVS-affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as ''migraines'', in their mothers and other maternal relatives. This family history suggests an inheritance pattern known as maternal inheritance or mitochondrial inheritance, which applies to genes contained in mitochondrial DNA. Disorders with mitochondrial inheritance can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females. However, because mitochondria can be passed from one generation to the next only through egg cells (not through sperm cells), only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. In addition, most researchers suggest that CVS development may require other factors to help trigger genetic component.' "
Which specialties of doctors or other health care professionals treat the condition?,"""In addition to the patient's primary-care physician or pediatrician, gastroenterologists (doctors who specialize in disorders of the ""'digestive system'') are usually consulted. In addition, critical-care specialists (adult or pediatric) may need to be consulted if complications develop.' "
How do I know if I have CVS (diagnosis)?,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is hard to diagnose because no tests -- such as a blood test or X-ray -- can establish a diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome. A doctor must look at symptoms and medical history to rule out other common diseases or disorders that can cause nausea and vomiting. Making a diagnosis takes time because the doctor also needs to identify a pattern or cycle to the vomiting. For example, the patient who has had at least five separate episodes of vomiting or at least three separate episodes over six months for children or one year for adults, that have had attacks similar to previous episodes (for example, they started the same time of day, last same time span and have the same intensity), makes the diagnosis of CVS more likely.''However, it is not unusual to have laboratory tests such as CT, ''ultrasound'' or ''MRI'' of the abdomen, magnetic resonance enterography, ''endoscopy'', ''upper GI series'' of ''X-rays'', gastrointestinal motility tests, ''food allergy'' tests, and others performed to help the physician be sure that diseases with similar symptoms are not causing the problems.' "
Is there a diet or natrual treatments for this syndrome? ,"'Although home remedies have not been well studied, anecdotal reports suggest at least three remedies may help some patients. They are biofeedback to reduce ''stress'', L-carnitine that helps turn fat into energy, and ''coenzyme Q10'', a substance that aids mitochondrial dysfunction.''Reports of diets that help reduce the frequency of reoccurrence of CVS attacks include ''gluten''-free diets, a Paleo ''diet'' (''diet'' based on foods eaten by early humans such as fish, meat, vegetables, and fruit without dairy or green products), and GAPS ''diet'' (complicated ''diet'"" plan designed for individuals with gastrointestinal immune problems). Parents and individuals should check with their physician before utilizing any of these home remedies or diets to avoid any potential side effects or deterioration in the child's or adult's condition."" "
How is cyclic vomiting syndrome  treated?,"'Treatment varies, but people with cyclic vomiting syndrome generally improve after learning to control their symptoms. People with cyclic vomiting syndrome are advised to get plenty of rest and ''sleep'' and to take medications that prevent a vomiting episode, stop one in progress, speed up recovery, or relieve associated symptoms.''Treatment of vomiting phase:'' Once a vomiting episode begins, treatment usually requires the person to stay in bed and ''sleep'' in a dark, quiet room. Severe nausea and vomiting may require hospitalization and intravenous fluids to prevent ''dehydration''. ''Sedatives'' may help if the nausea continues.''Treatment during prodromal phase:'' Sometimes, during the prodromal phase, it is possible to stop an episode from happening. People with nausea or ''abdominal pain'' before an episode can ask their doctor about taking ''ondansetron'' (''Zofran'') or ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan'') for nausea or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') for ''pain''. Other medications that may be helpful are ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac'') or ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), which help calm the stomach by lowering the amount of acid it makes.''Treatment during recovery phase:'"" During this phase it's very important to drink water and replace lost ""'electrolytes''. ''Electrolytes'' are salts the body needs to function and stay healthy. Symptoms during the recovery phase can vary. Some people find their appetite returns to normal immediately, while others need to begin by drinking clear liquids and then move slowly to solid food.''Frequent and long-lasting episode treatment:'' People whose episodes are frequent and long-lasting may be treated during the symptom-free intervals in an effort to prevent or ease future episodes. Medications that help people with migraine ''headaches'', such as ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), ''cyproheptadine'' (''Periactin''), and ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil''), are sometimes used during this phase, but they do not work for everyone. Taking the medicine daily for one to two months may be necessary before one can tell if it helps.''Symptom-free phase:'' The symptom-free interval phase is a good time to eliminate anything known to trigger an episode. For example, if episodes are brought on by stress or excitement, a symptom-free interval phase is the time to find ways to reduce stress and stay calm. Behavioral therapy may help reduce attacks by reducing stress and ''anxiety''.''Sinus and ''allergy'' causes:'' If sinus problems or ''allergies'' cause episodes, those conditions should be treated early to reduce the chance for a CVS attack.''Migraine treatment:'' During an episode, anti-migraine ''drugs'' such as ''sumatriptan'' (''Imitrex'') may be prescribed to stop ''symptoms of migraine'' ''headache''. The safety and efficacy of these medications has not been established in children under 18 years of age.'  "
What are the complications if the condition isn't treated?,"'If the condition is not treated, attacks typically occur four to 12 times per year. Between episodes, vomiting is absent, and nausea is either absent or much reduced. Many affected people experience other symptoms during and between episodes, including ''pain'', digestive disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux (''GERD'') and ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), and ''fainting'' spells (''syncope''). In addition, complications of CVS can also include ''dehydration'', ''electrolyte'' abnormalities, damage to the ''esophagus'', and ''tooth decay'' due to the acid in vomit. People with cyclic vomiting syndrome are also more likely than people without the disorder to experience ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and ''panic disorder''. It is unclear how these health conditions are related to nausea and vomiting.' "
What is the relationship between cyclic vomiting syndrome and migraines?,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is generally considered to be a variant of ''migraines'', which are severe ''headaches'' often associated with pain, nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Many people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have a family history of migraines, and attacks of nausea and vomiting may be replaced by migraine ''headaches'' as an affected person gets older.' "
"What other problems accompany this condition, and what is the prognosis?","'Most people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have normal intelligence, although some affected people have experienced developmental delay or intellectual disability, muscle ''weakness'' (myopathy), and/or ''seizures''. People with these additional features are said to have cyclic vomiting syndrome plus.''The prognosis for CVS varies. Patients with complications and weak responses to treatment have a fair prognosis while others may respond well and have a good prognosis. In general, CVS lasts about two and a half to five and a half years, resolving late childhood or early adolescence. Some patients go on to develop migraine ''headaches'', and a few patients have CVS extend into adulthood. Patients with a diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome plus have a prognosis usually ranging from fair to poor.' "
Is it possible to prevent this syndrome?,"'Most investigators who study CVS suggest there are ways to prevent or reduce the number of CVS attacks. Ways to prevent and/or reduce attacks include the following:' Get adequate sleep. Seek help to prevent stress and anxiety. Treat infections and/or allergies early. Avoid any triggers of CVS, especially related to foods. During the well phase, eat a balanced diet with regular meals. Utilize appropriate medications prescribed by a physician to reduce CVS symptoms."
What are the genetic changes related to this syndrome?,"'Although the exact causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome have yet to be determined, researchers have proposed several factors that may contribute to the disorder. These factors include changes in brain function, hormonal abnormalities, and gastrointestinal problems. Many researchers believe that cyclic vomiting syndrome is a migraine-like condition, which suggests that it is related to changes in signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in certain areas of the brain.''Some cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be related to genetic changes in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA, mDNA, or mtDNA).''Several changes in mitochondrial DNA have been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Some of these changes alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides), whereas others rearrange larger segments of mitochondrial DNA. These changes likely impair the ability of mitochondria to produce energy. Defects in energy production may lead to symptoms during periods when the body requires more energy, such as when the immune system is fighting an infection. It remains unclear how changes in mitochondrial function are related to recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.' "

What is Treacher Collins syndrome?,'Treacher Collins is a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues in the face.' 
What are the signs and symptoms of Treacher Collins syndrome?,"'The signs and symptoms of this disorder vary greatly, ranging from almost unnoticeable to severe. Most individuals have:'""Some people with this condition are also born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate. In severe cases, underdevelopment of the facial bones may restrict an affected infant's airway, causing potentially life-threatening respiratory problems.""   underdeveloped facial bones, particularly the cheek bones, and A very small jaw and chin (micrognathia)."
What are the characteristics of Treacher Collins syndrome?," People with TCS often have eyes that slant downward, sparse eyelashes, and a notch in the lower eyelids called an eyelid coloboma. Some individuals have additional eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss. It also characterized by absent, small, or unusually formed ears. Hearing loss occurs in about half of all individuals with the problem; hearing loss is caused by defects of the three small bones in the middle ear, which transmit sound, or by underdevelopment of the ear canal. People with Treacher Collins usually have normal intelligence."
How common is this syndrome?,"'Treacher Collins affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 people.' "
How do you get Treacher Collins (Causes)?,"'When Treacher Collins results from mutations in the TCOF1 or POLR1D gene, it is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. About 60 percent of these cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In the remaining autosomal dominant cases, a person with TCS inherits the altered gene from an affected parent.''When TCS is caused by mutations in the POLR1C gene, the condition has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.' "
What genes are related to this syndrome?,"'Mutations in the TCOF1, POLR1C, or POLR1D gene can cause Treacher Collins. TCOF1 gene mutations are the most common cause of the disorder, accounting for 81 to 93 percent of all cases. POLR1C and POLR1D gene mutations cause an additional 2 percent of cases. In individuals without an identified mutation in one of these genes, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown.''The proteins produced from the TCOF1, POLR1C, and POLR1D genes all appear to play important roles in the early development of bones and other tissues of the face. These proteins are involved in the production of a molecule called ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. Ribosomal RNA helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into new proteins, which is essential for the normal functioning and survival of cells. Mutations in the TCOF1, POLR1C, or POLR1D gene reduce the production of rRNA. Researchers speculate that a decrease in the amount of rRNA may trigger the self-destruction (apoptosis) of certain cells involved in the development of facial bones and tissues. The abnormal cell death could lead to the specific problems with facial development found in TCS. However, it is unclear why the effects of a reduction in rRNA are limited to facial development.' "
What are the treatment and management guidelines for this syndrome?,"'There is currently no cure for TCS. Treatment is tailored to the specific needs of each child or adult. Ideally, treatment is managed by a multidisciplinary team of craniofacial specialists.''Newborns may need special positioning or ''tracheostomy'' to manage the airway. Hearing loss may be treated with bone conduction amplification, speech therapy, and/or educational intervention.''There are some possible treatments that are being investigated. Researchers are looking for ways to inhibit a protein called p53, which helps the body to kill off unwanted cells. In people with TCS, p53 is abnormally activated, leading to the loss of specific cells and ultimately causing features of TCS. It has been proposed that inhibiting the production of p53 (or blocking its activation) may help to treat affected people. However, more research is needed to determine if this type of treatment is effective and safe.''Researchers are also studying the use of stems cells found in fat tissue to be used alongside surgery in people with TCS and other craniofacial disorders. Early studies have shown that surgical outcomes may be improved using these ''stem cells'' to help stimulate the regrowth of affected areas. However, this therapy is still experimental and controversial.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for a person with Treacher Collins syndrome?,"'Usually, people with TCS grow to become functioning adults with normal intelligence. With proper management, life expectancy is approximatelythe same as in the general population. In some cases, the prognosis depends on the specific symptoms and severity in the affected person. For example, very severe cases of TCS can cause perinatal death because of a compromised airway.' "

What is Kleine-Levin syndrome?,'Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare disorder that primarily affects adolescent males (approximately 70 percent of those with Kleine-Levin syndrome are male). ' 
What are the symptoms of Kleine-Levin syndrome?,"'It is characterized by recurring but reversible periods of excessive ''sleep'' (up to 20 hours per day). Symptoms occur as ""episodes,"" typically lasting a few days to a few weeks. ''Episode onset is often abrupt, and may be associated with ''flu''-like symptoms. Excessive food intake, irritability, childishness, disorientation, ''hallucinations'', and an abnormally uninhibited sex drive may be observed during episodes. Mood can be ''depressed'' as a consequence, but not a cause, of the disorder. Affected individuals are completely normal between episodes, although they may not be able to remember afterwards everything that happened during the episode. It may be weeks or more before symptoms reappear. Symptoms may be related to malfunction of the hypothalamus and thalamus, parts of the brain that govern appetite and ''sleep''.'  "
Is there any treatment for Kleine-Levin syndrome?,"'There is no definitive treatment for Kleine-Levin syndrome and watchful waiting at home, rather than pharmacotherapy, is most often advised. Stimulant pills, including amphetamines, ''methylphenidate'', and ''modafinil'', are used to treat sleepiness but may increase irritability and will not improve cognitive abnormalities. Because of similarities between Kleine-Levin syndrome and certain mood disorders, ''lithium'' and ''carbamazepine'' may be prescribed and, in some cases, have been shown to prevent further episodes. This disorder should be differentiated from cyclic re-occurrence of sleepiness during the ''premenstrual'' period in teen-aged girls, which may be controlled with ''birth control pills''. It also should be differentiated from ''encephalopathy'', recurrent ''depression'', or psychosis.'  "
What is the prognosis for Kleine-Levin syndrome?,'Episodes eventually decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of eight to 12 years.'  
What research is being done on Kleine-Levin syndrome?,'NINDS supports a broad range of clinical and basic research on diseases causing ''sleep disorders'' in an effort to clarify the mechanisms of these conditions and to develop better treatments for them.'

What is Loeys-Dietz syndrome?,"'Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a recently-described connective tissue disorder with features similar to those of ''Marfan syndrome'', and the vascular type of ''Ehlers-Danlos syndrome''. Loeys-Dietz syndrome is primarily characterized by aortic aneurysms (weakened outpouchings of the ''aorta'', the main artery in the body) in children. In Loeys-Dietz syndrome, the aortic aneurysms are prone to rupture at a smaller size than other aneurysms, putting children with Loeys-Dietz at great risk for dying if the ''aneurysm'' is not identified and treated early. ''The syndrome is named for pediatric geneticist Harry Dietz, director of the ''William S. Smilow Center for Marfan Syndrome Research at Johns Hopkins University'' and his colleague, Bart Loeys, who characterized the genetic and physical markers of the syndrome together with Dr. Dietz. '  "
What are the signs and symptoms of Loeys-Dietz syndrome?,"'Aortic aneurysms and abnormal organization of blood vessels (widespread tortuosity of the arteries in locations other than the aorta) are the hallmarks of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, but many affected children have characteristic physical and facial features that may be the first abnormality to be recognized. Recently, LDS has been subdivided into two types, LDS type I (LDSI) and type II (LDSII), signaling the presence or the absence of cranio-facial involvement, respectively. ''The craniofacial characteristics of Loeys-Dietz syndrome include early fusion of the skull bones (known as craniosynostosis), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), and ''cleft palate'' or split uvula. In some individuals with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, other physical abnormalities have been noted, including defects at birth in the ''heart'' and brain, ''osteoporosis'' (weak bones), skin changes (such as translucent skin and/or ''easy bruising''), and defects of the spine or chest. It is important to note that the severity of the visible physical characteristics varies widely among affected individuals, but the danger of rupture of aneurysms remains the same no matter how severe or mild the physical characteristics are. ''In many cases pediatricians may be able to recognize the characteristic facial features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and on this basis suggest further evaluation for the presence of aortic aneurysms and vascular irregularities. Other people with the syndrome are recognized when they seek medical assistance for other reasons, such as ''heart murmurs'' or a family history of Marfan syndrome or another condition that may cause aortic aneurysms.'  "
Is Loeys-Dietz syndrome inherited?,"'Loeys-Dietz syndrome is inherited, meaning that it is a genetic syndrome that tends to run in families. The mutated abnormal gene that causes Loeys-Dietz syndrome is dominant, and only one parent needs pass the gene to a child in order for the syndrome to develop. (This is in contrast to recessive syndromes in which each parent must pass the gene to a child in order for the syndrome to develop.) A report published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' in August, 2006, reported that 52 affected families (with a total of 90 affected individuals) had been identified. ' "
What causes Loeys-Dietz syndrome?,"'The cause of Loeys-Dietz syndrome has been determined recently. TGF-beta is a signaling molecule produced in the body that influences the growth, movement, and activity of cells as well as the death of cells by changing the way many genes within the cells are expressed. TGF-beta brings about the changes within cells by binding to receptors on the surfaces of the cells. . Loeys-Dietz syndrome is known to be a result of mutations in the TGF-beta-receptor I (TGFBR1) or II (TGFBR2) genes. The genetic mutations in Loeys-Dietz causes a change in the receptor that prevents TGF-beta from working on the cells. A test is available that can detect the genetic mutation associated with the syndrome; however, the test is not available in most laboratories.  ' "
How is Loeys-Dietz syndrome diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of aortic aneurysms, including those seen in the Loeys-Dietz syndrome, usually is made by injecting a dye that is visible by X-ray, ''computerized tomography'' (CT), or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') into the blood vessels. ''X-rays'' or scans by CT or MRI then are done that show the arteries and aneurysms (because the aneurysms are filled with dye-containing blood). Although aortic aneurysms are the hallmark of Loeys-Dietz Syndrome and the characteristic facial features may suggest the diagnosis, the definitive diagnosis of Loeys-Dietz Syndrome can only be established by the genetic test (described above). ' "
How is Loeys-Dietz syndrome treated?,"'The only treatment for Loeys-Dietz syndrome to prolong life expectancy is surgical repair of the ''aortic aneurysm''. Surgical repair of the aneurysms is generally successful. Since the aneurysms tend to rupture early, early and accurate diagnosis is critical to ensure that affected individuals receive prompt surgical treatment. The genetic test can be of value in identifying which individuals with aortic aneurysms have Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and therefore, should have immediate surgery. In contrast to Loeys-Dietz syndrome, in other inherited syndromes associated with aortic aneurysms, surgery carries a poorer prognosis, and the aneurysms can be managed with medications for a longer period of time before surgery becomes necessary. Studies are ongoing to determine whether drug treatment of the Loeys-Dietz syndrome also may be of value. ''At the time of diagnosis, imaging studies of the aorta are recommended and should be repeated after 6 months to determine if aortic enlargement is occurring. If the diameter of the aorta is not enlarging, yearly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the of the circulation from the barin to the pelvis are recommended, since affected persons commonly develop aneurysms that are treatable surgically.'

Syringomas occur most commonly around the eyes and eyelids, but other areas of the body can be affected.' "
What is Marfan syndrome?,"'Marfan syndrome is a ''genetic disorder'' that affects the body’s ability to make healthy connective tissue, which supports the bones, muscles, organs, and tissues in your body. The condition can affect different areas of the body, including:''Marfan syndrome affects men, women, and children, and has been found among people of all races and ethnic backgrounds.'   Bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage. Organs, eyes, heart and blood vessels, nervous system, and lungs. Skin."
What are the signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome?,"'The symptoms of Marfan syndrome vary from person to person because connective tissue is found throughout the body. Some people have mild or just a few symptoms, while others can have more serious problems. Symptoms may include:'   Abdominal pain. Arms, legs, fingers, and toes that are much longer in relation to the rest of the body. The chest that caves in or stick out. Curved spine. Flat feet. Headaches. A heartbeat that feels like it is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast. A highly arched mouth that can lead to crowding of teeth. Loose joints. Long, narrow face. Low back pain and numbness in the legs. Shortness of breath due to changes in the lungs or heart. Stretch marks on the skin. Vision changes, such as blurry vision and extreme nearsightedness."
What causes Marfan syndrome?,"'A mutation or change in a gene causes Marfan syndrome. Most people inherit the changed gene from their parents, but some children are born with the syndrome, even though there is no family history of the disorder. This is caused by a new change in the gene.'  "
Are there tests to diagnose Marfan syndrome?,"'No single test can diagnose Marfan syndrome. To see if you have the disorder, your doctor may:' Ask about your family and medical history. Perform a physical exam. Order blood and imaging tests. Order genetic testing to look for the changed gene that causes Marfan syndrome."
"How is Marfan syndrome treated, and can it be cured?","'Although there is no cure for Marfan syndrome, doctors use treatments to relieve symptoms and prevent additional problems or complications. Treatment depends on the area of the body affected by the syndrome and may include:'   Medications to help manage pain and problems with your heart. Other treatments, such as braces. Surgery to help correct problems with your bones or eyes."
What types of doctors or other health care professionals treat Marfan syndrome?,"'Health care providers who may treat Marfan syndrome include:' Cardiologists, who treat issues with the heart. Cardiothoracic surgeons, who specialize in surgery of the heart, lungs, and other organs and tissues in the chest. Clinical geneticists, who diagnose and treat children and adults with genetic disorders. Dental providers, such as orthodontists and oral-maxillofacial surgeons. Dermatologists, who specialize in conditions of the skin, hair, and nails. Mental health professionals, who provide counseling and treat mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Nurse educators, who help you understand your condition and help start treatment plans. Occupational therapists, who teach how to safely perform activities of daily living. Ophthalmologists, who treat eye disorders. Orthopaedists, who treat bone problems. Pediatricians, who diagnose and treat children. Physical therapists, who teach ways to build muscle strength. Primary care doctors, such as family physicians or internal medicine specialists, who coordinate care between the different health providers and treat other problems as they arise. Pulmonologists, who treat lung problems."
Living with Marfan syndrome,"'Treating and living with Marfan syndrome, and its complications is a lifelong process. However, treatment makes it possible for people with the disorder to have long, productive lives. The following tips can help you manage the disorder:''Women with Marfan syndrome can have healthy ''pregnancies''. However, the ''pregnancy'' is high risk because it can add ''stress'' on the heart. If you are thinking about ''getting pregnant'', talk to your doctor. Planning helps doctors treat problems prior to the pregnancy to keep both the mother and baby healthy.' Ask your doctors how often you should schedule follow-up visits. The visits may include regular eye exams, image tests to check for heart and lung problems, and an evaluation of your skeleton and growth. Reach out for support. Talk to your family and friends about the disorder and your feelings. Consider joining a community or online support group. Seek counseling or talk to a health care professional if you feel depressed or anxious about Marfan syndrome and its effects on your body. Eat a healthy well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Consider wearing medical identification to notify providers about your condition during an emergency. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can have a negative impact on both bone and lung health."

Summary,"'Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) occurs when an excessive amount of antidiuretic hormone is released resulting in water retention and a low sodium level. It is most common among older people. It has many causes including, but not limited too, ''pain'', ''stress'', ''exercise'', a ''low blood sugar'' level, certain disorders of the heart, thyroid gland, kidneys, or adrenal glands, and the use of certain medications. Disorders of the ''lungs'' and certain ''cancers'' may increase the risk of developing SIADH. Treatment includes fluid restriction and sometimes the use of medications that decrease the effect of antidiuretic hormone on the kidneys.' "
Symptoms,"'Symptoms of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone include water retention and low sodium level. Low sodium levels may cause lethargy and ''confusion''. Severe low levels of sodium in the body may cause muscle twitching, ''seizures'', stupor, ''coma'', and death.''This table lists symptoms that people with this disease may have. For most diseases, symptoms will vary from person to person. People with the same disease may not have all the symptoms listed.'  "
Cause,"'Many things can cause syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), including ''brain injury'', brain infection, brain abscesses, subarachnoid hemorrhage, ''encephalitis'', ''meningitis'', ''Guillain-Barré syndrome'', ''delirium'' tremens, ''multiple sclerosis'', ''lung cancer'', ''pancreatic cancer'', ''thymoma'', ''ovarian cancer'', ''lymphoma'', ''pneumonia'', ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'', lung ''abscess'', ''tuberculosis'', ''cystic fibrosis'', surgery, and ''drugs''.''SIADH has also been reported in association with ''AIDS'', ''temporal arteritis'', ''polyarteritis nodosa'', ''sarcoidosis'', ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever'', ''carcinoma'' of the cervix'', olfactory ''neuroblastoma'', and ''herpes zoster'' infection of the chest wall.''Often the underlying cause of the condition can not be determined. In these cases the condition is said to be idiopathic.' "
Treatment,"'Treatment of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) may involve fluid restriction, treatment of the underlying cause once determined, and medication that decreases the effect of antidiuretic hormone on the kidneys.'  "
What is Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis) and other ''birth defects'' in the hands and feet. The abnormality of the skull bones causes changes in the shape of the face and head. There are three subtypes of the syndrome, with Types II and II being the most severe. ''Pfeiffer syndrome has also been referred to as acrocephalosyndactyly type V, ACSV, craniofacial-skeletal-dermatologic syndrome, and Noack syndrome.' "
What causes Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'Pfeiffer syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, meaning that only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary to cause the condition. The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent or be a result of a new mutation (change in a gene) in the affected individual. Almost all cases of Pfeiffer syndrome type II and type III originate from new mutations because the parents are unaffected.' Pfeiffer syndrome type I is associated with mutations in genes known as FGFR1 
and FGFR2.  Pfeiffer syndrome type II and type III are associated with mutations 
in FGFR2. Older age in the father is a known risk factor for acquiring Pfeiffer 
syndrome in the offspring due to new mutations."
What are the signs and symptoms of Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'Signs and symptoms of Pfeiffer syndrome include:''People with Type I Pfeiffer syndrome typically have normal intelligence. Types II and III of Pfeiffer syndrome are more severe. People with types II and III of Pfeiffer syndrome usually have problems with brain development. This can cause limitation of brain growth and developmental delays.' Bulging eyes Wide-set eyes High forehead Beaked nose Underdevelopment of the upper jaw Prominent lower jaw Protrusion of the eyes Hearing loss (in over 50% of those 
affected) Short fingers and toes (brachydactyly) Webbing or fusion between the digits 
(syndactly) Dental problems Wide thumbs and big toes that bend away 
from the other digits Cloverleaf-shaped head (in Type II 
Pfeiffer syndrome)"
How common is Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'Pfeiffer syndrome affects around 1 out of every 100,000 people.' "
How is Pfeiffer syndrome diagnosed?,"'Pfeiffer syndrome is diagnosed by the presence of the characteristic birth defects. If the diagnosis is uncertain, genetic testing can be done to identify changes in the FGFR1 and/or FGFR2 genes.' "
Is there any treatment for Pfeiffer syndrome?,"""There is no treatment that can reverse Pfeiffer syndrome, but treatments are available that address each individual's specific symptoms. Treatments may be needed from a variety of specialists, including surgeons, pediatricians, otolaryngologists (ENT specialists), neurologists, or others. Reconstructive surgeries can help overcome some of the physical defects associated with the syndrome."" "
What other disorders are related to Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'There is a spectrum of disorders associated with changes to the FGFR genes that results in facial defects. These conditions include Pfeiffer syndrome and the following:' Apert syndrome Crouzon syndrome Beare-Stevenson syndrome FGFR2-related isolated coronal 
synostosis Jackson-Weiss syndrome Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis 
nigricans (AN) Muenke syndrome"
What is the life expectancy of an individual with Pfeiffer syndrome?,'Most people with Type I Pfeiffer syndrome have a normal life span. People with Types II and III have severe disease and may develop complications that shorten their life expectancy.' 
What is Prader-Willi syndrome?,"'Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic condition that affects many parts of the body. In infancy, this condition is characterized by weak muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, poor growth, and delayed development. Beginning in childhood, some affected individuals develop an insatiable appetite, which leads to chronic overeating (hyperphagia) and obesity. Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome, particularly those with obesity, also develop ''type 2 diabetes'' mellitus (the most common form of ''diabetes'').' "
"What are the signs, symptoms, and features of Prader-Willi syndrome?","'People with Prader-Willi syndrome typically have mild to moderate intellectual impairment and learning disabilities. Behavioral problems are common, including ''temper tantrums'', stubbornness, and compulsive behavior. Many affected individuals also have ''sleep'' abnormalities. ''Additional features of this condition include distinctive facial features, short stature, and small hands and feet. Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome have unusually fair skin and light-colored hair. Both affected males and affected females have underdeveloped genitals. Puberty is delayed or incomplete, and most affected individuals are unable to have children (''infertile'').' "
"How common is, and what causes Prader-Willi syndrome?","""Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by the loss of genes in a specific region of chromosome 15. People normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent. Some genes are turned on (active) only on the copy that is inherited from a person's father (the paternal copy). This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. Prader-Willi syndrome occurs when the region of the paternal chromosome 15 containing these genes is missing.""'Researchers are working to identify genes on chromosome 15 that are responsible for the characteristic features of Prader-Willi syndrome. They have determined that a deletion of the OCA2 gene on chromosome 15 is associated with unusually fair skin and light-colored hair in some affected individuals. The protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Researchers have not definitively connected any other genes with specific signs and symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome.''Most cases of Prader-Willi syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the paternal chromosome 15 is deleted in each cell. In another 25 percent of cases, a person with Prader-Willi syndrome has two copies of chromosome 15 inherited from his or her mother (maternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called maternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Prader-Willi syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect that abnormally turns off (inactivates) genes on the paternal chromosome 15. Each of these genetic changes results in a loss of gene function in a critical region of chromosome 15.' "
Can Prader-Willi syndrome be inherited?,"'Most cases of Prader-Willi syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the paternal chromosome 15 or by maternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.''Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Prader-Willi syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a genetic defect that abnormally inactivates genes on the paternal chromosome 15 to be passed from one generation to the next.' "

How do you know if you have restless leg syndrome?,"'The National Institutes of Health says that four criteria must be met for the diagnosis of RLS in a person (adult or child):' A strong urge to move your legs. This urge often, but not always, occurs with unpleasant feelings in your legs. When the disorder is severe, you also may have the urge to move your arms. Symptoms that start or get worse when you're inactive. The urge to move increases when you're sitting still or lying down and resting. Relief from moving. Movement, especially walking, helps relieve the unpleasant feelings. Symptoms that start or get worse in the evening or at night."
What is the treatment for restless leg syndrome? Is there a cure?,"'Treatment of restless leg syndrome is first directed toward any underlying illness, if known. For example:''There is no cure for restless leg syndrome; however, the condition usually responds well to home remedies and medications. The outlook is excellent for people with restless leg syndrome as long as it does not weaken or damage the function of the legs.'   Blood testing to reveal underlying iron deficiency anemia may reveal the underlying cause. If varicose veins are thought to be the cause, then surgery to repair the circulation may be considered. Reduction or elimination of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol from a person's diet can be very helpful. Stopping smoking can significantly diminish or prevent symptoms. Getting better sleep and exercise can help some persons affected by restless legs. Pregnant women who do not sleep well at night and other people with sleep disorders may develop RLS."
What medications treat restless leg syndrome and its symptoms?,"'Medications used to treat restless leg syndrome include:' natural supplements (such as iron), carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet), opioids (such as hydrocodone, or tramadol [Ultram] for intermittent symptoms), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equetro, Carbatrol), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), triazolam (Halcion), temazepam (Restoril), baclofen (Lioresal) bromocriptine, clonidine (Catapres, Catapres-TTS, Jenloga), gabapentin (Neurontin), gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant ER), ropinirole (Requip), and pramipexole (Mirapex)."

What are the signs and symptoms of Stiff-Person syndrome?,"'Stiff-Person syndrome is characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress, which can set off ''muscle spasms''. Abnormal postures, often hunched over and stiffened, are characteristic of the disorder. People with Stiff-Person syndrome can be too disabled to walk or move, or they are afraid to leave the house because street noises, such as the sound of a horn, can trigger spasms and falls. '  "
"Who is affected by, and what causes Stiff-Person syndrome?","'Stiff-Person syndrome affects twice as many women as men. It is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases such as ''diabetes'', ''thyroiditis'', ''vitiligo'', and ''pernicious anemia'"". Scientists don't yet understand what causes Stiff-Person syndrome, but research indicates that it is the result of an autoimmune response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord. "" "
How is Stiff-Person syndrome diagnosed?,"'The disorder is often misdiagnosed as '""Parkinson's disease""', ''multiple sclerosis'', ''fibromyalgia'', psychosomatic illness, or ''anxiety'' and ''phobia''. A definitive diagnosis can be made with a blood test that measures the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase (''GAD'') antibodies in the blood. People with Stiff-Person syndrome have elevated levels of GAD, an antibody that works against an enzyme involved in the synthesis of an important neurotransmitter in the brain.'  "
Is there any treatment for Stiff-Person syndrome?,"'People with Stiff-Person syndrome respond to high doses of ''diazepam'' and several anti-convulsants, ''gabapentin'' and ''tiagabine''. A study funded by the NINDS demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in reducing stiffness and lowering sensitivity to noise, touch, and ''stress'' in people with Stiff-Person syndrome. '  "
What is the prognosis for Stiff-Person syndrome?,"'Treatment with IVIg, anti-''anxiety'' ''drugs'', muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, and ''pain'' relievers will improve the symptoms of Stiff-Person syndrome, but will not cure the disorder. Most individuals with Stiff-Person syndrome have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe. With appropriate treatment, the symptoms are usually well controlled.' "
What research is being done for Stiff-Person syndrome?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) conducts research related to Stiff-Person syndrome in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. A study using the drug ''rituximab'' proved ineffective in treating individuals with the disorder. Current research is focused on understanding the cause of the disease and the role of the anti-GAD antibodies. ' "
What is syphilis?,"'Syphilis'' is a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'') caused by an infection with bacteria known as ''Treponema pallidum''. Like other ''STDs'', syphilis can be spread by any type of sexual contact. Syphilis can also be spread from an infected mother to the fetus during ''pregnancy'' or to the baby at the time of birth.''Syphilis has been described for centuries. It can cause long-term damage to different organs if not properly treated.' "
What causes syphillis?,"'The bacteria that cause syphilis, ''Treponema pallidum'', are referred to as spirochetes due to their spiral shape. The organisms penetrate into the lining of the mouth or genital area. ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of syphilis?,"'Syphilis infection, when untreated, progresses through different clinical stages with characteristic signs and symptoms. After the first infection, symptoms typically develop at around 21 days after the infection, but they may appear anywhere from 10 to 90 days following infection.''Primary syphilis''The first, or primary, stage of syphilis is characterized by the formation of a painless ulcer known as a ''chancre''. This sore develops at the site of infection and is usually solitary. A chancre is usually firm and round in shape. Sometimes, multiple chancres may be present. The chancre contains the infectious bacteria and while the sore is present, the condition is highly ''contagious''. Any contact with the chancre can spread the infection. If the chancre is located in the mouth, for example, even kissing can spread the disease. The chancre lasts for about 3 to 6 weeks and typically then goes away on its own. The use of ''condoms'' may also not prevent spread of the illness if the chancre is located on an area of the body not covered by the ''condom''.''Secondary syphilis''If primary syphilis is left untreated, secondary syphilis may develop. This stage of the illness usually occurs weeks to months after the primary stage. Secondary syphilis is characterized by a skin ''rash'' that typically does not ''itch'' and may easily be mistaken for ''rashes'' caused by other illnesses. It may appear on almost any part of the body, including sores inside the mouth, vagina, or anus. The ''rash'' of secondary syphilis is often found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the ''feet'', which is unusual for most ''rashes''. In some people, the rash may be mild and not noticed. Raised gray or whitish patches of skin, known as condyloma lata, may also develop, particularly in warm and moist areas of the body such as the armpits, mouth, or groin.''In secondary syphilis, the infection has spread throughout the body, so other symptoms may be associated with the skin manifestations. ''Fever'', ''enlarged lymph nodes'', ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'', ''hair loss'', ''headaches'', and muscle aches have all been reported in the secondary stage of syphilis. These symptoms will eventually subside, but if this secondary stage of the infection is not treated, the infection can progress to tertiary syphilis.''Tertiary syphilis''After the symptoms of secondary syphilis go away, the infection remains latent in the body if untreated. About 15% of infected and untreated people will go on to develop the third stage of syphilis, which can occur as much as 10 to 20 years after the initial infection. Tertiary syphilis is characterized by damage to any number of organ systems and can even be fatal. Tertiary syphilis can cause damage to the brain, nerves, eyes, ''heart'', blood vessels, ''liver'', bones, and joints. Symptoms that can result from the late stage of syphilis include problems with movement, gradual loss of sight, ''dementia'', ''paralysis'', and numbness. Neurosyphilis is the term used to refer to the involvement of the central nervous system and alterations in neurologic function.''Neonatal'' or congenital syphilis''Untreated syphilis in a ''pregnant'' women results in death of the fetus in up to 40% of infected pregnant women (''stillbirth'' or death shortly after birth), so all pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at their first ''prenatal'' visit. The screening test is usually repeated in the ''third trimester'' of pregnancy as well. If infected ''babies'' are born and survive, they are at risk for serious problems including ''seizures'' and developmental delays. Fortunately, syphilis in pregnancy is treatable.' "
What tests are used to diagnose syphilis?,"""There are two types of tests used to diagnose syphilis: treponemal tests (that identify antibodies to the causative organism) and non-treponemal tests (that identify the body's response to the infection but not to the organism itself). ""'The blood tests used to screen for syphilis are called the ''Venereal Disease'"" Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Rapid Plasminogen Reagent (RPR) tests. These tests detect the body's response to the infection, but not to the actual Treponema organism. While these are good screening tests, they are not specific enough to establish the diagnosis. These tests can give false-positive results, so a positive screening VDRL or RPR test must be followed by a treponemal test to detect the organism.""'A number of different tests are available that detect antibodies to ''Treponema pallidum'' bacteria. Examples include the microhemagglutination assay for ''T. pallidum'' (MHA-TP) and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-ABS). These tests can confirm the diagnosis of syphilis if a nontreponemal test such as VDRL or RPR is positive.' "
What is the treatment for syphilis?,"'Penicillin'' is the treatment of choice for syphilis in all stages. One intramuscular injection of long-acting benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units) is sufficient for a person who has primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. Three doses of this drug at weekly intervals are recommended for individuals with late latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration. While treatment kills the bacteria and prevents further organ damage, it will not reverse damage to the organs that has already occurred. Treatment with penicillin is safe during pregnancy.' "
What are the potential complications of syphilis?,"'As mentioned, untreated syphilis spreads throughout the body and causes complications with various organ systems. Some of the better known complications of late syphilis include ''blindness'', ''dementia'', ''aortic aneurysm'', deafness, ''stroke'', and other complications related to spread of the infection to the brain. Late stage syphilis can cause fatal complications.' "
What is the prognosis for syphilis?,"'Syphilis infection can be cured in any stage by the administration of penicillin. However, in later stages, damage already done to organs is not reversible.' "
Can syphilis be prevented?,"'There is no ''vaccine'' available to prevent syphilis. The use of ''safe sex'' practices, including condom use, can only prevent syphilis if the infectious chancre is located in a body area protected by a condom. Washing or ''douching'' after sexual activity cannot prevent the infection. It is not always possible to know whether a sex partner is infected with syphilis because the chancre (ulcer) may be located inside the vagina or rectum. Neonatal syphilis is preventable by treating the mother early in her pregnancy.' "
Facts you should know about lupus," Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease. SLE is characterized by the production of unusual antibodies in the blood. The cause(s) of systemic lupus erythematosus is (are) unknown, however, heredity, viruses, ultraviolet light, and drugs all may play some role. Lupus symptoms and signs includebutterfly-shaped rash on the face,appetite loss,joint pain,hair loss,fever,fatigue,photosensitivity,Raynaud's phenomenon,pleuritis, andpericarditis. butterfly-shaped rash on the face, appetite loss, joint pain, hair loss, fever, fatigue, photosensitivity, Raynaud's phenomenon, pleuritis, and pericarditis. Up to 10% of people with lupus isolated to the skin will develop the systemic form of lupus (SLE). Eleven criteria help health care professionals to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus is directed toward decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity with anti-inflammatory medications for those with mild symptoms and corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy) for those with more severe lupus. People with systemic lupus erythematosus can prevent ""flares"" of disease by avoiding sun exposure, not abruptly discontinuing medications, and monitoring their condition with their doctor."
What is systemic lupus erythematosus? What are the different types of lupus?,"""Lupus is an autoimmune disease characterized by acute and chronic inflammation of various tissues of the body. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. The immune system is a complex system within the body that is designed to fight infectious agents, such as bacteria and other foreign microbes. One of the ways that the immune system fights infections is by producing antibodies that bind to the microbes. People with lupus produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body rather than foreign infectious agents. These antibodies are referred to as autoantibodies.""'Because the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can affect tissues anywhere in the body, lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas. Sometimes lupus can cause disease of the skin, ''heart'', ''lungs'', kidneys, joints, and/or nervous system. When only the skin is involved by ''rash'', the condition is called lupus ''dermatitis'' or cutaneous lupus erythematosus. A form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that can be isolated to the skin, without internal disease, is called discoid lupus erythematosus. When internal organs are involved, the condition is referred to as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).''Both discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus are more common in women than men (about eight times more common). The disease can affect all ages but most commonly begins from 20-45 years of age. Statistics demonstrate that lupus is somewhat more frequent in African Americans and people of Chinese and Japanese descent.' "
What are risk factors and causes of lupus? Is lupus hereditary? Is lupus contagious?,"'The precise reason for the abnormal autoimmunity that causes lupus is not known. ''Inherited'' genes, viruses, ultraviolet light, and certain medications may all play some role.''Lupus is not caused by an infectious microorganism and is not ''contagious'' from one person to another.''Genetic factors increase the tendency of developing autoimmune diseases, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and autoimmune ''thyroid disorders'' are more common among relatives of people with lupus than the general population. Moreover, it is possible to have more than one autoimmune disease in the same individual. Therefore, ""overlap"" syndromes of lupus and ''rheumatoid arthritis'', or lupus and ''scleroderma'', etc., can occur.''Some scientists believe that the immune system in lupus is more easily stimulated by external factors like viruses or ultraviolet light. Sometimes, ''symptoms of lupus'' can be precipitated or aggravated by only a brief period of sun exposure.''It also is known that some women with systemic lupus erythematosus can experience worsening of their symptoms prior to their menstrual periods. This phenomenon, together with the female predominance of systemic lupus erythematosus, suggests that female hormones play an important role in the expression of SLE. This hormonal relationship is an active area of ongoing study by scientists.''Research has demonstrated evidence that a key enzyme\'s failure to dispose of dying cells may contribute the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. The enzyme, DNase1, normally eliminates what is called ""garbage DNA"" and other cellular debris by chopping them into tiny fragments for easier disposal. Researchers turned off the DNase1 gene in mice. The mice appeared healthy at birth, but after six to eight months, the majority of mice without DNase1 showed signs of systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, a genetic mutation in a gene that could disrupt the body\'s cellular waste disposal may be involved in the initiation of systemic lupus erythematosus.' "
What is drug-induced lupus?,"'Dozens of medications have been reported to trigger SLE. However, more than 90% of cases of ""drug-induced lupus"" occurs as a side effect of one of the following six drugs: ''hydralazine'' (''Apresoline'') is used for ''high blood pressure''; ''quinidine'' (''Quinidine Gluconate'', ''Quinidine Sulfate'') and ''procainamide'' (Pronestyl; Procan-SR; Procanbid) are used for ''abnormal heart rhythms''; ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin'') is used for ''epilepsy''; ''isoniazid'' (Nydrazid, Laniazid) is used for ''tuberculosis''; and d-''penicillamine'' (used for ''rheumatoid arthritis'  "
What are lupus symptoms and signs?,"'People with SLE can develop different combinations of symptoms and organ involvement.''Common lupus complaints and symptoms and signs include''Complications of organ involvement can lead to further symptoms that depend on the organ affected and severity of the disease.''SLE-associated skin manifestations can sometimes lead to scarring. In discoid lupus, only the skin is typically involved. The skin rash in discoid lupus often is found on the face and ''scalp''. It usually is red and may have raised borders. Discoid lupus ''rashes'' are usually painless and do not ''itch'', but scarring can cause permanent ''hair loss'' (alopecia). Over time, 5%-10% of those with discoid lupus may develop SLE.''Over half of the people with SLE develop a characteristic red, flat facial rash over the ''bridge'' of their nose. Because of its shape, it is frequently referred to as the ""butterfly rash"" of SLE. The rash is painless and does not ''itch''. The facial rash, along with inflammation in other organs, can be precipitated or worsened by exposure to sunlight, a condition called photosensitivity. This photosensitivity can be accompanied by worsening of inflammation throughout the body, called a ""flare"" of the disease.''Typically, with treatment, this rash can heal without permanent scarring.''Most SLE patients will develop arthritis during the course of their illness. Arthritis from SLE commonly involves swelling, ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and even deformity of the small joints of the hands, wrists, and ''feet''. Sometimes, the arthritis of SLE can mimic that of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (another autoimmune disease).''More serious organ involvement with inflammation occurs in the brain, ''liver'', and kidneys. White blood cells can be decreased in SLE (referred to as leukopenia or leucopenia). Also, low blood-clotting factors called platelets (''thrombocytopenia'') can be caused by lupus. Leukopenia can increase the risk of infection, and ''thrombocytopenia'' can increase the risk of bleeding. Low red blood cell counts (hemolytic\xa0''anemia'') can occur.''Inflammation of muscles (''myositis'') can cause ''muscle pain'' and ''weakness''. This can lead to elevations of muscle enzyme levels in the blood.''Inflammation of blood vessels (''vasculitis'') that supply oxygen to tissues can cause isolated injury to a nerve, the skin, or an internal organ. The blood vessels are composed of arteries that pass oxygen-rich blood to the tissues of the body and veins that return oxygen-depleted blood from the tissues to the lungs. ''Vasculitis'' is characterized by inflammation with damage to the walls of various blood vessels. The damage blocks the circulation of blood through the vessels and can cause injury to the tissues that are supplied with oxygen by these vessels.''Inflammation of the lining of the lungs (pleuritis) with pain aggravated by deep ''breathing'' (''pleurisy'') and of the heart (pericarditis) can cause sharp ''chest pain''. The chest pain is aggravated by ''coughing'', deep breathing, and certain changes in body position. The heart muscle itself rarely can become inflamed (''carditis''). It has also been shown that young women with SLE have a significantly increased risk of ''heart attacks'' due to ''coronary artery disease''.''Kidney inflammation in SLE (lupus nephritis) can cause leakage of protein into the urine, fluid retention, ''high blood pressure'', and even ''kidney failure''. This can lead to further ''fatigue'' and swelling (''edema'') of the legs and feet. With ''kidney failure'', machines are needed to cleanse the blood of accumulated waste products in a process called ''dialysis''.''Involvement of the brain can cause personality changes, thought disorders (psychosis), ''seizures'', and even ''coma''. Lupus of the nervous system (neurologic lupus) can lead to damage to nerves cause numbness, tingling, and weakness of the involved body parts or extremities. Brain involvement is referred to as lupus cerebritis.''Many people with SLE experience ''hair loss'' (alopecia). Often, this occurs simultaneously with an increase in the activity of their disease. The hair loss can be patchy or diffuse and appear to be more like hair thinning.''Some people with SLE have '""Raynaud's"""" phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon causes the blood vessels of the hands and feet to spasm, especially upon exposure to cold. The blood supply to the fingers and/or toes then becomes compromised, causing blanching, whitish and/or bluish discoloration, and pain and numbness in the exposed fingers and toes.""'Other diseases and conditions that can accompany lupus include ''fibromyalgia'', coronary ''heart disease'', nonbacterial ''valvular heart disease'', ''pancreatitis'', ''esophagus'' disease with ''difficulty swallowing'' (''dysphagia''), ''swollen lymph nodes'' (''lymphadenopathy''), ''liver disease'' (lupoid ''hepatitis''), infections, and a tendency to spontaneous blood clotting and thrombosis.'   fatigue or feeling tired, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, joint pain, muscle aches, hair loss (alopecia), arthritis, ulcers of the mouth and nose, facial rash (""butterfly rash""), unusual sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity), chest pain caused by inflammation of the lining that surrounds the lungs (pleuritis) and the heart (pericarditis), and poor circulation to the fingers and toes with cold exposure (Raynaud's phenomenon)."
How do health care professionals diagnose lupus?,"'Since SLE patients can have a wide variety of symptoms and different combinations of organ involvement, no single blood test establishes the diagnosis of systemic lupus. To help doctors improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of SLE, 11 criteria were established by the American Rheumatism Association. These 11 criteria are closely related to the symptoms discussed above. Some people suspected of having SLE may never develop enough criteria for a definite diagnosis. Other people accumulate enough criteria only after months or years of observation. When a person has four or more of these criteria, the diagnosis of SLE is strongly suggested. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of SLE may be made in some settings in people with only a few of these classical criteria, and treatment may sometimes be instituted at this stage. Of these people with minimal criteria, some may later develop other criteria, but many never do.''The following are 11 criteria used for diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus:''In addition to the 11 criteria, other tests can be helpful in evaluating people with SLE to determine the severity of organ involvement. These include routine testing of the blood to detect inflammation (for example, the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'', or ESR, and the ''C-reactive protein'', or CRP), blood-chemistry testing, direct analysis of internal body fluids, and tissue biopsies. Abnormalities in body fluids (joint or cerebrospinal fluid) and tissue samples (kidney biopsy, ''skin biopsy'', and nerve biopsy) can further support the diagnosis of SLE. The appropriate testing procedures are selected for the patient individually by the doctor.' Malar rash (over the cheeks of the face) Discoid skin rash (patchy redness with hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation that can cause scarring) Photosensitivity (skin rash in reaction to sunlight [ultraviolet light] exposure) Mucous membrane ulcers (spontaneous sores or ulcers of the lining of the mouth, nose, or throat) Arthritis (two or more swollen, tender joints of the extremities) Pleuritis or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining tissue around the heart or lungs, usually associated with chest pain upon breathing or changes of body position) Kidney abnormalities (abnormal amounts of urine protein or clumps of cellular elements called casts detectable with a standard urinalysis)Note: Ultimately, in patients with kidney disease from systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus nephritis), a kidney biopsy may be necessary to both define the cause of the kidney disease as being lupus-related as well as to determine the stage of the kidney disease in order to optimally guide treatments. Kidney biopsies are often performed by fine-needle aspiration of the kidney under radiology guidance, but in certain circumstances, a kidney biopsy can be done during an open abdominal operation. Brain irritation (manifested by seizures [convulsions] and/or psychosis, referred to as ""lupus cerebritis"") Blood-count abnormalities: low white blood count (WBC) or red blood count (RBC), or platelet count on routine complete blood count testing; leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Each of these are detectable with standard complete blood count testing (CBC). Immunologic disorder (abnormal immune tests include anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) or anti-Sm [anti-Smith] antibodies, falsely positive blood test for syphilis, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, or positive LE prep test) Antinuclear antibody (positive ANA antibody testing [antinuclear antibodies in the blood])"
What specialties of health care professionals treat lupus?,"'Lupus is treated by internal medicine subspecialists called ''rheumatologists'"". Depending on whether or not specific organs are targeted, other health specialists who can be involved in the care of patients with lupus include dermatologists, nephrologists, hematologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, and neurologists. It's not uncommon that a team of such physicians is coordinated by the treating ""'rheumatologist'' together with the primary care doctor.' "
What is the treatment for lupus? Is there a cure for lupus?,"""There is no permanent cure for SLE. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and protect organs by decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity in the body. The precise treatment is decided on an individual basis. Many people with mild symptoms may need no treatment or only intermittent courses of anti-inflammatory medications. Those with more serious illness involving damage to internal organ(s) may require high doses of corticosteroids in combination with other medications that suppress the body's immune system.""'People with SLE need more rest during periods of active disease. Researchers have reported that poor ''sleep'' quality was a significant factor in developing fatigue in people with SLE. These reports emphasize the importance for people and physicians to address ''sleep'' quality and the effect of underlying ''depression'', lack of ''exercise'', and self-care coping strategies on overall health. During these periods, carefully prescribed ''exercise'' is still important to maintain muscle tone and range of motion in the joints.''To protect from sun sensitivity, sunscreens, sun avoidance, and ''sun protection'' clothing are used. Certain types of lupus rash can respond to topical cortisone medications.''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') are helpful in reducing inflammation and pain in muscles, joints, and other tissues. Examples of NSAIDs include ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), and ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''). Since the individual response to NSAIDs varies, it is common for a doctor to try different NSAIDs to find the most effective one with the fewest side effects. The most common side effects are stomach upset, ''abdominal pain'', ulcers, and even ulcer bleeding. NSAIDs are usually taken with food to reduce side effects. Sometimes, medications that prevent ulcers while taking NSAIDs, such as ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec''), are given simultaneously.''Corticosteroids are more potent than NSAIDs in reducing inflammation and restoring function when the disease is active. Corticosteroids are particularly helpful when internal organs are affected. Corticosteroids can be given by mouth, injected directly into the joints and other tissues, or administered intravenously. Unfortunately, corticosteroids have serious side effects when given in high doses over prolonged periods, and the doctor will try to monitor the activity of the disease in order to use the lowest doses that are safe. Side effects of corticosteroids include ''weight gain'', thinning of the bones and skin, infection, ''diabetes'', facial puffiness, ''cataracts'', and death (necrosis) of the tissues in large joints.''Hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil) is an antimalarial medication found to be particularly effective for SLE patients with fatigue, skin involvement, and joint disease. Consistently taking Plaquenil can prevent flare-ups of lupus. Side effects are uncommon but include ''diarrhea'', ''upset stomach'', and eye-pigment changes. Eye-pigment changes are rare but require monitoring by an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) during treatment with Plaquenil. Researchers have found that Plaquenil significantly decreased the frequency of abnormal ''blood clots'' in people with systemic lupus. Moreover, the effect seemed independent of immune suppression, implying that Plaquenil can directly act to prevent the blood clots. This fascinating study highlights an important reason for people and doctors to consider Plaquenil for long-term use, especially for those SLE people who are at some risk for blood clots in veins and arteries, such as those with phospholipid antibodies (cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and false-positive ''venereal disease'' research laboratory test). This means not only that Plaquenil reduces the chance for re-flares of SLE, but it can also be beneficial in thinning the blood to prevent abnormal excessive blood clotting. Plaquenil is commonly used in combination with other treatments for lupus.''For resistant skin disease, other antimalarial drugs, such as ''chloroquine'' (''Aralen'') or quinacrine, are considered and can be used in combination with hydroxychloroquine. Alternative medications for skin disease include ''dapsone'' and retinoic acid (Retin-A). Retin-A is often effective for an uncommon wart-like form of lupus skin disease. For more severe skin disease, immunosuppressive medications are considered as described below.''Medications that suppress immunity (immunosuppressive medications) are also called cytotoxic drugs. They are sometimes referred to as chemotherapy because they are also used to treat ''cancer'', generally in much higher doses than those used to treat lupus. Immunosuppressive medications are used for treating people with more severe manifestations of SLE, such as damage to internal organ(s). Examples of immunosuppressive medications include ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune''), and the disease-modifying drug ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). All immunosuppressive medications can seriously depress blood-cell counts and increase risks of infection and bleeding. Immunosuppressive medications may not be taken during ''pregnancy'' or ''conception'' because of risk to the fetus. Other side effects are specific for each drug. For examples, methotrexate can cause liver toxicity, while cyclosporine can impair kidney function.''In recent years, ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''CellCept'') has been used as an effective medication for lupus, particularly when it is associated with kidney disease. CellCept has been helpful in reversing active lupus kidney disease (lupus ''renal disease'') and in maintaining remission after it is established. Its lower side-effect profile has advantage over traditional immune-suppression medications.''In lupus patients with serious brain (lupus cerebritis) or kidney disease (lupus nephritis), plasmapheresis is sometimes used to remove antibodies and other immune substances from the blood to suppress immunity. Plasmapheresis is a process of removing blood and passing the blood through a filtering machine, then returning the blood to the body with its antibodies removed. Rarely, people with SLE can develop seriously low platelet levels, thereby increasing the risk of excessive and spontaneous bleeding. Since the spleen is believed to be the major site of platelet destruction, surgical removal of the spleen is sometimes performed to improve platelet levels. Other treatments have included plasmapheresis and the use of male hormones.''Plasmapheresis has also been used to remove certain harmful proteins (cryoglobulins) that can lead to vasculitis. End-stage kidney damage from SLE requires dialysis and/or a ''kidney transplant''.''Research is indicating benefits of ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') in treating lupus. Rituximab is an intravenously infused antibody that suppresses a particular white blood cell, the B cell, by decreasing their number in the circulation. B cells have been found to play a central role in lupus activity, and when they are suppressed, the disease tends toward remission. This may particularly helpful for people with kidney disease.''Another new B-cell-suppressing treatment is ''belimumab'' (''Benlysta''). Belimumab blocks the stimulation of the B cells (a B-lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS-specific inhibitor) and is approved for the treatment of adults with active autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus who are receiving standard therapy. It is important to note that the efficacy of belimumab has not been evaluated in patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus. Belimumab has not been studied in combination with other biologic therapies or intravenous cyclophosphamide.'  "
Is there a lupus diet?,"'While there is no specific lupus ''diet'', scientists have found that low-dose ''diet'' supplementation with ''omega-3'' fish oils could help patients with lupus by decreasing inflammation and disease activity and possibly decreasing heart-disease risk. It is generally recommended that patients with lupus eat a balanced diet that includes plant-based foods and lean sources of protein.''DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) has been helpful in reducing fatigue, improving thinking difficulties, and improving quality of life in people with SLE. Recent research indicates that DHEA diet supplementation has been shown to improve or stabilize signs and symptoms of SLE. DHEA is commonly available in health-food stores, pharmacies, and many groceries.'  "
How can a lupus patient help prevent disease activity (flares)?,"'SLE is undoubtedly a potentially serious illness with involvement of numerous organ systems. However, it is important to recognize that most people with SLE lead full, active, and healthy lives. Periodic increases in disease activity (flares) can usually be managed by varying medications. Since ultraviolet light can precipitate and worsen flares, people with systemic lupus should avoid sun exposure. Sunscreens and clothing covering the extremities can be helpful. Abruptly stopping medications, especially corticosteroids, can also cause flares and should be avoided. People with SLE are at increased risk of infections as SLE-related complications, especially if they are taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications. Therefore, any unexpected fever should be reported to medical professionals and evaluated.''The key to successful management of SLE is regular contact and communication with the doctor, allowing monitoring of symptoms, disease activities, and treatment of side effects.' "
How can systemic lupus erythematosus affect pregnancy or the newborn?,"'Lupus pregnancy deserves special review because it presents unique challenges. ''Pregnant'' women with SLE are considered high-risk ''pregnancies''. These pregnancies require interactive monitoring generally by a skilled rheumatologist together with an obstetrician expert in high-risk pregnancies. Women with SLE who are pregnant require close observation during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period. This includes fetal monitoring by the obstetrician during later pregnancy. These women can have an increased risk of miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) and can have flares of SLE during pregnancy. The presence of phospholipid antibodies, such as cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant, in the blood can identify people at risk for miscarriages. Cardiolipin antibodies are associated with a tendency toward blood clotting. Women with SLE who have cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant may need blood-thinning medications (aspirin with or without ''heparin'') during pregnancy to prevent miscarriages. Other reported treatments include the use of intravenous gamma globulin for selected people with histories of premature ''miscarriage'' and those with low blood-clotting elements (platelets) during pregnancy. Pregnant women who have had a previous blood-clotting event may benefit by continuation of blood-thinning medications throughout and after pregnancy for up to six to 12 weeks, at which time the risk of clotting associated with pregnancy seems to diminish. Plaquenil has now been found to be safe for use to treat SLE during pregnancy. Corticosteroids, such as ''prednisone'', are also safely used to treat certain manifestation of lupus during pregnancy.''Lupus antibodies can be transferred from the mother to the fetus and result in lupus illness in the ''newborn'' (""''neonatal'' lupus""). This includes the development of low red cell counts (hemolytic anemia) and/or white blood cell counts (leucopenia) and platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and skin rash. Problems can also develop in the electrical system of the baby\'s heart (congenital ''heart block''). Occasionally, a ''pacemaker'"" for the baby's heart is needed in this setting. Neonatal lupus and congenital heart block are more common in newborns of mothers with SLE who carry specific antibodies referred to as anti-Ro (or anti-SSA) and anti-La (or anti-SSB). (It is helpful for the newborn baby's doctor to be made aware if the mother is known to carry these antibodies, even prior to delivery. The risk of heart block is 2%; the risk of neonatal lupus is 5%.) Neonatal lupus usually clears after 6 months of age, as the mother's antibodies are slowly metabolized by the baby."" "
What is the prognosis of lupus? What does the future hold for people with systemic lupus?,"'Overall, the outlook for people living with systemic lupus is improving each decade with the development of more accurate monitoring tests and treatments.''The role of the immune system in causing diseases is becoming better understood through research. This knowledge will be applied to design safer and more effective treatment methods. For example, completely revising the immune system of people with extremely aggressive treatments that virtually temporarily wipe out the immune system is being evaluated. Current studies involve immune eradication with or without replacement of cells that can reestablish the immune system (stem-cell transplantation).''It should be noted that people with SLE are at a somewhat increased risk for developing ''cancer''. The ''cancer'' risk is most dramatic for blood ''cancers'', such as ''leukemia'' and ''lymphoma'', but is also increased for ''breast cancer''. This risk probably relates, in part, to the altered immune system that is characteristic of SLE.''Women with SLE appear to be at increased risk for ''heart disease'' (''coronary artery disease'') according to recent reports. Women with SLE should be evaluated and counseled to minimize risk factors for ''heart disease'', such as elevated blood ''cholesterol'', quitting ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', and ''obesity''.''Landmark research has shown clearly that ''oral contraceptives'' do not increase the rate of flares of systemic lupus erythematosus. This important finding is opposite to what has been thought for years. Now we can reassure women with lupus that if they take birth-control pills, they are not increasing their risk for lupus flares. ''Note'': Women who are at increased risk of blood clotting, such as women with lupus who have phospholipid antibodies (including cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant), should avoid birth-control pills or any estrogen medications.''Individuals living with SLE can improve their long-term prognosis by learning about the many aspects of the illness as well as closely monitoring their own health with their doctors.'
