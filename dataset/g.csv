What is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency?,"'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that occurs most often in males. This condition mainly affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. In affected individuals, a defect in an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causes red blood cells to break down prematurely. This destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis.''The most common medical problem associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is hemolytic anemia, which occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (''jaundice''), dark urine, ''fatigue'', shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. In people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs (such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat ''malaria''). Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling ''pollen'' from fava plants (a reaction called favism).''Glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency is also a significant cause of mild to severe jaundice in newborns. Many people with this disorder, however, never experience any signs or symptoms.'  "
How common is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency?,"'An estimated 400 million people worldwide have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This condition occurs most frequently in certain parts of Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean. It affects about 1 in 10 African-American males in the United States.' "
What genes are related to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency?,"'Mutations in the G6PD gene cause glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.''The G6PD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in the normal processing of carbohydrates. It also protects red blood cells from the effects of potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are byproducts of normal cellular functions. Chemical reactions involving glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase produce compounds that prevent reactive oxygen species from building up to toxic levels within red blood cells.''If mutations in the G6PD gene reduce the amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or alter its structure, this enzyme can no longer play its protective role. As a result, reactive oxygen species can accumulate and damage red blood cells. Factors such as infections, certain drugs, or ingesting fava beans can increase the levels of reactive oxygen species, causing red blood cells to be destroyed faster than the body can replace them. A reduction in the amount of red blood cells causes the signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia.''Researchers believe that carriers of a G6PD mutation may be partially protected against ''malaria'', an infectious disease carried by a certain type of mosquito. A reduction in the amount of functional glucose-6-dehydrogenase appears to make it more difficult for this parasite to invade red blood cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency occurs most frequently in areas of the world where malaria is common.' "
How do people inherit glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency?,"'This condition is ''inherited'' in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.' "

Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.,"'Gallbladder cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in the tissues of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen. The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver to help digest fat. When food is being broken down in the stomach and ''intestines'', bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine. ''The wall of the gallbladder has 3 main layers of tissue. ''Between these layers is supporting connective tissue. Primary gallbladder cancer starts in the innermost layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows. ' Mucosal (innermost) layer. Muscularis (middle, muscle) layer. Serosal (outer) layer."
Being female can increase the risk of developing gallbladder cancer.,'Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for gallbladder cancer include the following: ' Being female. Being Native American.
"Possible signs of gallbladder cancer include jaundice, pain, and fever.",'These and other symptoms may be caused by gallbladder cancer. Other conditions may cause the same symptoms. A doctor should be consulted if any of the following problems occur: '   Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). Pain above the stomach. Fever. Nausea and vomiting. Bloating. Lumps in the abdomen.
Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.,"'Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons: ''Gallbladder cancer is sometimes found when the gallbladder is removed for other reasons. Patients with ''gallstones'' rarely develop gallbladder cancer. ''Procedures that create pictures of the gallbladder and the area around it help diagnose gallbladder cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the gallbladder is called staging. ''In order to plan treatment, it is important to know if the gallbladder cancer can be removed by surgery. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer are usually done at the same time. The following tests and procedures may be used: '   There aren't any noticeable signs or symptoms in the early stages of gallbladder cancer. The symptoms of gallbladder cancer, when present, are like the symptoms of many other illnesses. The gallbladder is hidden behind the liver. Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. An abdominal ultrasound is done to diagnose gallbladder cancer. Liver function tests: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by gallbladder cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay: A test that measures the level of CEA in the blood. CEA is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. When found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of gallbladder cancer or other conditions. CA 19-9 assay: A test that measures the level of CA 19-9 in the blood. CA 19-9 is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. When found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of gallbladder cancer or other conditions. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an X-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that produces it. Chest X-ray: An X-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An X-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). A dye may be injected into the gallbladder area so the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine will show up better in the image. This procedure is called MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography). To create detailed pictures of blood vessels near the gallbladder, the dye is injected into a vein. This procedure is called MRA (magnetic resonance angiography). ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography): A procedure used to X-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes gallbladder cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine. A catheter (a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the bile ducts. A dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an X-ray is taken. If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open. Tissue samples may also be taken. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The biopsy may be done after surgery to remove the tumor. If the tumor clearly cannot be removed by surgery, the biopsy may be done using a fine needle to remove cells from the tumor. Laparoscopy: A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as removing organs or taking tissue samples for biopsy. The laparoscopy helps to determine if the cancer is within the gallbladder only or has spread to nearby tissues and if it can be removed by surgery. PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography): A procedure used to X-ray the liver and bile ducts. A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an X-ray is taken. If a blockage is found, a thin, flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body."
Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: ''Treatment may also depend on the age and general health of the patient and whether the cancer is causing symptoms. '""Gallbladder cancer can be cured only if it is found before it has spread, when it can be removed by surgery. If the cancer has spread, palliative treatment can improve the patient's quality of life by controlling the symptoms and complications of this disease. ""'Taking part in one of the ''clinical trials'' being done to improve treatment should be considered. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site. ' The stage of the cancer (whether the cancer has spread from the gallbladder to other places in the body). Whether the cancer can be completely removed by surgery. The type of gallbladder cancer (how the cancer cell looks under a microscope). Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back)."
Stages of Gallbladder Cancer,"'Tests and procedures to stage gallbladder cancer tell the doctor the extent of the cancer. The testing necessary to learn if the disease is localized or not is usually done at the same time as diagnosis. ''See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to detect, diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer. ''In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the innermost (mucosal) layer of the gallbladder. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called ''carcinoma in situ''. ''In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB.''Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB. ''In stage III, cancer has spread to a main blood vessel in the liver or to nearby organs and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. ''In stage IV, cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and/or to organs far away from the gallbladder. ''Cancer is found in the wall of the gallbladder and can be completely removed by surgery. ''Cancer has spread through the wall of the gallbladder to surrounding tissues or organs or throughout the abdominal ''cavity''. Except in patients whose cancer has spread only to lymph nodes, the cancer is unresectable (cannot be completely removed by surgery). ''Recurrent gallbladder cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the gallbladder or in other parts of the body. ' Stage IA: Cancer has spread beyond the innermost (mucosal) layer to the connective tissue or to the muscle (muscularis) layer. Stage IB: Cancer has spread beyond the muscle layer to the connective tissue around the muscle. Stage IIA: Cancer has spread beyond the visceral peritoneum (a thin layer of tissue that covers the gallbladder) and/or to the liver and/or one nearby organ (such as the stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, or bile ducts outside the liver). Stage IIB: Cancer has spread: beyond the innermost layer to the connective tissue and to nearby lymph nodes; or to the muscle layer and nearby lymph nodes; or beyond the muscle layer to the connective tissue around the muscle and to nearby lymph nodes; or through the visceral peritoneum (tissue that covers the gallbladder) and/or to the liver and/or to one nearby organ (such as the stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, or bile ducts outside the liver), and to nearby lymph nodes."
Treatment Option Overview,"'There are different types of treatment for patients with gallbladder cancer.''Different types of treatments are available for patients with gallbladder cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. Before starting treatment, patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. ''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team. ''Gallbladder cancer may be treated with a cholecystectomy, surgery to remove the gallbladder and some of the tissues around it. Nearby lymph nodes may be removed. A laparoscope is sometimes used to guide gallbladder surgery. The laparoscope is attached to a video camera and inserted through an incision (port) in the abdomen. Surgical instruments are inserted through other ports to perform the surgery. Because there is a risk that gallbladder cancer cells may spread to these ports, tissue surrounding the port sites may also be removed.''If the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may relieve symptoms: ''Radiation therapy'' is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''X-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells. There are two types of radiation therapy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. ''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the spinal column, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. ''Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.

""   Surgical biliary bypass: If the tumor is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. During this operation, the gallbladder or bile duct will be cut and sewn to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area. Endoscopic stent placement: If the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin, flexible tube) to drain bile that has built up in the area. The stent may be placed through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage: A procedure done to drain bile when there is a blockage and endoscopic stent placement is not possible. An X-ray of the liver and bile ducts is done to locate the blockage. Images made by ultrasound are used to guide placement of a stent, which is left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. This procedure may be done to relieve jaundice before surgery. Surgery to remove the gallbladder and some of the tissue around it. The liver and nearby lymph nodes may also be removed. Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy may follow surgery. Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. A clinical trial of radiation therapy with radiosensitizers.

What is gallbladder pain?,"'Gallbladder ''pain'' is (often misspelled ""gall bladder"") an all-inclusive term used to describe any ''pain'' due to disease related to the gallbladder. The major gallbladder problems that produce gallbladder ''pain'' are biliary ''colic'', cholecystitis, ''gallstones'', ''pancreatitis'', and ascending cholangitis. Symptoms vary and may be triggered by eating certain foods. The pain may be described as intermittent, constant, abdominal, radiating to the back, mild to severe depending on the underlying cause.''A brief review of the gallbladder anatomy and function may help readers better understand gallbladder pain. The gallbladder is connected to the ''liver'' via ducts that supply bile to the gallbladder for storage. These bile ducts then form the common hepatic duct that joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct that empties into the GI tract (duodenum). In addition, the pancreatic duct usually merges with the common bile duct just before it enters the duodenum. Hormones trigger the gallbladder to release bile when fat and amino acids reach the duodenum after eating a meal (see illustration below), which facilitates the ''digestion'' of these foods. Statistics suggest that women may have up to twice the incidence of ''gallstones'' than men.' "
What are the causes of gallbladder pain?,"'As stated previously, the major gallbladder problems that produce gallbladder pain are biliary ''colic'', cholecystitis, ''gallstones'', ''pancreatitis'', and ascending cholangitis. There are two major causes of pain that either originate from the gallbladder or involve the gallbladder directly. They are due to 1) intermittent or complete blockage of any of the ducts by ''gallstones''; or 2) gallstone sludge and/or inflammation that may accompany irritation or infection of the surrounding tissues, when partial or complete obstruction of ducts causes pressure and ischemia (inadequate blood supply due to a blockage of blood vessels in the area) to develop in the adjacent tissues.''Gallstone formation usually happens in the gallbladder, but may form in any of the ducts. When the gallbladder is compressed (squeezed by musculature), bile usually goes out through the bile ducts into the GI tract; however, if gallstones or gallstone sludge is present, there can be partial or complete blockage of the ducts with pressure on the surrounding tissue, sometimes enough to cause local ischemia. Other processes such as ''trauma'' can cause gallbladder pain. Infection of the biliary ducts and the gallbladder, usually occurring after gallstone obstruction also can cause pain.'  "
What is biliary colic?,"'Biliary ''colic'' is a term used to describe the type of pain related to the gallbladder, when the gallbladder contracts and the cystic duct is partially or completely blocked by a gallstone. The symptoms are described below.' "
What are other signs and symptoms of gallbladder pain?,"'Gallbladder pain may vary or feel different depending on the cause. Many people with gallstones never experience pain. However, there are some variations in gallbladder pain that help the doctor to make a diagnosis.'   Biliary colic (intermittent duct blockage): Sudden and rapidly increasing pain (ache or pressure) in the right upper abdomen or epigastric area; some people will have pain radiating to the right shoulder (or back pain in the tip of the scapula) and/or also develop nausea and vomiting. The pain usually subsides in about 1 to 5 hours although a mild ache may persist for about a day. Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder tissue secondary to duct blockage): severe steady pain in the upper-right abdomen that may radiate to the right shoulder or back, abdominal tenderness when touched or pressed, sweating, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and bloating; discomfort lasts longer than with biliary colic. Acalculous cholecystitis (no gallstones) has similar symptoms to cholecystitis but occurs as a complication of other problems like trauma or burns; patients have severe symptoms and appear very ill. Pancreatitis: Gallstones from the gallbladder can block the pancreatic duct and cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) with upper abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, tender abdomen, more pain after eating, with nausea and vomiting. Ascending cholangitis (or simply cholangitis or infection of the biliary system) causes symptoms and signs that include fever, abdominal pain, jaundice and even hypotension (low blood pressure), and confusion; it is a medical emergency."
How is the cause of gallbladder pain diagnosed?,"""The history and physical exam helps to establish a presumptive diagnosis. Murphy's sign (pain or temporary respiratory arrest on deep right subcostal palpation) has been estimated to be over 95% specific for acute cholecystitis. A few laboratory blood tests such as ""'liver function'' tests, lipase, amylase, ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), and an abdominal X-ray are done to determine the exact problem is causing the pain.\xa0''Ultrasound'' can detect gallstones, and ''CT scan'' may delineate organ structural changes. A ''HIDA scan'' (uses radioactive material) can measure gallbladder emptying while an ''ERCP'' test uses an endoscope to place dye in the ducts of the pancreas, gallbladder, and ''liver''. ''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') is sometimes used to detail the organ structures (liver, gallbladder, and pancreas); other tests also may be considered. The results of these tests help pinpoint the problem and establish the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment of gallbladder pain?,"'If you have no gallbladder pain (even if you have gallstones but never had pain), you need no treatment. Some patients who have had one or two gallstone attacks may elect to avoid treatment. Pain during an acute gallstone attack is often treated with morphine. Medical treatments include''The definitive treatment is gallbladder removal surgery (and/or the obstructing gallstones). Currently, the surgical method of choice is laparoscopic surgery, where the gallbladder is removed by instruments using only small incisions in the abdomen. However, some patients may require more extensive surgery. Usually, people do well once the gallbladder is removed unless there is an underlying cause that mimics gallbladder pain (for example, biliary ''dyskinesia'', a motility disorder of sphincter of Oddi).''Women who are ''pregnant'' are treated like women who are not ''pregnant'', although pregnant women more commonly have ''cholesterol'' gallstone development than non-pregnant women. Although supportive care is tried in women who are pregnant, acute cholecystitis is the second most common surgical emergency in ''pregnancy'' (''appendicitis'' is the first).'   oral bile salt therapy (<50% effective), ursodiol (Actigall, for example) dissolution, and lithotripsy (shock waves)."
Home remedies for relief of gallbladder pain," Home remedies include peppermint, alfalfa, apple cider vinegar, and others; you should check with your doctor before using these remedies. Following a low-fat diet may reduce the frequency of biliary colic but has not been shown to dissolve gallstones. Coffee and regular exercise may reduce the incidence of gallstone disease and its associated gallbladder pain. Some health-care professional recommend decreasing dairy and grains in the diet after gallbladder removal; again, individuals should discuss such changes with their doctor."
What are the complications of gallbladder pain?,"'The complications of gallbladder pain include''Other complications of gallbladder disease include'   discomfort with eating, poor food intake, weight loss, electrolyte abnormalities, consumption of pain medications, and disruption of daily activities. bile duct blockage, serious infections (empyema and gangrene of the gallbladder), pancreatitis, peritonitis, and infrequently, gallbladder cancer."
What is cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)?,"'Cholescintigraphy is a test done by nuclear medicine physicians to diagnose obstruction of the bile ducts (for example, by a gallstone or a ''tumor''), disease of the gallbladder, and bile leaks. It sometimes is referred to as a HIDA scan or a gallbladder scan.' "
How is cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) done?,"'For cholescintigraphy, a radioactive chemical is injected intravenously into the patient. The test chemical is removed from the blood by the ''liver'' and secreted into the bile which is produced by the liver. The test chemical then disperses everywhere that the bile goes-into the bile ducts, the gallbladder, and the intestine. A camera that senses radioactivity (like a Geiger counter) is then placed over the patient\'s abdomen and a ""picture"" of the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder and surrounding areas is obtained which corresponds to where the radioactive chemical has traveled within the bile-filled liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder. Cholescintigraphy takes approximately two hours.' "
How are the results of cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) used?,"'There are various patterns of radioactivity that can be seen following the injection of the radioactive chemical, and each has a different meaning. If the test chemical is not detected in the liver, a diseased liver is probably indicated. If the chemical is absorbed by the liver but not secreted into the bile ducts, there probably is a complete obstruction of the bile ducts exiting the liver. When the test chemical fails to appear in the gallbladder, but is detected in the intestine, there probably is an obstruction of the cystic duct leading to and from the gallbladder. (Obstruction is most commonly caused by ''gallstones'' and, less commonly, by tumors. Parasites, and ''blood clots'' also may obstruct infrequently.) Finally, if the chemical appears outside the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, or intestine, there probably is a bile leak from the bile ducts or gallbladder.''Cholescintigraphy is most commonly used to diagnose problems with the gallbladder when other more commonly-performed tests, particularly ''ultrasonography'', are normal or non-diagnostic. Cholescintigraphy can be modified with the addition of an intravenous injection of cholecystokinin, the hormone that is normally released by the body after a meal. This hormone causes the gallbladder to contract and squeeze out its bile into the intestine. Reduced contraction of the gallbladder following cholecystokinin (i.e., reduced emptying of the radioactivity from the gallbladder) may mean that there is disease of the gallbladder itself, particularly inflammation or scarring of the wall.' "
What are the limitations of cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)?,"'Nonvisualization (the failure of the gallbladder to appear on a cholescintigraphy scan) of the gallbladder occurs because of disease of the gallbladder, particularly ''gallstones'"". However, nonvisualization does not necessarily mean that the obstruction is the cause of the patient's problem. For example, patients with ""'gallstones'"" often have a nonvisualizing gallbladder due to obstruction of the cystic duct, but the obstruction causes no symptoms. Thus, cholescintigraphy is helpful only if the patient's problem is likely-based on the history and physical examination-to be due to disease of the gallbladder or bile ducts.""""With the use of cholecystokinin, poor contraction of the gallbladder can be seen in some normal individuals. Therefore, reduced contraction does not always mean that the gallbladder is diseased. Again, cholescintigraphy with cholecystokinin is helpful only if the patient's problem is likely-based on the history and physical examination-to be due to disease of the gallbladder or bile ducts.""""Another limitation of cholescintigraphy is that this test does not work when the patient's serum ""'bilirubin'' is greater than 4 mg/dl.' "
What are the side effects of cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)?,"'There are few side effects to cholescintigraphy. Reactions to the radioactive chemical and cholecystokinin are rare.  The amount of radioactivity that patients are exposed to is small.  The radioactive compound is eliminated in the ''stool'', and the radioactivity deteriorates rapidly within hours.'  "
What alternatives are there to cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)?,"'Other common means of evaluating the gallbladder and bile ducts include ultrasonography and ''computerized tomography'' (CT or CAT scan). Cholangiography, either percutaneous (through the skin) or endoscopic (''ERCP'') (inserted down the throat), is a radiological procedure in which dye is injected into the gallbladder and bile ducts and then ''X-rays'' are taken. Newer procedures include endoscopic ultrasonography and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') cholangiography. Oral cholecystography in which X-rays are taken of the gallbladder following ingestion of a dye that is concentrated in the gallbladder, is currently rarely done.' "
What is an oral cholecystogram (OCG)?,"'The oral cholecystogram, or OCG, is a radiologic procedure for diagnosing ''gallstones''. An oral cholecystogram is in contrast to an ''intravenous cholangiogram'' (IVC). The oral cholecystogram is rarely used, as ''ultrasound'' or CT are more accurate, faster techniques for identifying ''gallstones'' without exposure to ''iodine''.' "
How is an oral cholecystogram done?,"'The bile ducts themselves cannot be seen on the x-ray in an OCG because the iodine is not concentrated in the ducts. Therefore, any gallstones lodged in the ducts will go undetected on OCG.'""Failure to visualize the gallbladder on an OCG may occur for one of two reasons.  First, a gallstone may have obstructed the cystic duct and prevented the iodine-containing bile from entering the gallbladder. Second, inflammation of the gallbladder -- usually due to gallstones -- may have interfered with the gallbladder's ability to concentrate bile and iodine. Whichever the cause, failure to visualize the gallbladder on an OCG strongly suggests a diseased gallbladder."" "
What are the risks of an oral cholecystogram?,"' The risks of an oral cholecystogram are few. One, of course, is the ''radiation''. However, in an OCG there is a relatively small amount of radiation from the x-rays.''Another risk involves the iodine. Some people are ''allergic'' to iodine.  Fortunately, most people who are allergic know that they are, and therefore do not undergo the test.' "
When is an oral cholecystogram useful?,"'The OCG finds gallstones 95% of the time. However, the OCG has tended to be replaced by ''ultrasonography'"" because ultrasonography is slightly better at diagnosing gallstones and can be done immediately without waiting one or two days for the OCG's iodine to be absorbed, excreted, and concentrated. The OCG also cannot give information about the presence of non-gallstone related diseases, which ultrasonography is sometimes able to do. A limitation of the OCG is that it does not work well when there is more than a minimal amount of ""'jaundice''. Fortunately, most people with gallstones are not jaundiced.''As would be expected, ultrasonography sometimes finds gallstones that are missed by the OCG. Less frequently, the OCG finds gallstones that are missed by ultrasonography. For this reason, if gallstones are strongly suspected but ultrasonography does not show them, it is reasonable to consider doing an OCG. So OCGs are still done, and for good reason.' "
What are gallstones? How do they form?,"'Gallstones (often misspelled as gall stones) are stones that form in the gall (bile) within the gallbladder. (The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ just below the liver that stores bile secreted by the liver.) Gallstones reach a size of between a sixteenth of an inch and several inches.''From the bile duct, bile can flow from two different directions.''Once in the gallbladder, bile is concentrated by the removal (absorption) of water. During a meal, the muscle that makes up the wall of the gallbladder contracts and squeezes the concentrated bile in the gallbladder back through the cystic duct into the common bile duct and then into the intestine. (Concentrated bile is much more effective for digestion than the un-concentrated bile that goes from the liver straight into the intestine.) The timing of gallbladder contraction - during a meal - allows the concentrated bile from the gallbladder to mix with food.''Gallstones usually form in the gallbladder; however, they also may form anywhere there is bile - in the intrahepatic, hepatic, common bile, and cystic ducts.''Gallstones also may move about in the bile, for example, from the gallbladder into the cystic or the common duct.' Bile is a watery liquid made by the cells of the liver that is important for digesting food in the intestine, particularly fat, and eliminating toxic substances from the body. Liver cells secrete the bile into small canals within the liver referred to as canaliculi. The bile flows through the canaliculi and into larger collecting ducts within the liver referred to as intrahepatic bile ducts. The bile then flows through merged intrahepatic bile ducts out of the liver as extrahepatic (outside the liver) bile ducts, ( first into the two hepatic bile ducts, then into the single common hepatic duct, and finally, after the common hepatic duct is joined by the cystic duct coming from the gallbladder, into the common bile duct. The first direction is through the common bile duct and directly into the intestine where the bile mixes with food and promotes digestion of food. At the same time, toxic substances that are removed by the liver from the blood are eliminated into the intestine. The second direction is into an offshoot of the common bile duct, the cystic duct, and from there into the gallbladder."
What are the signs and symptoms of gallstones? Do they cause pain?,"'The majority of people with gallstones have no signs or symptoms and are unaware of their gallstones. (The gallstones are ""silent."") These gallstones often are found as a result of tests (for example, ''ultrasound'', or ''X-rays'' of the abdomen) performed while evaluating medical conditions other than gallstones. Symptoms can appear later in life, however, after many years without symptoms. Thus, over a period of five years, approximately 10% of people with silent gallstones will develop symptoms. Once symptoms develop, they are likely to continue and often will worsen.''When signs and symptoms of gallstones occur, they virtually always occur because the gallstones obstruct the bile ducts.''The most common symptom of gallstones is biliary colic.'' Biliary colic is a very specific type of pain, occurring as the primary or only symptom in 80% of people with gallstones who develop symptoms. Biliary colic occurs when the bile ducts (cystic, hepatic ducts or common bile duct) are suddenly blocked by a gallstone. Slowly progressing obstruction, as from a ''tumor'', does not cause biliary colic. Behind the obstruction, fluid accumulates and distends the ducts and gallbladder. In the case of hepatic duct or common bile duct obstruction, this is due to continued secretion of bile by the liver. In the case of cystic duct obstruction, the wall of the gallbladder secretes fluid into the gallbladder. The distention of the ducts or gallbladder causes biliary colic.''Characteristically, biliary colic comes on suddenly or builds rapidly to a peak over a few minutes.''Biliary colic is a recurring symptom. Once the first episode occurs, there are likely to be other episodes. Moreover, there is a pattern of recurrence for each individual, that is, in some individuals the episodes tend to remain frequent while in others they are infrequent. The majority of people who develop biliary colic do not go on to develop cholecystitis or other complications. There is a misconception that contraction of the gallbladder is what causes the obstruction of the ducts and biliary colic. Eating, even fatty foods, does not cause biliary colic; most episodes of biliary colic occur during the night, long after the gallbladder has emptied.''Gallstones are blamed for many symptoms they do not cause. Among the ''symptoms gallstones do not cause'' are:'   It is a constant pain; it does not come and go, though it may vary in intensity while it is present. IT is not cramp-like. It lasts for 15 minutes to 4-5 hours. If the pain lasts more than 4-5 hours, it means that a complication - usually cholecystitis - has developed. The pain usually is severe, but movement does not make the pain worse. In fact, patients experiencing biliary colic often walk about or writhe (twist the body in different positions) in bed trying to find a comfortable position. Biliary colic often is accompanied by nausea. Most commonly, biliary colic is felt in the middle of the upper abdomen just below the sternum. The second most common location for pain is the right upper abdomen just below the margin of the ribs. Occasionally, the pain also may be felt in the back at the lower tip of the scapula on the right side. On rare occasions, the pain may be felt beneath the sternum and is mistaken for angina or a heart attack. An episode of biliary colic subsides gradually once the gallstone shifts within the duct so that it is no longer causing obstruction. dyspepsia (including abdominal bloating and discomfort after eating), intolerance to fatty foods, belching, and flatulence (passing gas or farting)."
Can you still have gallstones symptoms after they have been removed?,"'Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) should eliminate all gallstone-related symptoms except in three situations:''The possibility of gallstones in the ducts can be pursued with MRCP, ''endoscopic ultrasound'', and ERCP. Rarely, gallstone-like symptoms can be caused by a condition called sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, discussed below.'""The common bile duct has a muscular wall. The last several centimeters of the common bile duct's muscle immediately before the duct joins the duodenum comprise the sphincter of Oddi. The sphincter of Oddi controls the flow of bile. Since the pancreatic duct usually joins the common bile duct shortly before it enters the duodenum, the sphincter also controls the flow of fluid from the pancreatic duct. When the muscle of the sphincter tightens, it shuts off the flow of bile and pancreatic fluid. When it relaxes, bile and pancreatic fluid again flow into the duodenum, for example, after a meal. The sphincter may become scarred, and the duct is narrowed by the scarring. (The cause of the scarring is unknown.) The sphincter also may go into spasm intermittently. In either case, the flow of bile and pancreatic fluid may intermittently stop abruptly, mimicking the effects of a gallstone causing biliary colic and pancreatitis.""'The diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction can be difficult to make. The best diagnostic test requires an endoscopic procedure with the same type of endoscope as ERCP. Instead of filling the ducts with dye, however, the pressure within the sphincter is measured. If the pressure is abnormally high, scarring or spasm of the sphincter are likely. The treatment for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is sphincterotomy (described previously). The measurement of liver and pancreatic enzymes in the blood also may be useful in diagnosing sphincter dysfunction.' gallstones were left in the ducts, there were problems with the bile ducts in addition to gallstones, and gallstones were not the cause of the symptoms."
What do gallstones look like?,"'Gallstones may number anywhere from one to hundreds, varying in size from a millimeter to four or five centimeters. When there are single or only a few gallstones they tend to be round. When larger numbers of gallstones are present, they tend to be faceted due to the rubbing of one gallstone against another. Brown pigment gallstones may be crumbly and irregular.''Gallstones may pass out of the gallbladder or ducts particularly if they are small. It is the passage of gallstones that leads to many of their complications.' "
What causes gallstones? Who gets them?,"'Gallstones are common; they occur in approximately 20% of women in the US, Canada and Europe, but there is a large variation in the prevalence among different ethnic groups. For example, gallstones occur 1 ½ to 2 times more commonly in Scandinavians and Mexican-Americans. Among American Indians, gallstone prevalence is more than 80%. These differences probably are accounted for by genetic (hereditary) factors. First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of individuals with gallstones are 1 ½ times more likely to have gallstones than if they do not have a first-degree relative with gallstones. Further support for a genetic predisposition comes from twin studies. Thus, among non-identical pairs of twins (who share 50% of their genes with one another), both individuals in a pair have gallstones 8% of the time. Among identical pairs of twins (who share 100% of their genes with one another), both individuals have gallstones 23% of the time.''Several conditions are associated with the formation of gallstones, and the way in which they cause gallstones can vary. (See risks of gallstones.)'  "
Cholesterol gallstones,"'There are several types of gallstones, and each type has a different cause.''Cholesterol gallstones are primarily made up of cholesterol. They are the most common type of gallstone, comprising 80% of gallstones in individuals in Europe and the Americas. Cholesterol is one of the substances (chemicals) that liver cells secrete into bile. Secretion of cholesterol into bile is an important mechanism by which the liver eliminates excess cholesterol from the body.''In order for bile to carry cholesterol, the cholesterol must be dissolved in the bile. Cholesterol is a fat, however, and bile is an aqueous or watery solution; ''fats'' do not dissolve in watery solutions. In order to make the cholesterol dissolve in bile, the liver also secretes two detergents, bile acids, and lecithin, into the bile. These detergents, just like dish washing detergents, dissolve the fatty cholesterol so that it can be carried by bile through the ducts. If the liver secretes too much cholesterol for the amount of bile acids and lecithin it secretes, some of the cholesterol does not stay dissolved. Similarly, if the liver does not secrete enough bile acids and lecithin, some of the cholesterol does not stay dissolved. In either case, the undissolved cholesterol sticks together and forms particles of cholesterol that grow in size and eventually become gallstones.''Two other processes that promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones though neither process is able to cause cholesterol gallstones to form. The first is an abnormally rapid formation and growth of cholesterol particles into gallstones. Thus, with the same concentrations of cholesterol, bile acids, and lecithin in the bile, patients with gallstones form particles of cholesterol more rapidly than individuals without gallstones. The second process that promotes the formation and growth of gallstones is reduced contraction and emptying of the gallbladder that allows bile to stay in the gallbladder longer than normally so that there is more time for cholesterol particles to form and grow into gallstones.' "
Pigment and antibiotic caused gallstones,"'Pigment gallstones are the second most common type of gallstone. Although pigment gallstones comprise only 15% of gallstones in individuals from Europe and the Americas, they are more common than cholesterol gallstones in Southeast Asia. There are two types of pigment gallstones 1) black pigment gallstones, and 2) brown pigment gallstones.''Pigment is a waste product formed from ''hemoglobin'', the oxygen-carrying chemical in ''red blood cells''. The hemoglobin from old red blood cells that are being destroyed is changed into a chemical called ''bilirubin'' and released into the blood. Bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver. The liver modifies the bilirubin and secretes the modified bilirubin into bile so that it can be eliminated from the body.''Black pigment gallstones:'' If there is too much bilirubin in bile, the bilirubin combines with other constituents in bile, for example, calcium, to form pigment (so-called because it is dark brown in color). Pigment dissolves poorly in bile and, like cholesterol, it sticks together and forms particles that grow in size and eventually become gallstones. The pigment gallstones that form in this manner are called black pigment gallstones because they are black and hard.''Brown pigment gallstones:'' If there is reduced contraction of the gallbladder or obstruction to the flow of bile through the ducts, bacteria may ascend from the duodenum into the bile ducts and gallbladder. The bacteria alter the bilirubin in the ducts and gallbladder, and the altered bilirubin then combines with calcium to form pigment. The pigment then combines with fats in bile (cholesterol and fatty acids from lecithin) to form particles that grow into gallstones. This type of gallstone is called a brown pigment gallstone because it is more brown than black. It also is softer than black pigment gallstones.''Other types of gallstones.'' Other types of gallstones are rare. Perhaps the most interesting type is the gallstone that forms in patients taking the antibiotic, ceftriaxone (Rocephin). Ceftriaxone is unusual in that it is eliminated from the body in bile in high concentrations. It combines with calcium in bile and becomes insoluble. Like cholesterol and pigment, the insoluble ceftriaxone and calcium form particles that grow into gallstones. Fortunately, most of these gallstones disappear once the antibiotic is discontinued; however, they still may cause problems until they disappear. Another rare type of gallstone is formed from ''calcium carbonate''.' "
Who is at risk of gallstones?,"'There is no relationship between cholesterol in the blood and cholesterol gallstones. Individuals with elevated blood cholesterol do not have an increased prevalence of cholesterol gallstones. A common misconception is that ''diet'"" is responsible for the development of cholesterol gallstones, however, it isn't. The risk factors for developing cholesterol gallstones include:""'Black pigment gallstones form whenever an increased load of bilirubin reaches the liver. This occurs when there is increased destruction of red blood cells, as in diseases such as ''sickle cell disease'' and ''thalassemia''. Black pigment gallstones also are more common in patients with ''cirrhosis'' of the liver. Brown pigment gallstones form when there is stasis of bile (decreased flow), for example, when there are narrowed or obstructed bile ducts.' Gender. Gallstones occur more commonly in women than men. Age. Gallstone prevalence increases with age. Obesity. Obese individuals are more likely to form gallstones than thin individuals. Pregnancy. Pregnancy increases the risk for cholesterol gallstones because during pregnancy, bile contains more cholesterol, and the gallbladder does not contract normally. This change in composition of bile during pregnancy is due to the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy. Gallstones that form during pregnancy may remain following the pregnancy or may dissolve once the composition of bile has returned to the nonpregnant state. Birth control pills and hormone therapy Increased levels of hormones caused by either treatment mimics pregnancy. Rapid weight loss. Rapid weight loss by whatever means, whether it is a very low calorie diet or obesity surgery, causes cholesterol gallstones in up to 50% of individuals. Many of the gallstones will disappear after the weight is lost, but many do not. Moreover, until they are gone, they may cause problems. Crohn's disease. Individuals with Crohn's disease of the ileum are more likely to develop gallstones. Gallstones form because patients with Crohn's disease lack enough bile acids to solubilize the cholesterol in bile. Normally, bile acids that enter the small intestine from the liver and gallbladder are absorbed back into the body and are secreted again by the liver into bile. In other words, the bile acids recycle. In Crohn's disease, the ileum is diseased. Bile acids are not absorbed normally, the body becomes depleted of bile acids, and less bile acids are secreted in bile. As a result, there are not enough detergent bile acids to keep cholesterol dissolved in bile, resulting in gallstone formation. Increased blood triglycerides. Gallstones occur more frequently in individuals with elevated blood triglyceride levels. The reason for this is unclear."
Diagnosis with transabdominal and ultrasonography ,"'Gallstones are diagnosed in one of two situations.''Ultrasonography is the most important means of diagnosing gallstones. Standard ''computerized tomography'' (CT or CAT scan) and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') may occasionally demonstrate gallstones; however, they are not as useful compared to ultrasonography because they miss gallstones.''Ultrasonography is a radiological technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of the organs and structures of the body. The sound waves are emitted from a device called a transducer and are sent through the body\'s tissues. The sound waves are reflected by the surfaces and interiors of internal organs and structures as ""echoes."" These echoes return to the transducer and are transmitted onto a viewing monitor. On the monitor, the outline of organs and structures can be determined as well as their consistency, for example, liquid or solid.''To types of ultrasonographic techniques can be used for diagnosing gallstones: transabdominal ultrasonography and endoscopic ultrasonography.''For transabdominal ultrasonography, the transducer is placed directly on the skin of the abdomen. The sound waves travel through the skin and then into the abdominal organs. Transabdominal ultrasonography is painless, inexpensive, and without risk to the patient. In addition to identifying 97% of gallstones in the gallbladder, abdominal ultrasonography can identify many other abnormalities related to gallstones. It can identify:'""Transabdominal ultrasonography also may identify diseases not related to gallstones that may be the cause of the patient's problem, for example, ""'appendicitis''. The limitations of transabdominal ultrasonography are that it can only identify gallstones larger than 4-5 millimeters in size, and it is poor at identifying gallstones in the bile ducts.' When there are symptoms or signs that suggest the presence of gallstones and the diagnosis of gallstones is being pursued. Coincidentally while a non-gallstone-related medical problem is being evaluated. A thickened wall of the gallbladder when there is cholecystitis and inflammation has thickened the wall Enlarged gallbladder and bile duct due to obstruction by gallstones Pancreatitis Fluid surrounding the gallbladder (a possible sign of inflammation) sludge"
"Diagnosis with EUS, MRCP","'For endoscopic ultrasonography, a long flexible tube - the endoscope - is swallowed by the patient after he or she has been sedated with intravenous medication. The tip of the endoscope is fitted with an ultrasound transducer. The transducer is advanced into the duodenum where ultrasonographic images are obtained.''Endoscopic ultrasonography can identify gallstones and the same abnormalities as transabdominal ultrasonography; however, since the transducer is much closer to the structures of interest - the gallbladder, bile ducts, and pancreas - better images are obtained than with transabdominal ultrasonography. Thus, it is possible to visualize smaller gallstones with EUS than transabdominal ultrasonography. EUS also is better in identifying gallstones in the common bile duct.''Although endoscopic ultrasonography is in many ways better than transabdominal ultrasonography, it is expensive, not available everywhere, and carries a small risk of complications such as those associated with the use of intravenous sedation, and intestinal perforation by the endoscope. Fortunately, transabdominal ultrasonography usually gives most of the information that is necessary, and endoscopic ultrasonography is needed only infrequently. Endoscopic ultrasonography also is a better way than transabdominal ultrasonography to evaluate the pancreas for pancreatitis or its complications.''Magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography or MRCP is a modification of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows the bile and pancreatic ducts to be examined.''The procedure is called cholangio- (referring to the bile ducts) pancreatography (referring to the pancreatic duct) because it can demonstrate the bile and pancreatic ducts.''MRCP has in many instances replaced other procedures such as cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for evaluating the bile ducts. It can identify gallstones in the bile ducts, obstruction of the ducts, and leaks of bile. There are no risks to the patient with MRCP except for very rare reactions to the injected dye.' For MRCP, the patient is placed in a strong magnetic field that through its energy-carrying radio waves aligns (magnetizes) the protons in the molecules of water in the tissues. (Protons are parts of the atoms that make up water molecules. All tissues in the body contain water though they contain different amounts of water.) Energy-carrying radio waves are passed through the tissues, and the energy is absorbed by the water's protons. The radio waves are turned off, and the protons release the energy they had absorbed. The released energy is used to form an image of the tissues and organs of the body. The MRI separates tissues and organs based on their concentration of water. Since different tissues contain different amounts of water, MRCP is very good at providing images of organs and tissues. Since bile is mostly water, MRCP gives an excellent image of bile within the gallbladder and bile ducts. The pancreatic duct, which, like the bile ducts, is filled with a watery fluid, also is seen well. Often an intravenous injection of a dye is used to better delineate the bile and pancreatic ducts."
Diagnosis with HIDA scan,"'Cholescintigraphy is a procedure done by nuclear medicine physicians. It also is referred to as a HIDA scan or a gallbladder scan.''HIDA scans are used to identify obstruction of the bile ducts, for example, by a gallstone. They also may identify bile leaks and fistulas. There are no risks to the patient with HIDA scans.'""Cholescintigraphy also is used to study the emptying of the gallbladder. Some patients with gallstones have had gallbladder inflammation due to recognized or unrecognized episodes of cholecystitis. (There also are uncommon, non-gallstone-related causes of inflammation of the gallbladder.) The inflammation can result in scarring of the gallbladder's wall and muscle, which reduces the ability of the gallbladder to contract. As a result, the gallbladder does not empty normally. During cholescintigraphy, a synthetic hormone related to cholecystokinin (the hormone the body produces and releases during a meal to cause the gallbladder to contract) can be injected intravenously to cause the gallbladder to contract and squeeze out its bile and radioactivity into the intestine. If the gallbladder does not empty the bile and radioactivity normally, it is assumed that the gallbladder is diseased due to gallstones or non-gallstone related inflammation.""'The problem with interpreting a gallbladder emptying study is that many people with normal gallbladders have abnormal emptying of the gallbladder. Therefore, it is hazardous to base a diagnosis of a diseased gallbladder on abnormal gallbladder emptying alone.' For a HIDA scan, a radioactive chemical is injected intravenously into a patient. The radioactive chemical is removed from the blood by the liver and secreted into the bile. The chemical then disperses everywhere that the bile goes-into the bile ducts, the gallbladder, the intestine, and any place else that bile goes. A camera that senses radioactivity (like a Geiger counter) is then placed over the patient's abdomen and a ""picture"" of the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder is obtained which corresponds to where the radioactive chemical has traveled within, or outside of the bile-filled bile ducts, and gallbladder."
Diagnosis with ERCP,"'ERCP is a combined endoscope and X-ray procedure performed to examine the duodenum (the first portion of the small intestine), the papilla of Vater (a small ''nipple''-like structure where the common bile and pancreatic ducts enter the duodenum), the gallbladder, and bile and pancreatic ducts.''The procedure is performed by using a long, flexible, side-viewing instrument (a duodenoscope, a type of endoscope) about the diameter of a fountain pen. The duodenoscope is flexible and can be directed and moved around the many bends of the stomach and intestine. The video-endoscope is the most common type of duodenoscope, and uses chip at the tip of the instrument to transmit video images to a TV screen.'""ERCP can identify; 1) gallstones in the gallbladder (though it is not particularly good at this) and 2) blockage of the bile ducts, for example, by gallstones, and 3) bile leaks. ERCP also may identify diseases not related to gallstones that may be the cause of the patient's problem, for example, pancreatitis or ""'pancreatic cancer''.''An important advantage of ERCP is that instruments can be passed through the same channel as the cannula used to inject the dye to extract gallstones stuck in the common and hepatic ducts. This can save the patient from having an operation. ERCP has several risks associated with it, including the drugs used for sedation, perforation of the duodenum by the duodenoscope, and pancreatitis (due to damage to the pancreas). If gallstones are extracted, bleeding also may occur as a complication.' First, the patient is sedated with intravenous drugs. The duodenoscope is inserted through the mouth, to the back of the throat, down the food pipe (esophagus), through the stomach and into the first portion of the small intestine (duodenum). Once the papilla of Vater is identified, a small plastic catheter (cannula) is passed through a channel in the duodenoscope into the papilla of Vater, and into the bile ducts and the pancreatic duct. Contrast material (dye) is injected, and x-rays are taken of the bile ducts, gallbladder, and/or the pancreatic duct."
"Liver and pancreatic blood tests, and duodenal biliary drainage","'When the liver or pancreas becomes inflamed or their ducts become obstructed and enlarged, the cells of the liver and pancreas release some of their enzymes into the blood. The most commonly measured ''liver enzymes'' in blood are aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The most commonly-measured pancreatic enzymes in blood are amylase and lipase. Many medical conditions that affect the liver or pancreas cause these blood tests to become abnormal, so these abnormalities alone cannot be used to diagnose gallstones. Nevertheless, abnormalities of these tests suggest there is a problem with the liver, bile ducts, or pancreas, and gallstones are a common cause of such abnormal tests, particularly during sudden obstruction of the bile ducts or pancreatic ducts. Thus, abnormal liver and pancreatic blood tests direct attention to the possibility that gallstones may be causing the acute problem.''Duodenal biliary drainage'' is a procedure that occasionally can be useful in diagnosing gallstones; however, it is not often used. As previously discussed, gallstones begin as microscopic particles of cholesterol or pigment that grow in size. It is clear that some people who develop biliary colic, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis have only these particles in their gallbladders, yet the particles are too small to obstruct the ducts. There are two potential explanations for how obstruction might occur in this situation. The first is that a small gallstone initially caused an obstruction before passing through the bile ducts into the intestine. The second is that particles passing through the bile ducts can ""irritate"" the ducts, causing spasm of the muscle within the walls of the ducts (which obstructs the flow of bile) or inflammation of the duct that causes the wall of the duct to swell (which also obstructs the duct).''The risks to the patient of duodenal drainage are minimal. (There have been no reports of reactions to the synthetic hormone.) Nevertheless, duodenal drainage is uncomfortable.''A modification of duodenal drainage involves collection of bile through an endoscope at the time of an upper gastrointestinal ''endoscopy''-either esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (''EGD'') or ERCP.''The oral cholecystogram or OCG is a radiologic (X-ray) procedure for diagnosing gallstones.''The OCG is an excellent procedure for diagnosing gallstones; it finds 95% of them. The OCG has been replaced, however, by ultrasonography because ultrasonography is slightly better at finding gallstones and can be done immediately without waiting one or two days for the iodine to be absorbed, excreted, and concentrated.''Unlike ultrasonography, the OCG also cannot give information about the presence of non-gallstone related diseases. As would be expected, ultrasonography sometimes finds gallstones that are missed by the OCG. Less frequently, the OCG finds gallstones that are missed by ultrasonography. For this reason, if there is a strong suspicion that gallstones are present but ultrasonography does not show them, it is reasonable to consider doing an OCG; however, EUS has mostly replaced the OCG in this situation. An OCG should not be done in individuals who are ''allergic'' to iodine.''The intravenous cholangiogram or IVC is a radiologic (X-ray) procedure that is used primarily for looking at the larger intrahepatic and the extrahepatic bile ducts. It can be used to locate gallstones within these ducts.''An iodine-containing dye is injected intravenously into the blood. The dye is removed from blood by the liver and excreted into bile. Unlike the iodine used in the OCG, the iodine in the IVC is concentrated sufficiently enough in the bile ducts to outline the ducts and any gallstones within them. The IVC is rarely used because it has been replaced by MRI cholangiography and endoscopic ultrasound. Moreover, occasional serious reactions to the iodine-containing dye can occur, which rarely may result in the death of the patient.' For duodenal drainage, a thin plastic or rubber tube with several holes at its tip is passed through a patient's anesthetized nostril, down the back of the throat, through the esophagus and stomach, and into the duodenum where the bile and pancreatic ducts enter the small intestine. This is done with the help of x-ray (fluoroscopy). Once the tube is in place, a synthetic hormone related to cholecystokinin, the hormone that is normally released after a meal to cause the gallbladder, is injected intravenously. As a result, the gallbladder contracts and squeezes out its concentrated bile into the duodenum. The bile is sucked through the tube in the duodenum and examined for the presence of small cholesterol and pigment particles under a microscope. The patient takes iodine-containing tablets for one or two nights in a row and then has an X-ray of the abdomen. The iodine is absorbed from the intestine into the blood, removed from the blood by the liver, and excreted into bile. In the gallbladder, the iodine becomes concentrated along with the bile. On the X-ray, the iodine, which is dense and stops X-rays, fills the gallbladder and outlines the gallstones that are not dense, and allow X-rays to pass through them. The ducts cannot be seen on the x-ray because the iodine is not concentrated in the ducts."
What problems make it difficult to diagnose gallstones?,"'Usually, it is not difficult to diagnose gallstones. Problems arise, however, because of the high prevalence of silent gallstones and the occasional gallstone that is difficult to diagnose.''If a patient has symptoms that are typical for gallstones, for example, biliary colic, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis, and has gallstones on ultrasonography, little else usually needs to be done to demonstrate that the gallstones are causing the symptoms unless the patient has other complicating medical issues.'""If symptoms are not typical for gallstones there is a possibility that the gallstones are innocent bystanders (silent), and most importantly, removing the gallbladder surgically will not resolve the patient's problem or prevent further symptoms. In addition, the real cause of the symptoms will not be pursued. In such a situation, there is a need to obtain further evidence, other than their mere presence, that the gallstones are causing the problem. Such evidence can be obtained during an acute episode or shortly thereafter.""'If ultrasonography can be done during an acute episode of pain or inflammation caused by gallstones, it may be possible to demonstrate an enlarged gallbladder or bile duct caused by obstruction of the ducts by the gallstone. This is likely to require ultrasonography again after the episode has resolved in order to demonstrate that the gallbladder indeed was larger during the episode than before or after the episode. It is easier to obtain the necessary ultrasonography if the episode lasts several hours, but it is much more difficult to obtain ultrasonography rapidly enough if the episode lasts only 15 minutes.''Another approach is to test the blood for abnormal liver and pancreatic enzymes. The advantage here is that the enzymes, though not always elevated, can be elevated during an acute attack and for several hours after an episode of gallstone-related pain or inflammation, so they may be abnormal even after the episode has subsided. It is important to remember, however, that the enzymes are not specific for gallstones, and it is necessary to exclude other liver and pancreatic causes for abnormal enzymes.''Sometimes, episodes of pain or inflammation may be more or less typical of gallstones, but transabdominal ultrasonography may not demonstrate either gallstones or another cause of the episodes. In this situation, it is necessary to decide whether suspicion is high or low for gallstones as a cause of the episodes. If suspicion is low because of lack of typical symptoms, it may be reasonable only to repeat the ultrasonography, possibly obtain an OCG, and/or test for abnormalities of liver or pancreatic enzymes. If suspicion is high because of more typical symptoms, it is reasonable to investigate even further with endoscopic ultrasonography, ERCP, and duodenal drainage. Prior to these ""invasive"" procedures, some physicians recommend MRCP.' "
What is the treatment for gallstones? Are there home remedies?,"'Most gallstones are silent, and do not need treatment.''Cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder surgically) is the standard treatment for gallstones in the gallbladder. Surgery may be done through a large abdominal incision, laparoscopically or robotically through small punctures in the abdominal wall. Laparoscopic surgery results in less pain and a faster recovery. Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has 3D visualization. Cholecystectomy has a low rate of complications, but serious complications such as damage to the bile ducts and leakage of bile occasionally occur. There also is risk associated with the general anesthesia that is necessary for either type of surgery. Problems following removal of the gallbladder are few. Digestion of food is not affected, and no change in diet is necessary. Nevertheless, chronic ''diarrhea'' occurs in approximately 10% of patients.''Sometimes a gallstone may be stuck in the hepatic or common bile ducts. In such situations, there usually are gallstones in the gallbladder as well, and cholecystectomy is necessary. It may be possible to remove the gallstone stuck in the duct at the time of surgery, but this may not always be possible. An alternative means for removing gallstones in the duct before or after cholecystectomy is with sphincterotomy followed by extraction of the gallstone.''Sphincterotomy involves cutting the muscle of the common bile duct (sphincter of Oddi) at the junction of the common bile duct and the duodenum in order to allow easier access to the common bile duct. The cutting is done with an electrosurgical instrument passed through the same type of endoscope that is used for ERCP. After the sphincter is cut, instruments may be passed through the endoscope and into the hepatic and common bile ducts to grab and pull out the gallstone or to crush the gallstone. It also is possible to pass a lithotripsy instrument that uses high frequency sound waves to break up the gallstone. Complications of sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones include risks associated with general anesthesia, perforation of the bile ducts or duodenum, bleeding, and pancreatitis.''It is possible to dissolve some cholesterol gallstones with medication taken orally. The medication is a naturally occurring bile acid called ursodeoxycholic acid or ''ursodiol'' (''Actigall'"", Urso). Bile acids are one of the detergents that the liver secretes into bile to dissolve cholesterol. Although one might expect therapy with ursodiol to work by increasing the amount of bile acids in bile and thereby cause the cholesterol in gallstones to dissolve, the mechanism of ursodiol's action actually is different. Ursodiol reduces the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile. The bile then has less cholesterol and becomes capable of dissolving the cholesterol in the gallstones.""'There are important limitations to the use of ursodiol:''Due to these limitations, ursodiol generally is used only in individuals with smaller gallstones that are likely to have a very ''high cholesterol'' content and who are at high risk for surgery because of ill health. It also is reasonable to use ursodiol in individuals whose gallstones were perhaps formed because of a transient event, for example, rapid loss of weight, since the gallstones would not be expected to recur following successful dissolution. Another use of ursodiol is to prevent the formation of gallstones in patients who will ''lose weight'' rapidly.''Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is an infrequently used method for treating gallstones, particularly those lodged in bile ducts. ESWL generators produce shock waves outside of the body that are then focused on the gallstone. The shock waves shatter the gallstone, and the resulting pieces of the gallstone either drain into the intestine on their own or are extracted endoscopically. Shock waves also can be used to break up gallstones via special catheters passed through an endoscope at the time of ERCP.''There are no natural or home remedies to treat gallstones.'   If silent gallstones are discovered in an individual at age 65 (or older), the chance of developing symptoms from the gallstones is only 20% (or less) assuming a life span of 75 years. In this instance, it is reasonable not to treat the individual. In younger individuals, no treatment also may be appropriate if the individuals have serious, life-threatening diseases, for example, serious heart disease, that are likely to shorten their life span. On the other hand, in healthy young individuals, treatment should be considered even for silent gallstones because the individuals' chances of developing symptoms from the gallstones over a lifetime will be higher. Once symptoms begin, treatment should be recommended since further symptoms are likely and more serious complications can be prevented. It is only effective for cholesterol gallstones and not pigment gallstones. It works only for small gallstones, less than 1-1.5 cm in diameter. It takes one to two years for the gallstones to dissolve, and many of the gallstones reform following cessation of treatment."
What are the complications of gallstones?,"'Biliary colic is the most common symptom of gallstones, but, fortunately, it is usually a self-limited symptom. There are, however, more serious complications of gallstones.''Cholecystitis means inflammation of the gallbladder. Like biliary colic, it too is caused by sudden obstruction of the ducts, usually the cystic duct by a gallstone. In fact, cholecystitis may begin with an episode of biliary colic. Obstruction of the cystic duct causes the wall of the gallbladder to begin secreting fluid, but for unclear reasons, inflammation sets in. At first the inflammation is sterile, that is, there is no infection with bacteria; however, over time the bile and gallbladder become infected with bacteria that travel through the bile ducts from the intestine.''With cholecystitis, there is constant pain in the right upper abdomen. Inflammation extends through the wall of the gallbladder, and the right upper abdomen becomes particularly tender when it is pressed or even tapped. Unlike with biliary colic, however, it is painful to move around. Individuals with cholecystitis usually lie still. There is ''fever'', and the white blood cell count is elevated, both signs of inflammation. Cholecystitis usually is treated with antibiotics, and most episodes will resolve over several days. Even without antibiotics, cholecystitis often resolves. As with biliary colic, movement of the gallstone out of the cystic duct and back into the gallbladder relieves the obstruction and allows the inflammation to resolve.''Cholangitis is a condition in which bile in the common, hepatic, and intrahepatic ducts becomes infected. Like cholecystitis, the infection spreads through the ducts from the intestine after the ducts become obstructed by a gallstone. Patients with cholangitis are very sick with high ''fever'' and elevated white blood cell counts. Cholangitis may result in an ''abscess'' within the liver or ''sepsis''. (See discussion of sepsis that follows.)''Gangrene of the gallbladder is a condition in which the inflammation of cholecystitis ''cuts'' off the supply of blood to the gallbladder. Without blood, the tissues forming the wall of the gallbladder die, and this makes the wall very weak. The ''weakness'' combined with infection often leads to rupture of the gallbladder. The infection then may spread throughout the abdomen, though often the rupture is confined to a small area around the gallbladder (a confined perforation).''Jaundice'' is a condition in which bilirubin accumulates in the body. Bilirubin is brownish-black in color but is yellow when it is not too concentrated. A build-up of bilirubin in the body turns the skin and whites of the eye (sclera) yellow. Jaundice occurs when there is prolonged obstruction of the bile ducts. The obstruction may be due to gallstones, but it also may be due to many other causes, for example, tumors of the bile ducts or surrounding tissues. (Other causes of jaundice are a rapid destruction of red blood cells that overwhelms the ability of the liver to remove bilirubin from the blood or a damaged liver that cannot remove bilirubin from the blood normally.) Jaundice, by itself, generally does not cause problems.''Pancreatitis means inflammation of the pancreas. The two most common causes of pancreatitis are ''alcoholism'' and gallstones. The pancreas surrounds the common bile duct as it enters the intestine. The pancreatic duct that drains the digestive juices from the pancreas joins the common bile duct just before it empties into the intestine. If a gallstone obstructs the common bile duct just after the pancreatic duct joins it, the flow of pancreatic juice from the pancreas is blocked. This results in inflammation within the pancreas. Pancreatitis due to gallstones usually is mild, but it may cause serious illness and even death. Fortunately, severe pancreatitis due to gallstones is rare.''Sepsis is a condition in which bacteria from any source within the body, including the gallbladder or bile ducts, enter into the blood stream and spread throughout the body. Although the bacteria usually remain within the blood, they also may spread to distant tissues and lead to the formation of abscesses (localized areas of infection with formation of pus). Sepsis is a feared complication of any infection. The signs of sepsis include high fever, high white blood cell count, and, less frequently, rigors (shaking ''chills'') or a drop in ''blood pressure''.''A fistula is an abnormal tract through which fluid can flow between two hollow organs or between an abscess and a hollow organ or skin. Gallstones cause fistulas when the hard gallstone erodes through the soft wall of the gallbladder or bile ducts. Most commonly, the gallstone erodes into the small intestine, stomach, or common bile duct. This can leave a tract that allows bile to flow from the gallbladder to the small intestine, stomach, or the common bile duct. If the fistula enters the distal part of the small intestine, the concentrated bile can lead to problems such as ''diarrhea''. Rarely, the gallstone erodes into the abdominal ''cavity''. The bile then leaks into the abdominal ''cavity'' and causes inflammation of the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum), a condition called bile ''peritonitis''.''Ileus is a condition in which there is an obstruction to the flow of food, gas, and liquid within the intestine. It may be due to a mechanical obstruction, for example, a tumor within the intestine, or a functional obstruction, for example, inflammation of the intestine or surrounding tissues that prevents the muscles of the intestine from working normally and propelling intestinal contents. If a large gallstone erodes through the wall of the gallbladder and into the stomach or small intestine, it will be propelled through the small intestine. The narrowest part of the small intestine is the ileo-cecal valve, which is located at the site where the small intestine joins the colon. If the gallstone is too large to pass through the valve, it can obstruct the small intestine and cause an ileus. Gallstones also may cause ileus if there are other abnormal narrowings in the intestine such as a tumor or scarring.''Cancer of the gallbladder'' usually is associated with gallstones, but it is not clear which comes first, that is, whether the gallstones precede the ''cancer'' and, therefore, could potentially be the cause of the ''cancer'' or the gallstones form because ''cancer'' is present. Cancer of the gallbladder arises in less than 1% of individuals with gallstones. Therefore, concern about future development of cancer is by itself not a good reason for removing the gallbladder when gallstones are present.'  "
What is biliary sludge? Is it related to gallstones?,"'Sludge is a common term that is applied to an abnormality of bile that is seen with ultrasonography of the gallbladder. Specifically, the bile within the gallbladder is seen to be of two different densities with the denser bile on the bottom. The bile is denser because it contains microscopic particles, usually cholesterol or pigment, embedded in ''mucus''. (The mucus is secreted by the gallbladder.) Over time, sludge may remain in the gallbladder, it may disappear and not return, or it may come and go. As discussed previously, these particles may be precursors of gallstones, and they occur often in some situations in which gallstones frequently appear, for example, rapid ''weight loss'', pregnancy, and prolonged fasting.''Nevertheless, it appears that sludge goes on to become gallstones in only a minority of individuals. Just to make matters more difficult, it is not clear how often - if at all - sludge alone causes problems. Sludge has been blamed for many of the same symptoms as gallstones-biliary colic, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis, but often these symptoms and complications are caused by very small gallstones that are missed by ultrasonography. Thus, there is some uncertainty about the importance of sludge.'""It is clear, however, that sludge is not the equivalent of gallstones. The practical implication of this uncertainty is that unless an individual's symptoms are typical of gallstones, sludge should not be considered as a possible cause of the symptoms."" "
Can gallstones be prevented?,"'Ideally, it would be better if gallstones could be prevented rather than treated. Prevention of cholesterol gallstones is feasible since ursodiol, the bile acid medication that dissolves some cholesterol gallstones, also prevents them from forming. The difficulty is to identify individuals who are at a high risk for developing cholesterol gallstones over a relatively short period of time so that the duration of preventive treatment can be limited. One such group is obese individuals losing weight rapidly with very low calorie diets or with surgery. The risk of gallstones in this group is as high as 40% to 60%. In fact, ursodiol has been shown in several studies to be very effective at preventing gallstones in these individuals. It is important to ''stress'' that no dietary changes have been shown to treat or prevent gallstones.' "
Which types of doctors treat gallstones?,"'Gallstones usually are diagnosed by a ''gastroenterologist'', a medical subspecialist who deals with diseases of the intestine, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. General surgeons also may be involved in the diagnosis of gallstones but usually are the doctors who treat gallstones because the common treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder.' "
What's new with gallstone causes and treatments?,"'It is clear that genetic factors are important in determining who develops gallstones. Current scientific studies are directed at uncovering the specific genes that are responsible for gallstones. To date, 8-10 genes have been identified as being associated with cholesterol gallstones, at least in animals that develop cholesterol gallstones. Not surprisingly, the products of many of these genes control the production and secretion (by the liver) of cholesterol, bile acids, and lecithin. The long-term goal is to be able to identify individuals who are genetically at very high risk for cholesterol gallstones and to offer them preventive treatment. An understanding of the exact mechanism(s) of gallstone formation also may result in new therapies for treatment and prevention.''Surgery for gallstones has undergone a major transition from requiring large abdominal incisions to requiring only tiny incisions for laparoscopic instruments (''laparoscopic cholecystectomy''). It is possible that there will be another transition. Surgeons are experimenting with a technique called natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). NOTES is a new technique for accomplishing standard intra-abdominal surgery, but access to the abdomen is through a natural orifice - the mouth, anus, or vagina.''For ''NOTES'"", a flexible endoscopic instrument is similar to the flexible endoscopes presently being used widely is introduced through the chosen orifice, through an incision somewhere inside the orifice (for example, the stomach), and into the abdominal cavity. Thus, the only incision is within the body and not visible on the body's surface. There are potential advantages to this type of surgery, but it is in the early stages of development, and it is unclear what the future role of NOTES will be in gallbladder surgery. Nevertheless, several series of patients have already been described who have had their gallbladders removed via NOTES primarily through the vagina."" "
What is a gambling addiction?,"'Gambling addiction is a mental-health problem that is understood to be one of many kinds of impulse-control problems and having many similarities to ''obsessive compulsive disorder''. However, it is now understood to be more similar to other addictive disorders. The types of gambling that people with this disorder might engage in are as variable as the games available. Betting on sports, buying lottery tickets, playing poker, slot machines, or roulette are only a few of the activities in which compulsive gamblers engage. The venue of choice for individuals with gambling addiction varies as well. While many prefer gambling in a casino, the rate of online/Internet gambling addiction continues to increase with increased use of the Internet. Alternatively, some compulsive gamblers may also engage in risky stock market investments. Gambling addiction is also called compulsive gambling or pathological gambling.''Estimates of the number of people who gamble socially and qualify for being diagnosed with a gambling addiction range from 2%-3%, thereby affecting millions of people in the United States alone. Other important statistics on problem gambling include that it tends to affect at least 1% of people internationally. ''Teens'' actually tend to suffer from this disorder at a rate that is twice that of adults.''Although more men than women are thought to suffer from pathological gambling, women are developing this disorder at higher rates, now making up as much as 25% of individuals with pathological gambling. Other facts about compulsive gambling are that men tend to develop this disorder during their early teenage years while women tend to develop it later. However, the disorder in women then tends to get worse at a much faster rate than in men. Other apparently gender-based differences in gambling addiction include the tendencies for men to become addicted to more interpersonal forms of gaming, like blackjack, craps, or poker, whereas women tend to engage in less interpersonally based betting, like slot machines or bingo. Men with pathological gambling tend to receive counseling about issues other than gambling less often than their female counterparts.''Problem gambling generally means gambling that involves more than one symptom but fewer than the at least five symptoms required to qualify for the diagnosis of compulsive or pathological gambling. Binge gambling is a subtype of compulsive gambling that involves problem gambling but only during discrete periods of time. That is different from a general gambling addiction, which tends to involve excessive gambling behavior on an ongoing basis and to include persistent thoughts (preoccupation) about gambling even during times when the person is not engaged in gambling.' "
What are causes and risk factors for gambling addiction?,"""When contemplating why people gamble, it is important to understand that there is usually no one specific cause for pathological gambling. Some potential exceptions include the observation that some individuals who are given medications that treat Parkinson's disease or ""'restless leg syndrome'' (including ''pramipexole'' [''Mirapex'']) have been observed to develop impulse-control disorders like compulsive gambling, shopping, or compulsive sexual behaviors. The theory about that connection involves the increased activity of the chemical messenger ''dopamine'' in the brain. Another example where compulsive gambling may have a single cause is in ''bipolar disorder'' since exorbitant spending, including compulsive gambling, may be a symptom of the ''mania'' that is part of ''bipolar disorder''.''Much more commonly, gambling addiction, like most other emotional conditions, is understood to be the result of a combination of biological vulnerabilities, ways of thinking, and social stressors (biopsychosocial model). There are, however, elements that increase the likelihood that the individual will develop a gambling addiction. Risk factors for developing pathological gambling include ''schizophrenia'', mood problems, antisocial personality disorder, and alcohol or cocaine addiction. Individuals who have a low level of serotonin in the brain are also thought to be at higher risk for developing pathological gambling compared to others.''People who suffer from compulsive gambling have a tendency to be novelty seekers, feel disconnected (dissociated), relaxed, or aroused while gambling or playing video games. Research also shows that individuals who have money problems, win a large amount of money early into gambling, suffer a recent loss (like divorce, job loss), or are lonely increases the risk of developing compulsive gambling. Easy access to gambling (for example, living near towns with many gambling resources, such as Las Vegas or Atlantic City), belief that they’ve discovered a system to winning at gambling and failing to keep track of money won and lost gambling are more risk factors for engaging in compulsive gambling.'  "
What are symptoms and signs of a gambling addiction?,"'Pathological gambling involves persistent and recurring problem gambling that includes several of the following symptoms that are not the result of another mental-health problem, like during a manic episode:'   A preoccupation with gambling, either by reliving past gambling, planning for future gambling experiences, and/or thinking of ways to secure money to finance gambling Needing more and more money for gambling in order to achieve the desired level of gambling enjoyment Repeated unsuccessful attempts to stop or reduce betting behaviors Becoming uneasy or easily irritated when trying to reduce or stop gambling Gambling for the purpose of escaping problems or to relieve depression or anxiety Returning to gambling after losing money in an effort to recoup losses Lying to family or other loved ones, mental-health professionals, or others in an effort to hide the extent of the gambling behavior Committing crimes (for example, stealing, fraud, or forgery) or securing illegal loans to finance gambling Risking important relationships, employment, or other opportunities due to gambling Depending on others for money to resolve dire financial situations that are the result of gambling"
How do health-care professionals diagnose a gambling addiction? What specialists diagnose and treat this illness?,"""The first step to obtaining appropriate treatment is accurate diagnosis, which requires a complete physical and psychological evaluation to determine whether the person may have a gambling addiction. Since some medical conditions can cause an individual to develop erratic, impulsive behaviors, including problem gambling, the examining physician should rule out (exclude) these possibilities through an interview, physical examination, and applicable laboratory tests, as well as implementing a full mental-health evaluation. A thorough diagnostic evaluation includes a complete history of the patient's symptoms, during which time the practitioner might ask the following questions:""'The doctor usually asks about alcohol and drug use and whether the patient has had thoughts about death or ''suicide''. Further, the history often includes questions about whether other family members have had a gambling problem or other mental-health problems, and if treated, what treatments they received and which were effective versus ineffective.'""A diagnostic evaluation also includes a mental-status examination to determine if the patient's speech, thought pattern, mood, or memory has been affected, as often happens in the case of a many forms of ""'mental illness''. As of today, there is no laboratory test, blood test, or X-ray that can diagnose this mental disorder.'  How old were you when you gambled for the first time? How much time (how often and for how long each time) do you spend gambling or thinking about gambling? How much money do you lose/spend gambling? What kinds of things do you do to finance gambling? Do you have irresistible urges to gamble?"
What is the treatment for gambling addiction?,"""Although there is no standardized treatment for pathological gambling, many people participate in Gamblers' Anonymous (GA) or learn how to stop engaging in gambling behaviors. The approximately 8% one-year abstinence rate that intervention tends to produce is often improved when GA is combined with psychotherapy that is administered by a trained professional. That seems to be particularly true when cognitive behavioral treatment is the psychotherapy approach that is used by the practitioner. Medications that have been found to be helpful in decreasing either the urge to gamble or the thrill involved in doing so include antiseizure medications like ""'carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'') and ''topiramate'' (''Topamax''), mood stabilizers like ''lithium'' (Eskalith, ''Lithobid''), medications used to address addictions like naltrexone (ReVia), and ''antidepressants'' like ''clomipramine'' (''Anafranil'') and ''fluvoxamine'' (''Luvox''). Psychotherapy appears to be more effective than any of the medications used to treat this disorder so far. Financial/debt counseling and self-help interventions may also be important aspects of the care provided to individuals with gambling addiction.''Individuals who engaged in illegal behavior in the year prior to treatment tend to have more severe symptoms of this disorder, have more gambling-related debt compared to people who have not engaged in illegal activity during that time period. It is therefore thought that people who engage in breaking laws in the year before treatment begins need more intensive treatment for a longer period of time, sometimes even requiring inpatient or residential treatment, often referred to as rehab. Another important fact to consider in treatment for a gambling addiction is that up to 70% of people with this disorder also have another psychiatric problem. Therefore, it is not enough to just treat the gambling problem but any coexisting mental-health condition (such as ''alcoholism'' or other ''substance abuse'"" problem, mood disorder, or personality disorder) should be addressed as well in order to give the person with a gambling addiction his or her best chance for recovery from both conditions. There is also a need for research about how a person's culture can play a role in the development and treatment of problem gambling.""'Some studies have explored the possibility that so-called home remedies may help treat gambling addiction. Some remedies being explored to address this disorder include glutamate, ''diet'', and aromatherapies.' "
What is the prognosis for gambling addiction?,"'With treatment, the prognosis of compulsive gambling can be quite encouraging. More than two-thirds of people with this disorder tend to abstain from problem gambling a year after receiving six weeks of treatment. After treatment has ended, less than one-fifth of those who receive follow-up for relapse prevention tend to relapse into gambling addiction behavior after one year compared to half of those who do not receive follow-up.' "
What are complications and negative effects of gambling addiction?,"'Although as many as one-third of individuals who suffer from pathological gambling may recover from the disease without receiving any treatment, the potential devastation that compulsive gambling can wreak on the life of the suffer and those around him or her clearly indicate that the potential positive aspects outweigh the possible complications that result from an intervention. As much as $5 billion is spent on gambling in the United States every year, with people who are addicted to gambling accruing tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Harmful effects that compulsive gambling can have on the individual include financial problems ranging from high debt, bankruptcy or poverty, to legal problems resulting from theft to prostitution, to wanting, attempting, or completing ''suicide''. Many compulsive gambling sufferers experience ''stress''-associated medical problems like ''insomnia'', stomach ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems, ''headaches'', and muscle aches. Gambling addiction can have a multitude of negative effects on the family. Statistics indicate that families of people with compulsive gambling are more likely to experience ''domestic violence'' and ''child abuse''. Children of problem gamblers are at significantly higher risk of suffering from ''depression'', behavior problems, and substance abuse. One of the challenges of treatment of compulsive gambling is that as many as two-thirds of people who begin treatment for this disorder discontinue treatment prematurely, whether treatment involves medication, therapy, or both.' "
Is it possible to prevent gambling addiction?,"'In addition to alleviating risk factors for compulsive gambling, educating the public about the warning signs for this disorder are key components to prevention. Some warning signs include often talking about gambling, bragging about gambling wins, poor performance and unexplained absences from work or school, ''mood swings'', stealing, or excessive borrowing.'

What is a ganglion?,"'A ''ganglion'' is a sac-like swelling or ''cyst'' formed from the tissue that lines a joint or tendon. The tissue, called synovium, normally functions to produce lubricating fluid for these areas. A ganglion is a ''cyst'' formed by the synovium that is filled with a thick jelly-like fluid. While ganglia can follow local ''trauma'' to the tendon or joint, they usually form for unknown reasons. Occasionally, ganglia are early signs of ''arthritis'' that will become more obvious in the future.'  "
What are ganglion causes and risk factors?,'Ganglions can be caused by inflammation of the tissue lining joints and tendons. This inflammation can be a result of local injury or underlying arthritis.' 
Where do ganglia form and what symptoms do they cause?,"'Ganglia can form around any joint, but they are most frequently found in the wrist and ankles. They are usually painless and often barely visible as localized swellings. They typically do not appear to be inflamed. The largest ganglions form behind the back of the knee, causing a sense of fullness or tightness. A ganglion here is referred to as a ''Baker cyst'', after the doctor who originally described the condition.' "
What specialists treat a ganglion?,"'Specialists who treat ganglions include primary-care providers such as general medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as ''rheumatologists'' and general and orthopedic surgeons.' "
How do doctors diagnose and assess a ganglion?,"'Doctors diagnose a ganglion by physical examination. These ganglions can usually be felt on examination. A ganglion can be a result of underlying arthritis of the adjacent joint, and X-ray analysis is often used to determine the integrity of joints affected.' "
What are treatment options and home remedies for ganglia?,"'A ganglion can spontaneously rupture and go away. Sometimes gentle ''massage'' is all that is necessary. Other treatment options include removal of the ganglion fluid with a needle and syringe (aspiration) with or without an injection of cortisone medication. Occasionally, the entire ganglion is resected with surgery. People with a persisting or recurring ganglion should be evaluated for signs of systemic forms of arthritis, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis''.'  "
What is the prognosis of a ganglion?,"'The prognosis of a ganglion is generally excellent. Usually, a ganglion does not affect joint function and is painless. They can resolve spontaneously, but can require injection or resection for complete recovery.' "
Is it possible to prevent a ganglion?,"'No, it is not possible to prevent a ganglion.' "
What is gangrene?,"'Gangrene is a term that describes dead or dying body tissue(s) that occurs because the local blood supply to the tissue is either lost or is inadequate to keep the tissue alive. Gangrene has been recognized as a localized area of tissue death since ancient times. The Greeks used the term ''gangraina'' to describe putrefaction (death) of tissue. Although many laypeople associate the term ''gangrene'' with a bacterial infection, the medical use of the term includes any cause that compromises the blood supply (for example, ''peripheral arterial disease'' or other blood vessel disease) and results in tissue death in the affected part of the body. Consequently, a person can be diagnosed with gangrene but does not have to be ""infected.""''There are two major types of gangrene, referred to as dry and wet. Many cases of dry gangrene are not infected. All cases of wet gangrene are considered to be infected, almost always by bacteria. The most common sites for both wet and dry gangrene to occur are the digits (fingers and toes) and other extremities (hands, arms, ''feet'', and legs).' 

Read Doctor's View
  "
What is the difference between wet and dry gangrene?,"'Wet gangrene (also termed moist gangrene) is the most dangerous type of gangrene because if it is left untreated, the patient usually develops ''sepsis'' and dies within a few hours or days. Wet gangrene results from an untreated (or inadequately treated) infection in the body where the local blood supply has been reduced or stopped by tissue swelling, ''gas'' production in tissue, bacterial toxins, or all of these factors in combination. Additionally, conditions that compromise the blood flow such as ''burns'' or vascular trauma (for example, a knife ''wound'' that ''cuts'' off arterial flow) can occur first. Then the locally compromised body part or area becomes infected, which can result in wet gangrene. Wet gangrene is the type that is most commonly thought of when the term gangrene is used. Wet gangrene often produces an oozing fluid or pus, hence the term ""wet."" Early stages of wet gangrene may include:''These stages may progress rapidly over hours to days.''Dry gangrene, if it does not become infected and progress to wet gangrene, usually does not cause ''sepsis'' or death. However, it can result in local tissue death with the tissue eventually being sloughed off. Usually, the progression of dry gangrene is much slower (days to months) than wet gangrene because the vascular compromise slowly develops due to the progression of diseases that can result in local arterial blockage over time.''The stages are similar to wet gangrene (see above), except there is no infection, pus, wetness, or crackly-feeling skin, because there is no gas production in the uninfected tissue. Disease-fighting cells are not recruited to the area.''There are many diseases that may lead to dry gangrene; the most common are:''Infrequently, dry gangrene can occur quickly, over a few hours to days, when a rapid arterial blockage occurs in part of the body (for example, an arterial ''blood clot'' suddenly occludes a small artery to a toe). Dry gangrene often produces cool, dry, and discolored appendages (sometimes termed ""mummified"") with no oozing fluid or pus, hence the term ""dry.""' Signs of infection Aching pain with swelling A reddish skin color or blanched appearance if the area is raised above level of the heart Coolness on the skin surface Ulceration A crackly sensation when the skin is pressed due to gas in the tissue Diabetes Arteriosclerosis Tobacco addiction (smoking)"
What causes gangrene?,"'The common cause of either wet or dry gangrene is loss of an effective local blood supply to any tissue. Loss of the blood supply means tissues are deprived of oxygen, thus causing the cells in the tissue to die. The most common causes of tissue blood supply loss and major risk factors for gangrene are:''Rarely, '""Raynaud's disease""' can lead to gangrene of fingers and toes.''Dry gangrene can result from any of a number of diseases or mechanisms that can reduce or block arterial blood flow. Although the most common diseases that can cause dry gangrene are ''diabetes'', arteriosclerosis, and tobacco addiction, there are many other lesser-known diseases that can lead to this problem. For example, some autoimmune diseases that attack blood vessels (''vasculitis'' syndromes) may result in enough damage to cause dry gangrene. In other cases, dry gangrene can result from various external mechanisms such as ''burns'', frostbite, and arterial trauma caused by accidents, wounds, or surgery.''Wet gangrene can result from all the causes listed above for dry gangrene but always includes infection. In some cases of wet gangrene, the initial cause is considered to be the infection. Although many types of organisms (mainly bacteria) are known to participate in wet gangrene infections, the classic bacterial organism or bacterial infection associated with wet gangrene is ''Clostridium perfringens'', an anaerobic bacterium that grows best when oxygen is not present. These bacteria can cause myonecrosis (muscle ''fiber'' death) with\xa0exotoxins and produce gas bubbles in the dead and dying tissues (gas gangrene). This leads to localized swelling with compression and loss of blood flow to tissue, allowing bacteria to extend the infection to the connective tissue of muscle, skin, and other areas, causing ''necrotizing fasciitis'' (death of connective tissue). ''Necrotizing fasciitis'', in turn, allows the infection to spread, frequently with speed, out of the locally infected site to adjacent areas or to the bloodstream (sepsis). Although this cascade of events is seen with ''Clostridium perfringens'' often as the single infecting organism type, it can be caused by many other organisms such as ''Streptococcus'', ''Staphylococcus'', ''Bacteroides'', and ''Escherichia''. Usually two or more of these organisms occur in the infection, and many investigators suggest that together the organisms help each other (synergy) to extend the infection.''There are several subtypes of wet gangrene:''Leprosy'"" (Hansen's disease) is not a variant of wet or dry gangrene, although it can result in local tissue loss that can resemble gangrene. It is a disease caused by bacteria that are transferred usually from person to person. It causes nodules and sores. ""'M. leprae'' infection slowly destroys peripheral nerve endings in digits and mucous membranes over a period of years with loss of sensation. Digits and other local areas get repeatedly injured due to sensation loss and can become mutilated or develop atrophy and be sloughed off. However, if the chronic lesions become infected with other organisms, wet gangrene can develop in patients with leprosy.' Infections Trauma Poor wound healing Diseases like diabetes mellitus that can affect blood vessels (usually arteries)  Gas gangrene means gas is present in the gangrenous tissue as described above. Fournier's gangrene is gangrene with necrotizing fasciitis that occurs mainly in male genitalia. Internal gangrene is a general term that means gangrene is affecting an internal organ. Internal gangrene types are usually named after the organ that is affected (for example, gangrene of the appendix, gangrenous gallbladder, and gangrenous bowel involving the colon, rectum, or other areas)."
What are gangrene symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms of gangrene vary according to the type of gangrene (wet or dry), the anatomic location (external versus internal sites), and which organ system(s) are affected.'""Dry gangrene often begins with the affected area first becoming numb and cool. Discomfort levels vary with the patient's perception. The local area (for example, toe or finger) then starts to discolor, usually turning from reddish to brown and eventually black. During this time, the local area shrinks, becomes dry (mummified), and may slough off the body. Dry gangrene caused by immediate loss of arterial blood supply can first turn pale or bluish and then progress as above.""'Wet gangrene, in contrast to dry gangrene, usually begins with swelling and a very painful affected area that may be initially red and show signs of decay (sloughing tissue, pus, local oozing of fluid). Often the fluid and the affected area develop a very bad smell, due to the presence of such foul-smelling compounds as cadaverine and putrescine, which are produced as the infectious agent(s) destroy tissue. This dead and dying tissue develops a moist and black appearance. Additional symptoms that are often seen in patients with wet gangrene are ''fever'' and other signs of sepsis such as light-headedness due to ''low blood pressure''.''Internal gangrene, a variant of wet gangrene, has less obvious initial symptoms because the wet gangrene occurs in the internal organs. The patient may be very ill (septic) with gangrene but show few if any visual symptoms that are characteristic for wet gangrene. Occasionally, the skin overlying an organ with wet gangrene may become reddish or discolored, and the area may become swollen and painful. When the surgeon exposes the infected organ, the signs of wet gangrene are apparent. The symptoms vary somewhat according to the organ system infected; for example, patients with gangrene of the bowel due to an incarcerated ''hernia'' can have severe ''pain'' at the site of the hernia while a gangrenous gallbladder can result in severe pain located in the upper right side of the abdomen.'

How do health care professionals diagnose gangrene?,"'A person should suspect gangrene if any local body area changes color (especially if it is red, blue, or black) and becomes numb or painful. If the symptoms include those stated above for either dry or wet gangrene, the individual should immediately seek medical help.''The diagnosis is usually based on the clinical symptoms of either wet or dry gangrene. Often other tests are done in cases of wet gangrene to further define the infecting agent(s), the type of gangrene, and the extent of the infection. For example, ''X-rays'', CT, or ''MRI'' studies are done to see how far gas or necrosis (or both) has progressed from the local site. These studies are often done to help determine the extent of gangrene in both limb and internal types of gangrene. Blood cultures as well as cultures of the infected tissue and exudates are usually done to determine the infective agent(s) and to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy.''For dry gangrene, vascular surgeons often do ''angiography'' (a radiologic study with dye that shows arterial blood flow in tissues, also termed ''arteriogram'') to see the extent of ongoing or potential arterial blood loss to tissue.' "
What is the treatment for gangrene?,"'Treatment of gangrene depends upon the type of gangrene (dry vs. wet), the subtype of wet gangrene, and how much tissue is compromised by the gangrene. Immediate treatment is needed in all cases of wet gangrene and in some cases of dry gangrene. Treatment for all cases of gangrene usually involves:''Dry gangrene is usually treated with surgery that removes the dead tissue(s), such as a toe. How much tissue is removed may depend on how much arterial blood flow is still reaching other tissue(s). Often, the patient is treated with antibiotics to prevent infection of remaining viable tissue. The patient may also receive ''anticoagulants'' to reduce blood clotting. Supportive care can consist of surgical ''wound care'' and rehabilitation for reuse of the digits or limb. Some patients simply slough off the dry gangrenous tissue (termed autoamputation). This happens most often when medical and surgical caregivers are not readily available to the patient in remote areas or in some third-world countries. Many patients, if they do not get infected, can recover from autoamputation.''Wet gangrene is a medical emergency and needs immediate treatment. Treatment is usually done in a hospital, and a surgeon needs to be involved because the local area needs debridement (surgical removal of the dead and dying tissue). In some patients, debridement will not be adequate therapy, and amputation of a limb may be needed. At the same time as surgical treatment, intravenous antibiotics need to be administered (usually a combination of two or more broad-spectrum antibiotics, one of which is effective in killing anaerobic bacteria like ''Clostridium perfringens'' and another antibiotic effective against methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' or ''MRSA''). Consultation with an infectious disease specialist and a surgeon is recommended.''Internal gangrene requires an operation in the hospital to remove the gangrenous tissue. Some patients develop sepsis and require the support of an intensive care unit in which supportive care for other life-threatening problems such as ''hypotension'' (''low blood pressure'') can be treated. Rehabilitation therapy for patients with amputation is highly recommended.''Some clinicians treat gangrene, especially wet gangrene, with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (oxygen therapy given under pressure with the patient inside a chamber). Since some studies indicate that hyperbaric oxygen treatment improves tissue oxygen supply and can inhibit or kill anaerobic bacteria, this therapy is used to treat patients with gangrene. However, it is not available in many hospitals and is used in conjunction with the above described therapeutic methods, not as a primary therapy for wet gangrene.'

Is it possible to prevent gangrene?,"'If tissue obtains good oxygenation by adequate arterial blood flow and does not become infected, then both dry and wet gangrene can be prevented. Consequently, avoiding tobacco use and avoiding external trauma like frostbite can help prevent gangrene. Perhaps the best way to prevent gangrene, especially in developed countries, is to keep patients with diabetes under good glucose control and to have them do frequent examinations of their feet for any signs of cuts, infection, or redness. Patients with ''diabetic neuropathy'' (for example, numbness in extremity) should do this daily.''If any wound or ''burn'' occurs, it should be treated immediately to prevent infection. This is especially important in people with diabetes, ''vasculitis'', or a compromised immune system.''Some patients who notice coolness and redness of a local area (for example, toes, fingers) and get an ''angiogram'' that shows arterial blockage can have successful ''prevention'' of dry gangrene (and possibly wet gangrene). However, this needs to occur quickly so the vascular surgeon can remove the clot or obstruction in the artery before local tissue dies.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for a patient with gangrene?,"'Patients with dry gangrene usually do well as long as they do not become infected. These patients lose some local function due to tissue loss and, if they have an ongoing disease like diabetes, may develop dry gangrene again. In general, patients recover with minimal residual problems if the tissue loss is small.''Patients with wet gangrene usually have a poorer prognosis than those with dry gangrene. Statistics for the U.S. suggest that the mortality (death) rate is low in patients hospitalized with gangrene. The mortality (death rate) increases if the patient becomes septic. If treatment is initiated early, some patients need some form of amputation (digits, limbs). Although the death rate has remained steady, the number of cases of gangrene has been increasing in the United States in recent years, possibly due to the increasing numbers of patients with diabetes and other diseases that affect the vascular system, but these data are not complete.' "
What is the HPV vaccine?,"'The ''vaccine'', ''Gardasil'', is the first vaccine developed to prevent ''cervical cancer'', ''precancerous'' genital lesions, and ''genital warts'' due to ''HPV''.' "
Who should get the HPV vaccine?,'CDC recommends the ''HPV vaccine'' for all 11 and 12 year old girls. The recommendation allows for vaccination to begin at age nine. Vaccination also is recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the full series of shots. ' 
Are there other HPV vaccines in development?,"'Another ''HPV'' vaccine (being developed by GlaxoSmithKline) is in the final stages of clinical testing, but it is not yet licensed. This vaccine would protect against the two types of HPV that cause most cervical ''cancers'', but does not protect against ''genital warts''.' "
How and when is the vaccine delivered?,'The vaccine is given in a series of three injections over a six-month period. The second and third doses should be given at two and six months (respectively) after the first dose. HPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other ''vaccines''. ' 
Is the HPV vaccine effective?,'This vaccine is highly effective in preventing four types of HPV in young women who have not been previously exposed to HPV. This vaccine targets HPV types that cause up to 70% of all cervical cancers and about 90% of genital ''warts''. The vaccine will not treat existing HPV infections or their complications. ' 
Is the HPV vaccine safe?,"'The FDA has licensed the vaccine as safe and effective. This vaccine has been tested in thousands of females (9 to 26 years of age) around the world. These studies have shown no serious side effects. The most common side effect is brief soreness at the injection site. CDC, working with the FDA, will continue to monitor the safety of the vaccine after it is in general use. ' "
Does the vaccine contain thimerosal or mercury?,"'No, there is no thimerosal or mercury in the vaccine.' "
How long does vaccine protection last?,"'Will a booster shot be needed? The length of vaccine protection (immunity) is usually not known when a vaccine is first introduced. So far, studies have found that vaccinated persons are protected for five years. More research is being done to find out how long protection will last, and if a booster dose of vaccine will be needed. ' "
"Will girls and women be protected against HPV and related diseases, even if they don't get all three doses?","'It is not yet known how much protection girls/women would get from receiving only one or two doses of the vaccine. For this reason, it is very important that girls/women get all three doses of the vaccine. ' "
"If a woman turns 27 years of age after the first dose of HPV was administered but before the next doses are administered, should the series be completed?","'Yes, the series should be completed using the recommended intervals between doses, even if this means that the series is completed after a woman turns 27 years of age. ' "
Does the vaccine protect against cervical cancer?,"'Yes, HPV vaccine is the first vaccine developed to prevent ''cervical cancer''. This new vaccine is highly effective in preventing HPV infection, the major cause of cervical ''cancer'' in women. The vaccine protects against four types of HPV, including two that cause about 70% of cervical ''cancer''. ' "
How common is cervical cancer?,"'The American ''Cancer'' Society estimates that in 2014, over 12,000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer and approximately 4,020 women will die from this disease. ' "
Will the girls/women who have been vaccinated still need cervical cancer screening?,"'Yes, they will still need to see their healthcare provider for cervical ''cancer screening'"". There are three reasons why women will still need regular cervical cancer screening. First, the vaccine will NOT provide protection against all types of HPV that cause cervical cancer, so women will still be at risk for some cancers. Second, some women may not get all required doses of the vaccine (or they may not get them at the right times), so they may not get the vaccine's full benefits. Third, women may also not get the vaccine's full benefits if they have already acquired a vaccine HPV type. "" "
Why is the vaccine only recommended for females ages 9 through 26?,"'The vaccine has been extensively tested in 9 through 26 year-old females so information is only available about vaccine safety and protection for girls/women of this age group. However, studies on the vaccine are now being done in boys/men, as well as in women older than 26 years of age. The FDA will consider licensing the vaccine for these other groups when there is research to show that it is safe and effective in these groups. ' "
Why is HPV vaccine recommended for girls 11 to 12 years of age?,"'It is important for girls to get HPV vaccine before they become sexually active. The vaccine is most effective for girls/women who get vaccinated before their first sexual contact. It does not work as well for those who were exposed to the virus before getting the vaccine. It is now recommended for boys in the same age group, but has not been apprived for feemales over 26. ' "
Should pregnant women be vaccinated?,"'The vaccine is not recommended for ''pregnant'' women. There has only been limited information about vaccine safety among pregnant women and their unborn ''babies''. So far, studies suggest that the vaccine has not caused health problems during ''pregnancy'', nor has it caused health problems for the child. But more research is still needed. For now, pregnant women should wait to complete their pregnancy before getting the vaccine. If a women finds out she is pregnant after she has started getting the vaccine series, she should wait until after her pregnancy is completed to finish the three-dose series. ' "
What about vaccinating males?,'The CDC has now approved Gardasil for boys and recommends they receive it in the same age group as girls. ' 
Will my child be required to get the vaccine before she enters school?,"'There are no federal laws requiring the immunization of children. All school and daycare entry laws are state laws and vary from state to state. Therefore, you should check with your state health department or Board of Education to find out what ''vaccines'' your child will need to enter school or daycare. ''Each year the CDC publishes childhood and adolescent immunization schedules that provide recommended timelines for immunization of children and adolescents. The annual childhood and adolescent immunization schedules are a joint effort of the CDC, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). While these organizations have no regulatory authority over the immunization of children, the recommendations of the CDC, AAP, and AAFP are considered standards of medical practice and most physicians follow the recommendations. ' "
How much will the HPV vaccine cost?,"'As of January 2014, the retail price of the vaccine is $125 per dose ($375 for the full series). ' "
Will the vaccine be covered by insurance plans?,"'Most insurance plans and managed care plans cover recommended ''vaccines''. However, there may be a lag-time after a vaccine is recommended, before it is available and covered by health plans. While some insurance companies may cover the vaccine, others may not. ' "
How can I get the vaccine if I don't have insurance?,"'The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program helps families of children who may not otherwise have access to vaccines by providing free vaccines to doctors who serve them. The VFC program provides free vaccines to children and adolescents younger than 19 years of age, who are either Medicaid-eligible, American Indian, or Alaska Native or uninsured. There are over 45,000 sites that provide VFC vaccines, including hospital, private, and public clinics. The VFC Program also allows children and adolescents to get VFC vaccines through Federally Qualified Health Centers or Rural Health Centers, if their private health insurance does not cover ''vaccinations''. For more information about the VFC, visit www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/''Some states also provide free or low-cost vaccines at public health department clinics to people without health insurance coverage for vaccines. ' "
What is familial adenomatous polyposis?,"'Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an ''inherited'' disorder characterized by ''cancer'' of the ''large intestine'' (colon) and rectum. People with the classic type of familial adenomatous polyposis may begin to develop multiple noncancerous (benign) growths (polyps) in the colon as early as theirteenage years. Unless the colon is removed, these polyps will become ''malignant'' (cancerous). The average age at which an individual develops ''colon cancer'' in classic familial adenomatous polyposis is 39 years. Some people have a variant of the disorder, called attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, in whichpolyp growth is delayed. The average age of ''colorectal cancer'' onset for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis is 55 years.''In people with classic familial adenomatous polyposis, the number of polyps increases with age, and hundreds to thousands of polyps can develop in the colon. Also of particular significance are noncancerous growths called desmoid tumors. These fibrous tumors usually occur in the tissue covering the ''intestines'' and may be provoked by surgery to remove the colon. Desmoid tumors tend to recur after they are surgically removed. In both classic familial adenomatous polyposis and its attenuated variant, benign and malignant tumors are sometimes found in other places in the body, including the duodenum (a section of the  small intestine), stomach, bones, skin, and other tissues. People who have ''colon polyps'' as well as growths outside the colon are sometimes described as having Gardner syndrome.''A milder type of familial adenomatous polyposis, called autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis, has also been identified. People with the autosomal recessive type of this disorder have fewer polyps than those with the classic type. Fewer than 100 polyps typically develop, rather than hundreds or thousands. The autosomal recessive type of this disorder is caused by mutations in a different gene than the classic and attenuated types of familial adenomatous polyposis.'  "
How common is familial adenomatous polyposis?,"'The reported incidence of familial adenomatous polyposis varies from 1 in 7,000 to 1 in 22,000 individuals.'  "
"What genes are related to familial adenomatous 
polyposis?","'Mutations in the APC gene cause both classic and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis. These mutations affect the ability of the cell to maintain normal growth and function. Cell overgrowth resulting from mutations in the APC gene leads to the colon polyps seen in familial adenomatous polyposis. Although most people with mutations in the APC gene will develop ''colorectal''''cancer'', the number of polyps and the time frame in which they become malignant depend on the location of the mutation in the gene.'""Mutations in the MUTYH gene cause autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis (also called MYH-associated polyposis). Mutations in this gene prevent cells from correcting mistakes that are made when DNA is copied (DNA  replication) in preparation for cell division. As these mistakes build up in a person's DNA, the likelihood of cell overgrowth increases, leading to colon polyps and the possibility of colon ""'cancer''.' "
"How do people inherit familial adenomatous 
polyposis?","'Familial adenomatous polyposis can have different inheritance patterns.''When familial adenomatous polyposis results from mutations in the APC gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.''When familial adenomatous polyposis results from mutations in the MUTYH gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.' "

Why is identification of streptococcal infection important?,"'Patients benefit both immediately and potentially in the long-term by rapid confirmation of ''streptococcal'' cause of their sore throat. Antibiotic treatment provides a quicker reduction of symptoms, shortens the duration of illness and quickly, and efficiently eliminates the possibility of spread of infection to others. ' Although rare, serious consequences of
	streptococcal infections do 
occur. Rheumatic fever is associated with
	heart, 
	joint and nervous 
system damage and is preventable by rapid treatment of strep disease.  Serious kidney disease that may result in 
	kidney failure may also be a consequence of 
	streptococcal infection.  A throat infection due to strep needs antibiotic 
therapy initiated as 
rapidly as possible. The rapid strep test facilitates this goal."
Why is the rapid test better?,"'By comparison with culture methods, a rapid strep test is much quicker and can produce results within minutes.' "
What is the traditional test for strep throat?,'The traditional test for a strep throat has been a throat culture. The major drawback of a throat culture is that the results take two to three days due to the time necessary to allow enough GAS bacteria to grow to enable accurate identification.' 
What is a rapid strep test?,"""The rapid strep test is a quick and accurate diagnostic tool used to determine whether or not strep bacteria are present in the patient's throat. The same test may be used to evaluate for the presence of ""'Streptococci'' in other infected areas (for example, perianal infection in either gender, or vulvar infection in pre-pubertal girls).'  "
How is a rapid strep test done?,"'Obtaining a specimen is the same whether your doctor will do a throat culture or rapid test for strep. A cotton swab (similar to a Q-tip) is quickly rubbed over both ''tonsils'' as well as the back wall of the mouth (the posterior pharynx). It is important to avoid contact with other structures inside the mouth such as the tongue or cheeks. The swab is then placed in a specialized container and the rapid test performed. Many people find that obtaining the swab produces a gagging sensation. However, since the entire swabbing process lasts less than five seconds this inconvenience is minimal.' "
What are the limitations of the rapid strep test?,"'There are several manufactures of rapid strep tests. Each manufacturer has designed their test to respond only to the presence of the particular ''streptococcal'' bacteria (Group A) responsible for strep throat. Other bacteria which are less much less likely to cause sore throats are not identified by the rapid strep test. ' The test will not 
detect viral causes of sore throat.  A positive test response occurs when a 
reaction occurs between a protein on the surface of strep bacteria and chemicals in the 
test materials. Either living or dead strep bacteria will produce a 
positive reaction.  Most rapid strep tests have a
	sensitivity of 95%, meaning that 
the test will be positive in 95 of 100 patients who are documented to have strep 
throat via throat culture obtained at the same time. Since 5 of 100 patients 
with strep throat will be missed using a rapid strep test, all negative swab 
specimens should be sent for culture to confirm the absence of strep bacteria. 
	 A 
positive culture requires antibiotics.  The rapid strep test has a 98%
	specificity. This 
means that 98 of 100 positive tests correctly indicate the 
presence specifically of Group A streptococcus bacteria; 2 of 100 positive 
results are ""false positives"" - indicative of similarities between various surface
	proteins found on strep bacteria and other non-strep bacteria found in the 
mouth."
Lap band (gastric banding) introduction,"'Obesity'' is a growing concern. By medical standards, ''obesity'' is defined as having a ''body mass index'' (''BMI'') of over 30 kg/m2. While lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone for treatment, surgical options are becoming more popular. One of the surgical treatments for obesity is called gastric banding, commonly known as lap-band surgery. Some of the specifics of gastric banding will be addressed in this article.' "
What is gastric banding?,"'Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of an adjustable belt around the upper portion of the stomach using a laparascope. The band is made of silicone and can be tightened by adding saline to fill the band (like blowing air into a doughnut-shaped balloon). The band is connected to a port that is placed under the skin of the abdomen. This port is used to introduce or remove saline into the band.''LAGB ultimately restricts the size of the stomach and the amount of food it can hold. It also slows the passage of food to the intestine. By doing so, signals to the brain from the gut allow for a sensation of fullness and satiety with the consumption of less food. This signal is sent from a small pouch created by the band in the upper stomach. When the pouch fills, the same signal is sent to the brain that occurred previously when the entire stomach filled.' "
What is a lap band?,"'The LAP BAND® is a specific device brand name and is made by Allergan Inc. The term is often used in the lay community interchangeable with gastric banding (similar to the way we interchange the brand name Kleenex for facial tissue). There are different sizes and models of the LAP BAND. There are also other companies that make gastric banding devices such as the REALIZE® adjustable gastric band (by Ethicon), the MIDBAND®, and the Heliogast® gastric band (which are not available in the US).' "
Who are candidates for the lap band system?,"'Generally, candidates for LAGB have a body mass index over 40 kg/m2, or are more than 45 kilograms over their ideal body weight. LAGB can be performed on a person with a ''BMI'' of 35-40 kg/m2 if there are problematic medical conditions that are weight-related, such as ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'') or ''diabetes''.''Most surgeons and programs will want to note a history of failed ''weight loss'' in the past using more conventional approaches. The procedure is indicated for adults only, and is not to be performed on those less than 18 years old. All patients must demonstrate an understanding of the procedure, and be willing to adhere to the lifestyle changes that are needed to make this procedure successful. Most large centers have a psychological assessment to assure that this last criteria is met.''LAGB is usually contraindicated if the potential patient has difficulty understanding the procedure, is emotionally unstable, or is dependent on ''drugs'' or ''alcohol''. Those potential cases with a history of gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers need to be reviewed carefully. Similarly, those that have underlying medical conditions that make them high risk for surgery- such as ''heart'' or lung conditions- may be refused the procedure. Associated with these risks is a BMI of greater than 50kg/m2. In this group, there may be a request to ''lose weight'' prior to the procedure (although this seems paradoxical). Again, the risks of the procedure in this subgroup of ''obese'' patients may outweigh the benefits of surgery. By dropping the BMI under 50 kg.m2, outcomes may be better.''While there is growing discussion about offering LAGB to those with a BMI of 30-35 who have ''diabetes'', there are no current guidelines for this.' "
How is the lap band (LAGB) procedure performed?,"'Lap band or LAGB is a surgical procedure done under full general anesthesia and takes about 1 to 2 hours to perform. It is done using a laparoscopic technique. This involves making 3 to 5 small incisions, each about 1 inch in length. The surgeon inserts a small camera attached to a tube into one of these incisions and views the procedure on a screen. The other incisions allow for the use of surgical instruments and placement of the band. The gastric band is placed around the upper part of the stomach and set into position with ''sutures''. The port is then placed in the wall of the abdomen and sutured in place.' "
How do I prepare for lap band surgery?,"'Depending on the surgeon or the program, the preparation for surgery will vary. Many centers like to see a commitment from the patient to the necessary lifestyle changes even before surgery. It may be suggested that the patient start eating 5 to 6 small meals a day to prepare for the changes ahead. It may be recommended to wean off ""slippery"" high calorie foods such as ice cream or milk shakes (since these will continue to be easily absorbed after the procedure).''If the BMI is greater than 50, or if there are other medical issues, medical risk reduction may be needed preoperatively and should be discussed in detail. In addition, a ''weight loss'' of 5% to 10% prior to surgery has been shown to improved post operative outcomes, and may be a goal that your surgeon or preoperative care team will discuss with you.' "
How long is the recovery after lap band surgery?,"'Recovery varies with each individual. However, in general, LAGB offers a shorter hospitalization and quicker recovery than gastric bypass procedures. In general, most people can return to work 1 week after surgery (if their job is not too physically demanding). Normal activity can usually resume after 6 weeks.' "
What is a lap band fill?,"'A lap band ""fill"" is the common term for gastric band adjustments. Once surgery is performed, there is a period of healing that must take place before the first adjustment. Usually, the first fill takes place around 6 to 8 weeks. It involves injecting saline into the port just under the skin which is connected to the band. Prior to this, there may be little change in appetite. Fills are painless and are usually performed by the surgeon who performed the procedure. These adjustments may take place to enhance ''weight loss'', especially if there is a plateau phase in ''weight loss'', and they may to performed to overcome side effects such as ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' (in this latter case, the band is loosened).' "
What can I expect my lifestyle to be after lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'Immediately after surgery, there will be some ''pain'' and discomfort that can be controlled with medications. This is part of the normal recovery phase after any surgical procedure. After 6 to 8 weeks, one can generally return to normal activities. ''Weight loss'' with LAGB is a gradual process. Initially, the ''weight loss'' may be more dramatic- say 2 to 3 pounds per week. However, this generally slows to a pound or so weekly over the long-term. Naturally, the food choices made will govern this weight loss rate. After about 18 months, the weight loss tends to slow significantly. The average weight loss for this procedure is 40% of excess body weight in the first year, with an additional 10% to 20% in the second year. Patients are usually asked to keep in contact with their surgeon regularly during this time period as further band adjustments may be needed. ' "
What are the side effects of lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'Side effects include ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ulceration at the band site, ''esophageal reflux'' (''indigestion''), weight regain, and ''dehydration''. Since this type of surgery is restrictive and does not cause malabsorption of nutrients, vitamin deficiencies are not usually seen. However, many centers recommend multivitamin supplementation. ''Constipation'' is commonly encountered.' "
What are the risks and complications of lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'LAGB has a low risk of surgical complications compared to other weight reduction procedures. The mortality (death) rate is about 1 in 2000. There is the possibility of the band slipping or eroding into the stomach and of mechanical malfunction. Other complications may include infection, bleeding, and/or ''abdominal pain''. ' "
What type of surgeon performs lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'When choosing a surgeon, it is important to search for one who is a qualified bariatric surgeon. In general, practice makes perfect, and the more surgeries performed the better. A surgeon performing 100 or more procedures annually is likely going to have better outcomes. A surgeon who is part of a clinical team of nutritionists, nurses, psychologists, and physicians in general can provide better counseling and support in the pre- and postoperative period. ' "
Introduction,'Gastric bypass surgery combines the creation of a small stomach pouch to restrict food intake and construction of bypasses of the duodenum and other segments of the small intestine to cause malabsorption (decreased ability to absorb calories and nutrients from food).' 
Types of Gastric Bypass Surgery,"'Gastric bypass surgery that causes malabsorption and restricts food intake produces more ''weight loss'' than restriction operations like ''gastric banding'', which only decrease food intake. People who have bypass surgery generally lose two-thirds of their excess weight within two years.' Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RGB): This operation is the most common gastric bypass surgery performed in the U.S. First, a small stomach pouch is created by stapling part of the stomach together or by vertical banding. This limits how much food you can eat. Next, a Y-shaped section of the small intestine is attached to the pouch to allow food to bypass the duodenum as well as the first portion of the jejunum. This causes reduced calorie and nutrient absorption. This procedure can now be done with a laparoscope (a thin telescope-like instrument for viewing inside the abdomen) in some people. This involves using small incisions and generally has a more rapid recovery time.
 Extensive gastric bypass (biliopancreatic diversion): In this more complicated gastric bypass operation, the lower portion of the stomach is removed. The small pouch that remains is connected directly to the final segment of the small intestine, thus completely bypassing both the duodenum and jejunum. Although this procedure successfully promotes weight loss, it is not as widely used because of the high risk for nutritional deficiencies."
Risks of Gastric Bypass Surgery,"'People who undergo gastric bypass surgery are at risk for: ''Gastric bypass surgery also may cause ""dumping syndrome,"" whereby stomach contents move too rapidly through the small intestine. Symptoms include ''nausea'',  ''weakness'', ''sweating'', faintness, and, occasionally, ''diarrhea'' after eating, as well as the inability to eat sweets without becoming extremely weak. ''Gallstones'' can occur in response to rapid ''weight loss''. They can be dissolved with medication taken after the surgery. ' Pouch stretching (stomach gets bigger overtime, stretching back to its 
	original size). Band erosion (the band closing off part of the stomach disintegrates). Breakdown of staple lines (band and staples fall apart, reversing the 
	procedure). Leakage of stomach contents into the abdomen (this is dangerous because 
	the acid can eat away other organs).  Nutritional deficiencies causing health problems."
Complications From Nutritional Deficiencies,"'The limited absorption of ''vitamin B-12'' and iron can cause ''anemia''. The lack of calcium absorption can cause ''osteoporosis'' and metabolic bone disease. People who undergo this procedure are required to take nutritional ''supplements'' that usually prevent these deficiencies. ''The more extensive the gastric bypass surgery, the greater the risk for complications and nutritional deficiencies. People who undergo extensive bypasses of the normal digestive process require not only close monitoring, but also lifelong use of special foods and medications. ''WebMD Medical Reference' "
"Gastric cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the 
lining of the stomach.","'The stomach is a J-shaped organ in the upper abdomen. It is part of the digestive system, which processes nutrients (''vitamins'', minerals, carbohydrates, ''fats'', proteins, and water) in foods that are eaten and helps pass waste material out of the body. Food moves from the throat to the stomach through a hollow, muscular tube called the ''esophagus''. After leaving the stomach, partly-digested food passes into the small intestine and then into the ''large intestine''.''The wall of the stomach is made up of 3 layers of tissue: the mucosal (innermost) layer, the muscularis (middle) layer, and the serosal (outermost) layer. Gastric cancer begins in the cells lining the mucosal layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.''Stromal tumors of the stomach begin in supporting connective tissue and are treated differently from gastric cancer.' "
"Age, diet, and stomach disease can affect the risk of developing gastric cancer.","""Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for gastric cancer include the following:"" Having any of the following medical conditions:Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection of the stomach.Chronic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach).Pernicious anemia.Intestinal metaplasia (a condition in which the normal stomach lining is replaced with the cells that line the intestines).Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or gastric polyps. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection of the stomach. Chronic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach). Pernicious anemia. Intestinal metaplasia (a condition in which the normal stomach lining is replaced with the cells that line the intestines). Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or gastric polyps. Eating a diet high in salted, smoked foods and low in fruits and vegetables. Eating foods that have not been prepared or stored properly. Being older or male. Smoking cigarettes. Having a mother, father, sister, or brother who has had stomach cancer."
Symptoms of gastric cancer include indigestion and stomach discomfort or pain.,"'These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by gastric cancer or by other conditions.''In the early stages of gastric cancer, the following symptoms may occur:''In more advanced stages of gastric cancer, the following signs and symptoms may occur:''Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.'   Indigestion and stomach discomfort. A bloated feeling after eating. Mild nausea. Loss of appetite. Heartburn. Blood in the stool. Vomiting. Weight loss for no known reason. Stomach pain. Jaundice (yellowing of eyes and skin). Ascites (build-up of fluid in the abdomen). Trouble swallowing."
Tests that examine the stomach and esophagus are used to detect (find) and diagnose gastric cancer.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:''The sample of tissue may be checked to measure how many HER2 genes there are and how much HER2 protein is being made. If there are more HER2 genes or higher levels of HER2 protein than normal, the cancer is called HER2 positive. HER2-positive gastric cancer may be treated with a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 protein.' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. Upper endoscopy: A procedure to look inside the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine) to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth and down the throat into the esophagus. Barium swallow: A series of x-rays of the esophagus and stomach. The patient drinks a liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound). The liquid coats the esophagus and stomach, and x-rays are taken. This procedure is also called an upper GI series. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. A biopsy of the stomach is usually done during the endoscopy."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:''When gastric cancer is found very early, there is a better chance of recovery. Gastric cancer is often in an advanced stage when it is diagnosed. At later stages, gastric cancer can be treated but rarely can be cured. Taking part in one of the clinical trials being done to improve treatment should be considered.' The stage of the cancer (whether it is in the stomach only or has spread to lymph nodes or other places in the body). The patient's general health."
"After gastric cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to 
find out if cancer cells have spread within the stomach or to other parts of the 
body.","'The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the stomach or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.''The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:'   CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) assay: Tests that measure the level of CEA in the blood. This substance is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. When found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of gastric cancer or other conditions. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or rectum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT."
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
"Cancer may 
spread from where it began to other parts of the body.","'When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if gastric cancer spreads to the ''liver'', the cancer cells in the liver are actually gastric cancer cells. The disease is metastatic gastric cancer, not ''liver cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
The following stages are used for gastric cancer:,"'In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the inside lining of the mucosa (innermost layer) of the stomach wall. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called ''carcinoma in situ''.''In stage I, cancer has formed in the inside lining of the mucosa (innermost layer) of the stomach wall. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB, depending on where the cancer has spread.''Stage II gastric cancer is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB, depending on where the cancer has spread.''Stage III gastric cancer is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC, depending on where the cancer has spread.''In stage IV, cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.' Stage IA: Cancer may have spread into the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall. Stage IB: Cancer:may have spread into the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall and is found in 1 or 2 lymph nodes near the tumor; orhas spread to the muscle layer of the stomach wall. may have spread into the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall and is found in 1 or 2 lymph nodes near the tumor; or has spread to the muscle layer of the stomach wall. Stage IIA: Cancer:has spread to the subserosa (layer of tissue next to the serosa) of the stomach wall; orhas spread to the muscle layer of the stomach wall and is found in 1 or 2 lymph nodes near the tumor; ormay have spread to the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall and is found in 3 to 6 lymph nodes near the tumor. has spread to the subserosa (layer of tissue next to the serosa) of the stomach wall; or has spread to the muscle layer of the stomach wall and is found in 1 or 2 lymph nodes near the tumor; or may have spread to the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa) of the stomach wall and is found in 3 to 6 lymph nodes near the tumor.

Recurrent Gastric Cancer,'Recurrent gastric cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the stomach or in other parts of the body such as the liver or lymph nodes.' 
There are different types of treatment for patients with gastric cancer.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with gastric cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Five types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery is a common treatment of all stages of gastric cancer. The following types of surgery may be used:''If the tumor is blocking the stomach but the cancer cannot be completely removed by standard surgery, the following procedures may be used:''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat gastric cancer.''Chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both. Chemoradiation given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Chemoradiation given before surgery, to shrink the tumor (neoadjuvant therapy), is being studied.''Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used in the treatment of gastric cancer.''Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. For stage IV gastric cancer and gastric cancer that has recurred, monoclonal antibodies, such as ''trastuzumab'' or ramucirumab, may be given. Trastuzumab blocks the effect of the growth factor protein HER2, which sends growth signals to gastric cancer cells. Ramucirumab blocks the effect of the protein VEGF and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.'   Subtotal gastrectomy: Removal of the part of the stomach that contains cancer, nearby lymph nodes, and parts of other tissues and organs near the tumor. The spleen may be removed. The spleen is an organ in the upper abdomen that filters the blood and removes old blood cells. Total gastrectomy: Removal of the entire stomach, nearby lymph nodes, and parts of the esophagus, small intestine, and other tissues near the tumor. The spleen may be removed. The esophagus is connected to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat and swallow. Endoluminal stent placement: A procedure to insert a stent (a thin, expandable tube) in order to keep a passage (such as arteries or the esophagus) open. For tumors blocking the passage into or out of the stomach, surgery may be done to place a stent from the esophagus to the stomach or from the stomach to the small intestine to allow the patient to eat normally. Endoluminal laser therapy: A procedure in which an endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) with a laser attached is inserted into the body. A laser is an intense beam of light that can be used as a knife. Gastrojejunostomy: Surgery to remove the part of the stomach with cancer that is blocking the opening into the small intestine. The stomach is connected to the jejunum (a part of the small intestine) to allow food and medicine to pass from the stomach into the small intestine. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.' "
"Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their 
cancer treatment.",'Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' 
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "
Treatment Options by Stage,"'Treatment of stage 0 is usually surgery (total or subtotal gastrectomy).''Treatment of stage I gastric cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage II gastric cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage III gastric cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage IV or recurrent gastric cancer may include the following:'   Surgery (total or subtotal gastrectomy).

Surgery as palliative therapy to stop bleeding or shrink a tumor that is blocking the stomach. A clinical trial of new combinations of chemotherapy as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life."
What is a gastric emptying study?,"'The most common type of gastric emptying study is a procedure that is done by nuclear medicine physicians using radioactive chemicals that measures the speed with which food empties from the stomach and enters the small intestine. Gastric emptying studies are used for evaluating patients who are having symptoms that may be due to slow and, less commonly, rapid emptying of the stomach.  The symptoms of slow emptying are primarily ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''abdominal pain'', and abdominal fullness after eating.  The symptoms of rapid emptying are ''diarrhea'', ''weakness'', or light-headedness after eating.' "
How is a gastric emptying study done?,"""For a gastric emptying study, a patient eats a meal in which the solid component of the meal (for example, scrambled eggs or oatmeal for vegetarians), the liquid component of the meal (for example, water), or both, are mixed with a small amount of radioactive material. A scanner (acting like a Geiger counter) is placed over the patient's stomach to monitor the amount of radioactivity in the stomach for several hours after the test meal is eaten. As the radioactively-labeled food empties from the stomach, the amount of radioactivity in the stomach decreases. The rate at which the radioactivity leaves the stomach reflects the rate at which food is emptying from the stomach""'Some medications such as narcotic ''pain'' relievers and anticholinergic medications can cause a delay in emptying of the stomach, while other medications such as ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan'') and ''erythromycin'' can cause rapid emptying of the stomach. Medications that slow emptying of the stomach can give a falsely abnormal test result, while medications that speed up emptying of the stomach can give a falsely normal result. Therefore, medications that affect emptying of the stomach should be withheld for 72 hours before performing emptying studies.''Abnormally high blood glucose (''sugar'') levels also can slow emptying of the stomach. Therefore, it is important to control blood glucose levels to near normal levels before performing emptying studies in people with ''diabetes'' who are prone to develop high blood glucose levels.' "
When is a gastric emptying study used?,"'A gastric emptying study often is used when there is a suspicion that there is an abnormally delayed emptying of food from the stomach, medically called delayed gastric emptying. Delayed gastric emptying most commonly gives rise to abdominal discomfort after meals, ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. The two most common causes of delayed gastric emptying are gastric outlet obstruction and ''gastroparesis''. ''Gastric outlet obstruction refers to a condition in which the narrow channel leading from the stomach into the small intestine through which food passes (called the pylorus) is physically blocked, and, as a result food enters the first part of the small intestine (called the duodenum) slowly or not at all. The most common causes of gastric outlet obstruction are scarring or inflammation of the pylorus from peptic ulcers, ''cancers'' of the stomach, or, occasionally, cancers near the pylorus, for example, of the pancreas or duodenum. A diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction is made by tests such as''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'' (''EGD''), abdominal ''computerized tomography'' (''CT scan''), and ''upper GI series''. ''Once gastric outlet obstruction has been excluded by appropriate testing as the cause of delayed gastric emptying, physicians then may perform a gastric emptying study to diagnose ''gastroparesis'"". Gastroparesis is a condition in which there is delayed gastric emptying, but the delay is not due to obstruction. Rather, it is due to abnormal function of the muscles of the stomach. Normal function of the stomach's muscles is necessary in order to propel food from the stomach and into the small intestine. If the muscles or the nerves that control the muscles are not working normally, food remains in the stomach. Gastroparesis is commonly caused by diseases and medications. The most common cause of gastroparesis is ""'diabetes mellitus'"", which affects the function of the stomach's nerves and muscles. Many cases of gastroparesis have no clear cause for the dysfunction. These cases are referred to as idiopathic gastroparesis.""'A gastric emptying study also may be used when there is a suspicion that there is abnormally rapid gastric emptying. Rapid gastric emptying can cause ''diarrhea'' and episodes of weakness or light-headedness following meals (referred to as the ""dumping"" syndrome). Common causes of rapid gastric emptying include surgery of the stomach and ''diabetes'' mellitus. ' "
How are the results of a gastric emptying study evaluated?,"'In patients with gastroparesis, the food and the attached radioactive material remain in the stomach longer than normal (usually hours) before emptying into the small intestine. As a result, the scanner continues to show radioactivity in the area of the stomach for hours after the test meal. If abnormally slow emptying is demonstrated, medications such as metoclopramide (Reglan) may be given to speed up the emptying and improve symptoms. If abnormally rapid emptying of the stomach is found, medications may be given to slow down emptying. ' "
Are there any side effects of a gastric emptying study?,"'There are no side effects from a gastric emptying study. The radioactive material is not absorbed into the body and is eliminated in the ''stool''. Nevertheless, gastric emptying studies as well as any other studies that utilize radioactive materials should not be performed in ''pregnant'' women because the fetus is exposed to some radioactivity. ' "
Are there other tests that can be performed instead of a gastric emptying study?,"'An upper gastrointestinal (GI) series X-ray demonstrates abnormal emptying of barium in patients with a severe emptying problem, however, it cannot diagnose abnormal emptying of a mild or moderate degree. An ''antro-duodenal motility study'' or an ''electrogastrogram'' can demonstrate abnormalities in the muscles and nerves of the stomach, but they do not directly evaluate the effects of these abnormalities on emptying of the stomach. Other experimental methods for evaluating emptying of the stomach have been described, for example, ''ultrasonography'', breath tests using fatty acids, and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) but these tests are available in very few centers.'

What should you know about gastritis?,"'Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining. There are two types of gastritis, acute and chronic.''Some people with gastritis may not have any symptoms; however, both acute and chronic gastritis may have symptoms and signs of ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and occasionally, ''belching'', ''bloating'', ''loss of appetite'' and ''indigestion''.''A bacterium called ''Helicobacter pylori'' or ''H. pylori'', and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'"") are the two main causes of gastritis; however, there are many other causes of the condition, for example, infectious agents, autoimmune problems, diseases like Crohn's disease, ""'sarcoidosis'', and isolated granulomatosis gastritis.''Gastritis can be diagnosed by the your symptoms and history (for example, ''NSAID'' and/or ''alcohol'' consumption), or by breath, blood, ''stool'', immunological, and biopsy tests to detect H. pylori, and other tests like ''endoscopy'' or radiologic studies demonstrate mucosal changes.''The treatment for gastritis varies according to the cause. Other less common causes may be treated similarly, but do not treat the underlying cause.''Gastritis symptoms'' can be aggravated by chemical irritants that cause or aggravate the ''symptoms of gastritis'' should be reduced or stopped all together. For example, stop ''smoking'' cigarettes, avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, avoid ''caffeinated'', decaffeinated, and carbonated ''drinks''; and fruit juices that contain citric acid, for example, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, etc., and avoid high-fat foods.''There is no gastritis ''diet'', however, the growth of H. pylori may be stopped by a ''diet'' rich in ''fiber'', and foods that contain flavonoids, for example, certain teas, onions, ''garlic'', berries, celery, kale, broccoli, parsley, thyme, foods with ''soy'', and legumes, for example, lentils, kidney, black, soy, pinto, and navy beans.''Home remedies may help reduce gastritis symptoms, but usually does not treat the underlying cause of the condition.''People with acute gastritis usually recover completely with no complications. However, chronic gastritis may have a range of outcomes from good (early treatment) to poor if serious complications develop. Rarely, complications can occur from acute gastritis.''Complications from chronic gastritis include ''peptic ulcer'', bleeding ulcers, ''anemia'', gastric ''cancers'', MALT ''lymphoma'', renal problems, strictures, bowel obstruction, or even death.''If underlying causes of gastritis (for example, alcohol, or NSAIDs usage) are treated or not used, gastritis also may be prevented.''Gastritis may be cured if the underlying cause(s) is cured.''Since gastritis is infections and can you can avoid it by practicing good hand washing techniques, for example, wash the hands thoroughly and frequently. To reduce the risk of gastritis avoid situations where you are exposed to chemicals, ''radiation'', or toxins.'  "
What is gastritis?,"'Gastritis is inflammation of the lining of the stomach. Unfortunately, the term ""gastritis"" has been misused to include many different upper abdominal problems, but true gastritis refers to the stomach lining (gastric mucosa) that is inflamed. All or part of the gastric mucosa may be involved. Gastritis may be classified as acute or chronic. ''Acute gastritis'' maybe characterized as erosive (damaged areas where mucosal cells are disrupted or missing) and nonerosive. ''Chronic gastritis'' is determined by histopathology (appearance of the gastric mucosa) with symptoms lasting a long time. There is no widely accepted classification system although some have been proposed.''This information will focus on true gastritis. Gastritis has many causes, but most causes result in similar symptoms. This has leads to some ''confusion'' and is the reason why many health-care professionals now consider the term ""gastritis"" as a non-specific description of a cluster of symptoms.' "
How long does gastritis last?,"'Acute gastritis lasts for about 2-10 days. If chronic gastritis is not treated, it may last from weeks to years.' "
What are the symptoms of gastritis?,"'Many people with gastritis do not have symptoms. The condition is diagnosed only when samples of the stomach mucosa are examined for other suspected diseases. However, when gastritis symptoms occur, the most common symptoms include ''abdominal pain'' (intermittent or constant burning, gripping or gnawing ''pain''), ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', loss of appetite, bloating, burping, and belching.''Gastritis symptoms come and go over time, especially with chronic gastritis. ''Indigestion'' (''dyspepsia'') is another term that encompasses this cluster of symptoms. Symptoms of severe gastritis may include, ''vomiting blood'', ''blood in the stool'', and ''anemia'  "
Can you drink alcohol and eat any foods with gastritis?,"'Foods and other substances that should be avoided to reduce or prevent gastritis symptoms include, alcohol, spicy, fatty, and fried foods. Moreover, anything that might be toxic or irritating to the stomach should also be avoided (for example ''cigarette smoking'', acidic drinks like coffee, garlic powder, chili powder, peppers and tomato products).' "
What foods relieve gastritis symptoms? ,"'The University of Maryland health-care professionals and others suggest that eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding foods that are spicy, acidic, fried or fatty will help reduce symptoms. Moreover, ''stress'' reduction is also recommended. Dietary changes such as ''ginger'' tea and/or chamomile tea with honey reportedly soothes gastritis symptoms while onions, garlic, cranberries, apples, and celery may stop H. pylori growth.''Foods that may stop ''H. pylori'' growth and relieve gastritis symptoms include:''Although these home remedies may help reduce or soothe symptoms, home remedies seldom treat the underlying causes of gastritis.' Teas (green and white in particular) Yogurt Peppermint Wheat bran Carrot juice Coconut water Green leafy vegetables Onions Garlic Apples Fresh fruits and berries Celery Cranberry juice Kale Broccoli Scallions Parsley Thyme Soybeans Soy foods Legumes (beans, peas, and lentils)"
What causes gastritis?,"'A major cause of both acute and chronic gastritis is infection of the stomach mucosa by a bacterial species named '' ''Helicobacter pylori'"". Usually, this bacterium first infects the stomach antrum (stomach mucosa without acid-producing cells) acutely and may progress to infect most or all of the stomach's mucosa over time (chronic gastritis) and remain there for years. This infection generates an initial strong inflammatory response and eventually, a long-term chronic inflammation with intestinal cell changes may develop. Another major cause of acute and chronic gastritis is the use (and overuse) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).""'However, there are many other causes of gastritis; the following is a list of common causes of both acute and chronic gastritis; chronic gastritis may occur with repeated or continual presence of most of these causes:''In general, infectious agents, especially ''Helicobacter pylori'', and NSAIDs are responsible for the majority of people with gastritis.'   Bacterial, viral and parasitic infections Certain drugs (cocaine) Alcoholic disease (drinking excessive amounts of alcohol) Bile reflux Fungal infections Allergic reactions Autoimmune reactions Stress reaction Radiation Certain food poisonings (infectious and chemical) Trauma"
How do you know if you have gastritis?,"""Gastritis is diagnosed based on the patient's symptoms and history of a previous diagnosis and treatment of gastritis, alcohol consumption, and use of NSAIDs. Definitive diagnosis of gastritis is made by identifying the underlying cause of the gastric mucosal inflammation and/or by tissue (gastric) biopsy. For example, the major infective cause of gastritis is""' Helicobacter pylori'' ''(H. pylori)''. This bacterium can be detected by breath, blood, ''stool'', immunological and biopsy tests. Although the bacterium can be cultured from the patient, this is seldom attempted. Other pathogens can be identified using culture, stool, and immunological tests.''Biopsy of the stomach mucosa, done during endoscopy examinations, is often used in patients to identify the causes of chronic gastritis and may allow visualization of mucosal erosions and other stomach mucosal changes. Abdominal ''X-rays'' or barium studies (upper or lower) may demonstrate the presence of thickened mucosa and folds that are signs of inflammation in the stomach.''Your doctor can help determine which tests should be done, including ancillary tests that may help identify other causes of the non-specific symptoms commonly found with gastritis.'  "
What OTC and prescription medications treat gastritis?,"'Treating the underlying cause of gastritis is the most effective way to reduce or resolve gastritis symptoms. For example, if the cause of gastritis is ''H. pylori'', then treatment with appropriate antibiotics (usually a combination of ''amoxicillin'' and ''clarithromycin'' [''Biaxin'', Biaxin XL] plus bismuth subsalicylate [''Pepto-Bismol'']) should be effective to provide relief from symptoms.''If NSAIDs are the cause, then stopping the drug should be effective.''Other treatments often are used in addition to those that treat the specific cause of gastritis, many of which are ''over-the-counter'' or OTC, may reduce or stop symptoms of gastritis and allow gastric mucosal healing to begin regardless of the underlying cause. These medications include''They all function by different mechanisms to reduce acid in the stomach but usually do not treat the underlying cause of gastritis.'   antacids (Maalox , Rolaids, and Alka-Seltzer), histamine (H2) blockers (famotidine [Pepcid AC], ranitidine [Zantac 75]), and PPI's or proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole [Prilosec], pantoprazole [Protonix], esomeprazole [Nexium])."
What is the best treatment for gastritis?,"'Treatments for gastritis vary and depend on successful treatments of its underlying cause(s). The most common treatments are over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications for symptom relief.''A diet that avoids hot, fried and/or spicy foods, alcohol drinking, or eating items you may be allergic to is another good way to both treat and reduce the risk of gastritis.' "
What home remedies relieve symptoms of gastritis? ,"'Usually, home remedies do not treat the underlying cause of gastritis.' "
Is there a special diet for gastritis?,"'There are general recommendations about what foods and drinks that you should consume to help reduce and relieve symptoms of gastritis. If underlying causes are not treated (for example, severe ''H. pylori'' infection, eating spicy foods and/or alcohol consumption), diet changes may result in little or no change in gastritis symptoms.' "
Can gastritis be cured?,"'Most people that get gastritis have few or short-term symptoms, and recover completely and are cured of the condition. Those people with underlying causes that are appropriately treated often recover completely. The prognosis of individuals with chronic disease and those who develop serious complications like bleeding ulcers, obstruction, and ''cancer'' .' "
Can you die from gastritis?,"'The complications of gastritis may occur over time, especially if gastritis becomes chronic and the underlying causes are not treated. Complications of gastritis may include, ''peptic ulcer'', bleeding ulcers, erosive stomach lining (the stomach tissue wears away), anemia, gastric cancers, MALT lymphoma, gastric scarring and strictures with outlet obstruction, ''dehydration'', kidney problems, and death.' "
How is gastritis prevented?,"'If the underlying cause of gastritis is preventable, then gastritis can be prevented and people can get gastritis relief.' Don't drink alcohol, take NSAIDs, and quit smoking if they trigger gastritis. Avoid situations where chemicals, radiation or some toxin ingestion could be. It may be more difficult to prevent some infectious causes of gastritis, but proper hygiene, hand washing, and eating and drinking only adequately cleaned or treated foods and fluids are healthy ways to decrease your risk of getting gastritis from infectious agents."
What is the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Gastroenteritis is a nonspecific term for various inflammatory problems in the gastrointestinal tract with the most common symptoms and signs being diarrhea, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''abdominal pains''. Gastroenteritis is often referred to as the ""stomach flu,"" however, it is not related to the ''influenza'' virus.''In the U.S., less than 2% of the estimated 100 million people with stomach ''flu symptoms'' per year ever require hospitalization, but in developing countries it is a leading cause of death, mainly due to dehydration.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'The signs and symptoms of stomach flu may vary depending upon the cause.''Symptoms may occur in some individuals with either viral or bacterial stomach flu. Symptoms also may be seen with other causes of stomach flu (drugs, food ''allergies'', toxins), for example:'   The primary symptom of viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu) is diarrhea (non-bloody). Nausea, vomiting, and some abdominal cramping may accompany the diarrhea. Mild fever (about 100 F or 37.77 C), chills, headache, and muscle aches along with feeling tired may occur in some individuals with viral gastroenteritis. Vomiting is occasional. Symptoms usually last about two to five days and then begin to resolve with viral gastroenteritis. Bacterial gastroenteritis (stomach flu) shares many of the symptoms as viral stomach flu, but in some individuals, bacteria may cause bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic gastroenteritis). Abdominal pain Weight loss Muscle aches and pains Headache Eosinophilia (mainly in allergic gastroenteritis) Electrolyte loss Severe gastroenteritis means the person has signs of dehydration; this is a medical emergency."
What are the signs and symptoms of stomach flu (gastroenteritis) in children?,"'Children with gastroenteritis or stomach flu usually have diarrhea, but may have other symptoms, for example:' Diarrhea Refusing to eat or drink or are very thirsty Either increased or low or no urine output Weight loss Lethargy Bloody diarrhea Pinched skin that does not rapidly go back to normal is a sign of dehydration, along with decreased fluid intake."
How is the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) spread?,"'Most viral and bacterial causes of the stomach flu can be transfer to other people by direct and indirect contact, usually by the fecal-oral route.' Direct contact could involve an infant's hand touching feces-contaminated surfaces and then touching a sibling or relative; indirect contact would be like touching a door knob or railing on a cruise ship or in a dorm that is contaminated and the person touches the contaminated surface and transfers the agent by touching their mouth. Another common way to get stomach flu is drinking or eating contaminated foods and liquids."
What causes the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Bacteria and ''viruses'' -- infectious agents -- (the most common cause) are the most frequent causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and worldwide. Infections cause diarrhea and other symptoms by causing inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tissue. The infections increase the fluid content in the ''intestines'"" and colon by changing the gastrointestinal tract's ability to absorb water and by increasing the speed of transit (motility) for things you ingest. This, in turn, causes diarrhea. Infectious agents may physically damage intestinal cells directly or indirectly with secreted toxins."" "
What are the most common causes of the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'The most prevalent cause of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and the world is '' Norovirus''. It causes about 50%-70% of viral gastroenteritis cases, while '' Rotavirus, Astrovirus, ''Adenovirus'', and ''Sapovirus'' ''strains'' cause most of the other viral gastroenteritis infections. ''Norovirus'' also was listed as the leading cause of gastroenteritis in children under 5 years old according to the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC).''Bacterial causes of gastroenteritis that occur worldwide are ''Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter Aeromonas'', and '' ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') ''strains of bacteria. Other bacteria like ''Clostridium, ''Vibrio'', Campylobacter'', and ''Yersinia spp'' can cause outbreaks occasionally. Occasionally, some bacterial causes of gastroenteritis (for example, ''Salmonella'' and , certain ''E. coli'' strains) may produce hemorrhagic or bloody diarrhea.''Parasites such as ''Giardia'', Cryptosporidium'', and ''Entamoeba'' infections can cause gastroenteritis and occasionally, other parasites have outbreaks such as the ''Cyclospora'' outbreak that occurred in 2012 to 2013 in the U.S.''There are many other less frequent causes of gastroenteritis such as food ''allergies'' (eosinophilic gastroenteritis), antibiotics, and toxins. Gastroenteritis symptoms are frequently listed as possible side effects of many medicines.''In most instances, food and ''drinks'' come into contact with feces contaminated with the infecting agent. This can happen in the fields, or in transport, storage, and processing of food and drinks. In processed foods and drinks, this contamination is relatively rare, but when it occurs, an outbreak of the disease is often traced back to faulty equipment, human errors in the processing and/or a breakdown of quality-control procedures.'  "
Is the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) contagious?," The large majority of causes (viral and bacterial) of gastroenteritis are contagious, usually through food or water contamination. In addition, they can be transferred person to person. Exposures to body fluids (for example, feces or droplets containing infectious agents) are common sources that transmit the disease to others (See transmission section). A few causes of gastroenteritis are not contagious, for example, food allergies or the side effects of medications."
Who gets the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Gastroenteritis (stomach flu) is a common, worldwide disease and almost everyone suffers from it a few times in their life because it is almost impossible to avoid contact with some of the viral and bacterial causes.' People living in crowded conditions (military, cruise ships, dorms) are at higher risk, as are people living in developing countries who often have a diet that contains contaminated food or water. Infants, children, and some adults (elderly, immunosuppressed) are at higher risk because of immature or depressed immune systems and also because they can become dehydrated faster than older children and adults. Some people taking antibiotics are at higher risk because the antibiotics depress the normal GI microbes and allow bacteria or viruses like Clostridium difficile to predominate and cause disease. People who do not practice good hygiene and hand washing techniques are at higher risk, as are those who eat under cooked and/or unwashed foods or drink from potentially contaminated fluid sources (rivers, streams, unpasteurized milk, for example)."
When should you call a doctor for the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'If gastroenteritis symptoms last more than about five days, increase in severity (fever of 101 F or 38.33 C or higher), or a person develops bloody diarrhea, dehydration, constant ''abdominal pain'' or other symptoms see a physician. The patient may have some gastroenteritis symptoms but may have a disease more serious than self-limiting gastroenteritis. Signs and ''symptoms of dehydration'' may include decreased or no urine production, dry ''mucus'' membranes, ''dry mouth'' or skin, no tears, ''weakness'', ''lightheadedness'' and ''low blood pressure'', while children may show little or no urination, become lethargic, have skin that ""tents up"" when pinched. Signs of dehydration in anyone are good reasons to see a doctor immediately.' "
How do you know that you have the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'There are no specific tests for gastroenteritis, thus gastroenteritis is most often diagnosed by the symptoms it produces, mainly diarrhea. Because gastroenteritis is usually a self-limited disease, the large majority of people are never seen or diagnosed by a doctor. However, during outbreaks like those seen on cruise ships, viral and bacterial cultures or ''PCR'' and other immunologically based tests can eventually identify the causative pathogen. By the time this identification occurs, most of the individuals with gastroenteritis have begun to recover.''When gastroenteritis symptoms become severe, most public health officials and health care professionals run such tests to identify the causative agent of a specific disease, based on all of the history of the patients, physical exams, and symptoms. In addition, patients with similar histories of recent food or drink they had in common with others often helps to discover the source of the disease (for example, people who got diarrhea had salads from the same food source).'

Are the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) and food poisoning the same condition?,"'Although the stomach flu and ''food poisoning'' share some common symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, ''stomach cramps'', muscle aches, for example, they are not exactly the same condition.''Consequently, there is some crossover between the two terms.''In addition:' Stomach flu or gastroenteritis means any nonspecific inflammatory problem in the gastrointestinal tract; some doctors consider the stomach flu to be more narrowly defined as a viral infection that attacks the digestive system. Food poisoning specifically is caused by eating or drinking contaminated food or fluid that contains bacteria, viruses, parasites and/or their toxins they produce. Food poisoning usually is found in small outbreaks that occur among individuals that have ingested the same foods or drink, and symptoms occur rapidly within hours; whereas the stomach flu has a more gradual onset of symptoms and usually lasts longer than food poisoning. Stomach flu is highly contagious and can be spread quickly to other individuals; whereas food poisoning usually requires ingesting the poison and does not easily spread to other individuals."
Are the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) and the flu (influenza) the same infection?,"'Although both the stomach flu and the flu (influenza) may be caused by viruses, the viral genus and species are different for each entity.' The viruses that cause the majority of stomach flu (gastroenteritis) are Norovirus spp; whereas the viruses that cause influenza are mainly Influenza A and B viral spp and subtypes. Stomach flu results mainly in problems with the gastrointestinal tract while influenza (flu) involves the respiratory tract. These two problems are not the same thing."
What foods are recommended to eat (diet ) when you have the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Some health care professionals suggest a special diet for the gastroenteritis, especially for viral and/or bacterial infections in children. First and foremost is adequate fluid rehydration to prevent dehydration.''The diet frequently suggested is termed the ""BRAT"" diet. This diet consists of foods that are not usually irritating but soothing for the gastrointestinal tract. The ''BRAT diet'"" stands for bananas, rice, applesauce and toast. Although some doctors think this diet may not markedly benefit patients, others recommend it for both adults and children for a day or two to make the transition from the resolving symptoms of acute gastroenteritis to the patient's previously normal diet."" "
"What natural and home remedies help soothe stomach flu (gastroenteritis) 
symptoms?"," Home treatment consists of adequate fluid intake so dehydration is prevented Clear fluids are recommended (Pedialyte especially for young children, Gatorade, PowerAde and other sports drinks), but not fruit juices or milk as they may prolong the symptoms Salt Ginger Baking soda Apple cider vinegar Basil Chamomile tea Asafetida spice Zinc Cinnamon Mint Turmeric Yogurt"
What is the treatment for the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Most people with the stomach flu require no formal treatment. The key to a rapid and safe recovery at home (home remedy) is proper hydration. If dehydration occurs, the patient should be evaluated by a doctor. Many health care professionals choose to begin IV fluids, the treatment of choice for rapid rehydration.''Other medications may be prescribed to reduce the symptoms of gastroenteritis. To reduce vomiting, ''promethazine'' (Phenergan), ''prochlorperazine'' (''Compazine''), or ''ondansetron'' (''Zofran'') are often used. Some physicians suggest using these agents only as a suppository or rapidly disintegrating tablet on the tongue since patients may vomit the pills up. Others may prescribe ''diphenoxylate and atropine'' (''Lomotil'') or lopermadine (''Imodium'') to slow diarrhea while others do not as the drugs may prolong the disease in some individuals. Many doctors recommend no medical treatment for gastroenteritis symptoms as all of the drugs have side effects and if the patient stays well hydrated, the symptoms usually stop soon anyway.'""As the gastroenteritis symptoms abate, especially vomiting, doctors may recommend a BRAT diet (bananas, rice, apples and toast) for a day or two before returning to the patient's regular diet. Potatoes, lean meat like chicken and whole grains can help replace nutrients and ""'electrolytes'' lost with diarrhea.''Patients who have more serious symptoms or other symptoms in addition to gastroenteritis need to be evaluated, diagnosed, and treated by a physician because the patient will likely have a specific disease that will need treatment. The treatment will depend on the cause of the illness (for example, salmonellosis or ''Clostridium difficile'' toxin). Antibiotics and other treatments may not be recommended for some of these diseases so an accurate diagnosis of the disease is important. For ''Clostridium difficile'' infected patients, antibiotic sensitivity testing may need to be done to determine the most effective antibiotics to use.'

How long does the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) last?,"'Depending upon the cause of gastroenteritis, it may be considered acute or chronic.' Acute gastroenteritis (viral) lasts about seven to 14 days, and is then usually self-cured. Chronic gastroenteritis (for example, allergic gastroenteritis) may last for months or longer if not diagnosed and appropriately treated."
What are complications of the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Most patients who get gastroenteritis have no complications and will completely recover. The major complication for some patients is dehydration; infants, children, the elderly and immunosuppressed are at higher risk for this complication. In many third world countries, hydration of infants is difficult at best so there are many infant deaths worldwide due to dehydration caused by gastroenteritis.'  "
What is the prognosis for the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'The prognosis (outlook) for complete recovery is excellent in most people infected with viral and bacterial caused gastroenteritis, as long as the person keeps well hydrated. Because infants, children, ''pregnant'' women, and adults that are elderly or immunosuppressed, usually dehydrate faster than healthy adults and sometimes are more difficult to rehydrate orally, their prognosis can range from excellent to poor. Their prognosis depends on how dehydrated they become and how effective are the attempts to rehydrate the patient.''The prognosis for those patients that develop gastroenteritis symptoms as part of a specific disease process (for example, ''shigellosis'') vary from good to poor, depending on the severity of the specific disease process.' "
Can you prevent from getting the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'There is no diet that will prevent gastroenteritis but food preparation plays a strong role in preventing gastroenteritis. In general, there are some actions people can do to prevent or reduce the chance of getting gastroenteritis, including:''There is a vaccine available against rotavirus that has reduced this infection in children. Also, there is a vaccine available against cholera-causing bacteria (''Vibrio''), but it is not widely available. A clinical trial of a Norovirus vaccine was done with some success. It is likely in the near future commercial ''vaccines'' against some causes will be available.' Hand washing, especially before eating and after any close association with an infected person or items (clothing, bedding, toys) they have touched Launder items daily that infected persons wear Avoid direct contact with infected individuals when possible Do not eat undercooked foods, especially meats Do not eat raw foods or drink untreated water Do not drink untreated or unpasteurized fluids, especially milk Thoroughly wash any produce, especially in third world countries, before eating While traveling, avoid all raw foods and ice; drink only from sealed bottled products and use bottled water for tooth brushing"
Which specialties of doctors treat the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"""Most individuals with viral or mild bacterial caused gastroenteritis require no treatment or can be treated by the patient's primary care provider or pediatrician. For more patients with more severe gastroenteritis, such infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, ""'emergency medicine'' specialists, allergists, critical care physicians, and hematologists may be consulted.' "
What is the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Stomach flu'' or ''gastroenteritis'' is a general term for a number of inflammatory problems that occur in the gastrointestinal tract. ''Gastroenteritis'' is a better term because when some individuals use the term ""stomach ''flu'',"" they get the term confused with the ''flu'' (''influenza'') and the ''viruses'' that cause the flu. ''Influenza'' ''viruses'' do not cause ''stomach flu''.''The most common symptoms of the stomach flu include:''Other symptoms may include:''Because stomach flu means gastroenteritis and, because when the term “stomach flu” is used, the readers usually mean acute gastroenteritis caused by viruses (mainly ''Norovirus''); the emphasis of this article will be on ''Norovirus''- caused gastroenteritis although other causes will be mentioned.'   Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Fever Headache Body aches Dehydration"
Is the stomach flu contagious? What causes it?,"'There are many causes of stomach flu. The most common causes are ''contagious'' gastroenteritis, and include:''However, many other causes of gastroenteritis that are not ''contagious'' include:''Many medications list gastroenteritis as a common side effect.' Viruses (for example, Norovirus, Adenovirus and others), Bacteria (for example,  Salmonella,  Shigella,  E. coli and others), and Parasites (for example  Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium, and others). Food allergies Antibiotics Toxins"
What are the signs and symptoms of the stomach flu?,"'The primary symptom of stomach flu or gastroenteritis is ''diarrhea'' that does not contain blood usually accompanied by ''nausea'', some occasional ''vomiting'', and abdominal cramping.''The incubation time for gastroenteritis varies according to the particular cause. The most rapid incubation time is usually with viral illnesses (for example, for ''Norovirus'', which is about 1 -2 days), and the infected person may become contagious during this time without symptoms of ''nausea'' or ''diarrhea''.''Noncontagious causes (''allergies'', toxins, medication side effects) may produce symptoms very rapidly (minutes to hours) and in some people, the symptoms may become so severe that they require emergency care.'""Doctors usually base the diagnosis on the person's history and physical exam; some patients will need further blood and fecal tests done to determine the cause, especially in more severe infections.""  "
How is the stomach flu spread (how do you get it)?,"   Contagious causes of stomach flu (gastroenteritis) are spread usually through contamination of food or water or by person-to-person (fecal – oral route) spread via contaminated droplets containing infectious organisms. Some of the contagious causes of gastroenteritis (most notably, Norovirus) can be spread by kissing and other close personal contact or on surfaces where droplets containing viruses or other agents survive. Some viruses can even be spread to household pets such as dogs that, in turn, can spread the disease to other people. Fortunately, most causes of contagious gastroenteritis are not spread by breastfeeding or through breast milk. Noncontagious gastroenteritis such as that related to side effects of medicine or food allergies is not spread from person to person."
How long is the stomach flu contagious (incubation period)?,"'Stomach flu is contagious when the organisms that cause stomach flu are spread to uninfected individuals. The timeframe or how long the infected person remains contagious depends on the infecting cause. For example, most common cause of stomach flu is ''Norovirus''. It has an incubation period of about 12 - 48 hours, and can cause the person to be contagious during the incubation period and for as long as they shed virus (usually about three days after symptoms stop but sometimes up to two weeks). ''Norovirus'' symptoms usually last about one to two days and is sometimes termed the 24 hour stomach flu.''Other infectious agents such as other viral ''strains'', bacteria, and other infectious agents have incubation periods and contagious periods unique to them. Because this is an introductory article about stomach flu, readers are recommended to check the incubation periods and contagious periods of whatever infectious agent is thought to be causing the problem (for example, ''Salmonella'' or ''E. coli'').' "
How long does the stomach flu last?,"'For contagious causes of stomach flu, many individuals have symptoms that last about 2 to 5 days, after which the symptoms tend to resolve. Once the symptoms resolve, an individual may be considered ""cured"" of stomach flu. However, it\'s not unusual for that same individual to develop stomach flu again at some point in time if they are exposed to other causes, or in some individuals, the same infectious cause. Occasionally, the stomach flu ""symptoms"" progress and goes on to become another more severe disease (for example, salmonellosis or ''shigellosis'').'  "
How long do the contagious causes of the stomach flu last on surfaces?,"'The most common cause of stomach flu, noroviruses, can live on surfaces for up to about two weeks. Consequently, is important to try to avoid contaminating surfaces while you are infected with the virus and equally important, anyone not infected individual should wash their hands with soap and water after touching surfaces that might be contaminated. Cleaning surfaces like doorknobs or kitchen counters with a diluted bleach and water solution can help reduce the chance of infection.''For other causes of stomach flu (gastroenteritis), the reader is suggested to look up the specific infectious agent to determine how long it will remain viable and contagious on surfaces.' "
When should I contact a doctor for the stomach flu?,"'Many people get contagious stomach flu from different causes, but in general, they recover from the infection in about 2 to 5 days and usually do not contact a health-care professional. Most doctors consider gastroenteritis to be a self-limiting disease. Unfortunately some people, especially the elderly, young children, and individuals that have multiple medical problems may develop more severe symptoms. Consequently, people should contact their health-care professional or emergency department if one or more the following occurs:'   Gastroenteritis symptoms that last more than five days The intensity of the symptoms increases A fever above 101 F or 38.3 C Bloody diarrhea Signs of dehydration appear, for example, little or no urine output or dry mucous membranes Constant or increasing abdominal pains A person is immunocompromised, has other medical problems, or is pregnant Facial or throat swelling Shortness of breath"
What is gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma?,"'The esophagus is the tube that allows food to travel from the mouth to the stomach. The lower part of the esophagus that connects to the stomach is called the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. At this location, there is a ring of muscles called the lower esophageal sphincter. This muscular ring controls the movement of food from the esophagus into the stomach. The GE junction lies just below the ''diaphragm'', or ''breathing'' muscle, beneath the ''lungs''.''Cancers'' that start in glandular cells are termed adenocarcinomas. Therefore, a gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma is a ''cancer'' that begins in glandular cells located near the GE junction. This ''cancer'' has also been referred to as esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma.''Gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas are staged and treated the same as cancers of the esophagus and are typically considered to be a form of ''esophageal cancer''.''Esophageal cancer'' is four times more common in men than in women. Almost 17,000 cases of new esophageal ''cancer'' cases are diagnosed yearly in the U.S., and the condition causes over 15,500 deaths each year. It is most common in Caucasians, but the incidence rate in African-Americans is almost as high as in whites. Esophageal ''cancer'' is much more common in other parts of the world, including Iran, northern China, India, and southern Africa.' "
What causes gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma?,"'The cause of GE junction adenocarcinoma is not well understood. As with all cancers, the DNA from esophageal ''cancer'' cells shows changes in many different genes. But specific genetic changes (mutations) that have been definitively linked to GE junction adenocarcinoma are not well characterized. ''Inherited'"" DNA mutations can increase some people's risk for developing certain cancers, but this does not seem to be the case for esophageal cancer as it does not appear to run in families. There are known risk factors (see below) that can increase your risk of getting esophageal cancer."" "
What are risk factors for gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma?,"'Risk factors that can increase the risk of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma include the following:' Male gender Increasing age (over 85% of cases occur in people over 55) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus, a change in the lining of the esophagus that occurs after long-term reflux of stomach acid into the lower esophagus Tobacco use, including chewing tobacco, cigars, and pipes Alcohol use, although alcohol increase the risk of other types of esophageal cancer more than for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma Obesity Dietary factors: A diet high in fruits and vegetables decrease the risk, while consumption of processed meat may increase the risk. Achalasia, a disorder of movement of the esophagus"
What are gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma symptoms and signs?,"'Most esophageal cancers, including gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas, do not cause symptoms until they have grown large or spread to an advanced stage. At this point, they cause typical symptoms and signs. The symptoms and signs may include the following:'  Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, can be a sense that food is ""stuck"" in the esophagus or not going down properly. Others have described a feeling of choking on food. If the opening of the esophagus is very narrow due to a cancer, people might start avoiding bread and meat due to difficulty eating and switching to a more liquid diet that can pass easily into the stomach. Increased production of saliva: The body compensates for difficulty swallowing by producing more saliva. This can lead to coughing up mucus or excessive saliva. Hoarseness Unintentional weight loss Painful swallowing or heartburn-like chest pain (chronic GERD) or burning Nausea and vomiting Chronic cough or hiccups Black stool from bleeding in the area of the cancer (GI bleeding) Anemia Bone pain, if the cancer has spread to the bones"
What specialists treat gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma?,"'A ''gastroenterologist'' typically performs the endoscopic tests that involve biopsies to diagnose gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. If cancer is found, the treatment team typically includes other specialists, including surgeons, oncologists, and ''radiation'' oncologists.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose and stage gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma?,"'You doctor may order a number of different tests to diagnose gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.''After diagnosis, the tumor is staged. That means the extent to which the tumor has spread is assessed and classified. Staging helps determine the proper type of treatment. Staging is done using a ""T, N, M"" system. The ""T"" refers to the location of the tumor and how deep into the wall of the esophagus it has grown. Some tumors will grow entirely through the wall of the esophagus and into adjacent structures like the trachea, ''aorta'', or spine. The ""N"" refers to the degree to which the tumor has spread to ''lymph nodes'', and ""M"" refers to the presence of distant metastases, meaning that tumor cells have entered the bloodstream and caused the cancer to spread to distant locations in the body.''The ''tumor grade'' is also assessed based on how the cells appear when examined under the microscope. A low-grade (grade 1) tumor contains cells that are closest to resembling normal cells, while high-grade (grade 3) tumors have cells that appear markedly different from normal cells. Grade 2 tumors fall somewhere in between.''Once these characteristics have been determined, the cancer is assigned to a stage group from I to IV. Some of these numerical groups are further subdivided into A-C.' Upper endoscopy is a procedure in which doctors use a flexible lighted tube to examine the inside of the esophagus and the GE junction. With this instrument, samples (biopsies) of any suspicious or abnormal areas can be taken for analysis by a pathologist to determine if cancer is present. Sometimes the biopsy tissue will show precancerous changes, known as dysplasia. Endoscopic ultrasound is often performed with an endoscopy. This uses an ultrasound probe that gives off sound waves at the end of the endoscope. This allows to doctor to determine the size of an esophageal cancer and the extent to which it has spread into nearby areas, including spread to nearby lymph nodes. Barium swallow is a procedure in which a contrast material (barium) is swallowed prior to taking a series of X-ray images of the esophagus, stomach, and part of the intestines. This is called an upper gastrointestinal (GI) series. CT scans, PET scans, and MRI scans are other imaging studies that may be used to help diagnose gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma or determine the extent of spread of the tumor."
What is the treatment for gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma?,"'Treatment for gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma is dependent upon the tumor stage and can involve a combination of different methods.''Surgical removal (resection) of the tumor is indicated when possible. Stage I and II esophageal cancers are potentially removable, along with most stage III cancers, if they have not grown into important organs like the windpipe or ''aorta''. Stage IV tumors have spread to distant sites in the body and are not able to be removed by surgery. Cancers of the gastroesophageal junction, when possible, are treated by surgically removing part of the stomach, the cancer, and a portion of the normal esophagus above the cancer. The stomach is then connected to the remaining part of the esophagus. Nearby lymph nodes are also removed to check for the presence of cancer cells.''Neoadjuvant therapy is treatment that is given before surgery to try to shrink the tumor to make the surgery easier. Neoadjuvant therapy may be given in the form of ''radiation'' or ''chemotherapy'' or a combination of the two.''Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a technique that removes sections of the lining of the esophagus, done through an endoscope as described above. This technique is only suitable for very small early stage cancers.''Photodynamic therapy'' (PDT) is also used to treat small cancers and ''precancerous'' changes. Porfimer sodium (Photofrin), a light-activating drug, is first injected into a vein. The drug collects in cancer cells over a time period of a few days. Using an endoscope, a laser light is then directed on the cancer. The drug reacts with the light and changes into a substance that destroys cancer cells, which are later removed with an endoscope. This can be used to remove small cancers or to reduce the size of large cancers to improve swallowing ability. It is limited in its ability to only destroy parts of the tumor that can be accessed by the laser light source, so deeper parts of the tumor cannot be treated.''Other treatments including electrocoagulation and laser ablation are sometimes carried out to keep the esophagus open and help the affected person swallow. These involve the localized destruction of cancer cells using laser or electric energy. Placement of a ''stent'' to keep the esophagus open is also sometimes performed via ''endoscopy''.''Chemotherapy involves the administration of ''drugs'' into the body that kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (in this case known as adjuvant therapy) or prior to surgery to shrink a tumor (neoadjuvant therapy). It is often given along with ''radiation therapy''.''Different chemotherapy ''drugs'' have been used to treat gastroesophageal junction cancers. A regimen known as ECF, consisting of epirubicin (''Ellence''), cisplatin, and 5-fluoruracil (5-FU), is often given for gastroesophageal junction tumors. Other drugs that have been used include carboplatin, paclitaxel (''Taxol''), ''docetaxel'' (''Taxotere''), ''capecitabine'' (''Xeloda''), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (Captosar).''Radiation therapy uses high-energy particles or rays to destroy cancer cells. It may be given along with chemotherapy (known as chemoradiation), either before or after surgery. It can also be used to relieve symptoms in the cases of advanced gastroesophageal junction cancer like ''pain'', bleeding, and trouble swallowing. This type of treatment is referred to as palliative treatment or palliation.''Targeted therapy drugs are medicines that work against a particular molecular abnormality or ""target"" found on cancer cells. This is a newer type of treatment than chemotherapy.''Trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') and ramucirumab (Cyramza) are two targeted therapy drugs that have been used to treat advanced esophageal cancers. ''Trastuzumab'' is used to treat cancers that over express a protein known as HER-2 that drives cell growth. Ramucirumab targets a protein known as VEGF that directs cancers to make new blood vessels. Ramucirumab is used to treat advanced cancers of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction, typically when other drugs have stopped working.''A new type of cancer treatment involves the use of drugs that target so-called ""checkpoints"" of the immune system. The normal immune system has built-in checkpoints that protect the body from attacks by its own immune system. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is a drug that blocks a known immune system checkpoint.. It targets PD-1, a protein on immune system T cells that helps keep these cells from attacking normal cells in the body. By blocking PD-1, the drug stimulates the body to mount an immune response against cancer cells. This drug has been used in some people with advanced gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas who have had at least two previous treatments that have stopped working.' "
What is the prognosis for gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma?,"'Survival rates for cancers are usually expressed as five-year survival rates. These statistics are based upon people who were diagnosed at least five years ago, so survival rates may be improved for those diagnosed more recently due to advances in treatment. In general, survival rates increase as the stage (extent of spread of the cancer at diagnosis) increases. It is important to note that these survival rates are only estimates, and individuals may have different outcomes based upon a number of factors.''Five-year survival rates for esophageal cancers have been reported for tumors that are either localized, with regional spread to nearby lymph nodes, or with distant spread. These are combined rates for all types of esophageal cancer, which includes gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas (cancers of glandular cells) tend to have a slightly more favorable survival rate than other types of esophageal cancer.' Localized: Cancers of the esophagus that are confined to the esophagus have a five-year survival rate of 43%. Regional: Cancers of the esophagus that have spread to lymph nodes in the area have a five-year survival rate of 23%. Distant: This group includes all stage IV cancers that have spread to distant sites in the body. These cancers have a five-year survival rate of 5%."
Is it possible to prevent gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma?,"'It is impossible to completely prevent gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, but you can take steps to decrease your risk. Getting adequate treatment if you have been diagnosed with ''GERD'"" or Barrett's esophagus can lower your risk. Eating a healthy ""'diet'' and maintaining a healthy weight can decrease the risk. Reducing alcohol use and not using tobacco can also lower your risk.' "
What is GERD or acid reflux?,"'Gastroesophageal reflux disease, commonly referred to as GERD or acid reflux is a condition in which the liquid content of the stomach regurgitates (backs up or refluxes) into the esophagus. The liquid can inflame and damage the lining (esophagitis) although visible signs of inflammation occur in a minority of patients. The regurgitated liquid usually contains acid and pepsin that are produced by the stomach. (Pepsin is an enzyme that begins the ''digestion'' of proteins in the stomach.) The refluxed liquid also may contain bile that has backed-up into the stomach from the duodenum. The first part of the small intestine attached to the stomach. Acid is believed to be the most injurious component of the refluxed liquid. Pepsin and bile also may injure the esophagus, but their role in the production of esophageal inflammation and damage is not as clear as the role of acid.''GERD is a chronic condition. Once it begins, it usually is life-long. If there is an injury to the lining of the esophagus (esophagitis), this also is a chronic condition. Moreover, after the esophagus has healed with treatment and treatment is stopped, the injury will return in most patients within a few months. Once treatment for GERD is begun it will need to be continued indefinitely although. However, some patients with intermittent symptoms and no esophagitis can be treated only during symptomatic periods.'""In fact, reflux of the stomach's liquid contents into the esophagus occurs in most normal individuals. One study found that reflux occurs frequently in normal individuals as in patients with GERD. In patients with GERD, however, the refluxed liquid contains acid more often, and the acid remains in the esophagus longer. It has also been found that liquid refluxes to a higher level in the esophagus in patients with GERD than normal individuals.""'As is often the case, the body has ways to protect itself from the harmful effects of reflux and acid. For example, most reflux occurs during the day when individuals are upright. In the upright position, the refluxed liquid is more likely to flow back down into the stomach due to the effect of gravity. In addition, while individuals are awake, they repeatedly swallow, whether or not there is reflux. Each swallow carries any refluxed liquid back into the stomach. Finally, the salivary glands in the mouth produce saliva, which contains bicarbonate. With each swallow, bicarbonate-containing saliva travels down the esophagus. The bicarbonate neutralizes the small amount of acid that remains in the esophagus after gravity and swallowing has removed most of the acidic liquid.''Gravity, swallowing, and saliva are important protective mechanisms for the esophagus, but they are effective only when individuals are in the upright position. At night during ''sleep'', gravity has no effect, swallowing stops, and the secretion of saliva is reduced. Therefore, reflux that occurs at night is more likely to result in acid remaining in the esophagus longer and causing greater damage to the esophagus.''Certain conditions make a person susceptible to GERD. For example, GERD can be a serious problem during ''pregnancy''. The elevated hormone levels of pregnancy probably cause reflux by lowering the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter (see below). At the same time, the growing fetus increases the pressure in the abdomen. Both of these effects would be expected to increase reflux. Also, patients with diseases that weaken the esophageal muscles, such as ''scleroderma'' or mixed connective tissue diseases, are more prone to develop GERD.' "
What causes GERD (acid reflux)?,"'The cause of GERD is complex and may involve multiple causes. Moreover, different causes may affect different individuals or even in the same individual at different times. A small number of patients with GERD produce abnormally large amounts of acid, but this is uncommon and not a contributing factor in the vast majority of patients. ''The factors that contribute to GERD are:''The action of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is perhaps the most important factor (mechanism) for preventing reflux. The esophagus is a muscular tube that extends from the lower throat to the stomach. The LES is a specialized ring of muscle that surrounds the lower-most end of the esophagus where it joins the stomach. The muscle that makes up the LES is active most of the time, that is, at rest. This means that it is contracting and closing off the passage from the esophagus into the stomach. This closing of the passage prevents reflux. When food or saliva is swallowed, the LES relaxes for a few seconds to allow the food or saliva to pass from the esophagus into the stomach, and then it closes again.''Several different abnormalities of the LES have been found in patients with GERD. Two of them involve the function of the LES. The first is abnormally weak contraction of the LES, which reduces its ability to prevent reflux. The second is abnormal relaxations of the LES, called transient LES relaxations. They are abnormal in that they do not accompany swallows and they last for a long time, up to several minutes. These prolonged relaxations allow reflux to occur more easily. The transient LES relaxations occur in patients with GERD most commonly after meals when the stomach is distended with food. Transient LES relaxations also occur in individuals without GERD, but they are infrequent.''The most recently-described abnormality in patients with GERD is laxity of the LES. Specifically, similar distending pressures open the LES more in patients with GERD than in individuals without GERD. At least theoretically, this would allow easier opening of the LES and/or greater backward flow of acid into the esophagus when the LES is open.''Hiatal hernias contribute to reflux, although the way in which they contribute is not clear. A majority of patients with GERD have hiatal hernias, but many do not. Therefore, it is not necessary to have a ''hiatal hernia'' in order to have GERD. Moreover, many people have hiatal hernias but do not have GERD. It is not known for certain how or why hiatal hernias develop.''Normally, the LES is located at the same level where the esophagus passes from the chest through a small opening in the ''diaphragm'' and into the abdomen. (The diaphragm is a muscular, horizontal partition that separates the chest from the abdomen.) When there is a hiatal ''hernia'', a small part of the upper stomach that attaches to the esophagus pushes up through the diaphragm. As a result, a small part of the stomach and the LES come to lie in the chest, and the LES is no longer at the level of the diaphragm.''It appears that the diaphragm that surrounds the LES is important in preventing reflux. That is, in individuals without hiatal hernias, the diaphragm surrounding the esophagus is continuously contracted, but then relaxes with swallows, just like the LES. Note that the effects of the LES and diaphragm occur at the same location in patients without hiatal hernias. Therefore, the barrier to reflux is equal to the sum of the pressures generated by the LES and the diaphragm. When the LES moves into the chest with a hiatal hernia, the diaphragm and the LES continue to exert their pressures and barrier effect. However, they now do so at different locations. Consequently, the pressures are no longer additive. Instead, a single, high-pressure barrier to reflux is replaced by two barriers of lower pressure, and reflux thus occurs more easily. So, decreasing the pressure barrier is one way that a hiatal hernia can contribute to reflux.''As previously mentioned, swallows are important in eliminating acid in the esophagus. Swallowing causes a ring-like wave of contraction of the esophageal muscles, which narrows the lumen (inner ''cavity'') of the esophagus. The contraction, referred to as peristalsis, begins in the upper esophagus and travels to the lower esophagus. It pushes food, saliva, and whatever else is in the esophagus into the stomach.''When the wave of contraction is defective, refluxed acid is not pushed back into the stomach. In patients with GERD, several abnormalities of contraction have been described. For example, waves of contraction may not begin after each swallow or the waves of contraction may die out before they reach the stomach. Also, the pressure generated by the contractions may be too weak to push the acid back into the stomach. Such abnormalities of contraction, which reduce the clearance of acid from the esophagus, are found frequently in patients with GERD. In fact, they are found most frequently in those patients with the most severe GERD. The effects of abnormal esophageal contractions would be expected to be worse at night when gravity is not helping to return refluxed acid to the stomach. Note that ''smoking'' also substantially reduces the clearance of acid from the esophagus. This effect continues for at least 6 hours after the last ''cigarette''.''Most reflux during the day occurs after meals. This reflux probably is due to transient LES relaxations that are caused by distention of the stomach with food. A minority of patients with GERD, about, has been found to have stomachs that empty abnormally slowly after a meal. This is called ''gastroparesis''. The slower emptying of the stomach prolongs the distention of the stomach with food after meals. Therefore, the slower emptying prolongs the period of time during which reflux is more likely to occur. There are several medications associated with impaired gastric emptying, such as:''Individuals should not stop taking these or any drugs that are prescribed until the prescribing doctor has discussed the potential GERD situation with them.'   lower esophageal sphincter abnormalities, hiatal hernias,  abnormal esophageal contractions, and slow or prolonged emptying of the stomach. narcotics,  tricyclic antidepressants,  calcium channel blockers (CCBs),  clonidine,  dopamine agonists,  lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid), nicotine and progesterone."
What are the symptoms of uncomplicated GERD?,"'The symptoms of uncomplicated GERD are primarily:''Other symptoms occur when there are complications of GERD and willbe discussed with the complications.''When acid refluxes back into the esophagus in patients with GERD, nervefibers in the esophagus are stimulated. This nerve stimulation results mostcommonly in heartburn, the ''pain'' that is characteristic of GERD. Heartburnusually is described as a burning ''pain'' in the middle of the chest. It may starthigh in the abdomen or may extend up into the neck. In some patients, however,the pain may be sharp or pressure-like, rather than burning. Such pain can mimic''heart'' pain (''angina''). In other patients, the pain may extend to the back.''Sinceacid reflux is more common after meals, heartburn is more common after meals.Heartburn is also more common when individuals lie down because without theeffects of gravity, reflux occurs more easily, and acid is returned to the stomach more slowly. Many patients with GERD are awakened from ''sleep'' by heartburn.''Episodes of heartburn tendto happen periodically. This means that the episodes are more frequent or severefor a period of several weeks or months, and then become less frequent orsevere or even absent for several weeks or months. This periodicity of symptoms provides the rationale for intermittent treatment in patients with GERD who do not have esophagitis. Nevertheless, heartburn is alife-long problem, and it almost always returns.''Regurgitation is the appearance of refluxed liquid in the mouth. In most patients with GERD, usually only small quantities of liquid reach the esophagus, and the liquid remains in the lower esophagus. Occasionally in some patients with GERD, larger quantities of liquid, sometimes containing food, are refluxed and reach the upper esophagus.'""At the upper end of the esophagus is the upper esophageal sphincter (UES).The UES is a circular ring of muscle that is very similar in its actions to theLES. That is, the UES prevents esophageal contents from backing up into thethroat. When small amounts of refluxed liquid and/or foods get pastthe UES and enter the throat, there may be an acid taste in the mouth. If largerquantities breach the UES, patients may suddenly find their mouths filled withthe liquid or food. What's more, frequent or prolonged regurgitation can leadto acid-induced erosions of the ""'teeth''.''Nausea is uncommon in GERD. In some patients, however, it may be frequent orsevere and may result in ''vomiting''. In fact, in patients with unexplained nauseaand/or ''vomiting'', GERD is one of the first conditions to be considered. It is not clearwhy some patients with GERD develop mainly heartburn and others develop mainlynausea.' heartburn 
(sometimes interpreted as chest pain),  regurgitation,
and  nausea. 
	"
What are the complications of GERD?,"'The liquid from the stomach that refluxes into the esophagus damages the cells lining the esophagus. The body responds in the way that it usually responds to damage, which is with inflammation (esophagitis). The purpose of inflammation is to neutralize the damaging agent and begin the process of healing. If the damage goes deeply into the esophagus, an ulcer forms. An ulcer is simply a break in the lining of the esophagus that occurs in an area of inflammation. Ulcers and the additional inflammation they provoke may erode into the esophageal blood vessels and give rise to bleeding into the esophagus.''Occasionally, the bleeding is severe and may require:''Ulcers of the esophagus heal with the formation of ''scars'' (fibrosis). Over time, the ''scar tissue'' shrinks and narrows the lumen (inner ''cavity'') of the esophagus. This scarred narrowing is called a stricture. Swallowed food may get stuck in the esophagus once the narrowing becomes severe enough (usually when it restricts the esophageal lumen to a diameter of one centimeter). This situation may necessitate endoscopic removal of the stuck food. Then, to prevent food from sticking, the narrowing must be stretched (widened). Moreover, to prevent a recurrence of the stricture, reflux also must be prevented.'""Long-standing and/or severe GERD causes changes in the cells that line the esophagus in some patients. These cells are pre-cancerous and may, though usually, become cancerous. This condition is referred to as Barrett's esophagus and occurs in approximately 10% of patients with GERD. The type of ""'esophageal cancer'"" associated with Barrett's esophagus (""'adenocarcinoma'"") is increasing in frequency. It is not clear why some patients with GERD develop Barrett's esophagus, but most do not.""""Barrett's esophagus can be recognized visually at the time of an ""'endoscopy'"" and confirmed by microscopic examination of the lining cells. Then, patients with Barrett's esophagus can undergo periodic surveillance endoscopies with biopsies although there is not agreement as to which patients require surveillance. The purpose of surveillance is to detect progression from pre-""'cancer'' to more cancerous changes so that ''cancer'""-preventing treatment can be started. It also is believed that patients with Barrett's esophagus should receive maximum treatment for GERD to prevent further damage to the esophagus. Procedures are being studied that remove the abnormal lining cells. Several endoscopic, non-surgical techniques can be used to remove the cells. These techniques are attractive because they do not require surgery; however, there are associated with complications, and the long-term effectiveness of the treatments has not yet been determined. Surgical removal of the esophagus is always an option.""'Many nerves are in the lower esophagus. Some of these nerves are stimulated by the refluxed acid, and this stimulation results in pain (usually heartburn). Other nerves that are stimulated do not produce pain. Instead, they stimulate yet other nerves that provoke ''coughing''. In this way, refluxed liquid can cause coughing without ever reaching the throat! In a similar manner, reflux into the lower esophagus can stimulate esophageal nerves that connect to and can stimulate nerves going to the lungs. These nerves to the lungs then can cause the smaller ''breathing'' tubes to narrow, resulting in an attack of ''asthma''.''Although GERD may cause ''cough'', it is not a common cause of unexplained coughing. Although GERD also may be a cause of ''asthma'', it is more likely that it precipitates ''asthmatic'' attacks in patients who already have asthma. Although ''chronic cough'' and asthma are common ailments, it is not clear just how often they are aggravated or caused by GERD.''If refluxed liquid gets past the upper esophageal sphincter, it can enter the throat (pharynx) and even the voice box (larynx). The resulting inflammation can lead to a ''sore throat'' and ''hoarseness''. As with coughing and asthma, it is not clear just how commonly GERD is responsible for otherwise unexplained inflammation of the throat and larynx.''Refluxed liquid that passes from the throat (pharynx) and into the larynx can enter the lungs (aspiration). The reflux of liquid into the lungs (called aspiration) often results in coughing and choking. Aspiration, however, also can occur without producing these symptoms. With or without these symptoms, aspiration may lead to infection of the lungs and result in ''pneumonia''. This type of ''pneumonia'' is a serious problem requiring immediate treatment. When aspiration is unaccompanied by symptoms, it can result in a slow, progressive scarring of the lungs (''pulmonary fibrosis'') that can be seen on chest ''X-rays''. Aspiration is more likely to occur at night because that is when the processes (mechanisms) that protect against reflux are not active and the coughing reflex that protects the lungs also is not active.''The throat communicates with the nasal passages. In small children, two patches of lymph tissue, called the ''adenoids'', are located where the upper part of the throat joins the nasal passages. The passages from the sinuses and the tubes from the middle ears (Eustachian tubes) open into the rear of the nasal passages near the adenoids. Refluxed liquid that enters the upper throat can inflame the adenoids and cause them to swell. The swollen adenoids then can block the passages from the sinuses and the Eustachian tubes. When the sinuses and middle ears are closed off from the nasal passages by the swelling of the adenoids, fluid accumulates within them. This accumulation of fluid can lead to discomfort in the sinuses and ears. Since the adenoids are prominent in young children, and not in adults, this fluid accumulation in the ears and sinuses is seen in children and not adults.'   blood transfusions, an endoscopic procedure (in which a tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus to visualize the site of bleeding and to stop the bleeding), or surgical treatment."
How is GERD or acid reflux diagnosed and evaluated?,"'There are a variety of procedures, tests, and evaluation of symptoms (for example, heartburn) to diagnose and evaluate patients with GERD.'  "
Symptoms and procedures to diagnose GERD,"'The usual way that GERD is by its characteristic symptom, heartburn. Heartburn is most frequently described as a sub-sternal (under the middle of the chest) burning that occurs after meals and often worsens when lying down. To confirm the diagnosis, physicians often treat patients with medications to suppress the production of acid by the stomach. If the heartburn then is diminished to a large extent, the diagnosis of GERD is considered confirmed. This approach of making a diagnosis on the basis of a response of the symptoms to treatment is commonly called a therapeutic trial.''There are problems with this approach For instance, patients who have conditions that can mimic GERD, specifically duodenal or gastric (stomach) ulcers, also can actually respond to such treatment. In this situation, if the physician assumes that the problem is GERD, the cause of the ulcer disease would be missed such as a type of infection called  ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori''), or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or ''NSAIDS'' (for example, ''ibuprofen''), can also cause ulcers and these conditions would be treated differently from GERD.'""Moreover, as with any treatment, there is perhaps a 20% placebo effect, which means that 20% of patients will respond to a placebo (inactive) pill or, indeed, to any treatment. This means that 20% of patients who have causes of their symptoms other than GERD (or ulcers) will have a decrease in their symptoms after receiving the treatment for GERD. Thus, on the basis of their response to treatment (the therapeutic trial), these patients then will continue to be treated for GERD, even though they do not have GERD. What's more, the true cause of their symptoms will not be pursued.""'Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (also known as esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy or ''EGD'') is a common way of diagnosing GERD. EGD is a procedure in which a tube containing an optical system for visualization is swallowed. As the tube progresses down the gastrointestinal tract, the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be examined.'""The esophagus of most patients with symptoms of reflux looks normal. Therefore, in most patients, endoscopy will not help in the diagnosis of GERD. However, sometimes the lining of the esophagus appears inflamed (esophagitis). Moreover, if erosions (superficial breaks in the esophageal lining) or ulcers (deeper breaks in the lining) are seen, a diagnosis of GERD can be made confidently. Endoscopy will also identify several of the complications of GERD, specifically, ulcers, strictures, and Barrett's esophagus. Biopsies also may be obtained.""'Finally, other common problems that may be causing GERD like symptoms can be diagnosed (for example ulcers, inflammation, or ''cancers'' of the stomach or duodenum) with EGD.'""Biopsies of the esophagus that are obtained through the endoscope are not considered very useful for diagnosing GERD. They are useful, however, in diagnosing cancers or causes of esophageal inflammation other than acid reflux, particularly infections. Moreover, biopsies are the only means of diagnosing the cellular changes of Barrett's esophagus. More recently, it has been suggested that even in patients with GERD whose esophagi appear normal to the eye, biopsies will show widening of the spaces between the lining cells, possibly an indication of damage. It is too early to conclude, however, that seeing widening is specific enough to be confidently that GERD is present.""'Before the introduction of endoscopy, an X-ray of the esophagus (called an esophagram) was the only means of diagnosing GERD. Patients swallowed barium (contrast material), and X-rays of the barium-filled esophagus were then taken. The problem with the esophagram was that it was an insensitive test for diagnosing GERD. That is, it failed to find signs of GERD in many patients who had GERD because the patients had little or no damage to the lining of the esophagus. The X-rays were able to show only the infrequent complications of GERD, for example, ulcers and strictures. X-rays have been abandoned as a means of diagnosing GERD, although they still can be useful along with endoscopy in the evaluation of complications.''When GERD affects the throat or larynx and causes symptoms of cough, ''hoarseness'', or ''sore throat'', patients often visit an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist. The ENT specialist frequently finds signs of inflammation of the throat or larynx. Although diseases of the throat or larynx usually are the cause of the inflammation, sometimes GERD can be the cause. Accordingly, ENT specialists often try acid-suppressing treatment to confirm the diagnosis of GERD. This approach, however, has the same problems as discussed above, that result from using the response to treatment to confirm GERD.' "
GERD (acid reflux) tests,"'Esophageal acid testing is considered a ""gold standard"" for diagnosing GERD. As discussed previously, the reflux of acid is common in the general population. However, patients with the symptoms or complications of GERD have reflux of more acid than individuals without the symptoms or complications of GERD. Moreover, normal individuals and patients with GERD can be distinguished moderately well from each other by the amount of time that the esophagus contains acid.''The amount of time that the esophagus contains acid is determined by a test called a 24-hour ''esophageal pH test''. (pH is a mathematical way of expressing the amount of acidity.) For this test, a small tube (catheter) is passed through the nose and positioned in the esophagus. On the tip of the catheter is a sensor that senses acid. The other end of the catheter exits from the nose, wraps back over the ear, and travels down to the waist, where it is attached to a recorder. Each time acid refluxes back into the esophagus from the stomach, it stimulates the sensor and the recorder records the episode of reflux. After a 20 to 24 hour period of time, the catheter is removed and the record of reflux from the recorder is analyzed.''There are problems with using pH testing for diagnosing GERD. Despite the fact that normal individuals and patients with GERD can be separated fairly well on the basis of pH studies, the separation is not perfect. Therefore, some patients with GERD will have normal amounts of acid reflux and some patients without GERD will have abnormal amounts of acid reflux. It requires something other than the pH test to confirm the presence of GERD, for example, typical symptoms, response to treatment, or the presence of complications of GERD. GERD also may be confidently diagnosed when episodes of heartburn correlate with acid reflux as shown by acid testing.''pH testing has uses in the management of GERD other than just diagnosing GERD. For example, the test can help determine why ''GERD symptoms'' do not respond to treatment. Perhaps 10 to 20 percent of patients will not have their symptoms substantially improved by treatment for GERD. This lack of response to treatment could be caused by ineffective treatment. This means that the medication is not adequately suppressing the production of acid by the stomach and is not reducing acid reflux. Alternatively, the lack of response can be explained by an incorrect diagnosis of GERD. In both of these situations, the pH test can be very useful. If testing reveals substantial reflux of acid while medication is continued, then the treatment is ineffective and will need to be changed. If testing reveals good acid suppression with minimal reflux of acid, the diagnosis of GERD is likely to be wrong and other causes for the symptoms need to be sought.''pH testing also can be used to help evaluate whether reflux is the cause of symptoms (usually heartburn). To make this evaluation, while the 24-hour ph testing is being done, patients record each time they have symptoms. Then, when the test is being analyzed, it can be determined whether or not acid reflux occurred at the time of the symptoms. If reflux did occur at the same time as the symptoms, then reflux is likely to be the cause of the symptoms. If there was no reflux at the time of symptoms, then reflux is unlikely to be the cause of the symptoms.'""Lastly, pH testing can be used to evaluate patients prior to endoscopic or surgical treatment for GERD. As discussed above, some 20% of patients will have a decrease in their symptoms even though they don't have GERD (the placebo effect). Prior to endoscopic or surgical treatment, it is important to identify these patients because they are not likely to benefit from the treatments. The pH study can be used to identify these patients because they will have normal amounts of acid reflux.""'A newer method for prolonged measurement (48 hours) of acid exposure in the esophagus utilizes a small, wireless capsule that is attached to the esophagus just above the LES. The capsule is passed to the lower esophagus by a tube inserted through either the mouth or the nose. After the capsule is attached to the esophagus, the tube is removed. The capsule measures the acid refluxing into the esophagus and transmits this information to a receiver that is worn at the waist. After the study, usually after 48 hours, the information from the receiver is downloaded into a computer and analyzed. The capsule falls off of the esophagus after 3-5 days and is passed in the ''stool''. (The capsule is not reused.)'""The advantage of the capsule over standard pH testing is that there is no discomfort from a catheter that passes through the throat and nose. Moreover, with the capsule, patients look normal (they don't have a catheter protruding from their noses) and are more likely to go about their daily activities, for example, go to work, without feeling self-conscious. Because the capsule records for a longer period than the catheter (48 versus 24 hours), more data on acid reflux and symptoms are obtained. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether obtaining additional information is important.""'Capsule pH testing is expensive. Sometimes the capsule does not attach to the esophagus or falls off prematurely. For periods of time the receiver may not receive signals from the capsule, and some of the information about reflux of acid may be lost. Occasionally there is pain with swallowing after the capsule has been placed, and the capsule may need to be removed endoscopically. Use of the capsule is an exciting use of new technology although it has its own specific problems.''Esophageal motility testing determines how well the muscles of the esophagus are working. For motility testing, a thin tube (catheter) is passed through a nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus. On the part of the catheter that is inside the esophagus are sensors that sense pressure. A pressure is generated within the esophagus that is detected by the sensors on the catheter when the muscle of the esophagus contracts. The end of the catheter that protrudes from the nostril is attached to a recorder that records the pressure. During the test, the pressure at rest and the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter are evaluated. The patient then swallows sips of water to evaluate the contractions of the esophagus.''Esophageal motility testing has two important uses in evaluating GERD. The first is in evaluating symptoms that do not respond to treatment for GERD since the abnormal function of the esophageal muscle sometimes causes symptoms that resemble the ''symptoms of GERD''. Motility testing can identify some of these abnormalities and lead to a diagnosis of an esophageal motility disorder. The second use is evaluation prior to surgical or endoscopic treatment for GERD. In this situation, the purpose is to identify patients who also have motility disorders of the esophageal muscle. The reason for this is that in patients with motility disorders, some surgeons will modify the type of surgery they perform for GERD.''Gastric emptying studies are studies that determine how well food empties from the stomach. As discussed above, about 20 % of patients with GERD have slow emptying of the stomach that may be contributing to the reflux of acid. For gastric emptying studies, the patient eats a meal that is labeled with a radioactive substance. A sensor that is similar to a Geiger counter is placed over the stomach to measure how quickly the radioactive substance in the meal empties from the stomach.''Information from the emptying study can be useful for managing patients with GERD. For example, if a patient with GERD continues to have symptoms despite treatment with the usual medications, doctors might prescribe other medications that speed-up emptying of the stomach. Alternatively, in conjunction with ''GERD surgery'', they might do a surgical procedure that promotes a more rapid emptying of the stomach. Nevertheless, it is still debated whether a finding of reduced gastric emptying should prompt changes in the surgical treatment of GERD.''Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and regurgitation may be due either to abnormal gastric emptying or GERD. An evaluation of gastric emptying, therefore, may be useful in identifying patients whose symptoms are due to abnormal emptying of the stomach rather than to GERD.''The acid perfusion (Bernstein) test is used to determine if ''chest pain'"" is caused by acid reflux. For the acid perfusion test, a thin tube is passed through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the middle of the esophagus. A dilute, acid solution and a physiologic salt solution (similar to the fluid that bathes the body's cells) are alternately poured (perfused) through the catheter and into the esophagus. The patient is unaware of which solution is being infused. If the perfusion with acid provokes the patient's usual pain and perfusion of the salt solution produces no pain, it is likely that the patient's pain is caused by acid reflux.""""The acid perfusion test, however, is used only rarely. A better test for correlating pain and acid reflux is a 24-hour esophageal pH or pH capsule study during which patients note when they are having pain. It then can be determined from the pH recording if there was an episode of acid reflux at the time of the pain. This is the preferable way of deciding if acid reflux is causing a patient's pain. It does not work well, however, for patients who have infrequent pain, for example every two to three days, which may be missed by a one or two day pH study. In these cases, an acid perfusion test may be reasonable."" "
How is GERD (acid reflux) treated?,"'One of the simplest treatments for GERD is referred to as life-style changes, a combination of several changes in habit, particularly related to eating.'  "
Lifestyle changes and GERD (acid reflux) diet,"""As discussed above, reflux of acid is more injurious at night than during the day. At night, when individuals are lying down, it is easier for reflux to occur. The reason that it is easier is because gravity is not opposing the reflux, as it does in the upright position during the day. In addition, the lack of an effect of gravity allows the refluxed liquid to travel further up the esophagus and remain in the esophagus longer. These problems can be overcome partially by elevating the upper body in bed. The elevation is accomplished either by putting blocks under the bed's ""'feet'' at the head of the bed or, more conveniently, by sleeping with the upper body on a foam rubber wedge. These maneuvers raise the esophagus above the stomach and partially restore the effects of gravity. It is important that the upper body and not just the head be elevated. Elevating only the head does not raise the esophagus and fails to restore the effects of gravity.''Elevation of the upper body at night generally is recommended for all patients with GERD. Nevertheless, most patients with GERD have reflux only during the day and elevation at night is of little benefit for them. It is not possible to know for certain which patients will benefit from elevation at night unless acid testing clearly demonstrates night reflux. However, patients who have heartburn, regurgitation, or other symptoms of GERD at night are probably experiencing reflux at night and definitely should elevate their upper body when sleeping. Reflux also occurs less frequently when patients lie on their left rather than their right sides.''Several changes in eating habits can be beneficial in treating GERD. Reflux is worse following meals. This probably is so because the stomach is distended with food at that time and transient relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter are more frequent. Therefore, smaller and earlier evening meals may reduce the amount of reflux for two reasons. First, the smaller meal results in lesser distention of the stomach. Second, by bedtime, a smaller and earlier meal is more likely to have emptied from the stomach than is a larger one. As a result, reflux is less likely to occur when patients with GERD lie down to sleep.''Certain foods are known to reduce the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter and thereby promote reflux. These foods should be avoided and include:''Fatty foods (which should be decreased) and ''smoking'' (which should be stopped) also reduce the pressure in the sphincter and promote reflux.''In addition, patients with GERD may find that other foods aggravate their symptoms. Examples are spicy or acid-containing foods, like citrus juices, carbonated ''beverages'', and tomato juice. These foods should also be avoided if they provoke symptoms.''One novel approach to the treatment of GERD is chewing gum. Chewing gum stimulates the production of more bicarbonate-containing saliva and increases the rate of swallowing. After the saliva is swallowed, it neutralizes acid in the esophagus. In effect, chewing gum exaggerates one of the normal processes that neutralize acid in the esophagus. It is not clear, however, how effective chewing gum is in treating heartburn. Nevertheless, chewing gum after meals is certainly worth a try.'   chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, and caffeinated drinks."
GERD (acid reflux) medications,"'There are a variety of over-the-counter (for example, antacids and foam barriers) and prescription medications (for example, proton pump inhibitors, histamine antagonists, and promotility drugs) for treating GERD.''Despite the development of potent medications for the treatment of GERD, antacids remain a mainstay of treatment. Antacids neutralize the acid in the stomach so that there is no acid to reflux. The problem with antacids is that their action is brief. They are emptied from the empty stomach quickly, in less than an hour, and the acid then re-accumulates. The best way to take antacids, therefore, is approximately one hour after meals, which is just before the symptoms of reflux begin after a meal. Since the food from meals slows the emptying from the stomach, an antacid taken after a meal stays in the stomach longer and is effective longer. For the same reason, a second dose of antacids approximately two hours after a meal takes advantage of the continuing post-meal slower emptying of the stomach and replenishes the acid-neutralizing capacity within the stomach.''Antacids may be aluminum, magnesium, or calcium based. Calcium-based antacids (usually ''calcium carbonate''), unlike other antacids, stimulate the release of gastrin from the stomach and duodenum. Gastrin is the hormone that is primarily responsible for the stimulation of acid secretion by the stomach. Therefore, the secretion of acid rebounds after the direct acid-neutralizing effect of the calcium carbonate is exhausted. The rebound is due to the release of gastrin, which results in an overproduction of acid. Theoretically at least, this increased acid is not good for GERD.''Acid rebound, however, has not been shown to be clinically important. That is, treatment with calcium carbonate has not been shown to be less effective or safe than treatment with antacids not containing calcium carbonate. Nevertheless, the phenomenon of acid rebound is theoretically harmful. In practice, therefore, calcium-containing antacids such as ''Tums'' and Rolaids are not recommended for frequent use. The occasional use of these calcium carbonate-containing antacids, however, is not believed to be harmful. The advantages of calcium carbonate-containing antacids are their low cost, the calcium they add to the ''diet'', and their convenience as compared to liquids.''Aluminum-containing antacids have a tendency to cause ''constipation'', while magnesium-containing antacids tend to cause ''diarrhea''. If ''diarrhea'' or ''constipation'' becomes a problem, it may be necessary to switch antacids, or alternatively, use antacids containing both aluminum and magnesium.''Although antacids can neutralize acid, they do so for only a short period of time. For substantial neutralization of acid throughout the day, antacids would need to be given frequently, at least every hour.''The first medication developed for more effective and convenient treatment of acid-related diseases, including GERD, was a histamine antagonist, specifically ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet'""). Histamine is an important chemical because it stimulates acid production by the stomach. Released within the wall of the stomach, histamine attaches to receptors (binders) on the stomach's acid-producing cells and stimulates the cells to produce acid. Histamine antagonists work by blocking the receptor for histamine and thereby preventing histamine from stimulating the acid-producing cells. (Histamine antagonists are referred to as H2 antagonists because the specific receptor they block is the histamine type 2 receptor.)""'As histamine is particularly important for the stimulation of acid after meals, H2 antagonists are best taken 30 minutes before meals. The reason for this timing is so that the H2 antagonists will be at peak levels in the body after the meal when the stomach is actively producing acid. H2 antagonists also can be taken at bedtime to suppress nighttime production of acid.'""H2 antagonists are very good for relieving the symptoms of GERD, particularly heartburn. However, they are not very good for healing the inflammation (esophagitis) that may accompany GERD. In fact, they are used primarily for the treatment of heartburn in GERD that is not associated with inflammation or complications, such as erosions or ulcers, strictures, or Barrett's esophagus.""'Four different H2 antagonists are available by prescription, including  cimetidine (Tagamet), ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac''), ''nizatidine'' (''Axid''), and ''famotidine'', (''Pepcid''). All four are also available over-the-counter (OTC), without the need for a prescription. However, the OTC dosages are lower than those available by prescription.''The second type of drug developed specifically for acid-related diseases, such as GERD, was a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), specifically, ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''). A PPI blocks the secretion of acid into the stomach by the acid-secreting cells. The advantage of a PPI over an H2 antagonist is that the PPI shuts off acid production more completely and for a longer period of time. Not only is the PPI good for treating the symptom of heartburn, but it also is good for protecting the esophagus from acid so that esophageal inflammation can heal.'""PPIs are used when H2 antagonists do not relieve symptoms adequately or when complications of GERD such as erosions or ulcers, strictures, or Barrett's esophagus exist. Five different PPIs are approved for the treatment of GERD, including omeprazole (Prilosec, Dexilant), ""'lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''), ''rabeprazole'' (''Aciphex''), ''pantoprazole'' (''Protonix''), and ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium''), and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant). A sixth PPI product consists of a combination of omeprazole and ''sodium bicarbonate'' (''Zegerid''). PPIs (except for Zegarid) are best taken an hour before meals. The reason for this timing is that the PPIs work best when the stomach is most actively producing acid, which occurs after meals. If the PPI is taken before the meal, it is at peak levels in the body after the meal when the acid is being made.''Pro-motility drugs work by stimulating the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and/or colon. One pro-motility drug, ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan''), is approved for GERD. Pro-motility drugs increase the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter and strengthen the contractions (peristalsis) of the esophagus. Both effects would be expected to reduce reflux of acid. However, these effects on the sphincter and esophagus are small. Therefore, it is believed that the primary effect of metoclopramide may be to speed up emptying of the stomach, which also would be expected to reduce reflux.''Pro-motility drugs are most effective when taken 30 minutes before meals and again at bedtime. They are not very effective for treating either the symptoms or complications of GERD. Therefore, the pro-motility agents are reserved either for patients who do not respond to other treatments or are added to enhance other treatments for GERD.''Foam barriers provide a unique form of treatment for GERD. Foam barriers are tablets that are composed of an antacid and a foaming agent. As the tablet disintegrates and reaches the stomach, it turns into foam that floats on the top of the liquid contents of the stomach. The foam forms a physical barrier to the reflux of liquid. At the same time, the antacid bound to the foam neutralizes acid that comes into contact with the foam. The tablets are best taken after meals (when the stomach is distended) and when lying down, both times when reflux is more likely to occur. Foam barriers are not often used as the first or only treatment for GERD. Rather, they are added to other drugs for GERD when the other drugs are not adequately effective in relieving symptoms. There is only one foam barrier, which is a combination of aluminum hydroxide gel, magnesium trisilicate, and alginate (Gaviscon).' "
GERD surgery,"'The drugs described above usually are effective in treating the symptoms and complications of GERD. Nevertheless, sometimes they are not. For example, despite adequate suppression of acid and relief from heartburn, regurgitation, with its potential for complications in the lungs, may still occur. Moreover, the amounts and/or numbers of drugs that are required for satisfactory treatment are sometimes so great that drug treatment is unreasonable. In such situations, surgery can effectively stop reflux.''The surgical procedure that is done to prevent reflux is technically known as  ''fundoplication'' and is called reflux surgery or ''anti-reflux surgery''. During fundoplication, any hiatal hernial sac is pulled below the diaphragm and stitched there. In addition, the opening in the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes is tightened around the esophagus. Finally, the upper part of the stomach next to the opening of the esophagus into the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophagus to make an artificial lower esophageal sphincter. All of this surgery can be done through an incision in the abdomen (laparotomy) or using a technique called ''laparoscopy''. During laparoscopy, a small viewing device and surgical instruments are passed through several small puncture sites in the abdomen. This procedure avoids the need for a major abdominal incision.''Surgery is very effective at relieving symptoms and treating the complications of GERD. Approximately 80% of patients will have good or excellent relief of their symptoms for at least 5 to 10 years. Nevertheless, many patients who have had surgery will continue to take drugs for reflux. It is not clear whether they take the drugs because they continue to have reflux and symptoms of reflux or if they take them for symptoms that are being caused by problems other than GERD. The most common complication of fundoplication is swallowed food that sticks at the artificial sphincter. Fortunately, the sticking usually is temporary. If it is not transient, endoscopic treatment to stretch (dilate) the artificial sphincter usually will relieve the problem. Only occasionally is it necessary to re-operate to revise the prior surgery.''Very recently, endoscopic techniques for the treatment of GERD have been developed and tested. One type of endoscopic treatment involves suturing (stitching) the area of the lower esophageal sphincter, which essentially tightens the sphincter.''A second type involves the application of radio-frequency waves to the lower part of the esophagus just above the sphincter. The waves cause damage to the tissue beneath the esophageal lining and a ''scar'' (fibrosis) forms. The scar shrinks and pulls on the surrounding tissue, thereby tightening the sphincter and the area above it.''A third type of endoscopic treatment involves the injection of materials into the esophageal wall in the area of the LES. The injected material is intended to increase pressure in the LES and thereby prevent reflux. In one treatment the injected material was a polymer. Unfortunately, the injection of polymer led to serious complications, and the material for injection is no longer available. Another treatment involving injection of expandable pellets also was discontinued. Limited information is available about a third type of injection which uses gelatinous polymethylmethacrylate microspheres.''Endoscopic treatment has the advantage of not requiring surgery. It can be performed without hospitalization. Experience with endoscopic techniques is limited. It is not clear how effective they are, especially long-term. Because the effectiveness and the full extent of potential complications of endoscopic techniques are not clear, it is felt generally that endoscopic treatment should only be done as part of experimental trials.''Transient LES relaxations appear to be the most common way in which acid reflux occurs. Although there is an available drug that prevents relaxations (''baclofen''), it has side effects that are too frequent to be generally useful. Much attention is being directed at the development of drugs that prevent these relaxations without accompanying side effects.' "
What is a reasonable approach to the management of GERD (acid reflux)?,"'There are several ways to approach the evaluation and management of GERD. The approach depends primarily on the frequency and severity of symptoms, the adequacy of the response to treatment, and the presence of complications.''For infrequent heartburn, the most common symptom of GERD, life-style changes and an occasional antacid may be all that is necessary. If heartburn is frequent, daily non-prescription-strength (over-the-counter) H2 antagonists may be adequate. A foam barrier also can be used with the antacid or H2 antagonist.''If life-style changes and antacids, non-prescription H2 antagonists, and a foam barrier do not adequately relieve heartburn, it is time to see a physician for further evaluation and to consider prescription-strength drugs. The evaluation by the physician should include an assessment for possible complications of GERD based on the presence of such symptoms or findings as:''Clues to the presence of diseases that may mimic GERD, such as gastric or duodenal ulcers and esophageal motility disorders, should be sought.''If there are no symptoms or signs of complications and no suspicion of other diseases, a therapeutic trial of acid suppression with H2 antagonists often is used. If H2 antagonists are not adequately effective, a second trial, with the more potent PPIs, can be given. Sometimes, a trial of treatment begins with a PPI and skips the H2 antagonist. If treatment relieves the symptoms completely, no further evaluation may be necessary and the effective drug, the H2 antagonist or PPI, is continued. As discussed previously, however, there are potential problems with this commonly used approach, and some physicians would recommend a further evaluation for almost all patients they see.''If at the time of evaluation, there are symptoms or signs that suggest complicated GERD or a disease other than GERD or if the relief of symptoms with H2 antagonists or PPIs is not satisfactory, a further evaluation by endoscopy (EGD) definitely should be done.''There are several possible results of endoscopy and each requires a different approach to treatment. If the esophagus is normal and no other diseases are found, the goal of treatment simply is to relieve symptoms. Therefore, prescription strength H2 antagonists or PPIs are appropriate. If damage to the esophagus (esophagitis or ulceration) is found, the goal of treatment is healing the damage. In this case, PPIs are preferred over H2 antagonists because they are more effective for healing.'""If complications of GERD, such as stricture or Barrett's esophagus are found, treatment with PPIs also is more appropriate. However, the adequacy of the PPI treatment probably should be evaluated with a 24-hour pH study during treatment with the PPI. (With PPIs, although the amount of acid reflux may be reduced enough to control symptoms, it may still be abnormally high. Therefore, judging the adequacy of suppression of acid reflux by only the response of symptoms to treatment is not satisfactory.) Strictures may also need to be treated by endoscopic dilatation (widening) of the esophageal narrowing. With Barrett's esophagus, periodic endoscopic examination should be done to identify pre-""'malignant'' changes in the esophagus.''If symptoms of GERD do not respond to maximum doses of PPI, there are two options for management. The first is to perform 24-hour pH testing to determine whether the PPI is ineffective or if a disease other than GERD is likely to be present. If the PPI is ineffective, a higher dose of PPI may be tried. The second option is to go ahead without 24 hour pH testing and to increase the dose of PPI. Another alternative is to add another drug to the PPI that works in a way that is different from the PPI, for example, a pro-motility drug or a foam barrier. If necessary, all three types of drugs can be used. If there is not a satisfactory response to this maximal treatment, 24 hour pH testing should be done.''Who should consider surgery or, perhaps, an endoscopic treatment trial for GERD? (As mentioned previously, the effectiveness of the recently developed endoscopic treatments remains to be determined.) Patients should consider surgery if they have regurgitation that cannot be controlled with drugs. This recommendation is particularly important if the regurgitation results in infections in the lungs or occurs at night when aspiration into the lungs is more likely. Patients also should consider surgery if they require large doses of PPI or multiple drugs to control their reflux. It is debated whether or not a desire to be free of the need to take life-long drugs to prevent symptoms of GERD is by itself a satisfactory reason for having surgery.'""Some physicians - primarily surgeons - recommend that all patients with Barrett's esophagus should have surgery. This recommendation is based on the belief that surgery is more effective than endoscopic surveillance or ablation of the abnormal tissue followed by treatment with acid-suppressing drugs in preventing both the reflux and the cancerous changes in the esophagus. There are no studies, however, demonstrating the superiority of surgery over drugs or ablation for the treatment of GERD and its complications. Moreover, the effectiveness of drug treatment can be monitored with 24 hour pH testing."" cough, asthma, hoarseness, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, unexplained lung infections, or anemia (due to bleeding from esophageal inflammation or ulceration)."
What are the unresolved issues in GERD (acid reflux)?,"'One unresolved issue in GERD is the inconsistent relationships among acid reflux, heartburn, and damage to the lining of the esophagus (esophagitis and the complications).''Clearly, we have much to learn about the relationship between acid reflux and esophageal damage, and about the processes (mechanisms) responsible for heartburn. This issue is of more than passing interest. Knowledge of the mechanisms that produce heartburn and esophageal damage raises the possibility of new treatments that would target processes other than acid reflux.''One of the more interesting theories that has been proposed to answer some of these questions involves the reason for pain when acid refluxes. It often is assumed that the pain is caused by irritating acid contacting an inflamed esophageal lining. But the esophageal lining usually is not inflamed. It is possible therefore, that the acid is stimulating the pain nerves within the esophageal wall just beneath the lining. Although this may be the case, a second explanation is supported by the work of one group of scientists. These scientists find that heartburn provoked by acid in the esophagus is associated with contraction of the muscle in the lower esophagus. Perhaps it is the contraction of the muscle that somehow leads to the pain. It also is possible, however, that the contraction is an epiphenomenon, that is, refluxed acid stimulates pain nerves and causes the muscle to contract, but it is not the contraction that causes the pain. More studies will be necessary before the exact mechanism(s) that causes heartburn is clear.''There are potentially injurious agents that can be refluxed other than acid, for example, bile. Until recently it has been impossible or difficult to accurately identify non-acid reflux and, therefore, to study whether or not non-acid reflux is injurious or can cause symptoms. ''A new technology allows the accurate determination of non-acid reflux. This technology uses the measurement of impedance changes within the esophagus to identify reflux of liquid, be it acid or non-acid. By combining measurement of impedance and pH it is possible to identify reflux and to tell if the reflux is acid or non-acid. It is too early to know how important non-acid reflux is in causing esophageal damage, symptoms, or complications, but there is little doubt that this new technology will be able to resolve the issues surrounding non-acid reflux.'   Why do only a few of the many episodes of acid reflux that occur in a patient with GERD cause heartburn? Why do some patients with mildly increased acid reflux develop heartburn, while other patients with the same amount of acid reflux do not? Why does heartburn usually occur in an esophagus that has no visible damage? Why is it that some patients with more damage to the esophagus have less heartburn than patients with no damage? Is heartburn not related to inflammation but rather to absorption of acid across the lining of the esophagus through widened spaces between the lining cells?"
What is esophageal pH monitoring?,'Esophageal pH (pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution) monitoring is a procedure for measuring the reflux (regurgitation or backwash) of acid from the stomach into the ''esophagus'' that occurs in ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').' 
When is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is used to diagnose ''GERD'', to determine the effectiveness of medications that are given to prevent ''acid reflux'', and to determine if episodes of acidic reflux are causing episodes of ''chest pain''. Monitoring esophageal pH also can be used to determine if acid is reaching the pharynx (lower throat) and is possibly responsible for such symptoms as ''cough'', ''hoarseness'', and ''sore throat''.'  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring performed?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is performed by passing a thin ''plastic'' catheter a sixteenth of an inch in diameter through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The sensor is positioned in the esophagus so that it is just above the lower esophageal sphincter, a specialized area of esophageal muscle that lies at the junction of the esophagus and stomach and prevents acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus. In this position the sensor records each reflux of acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid. ''The patient is sent home with the catheter and recorder in place and returns the next day to have them removed. During the 24 hours that the catheter is in place, the patient goes about his or her usual activities, for example, eating, sleeping, and working. Meals, periods of ''sleep'', and symptoms are recorded by the patient in a diary and/or by pushing buttons on the recorder.  After the catheter is removed, the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data it has gathered can be downloaded into the computer where it is analyzed and put into graphic form. The procedure can be modified by placing the sensor in the upper esophagus or pharynx to determine if refluxed acid is reaching the pharynx.''The most recently-developed device for monitoring esophageal pH uses a capsule also known as the Bravo Capsule. The capsule contains an acid sensing probe, a battery, and a transmitter. The probe monitors the acid in the esophagus and transmits the information to a recorder that is worn by the patient on a belt. The capsule is introduced into the esophagus on a catheter through the nose or mouth and is attached to the lining of the esophagus with a clip. The catheter then is detached from the capsule and removed. Thus, there is no catheter protruding from the nose. The capsule transmits for two days or three days, and then the battery dies. Five to seven days later, the capsule falls off the esophageal lining and is passed in the ''stool'' as the capsule is not reusable. ''The advantages of the capsule device are related to the absence of a catheter connecting the probe to the recorder.  There is greater comfort without a catheter in the back of the throat, and patients are more likely to go to work and do more of their normal activities without feeling self-conscious about the appearance of the catheter to others. The disadvantages of the capsule are that it cannot be used in the pharynx (where it would be impossibly uncomfortable) and, so far, it has not been used in the stomach. '  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Almost everyone has some acidic reflux, but the amount of reflux is small and rarely causes inflammation of the esophagus (''esophagitis''). As the amount of acid reflux increases above the normal range, so does the probability of developing esophagitis and its symptoms. In patients with symptoms that suggest acid reflux, a diagnosis of reflux can be made by demonstrating an acid pH in the esophagus for a greater than normal amount of time.'""A common alternative method to diagnose reflux is to treat patients with medications that reduce reflux. If the patient's symptoms stop, then the symptoms are likely to be due to acid reflux. Another way of diagnosing acid reflux as the cause of symptoms is to demonstrate that episodes of acid reflux recorded by esophageal pH monitoring occur at exactly the same time as esophageal ""'pain''.''Esophageal pH monitoring also can be used to determine why treatment for reflux is not working. For example, a patient treated for acidic reflux may continue to have symptoms. If so, then the question must be asked as to why the symptoms are continuing. Is it because the medication is not adequate or is it because the symptoms are not due to reflux and, therefore, are not going to respond to treatment for reflux? If the pH monitoring study performed while the patient takes his or her medication for reflux shows abnormal amounts of reflux, then treatment is inadequate and needs to be changed. If the amount of acid reflux is within the normal range, then it is likely that the symptoms are not being caused by acid reflux, and other potential problems need to be considered as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What are the limitations of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'The demonstration of abnormal amounts of acid reflux does not mean that symptoms are being caused by the reflux.  Only treatment with medications that treat reflux coupled with a marked reduction of symptoms can be used to substantiate reflux as the cause of the symptoms.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that treatment is associated with a placebo response. For instance, 10% to 20% of patients without acid reflux report an improvement in  symptoms with anti-reflux medications.  Therefore, even a good response to treatment does not definitely prove that reflux is the cause of symptoms.''Some of the strongest evidence that episodic ''chest pain'' is being caused by acid reflux is provided by demonstrating that the painful episodes coincides with an episode of acid reflux.  If there are very frequent episodes of reflux, however, it may not be possible to separate a true association between a symptom and reflux from a chance association due to the great frequency of episodes of reflux.  Conversely, if a symptom occurs infrequently, for example, once every few days, it is unlikely that the symptom will occur during a routine 24 hour monitoring session, and therefore, a correlation will not be possible.  One attempt to get around the latter problem is to extend the monitoring to several days, but this extended monitoring is done infrequently.' "
Are there other ways in which pH monitoring can be used?,"'If the pH sensor is left in the stomach instead of the esophagus, it is possible to determine the effectiveness of medications that shut off the production of acid in the stomach.  This information may be useful in determining the proper doses of medications among patients with acid-related conditions of the stomach and duodenum (for example, peptic ulcers).  It also is possible to place a catheter with two acid sensors so that one sensor is in the stomach and the other is in the lower esophagus.  With this catheter, it is possible to evaluate both acidic ''esophageal reflux'' and the effectiveness of acid-suppressing medications.''The pH sensor may be placed in the upper esophagus or in the pharynx just above the upper esophageal sphincter in patients with unexplained symptoms of ''sore throat'', ''hoarseness'', or ''cough''.  In these patients, the demonstration of acid reflux into the upper esophagus or pharynx suggests that acid reflux may be the cause of the symptoms. Recent studies however have shown that the association of these symptoms with acidic reflux may not be reliable.' "
What are the side effects of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are very few side effects of esophageal pH monitoring. Although there may be mild discomfort in the back of the throat while the catheter is in place, particularly during swallows, the majority of patients have no difficulty eating, sleeping, or going about their daily activities. Most patients, however, prefer not to go to work because they feel self-conscious about the catheter protruding from their nose. The capsule device may cause discomfort when swallowing. The discomfort is felt in the chest and may be due to food or the wave of esophageal contraction tugging on the capsule as it passes.' "
Are there alternatives to esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are no alternatives for obtaining the information that esophageal pH monitoring provides.  Nevertheless, the presence of esophagitis visually at the time of ''endoscopy'"" strongly suggests the presence of acidic reflux among patients who don't have other likely causes of esophageal ""'pain''.  This may obviate the need to do a pH monitoring study.' "
What is gastroparesis?,"'Gastroparesis means ''weakness'' of the muscles of the stomach. Gastroparesis results in poor grinding of food in the stomach into small particles and slow emptying of food from the stomach into the small intestine.'""The stomach is a hollow organ composed primarily of muscle. Solid food that has been swallowed is stored in the stomach while it is ground into tiny pieces by the constant churning generated by rhythmic contractions of the stomach's muscles. Smaller particles are digested better in the small intestine than larger particles, and only food that has been ground into small particles is emptied from the stomach then digested. Liquid food does not require grinding.""'The ground solid and liquid food is emptied from the stomach into the small intestine slowly in a metered fashion. The metering process allows the emptied food to mixed well with the digestive juices of the small intestine, pancreas, and ''liver'' (bile) and to be absorbed well from the intestine. The metering process by which solid and liquid foods are emptied from the stomach is a result of a combination of relaxation of the muscle in parts of the stomach designed to accommodate (store) food, and the pressure generated by the muscle in other parts of the stomach that pushes the food into the small intestine. (Thus, the stomach can store and empty food at the same time.) The metering also is controlled by the opening and closing of the pylorus, the muscular opening of the stomach into the small intestine.'""When the contractions of the stomach's muscles are weakened, food is not thoroughly ground and does not empty into the intestine normally. Since the muscular actions whereby solid food and liquid food are emptied from the stomach are slightly different, the emptying of solids and liquids follows different time courses, and there may be slow emptying of solid food (most common), solid and liquid food (less common), or liquid food alone (least common).""  "
What causes gastroparesis?,"""Gastroparesis can be caused either by diseases of the stomach's muscles or the nerves that control the muscles, though often no specific cause is identified. The most common disease causing gastroparesis is ""'diabetes mellitus'', which damages the nerves controlling the stomach muscles.'""Gastroparesis also can result from damage to the vagus nerve, the nerve that controls the stomach's muscles, that occurs during surgery on the ""'esophagus'' and stomach. ''Scleroderma'"" is an example of a disease in which gastroparesis is due to damage to the stomach's muscles. Occasionally, gastroparesis is caused by reflexes within the nervous system, for example, when the pancreas is inflamed (""'pancreatitis''). In such cases, neither the nerves nor the muscles of the stomach are diseased, but messages are sent through nerves from the pancreas to the stomach, which prevents the muscles from working normally.''Other causes of gastroparesis include imbalances of ''minerals'' in the blood such as potassium, calcium or magnesium, medications (such as narcotic ''pain''-relievers), and ''thyroid disease''. For a substantial number of patients no cause can be found for the gastroparesis, a condition termed idiopathic gastroparesis. Indeed, idiopathic gastroparesis is the second most frequent cause of gastroparesis after ''diabetes''.''Gastroparesis can occur as an isolated problem or it can be associated with weakness of the muscles of other parts of the intestine, including the small intestine, colon, and esophagus.'  "
What are gastroparesis symptoms and signs?,"'The primary symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include ''bloating'' with or without abdominal distension, early satiety (feeling full quickly when eating), and in severe cases, ''weight loss'' due to a reduced intake of food because of the symptoms. ''Abdominal pain'' also is present frequently though the cause of the ''pain'' is unclear. Reduced intake of food and restriction of the types of food that are eaten can lead to nutritional deficiencies.''The vomiting of gastroparesis usually occurs after meals; however, with severe gastroparesis, vomiting may occur without eating due simply to the accumulation of secretions in the stomach. The characteristic vomiting happens several hours after a meal when the stomach is maximally distended by the presence of food and secretions stimulated by the meal. Since the grinding action of the stomach is absent, the vomited food often contains larger pieces of recognizable food. (This can be contrasted with the more common type of vomiting in which the food appears as small, uniform, unidentifiable particles.)''Other, less frequent effects of gastroparesis are the promotion of ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') and malnutrition.'  "
How is gastroparesis diagnosed?,"'The most common method for diagnosing gastroparesis is a nuclear medicine test called a gastric emptying study, which measures the emptying of food from the stomach. For this study, a patient eats a meal in which the solid food, liquid food, or both contain a small amount of radioactive material. A scanner (acting like a Geiger counter) is placed over the stomach for several hours to monitor the amount of radioactivity in the stomach. In patients with gastroparesis, the food takes longer than normal (usually more than several hours) to empty into the intestine.''The ''antro-duodenal motility study'' is a study that can be considered experimental and is reserved for selected patients. An antro-duodenal motility study measures the pressure that is generated by the contractions of the muscles of the stomach and intestine. This study is conducted by passing a thin tube through the nose, down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the small intestine. With this tube, the strength of the contractions of the muscles of the stomach and small intestine can be measured at rest and following a meal. In most patients with gastroparesis, food (which normally causes the stomach to contract vigorously) causes either infrequent contractions (if the nerves are diseased) or only very weak contractions (if the muscle is diseased).''An ''electrogastrogram'', another experimental study that sometimes is done in patients with suspected gastroparesis, is similar to an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') of the ''heart'"". The electrogastrogram is a recording of the electrical signals that travel through the stomach muscles and control the muscles' contractions. An electrogastrogram is performed by taping several electrodes onto a patient's abdomen over the stomach area in the same manner as electrodes are placed on the chest for an EKG. The electrical signals coming from the stomach that reach the electrodes on the abdomen are recorded at rest and after a meal. In normal individuals, there is a regular electrical rhythm just as in the heart, and the power (voltage) of the electrical current increases after the meal. In most patients with gastroparesis, the rhythm is not normal or there is no increase in electrical power after the meal. Although the gastric emptying study is the primary test for diagnosing gastroparesis, there are patients with gastroparesis who have a normal gastric emptying study but an abnormal electrogastrogram. Therefore, the electrogastrogram can be useful primarily when the suspicion for gastroparesis is high but the gastric emptying study is normal or borderline abnormal.""'A physical obstruction to the emptying of the stomach, for example, a ''tumor'' that compresses the outlet from the stomach or scarring from an ulcer, may cause symptoms that are similar to gastroparesis. Therefore, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) ''endoscopy'"" test usually is performed to exclude the possibility of an obstruction as the cause of a patient's symptoms. (Upper GI endoscopy involves the swallowing of a tube with a camera on the end and can be used to visually examine the stomach and duodenum and take biopsies.)""'Upper GI endoscopy also may be useful for diagnosing one of the complications of gastroparesis, a bezoar (a clump or wad of swallowed food or hair). Because of the poor emptying of the stomach, hard to digest components of the ''diet'', usually from vegetables, are retained and accumulate in the stomach. A ball of undigested, plant-derived material can accumulate in the stomach and give rise to symptoms of fullness or can further obstruct the emptying of food from the stomach. Removing the bezoar may improve symptoms and emptying.''A computerized tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and upper gastrointestinal X-ray series also may be necessary to exclude ''cancer of the pancreas'' or other conditions that can obstruct the emptying of the stomach.''An alternative method of looking at gastric emptying is a large capsule (SmartPill) that is swallowed. The capsule measures pressure, acidity and temperature, and then transmits the measurements wirelessly to a recorder. By analyzing the measurements it can be determined how long it takes the capsule to empty from the stomach, and the amount of time necessary for emptying correlates well with other measures of gastric emptying.'  "
What is the treatment for gastroparesis and its symptoms?,"'Treatment of gastroparesis includes ''diet'', medication, and devices or procedures that facilitate emptying of the stomach. The goals of treatment include:''Emptying from the stomach is faster when there is less food to empty, so smaller, more frequent portions of food are recommended. Soft foods (or preferably liquid) that do not require grinding also are emptied more easily. Moreover, in gastroparesis, the emptying of liquids often is less severely affected than the emptying of solids. Fat causes the release of hormones that slow down the emptying of the stomach. Therefore, foods low in fat empty faster from the stomach. In patients with severe gastroparesis, sometimes only liquid meals are tolerated. It also is recommended that the diet be low in ''fiber'' (for example, vegetables) due to the concern about the formation of bezoars, and the fact that fiber slows gastric emptying - at least in normal individuals.''Food should be chewed well since the grinding action of the stomach is reduced. Meals should be taken with enough liquids to ensure maximal liquidity of contents in the stomach since liquids usually empty better than solid food; however, if liquid emptying also is slow, too much liquid might create problems. (Only trial and error will determine the effects of increased liquids.) Patients with gastroparesis should have most food early in the day, especially the solid food; they should not lie down for 4-5 hours after their last meal, since when lying, the assistance of gravity on gastric emptying is lost. ''Multivitamins'' should be taken because of the likelihood of malnutrition and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.'   To provide a diet containing foods that are more easily emptied from the stomach. Controlling underlying conditions that may be aggravating gastroparesis. Relieve symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Stimulate muscle activity in the stomach so that food is properly ground and emptied from the stomach Maintaining adequate nutrition."
What medications treat gastroparesis?,"'It has been demonstrated that ''tegaserod'' (''Zelnorm''), an oral drug used for treating ''constipation'' in ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), increases emptying from the stomach just as it does from the colon. However, in March of 2007, the FDA asked Novartis to suspend sales of tegaserod ) in the United States because a retrospective analysis of data by Novartis from more than 18,000 patients showed a slight difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events (''heart attacks'', ''strokes'', and ''angina'') among patients on tegaserod compared to placebo. The data showed that cardiovascular events occurred in 13 out of 11,614 patients treated with tegaserod (0.1%), compared to one cardiovascular event in 7,031 (0.01%) placebo-treated patients. However, it is unclear whether tegaserod actually causes ''heart attacks'' and strokes. Despite this fact, the availability of tegaserod in the U.S. is limited to emergency situations.''There are two important guidelines in prescribing oral drugs for gastroparesis. First, the drugs must be given at the right times, and second, the drugs must reach the small intestine so that they can be absorbed into the body. Since the goal of treatment is to stimulate muscular contractions during and immediately after a meal, drugs that stimulate contractions should be given before meals.''Most drugs must be emptied from the stomach so that they can be absorbed in the small intestine. The majority of patients with gastroparesis have delayed emptying of solid food as well as pills and capsules. As mentioned previously, many patients with gastroparesis have less of a problem emptying liquids as compared with solid food. Therefore, liquid medications usually are more effective than pills or capsules.''Occasionally, patients have such poor emptying of both liquid and solid food from the stomach that only drugs given intravenously are effective. In such patients, intravenous metoclopramide or erythromycin can be used. A third option is octreotide (''Sandostatin''), a hormone-like drug that can be injected beneath the skin. Like erythromycin, octreotide stimulates short bursts of strong contractions of the muscles in the stomach and small intestine. Due to its greater expense and the need for injection, octreotide is used only when other medications fail.' Oral Drugs: There are four oral drugs that are used to stimulate contractions of the stomach's muscles, referred to as pro-motility drugs. These drugs are 1) cisapride (Propulsid), 2) domperidone, 3) metoclopramide (Reglan), and 4) erythromycin. Cisapride (Propulsid) is an effective drug for treating gastroparesis; however, it was removed from the market because it can cause serious and life-threatening irregular heart rhythms. Despite this fact, it can be obtained for use through the pharmaceutical company that manufactures it (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) under a strictly monitored protocol but only for patients with severe gastroparesis unresponsive to all other measures. Domperidone has not been released for use in the US; however, it too can be obtained if approval is obtained for its use from the US Food and Drug Administration. Metoclopramide (Reglan) is available without restriction and is effective at promoting muscular activity in the stomach; however, there are side effects of metoclopramide that can limit its use. Erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ilosone, etc.), is a uncommonly used antibiotic. At doses lower than those used to treat infections, erythromycin stimulates contractions of the muscles of the stomach and small intestine and is useful for treating gastroparesis."
Controlling underlying conditions and maintaining nutrition,"'High levels of glucose (''sugar'') in blood tends to slow gastric emptying. Therefore, it is important to lower blood glucose levels in patients with ''diabetes'' to near normal levels with diets and medications. Individuals with a deficiency of ''thyroid hormone'' (''hypothyroidism'') should be treated with thyroid hormone. If bezoars are present, they should be removed (usually endoscopically).''Patients with mild gastroparesis usually can be successfully managed with pain relievers and pro-motility medications, but patients with severe gastroparesis often require repeated hospitalizations to correct ''dehydration'', malnutrition and to control symptoms.''Treatment options for ''dehydration'' and malnutrition include:''Enteral nutrition is safe and effective. The two common means of delivering enteral nutrition are via naso-jejunal tubes or jejunostomy tubes. The jejunum is the part of the small intestine just past the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine just beyond the stomach. Both naso-jejunal tubes and jejunostomy tubes are designed to bypass the stomach and deliver nutrients into the jejunum where they can be absorbed.''A naso-jejunal tube is a long, thin catheter inserted (usually by a radiologist or a ''gastroenterologist'') via the nostril into the stomach. The tip of the naso-jejunal tube is then advanced past the stomach into the small intestine. Often this must be done during upper GI endoscopy. Liquid nutrients then can be delivered via the naso-jejunal tube into the small intestine. Naso-jejunal tubes generally are safe, but there are cosmetic disadvantages and discomfort of having a tube in the nose. The problems that occur with naso-jejunal tubes are primarily accidental or intentional removal by the patient, blockage of the tube by solidified nutritional solutions, and aspiration (backup of stomach contents into the ''lungs'' that can lead to ''pneumonia'').''A jejunostomy is a catheter placed directly into the jejunum. It can be done during standard abdominal surgery, using minimally invasive techniques (''laparoscopy''), or by a specially-trained radiologist. With a jejunostomy, the catheter passes through the skin on the abdominal wall and directly into the jejunum. Before a jejunostomy is placed, a trial of naso-jejunal nutrition often is given to be certain that the small bowel is not involved with the same motility problem as the stomach and that nutritional liquids infused into the small intestine will be tolerated.' Intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and replenish electrolytes if nutrition is adequate but symptoms occasionally interrupt the intake of even liquid food. Enteral nutrition which provides liquid food directly into the small intestine, bypassing the paralyzed stomach. Intravenous total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to provide calories and nutrients (TPN is a fluid containing glucose, amino acids, lipids, minerals, and vitamins-everything that is needed for adequate nutrition-intravenously. The fluid usually is delivered into a large vein via a catheter in the arm or upper chest.) Doctors generally prefer enteral nutrition over TPN because long-term use of TPN is associated with infections of the catheter and liver damage. Infection can spread through the blood to the rest of the body, a serious condition called sepsis. Catheter-related sepsis often requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics and removal of the infected catheter or replacement with a new catheter. TPN also can damage the liver, most commonly causing abnormal liver tests in the blood. TPN-induced liver damage usually is mild and reversible (the liver test abnormalities return to normal after cessation of TPN), but, rarely, irreversible liver failure can occur. Such liver failure may require liver transplantation."
What drugs relieve pain and nausea from gastroparesis?,"'Drugs used to relieve nausea and vomiting'' in gastroparesis include promotility drugs (see discussion that follows) such as metoclopramide (Reglan) and domperidone, ''anti-nausea'' medications such as ''prochlorperazine'' (''Compazine'') and ''promethazine'' (Phenergan), serotonin antagonists such as ''ondansetron'' (''Zofran''), anticholinergic drugs such as a ''scopolamine'' patch (commonly used for treating ''motion sickness''), drugs used for treating nausea in ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'' patients such as ''aprepitant'' (''Emend''), and ''medical marijuana'' (''Marinol'').''Drugs used to relieve abdominal pain'' in gastroparesis include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'') and ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), low dose ''tricyclic antidepressants'' such as ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep''), drugs that block nerves that sense pain such as ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin''), and narcotics such as ''tramadol'' (''Ultram'') and ''fentanyl'' (''Duragesic''). (Nevertheless, narcotics as a group tend to cause ''constipation'' and slow emptying of the stomach, and, therefore, should be avoided or used with caution in patients with gastroparesis.' "
Is there surgery to treat gastroparesis?,"'Electrical pacing: ''Electrical pacing of the stomach is a newer method for treating severe gastroparesis. Electrical pacing of the stomach is analogous to cardiac pacing for the treatment of an abnormally slow heartbeat and involves the placement of a ''pacemaker''. The pacemaker usually is placed laparoscopically and does not require a large abdominal incision for entering the abdomen. During placement, wire electrodes are attached to the muscle of the stomach. The wires are brought out through the abdominal wall just beneath the skin. The wires are attached to a small, battery-operated pacemaker that is buried in a surgically-created pouch just under the skin. The skin is then sutured so that the pacemaker and wires are beneath the skin. The pacemaker generates electrical impulses that are transmitted by the wires to the muscles of the stomach, and the muscles contract in response to the impulses. Electrical pacing is effective in many patients with severe gastroparesis, but the numbers of patients who have been treated is small.''Surgery: '""Surgery occasionally is used to treat gastroparesis. The goal of surgery is to create a larger opening between the stomach and the intestine in order to aid the process of emptying the stomach's contents. Alternatively, the entire stomach may be removed. These procedures should be considered only when all other measures have failed because of the potential complications from the surgery. Surgery should be done only by surgeons in consultation with gastroenterologists who are knowledgeable and experienced in caring for patients with gastrointestinal motility disorders (disorders of the nerves or muscles of the gastrointestinal tract that affect ""'digestion'' and transport of food).' "
What is the prognosis (long-term outcome) for patients with gastroparesis?,"'If gastroparesis is caused by a reversible problem, for example pancreatitis, the condition will subside when the underlying problem resolves. In some people with ''diabetes'', better control of their blood ''sugar'' will improve emptying of the stomach. If there is no reversible cause, gastroparesis rarely resolves. In fact, it may become worse with time. Gastroparesis is particularly difficult to treat when there are accompanying motility disorders of the muscles of the small intestine.' "
What is new in gastroparesis?,"'The newest experimental treatment for gastroparesis is injection of botulinum toxin into the pylorus. The pylorus is the narrow channel through which food passes from the stomach to the duodenum. The pylorus, like the stomach, is a muscular organ. The pylorus is closed most of the time due to continuous contraction of the pyloric muscle. Intermittently it opens and allows secretions from the stomach to enter the small intestine. After meals, the pylorus is very important for metering the emptying of the stomach. In gastroparesis, although the muscles of the stomach are weak all of the time, the muscle of the pylorus remains strong and contracted and the pylorus relatively closed. It was hypothesized that if the strength of the pyloric muscle was reduced, food might empty from the stomach more readily. Although the initial results were good, subsequent studies have not confirmed the benefit of botulinum toxin. Although the initial results with botulinium toxin were good, subsequent studies have not confirmed the benefit. Its use should be considered experimental.''Although a surgical procedure, termed pyloroplasty, to enlarge the pylorus has been used in the past to treat problems with emptying of the stomach, it is major surgery and has had mixed results with respect to its efficacy.' "
What is upper endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy is a procedure that enables the examiner (usually a ''gastroenterologist'') to examine the ''esophagus'' (swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of small bowel) using a thin, flexible tube called the upper endoscope with a camera on the tip through which the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be viewed using a TV monitor.'  "
How do I prepare for endoscopy?,"'To accomplish a safe and complete examination, the stomach should be empty. The patient will most likely be asked to have nothing to eat or drink for six hours or more prior to the procedure.''Prior to scheduling the procedure, the patient should inform his or her physician of any medications being taken, any ''allergies'"", and all known health problems. This information will help the doctor determine whether the patient may need antibiotics prior to the procedure, and what potential medications should not be used during the exam because of the patient's ""'allergies''. The information will provide the individual scheduling the procedure an opportunity to instruct the patient whether any of the medications should be held or adjusted prior to the endoscopy.''Knowledge that the patient has any major health problems, such as ''heart'' or lung diseases, will alert the doctor of possible need for special attention during the procedure.'  "
Why has my doctor ordered an endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy usually is performed to evaluate possible problems with the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, and evaluate symptoms such as upper ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'', difficulty in swallowing, or intestinal bleeding ''anemia''. Upper endoscopy is more accurate than gastrointestinal ''X-rays'' for detecting inflammation or smaller abnormalities such as ulcers or tumors within the reach of the instrument. Its other major advantage over X-rays is the ability to perform biopsies (obtain small pieces of tissue) or cytology (obtain some cells with a fine brush) for microscopic examination to determine the nature of the abnormality and whether any abnormality is benign or ''malignant'' (cancerous).''Biopsies are taken for many reasons, and it may not mean that your doctor suspects ''cancer''.'"" Upper endoscopy also can be used to treat many conditions within its reach. The endoscope's channels permit passage of accessory instruments enabling the examiner to treat many of the conditions such as stretching areas of narrowing (strictures, Schatzki ring), removal of benign growths such as polyps, retrieving accidentally swallowed objects, or treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as seen in ulcers tears of the lining. These capabilities have markedly reduced the need for transfusions or surgery"" "
What can I expect before and during the procedure? Will I be awake?,"'Before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with you why the procedure is being done, whether there are alternative procedures or tests, and what possible complications may result from the endoscopy.''Practices vary amongst doctors, but the patient may have the throat sprayed with a numbing solution and will probably be given sedating and ''pain'' alleviating medications through a vein. You will be relaxed after receiving this medication, usually midazolam (''Versed'') for sedation and ''fentanyl'' for ''pain'' relief, and you may even go to ''sleep''. This form of sedation is called ''conscious sedation'', and usually is administered by a nurse who monitors you during the entire procedure.''You also may be sedated using propofol (Diprivan) called ""''deep sedation'',"" which usually is administered by a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist who monitors your vital signs (''blood pressure'' and pulse) as well as the amount of oxygen in your blood during the procedure.''After you are sedated while lying on your left side the flexible video endoscope, the thickness of a small finger, is passed through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure will NOT interfere with your ''breathing''. Most people experience only minimal discomfort during the test, and many ''sleep'' throughout the entire procedure using conscious sedation. Deep sedation ensures that you feel no discomfort during the entire procedure.'  "
What happens after the procedure? Can I drive?,"'When the procedure has been completed, you will be observed and monitored by a qualified individual in the endoscopy room or a recovery area until much of the effects of the medications have worn off.''Occasionally, endoscopy may cause a mild ''sore throat'', which promptly responds to saline gargles, or a feeling of distention from the air that was used during the procedure. Both problems are mild and transient.''When fully recovered, the you will be instructed when to resume your usual ''diet'' (probably within a few hours), and the your driver will be allowed to take you home. (Because of the use of sedation, most facilities mandate that a driver take patients home and not drive, handle machinery, or make important decisions for the remainder of the day.)' "
What are the risks of endoscopy?,"'Endoscopy is a safe procedure and when performed by a physician with specialized training in these procedures, the complications are extremely rare. They may include localized irritation of the vein where the medication was administered, reaction to the medication or ''sedatives'' used, complications from pre-existing heart, lung, or ''liver disease'', bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or removal of a polyp (which if it occurs is almost always minor and rarely requires transfusions or surgery). Major complications such as perforation (punching a hole through the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) are rare but usually require surgical repair.' "
When will I recevie the results of my endoscopy?,"'Under most circumstances, the examining physician will inform the patient of the test results or the probable findings prior to discharge from the recovery area. The results of biopsies or cytology usually take 72-96 hours and the doctor may only give the patient a presumptive diagnosis pending the definitive one, after the microscopic examination of the biopsies.'  "
What if I still have questions after the procedure?,"'If you have any questions or concerns about the exam, costs, whether your insurance will cover it, or methods of billing, talk to your doctor or another healthcare professional. Most endoscopists are highly trained specialists and will be happy to discuss their qualifications and answer any questions.' "
Facts you should know about Gaucher disease,"  Gaucher disease is an inherited (genetic) condition that is due to a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Gaucher disease leads to the accumulation of fatty substances in certain organs. Signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease includeenlarged liver and spleen,fatigue,anemia,bone pain and fractures, andeasy bruising and bleeding. enlarged liver and spleen, fatigue, anemia, bone pain and fractures, and easy bruising and bleeding. Signs and symptoms vary among people with Gaucher disease. There are several types of Gaucher disease including type 1, 2, 3 Gaucher disease; perinatal lethal Gaucher disease, and cardiovascular Gaucher disease. The most common type of Gaucher disease is type 1, and this type typically does not affect the nervous system. Type 2 Gaucher disease and perinatal lethal Gaucher disease are rare and severe forms of the disease. Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Gaucher disease is most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, affecting about 1 out of every 855 people. In the non-Jewish population, Gaucher disease affects 1 out of every 40,000 people. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the main treatment for Gaucher disease. Those with family members affected with Gaucher disease may want to consider genetic counseling and screening for the genetic mutation."
What is Gaucher disease?,"""Gaucher disease (sometimes called Gaucher's disease) is an inherited condition that results in the abnormal accumulation of fatty substances known as glycolipids in different body tissues due to a deficiency of an enzyme known as glucocerebrosidase. There are several different types of the condition, and the signs and symptoms that arise due to the sphingolipid accumulation vary widely. Gaucher disease is due to a genetic defect in a gene known as GBA1. Gaucher disease belongs to a class of diseases called lysosomal storage diseases, named after a type of cell that is affected by the buildup of glycolipids."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease?,"'The main signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease include the following:''People with type 1 Gaucher disease usually first notice painless enlargement of the spleen, anemia, or bleeding and ''bruising'' due to low ''platelet count'"". The enlargement of the spleen may become severe and may limit a child's growth due to the energy required to sustain the enlarging spleen. An enlarged liver and abnormal ""'liver function'' tests are also characteristic signs. Skeletal involvement by Gaucher disease is common and can take the form of bone pain, fractures of bone, and a defect of the thigh bone (femur).'   Anemia (low red blood cell count) Fatigue(tiredness) Low platelet count, that can lead to easy bruising Enlarged spleen and liver (hepatosplenomegaly) Easy bleeding that is difficult to stop Bone pain, bone crisis (severe bone pain often accompanied by fever), and the chance of easily broken bones"
How is Gaucher disease inherited?,"'Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both parents must carry a copy of the defective gene in order for a child to be affected.' "
How common is Gaucher disease?,"'In people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent Type 1 Gaucher disease (see below) is more common, and affects 1 out of every 855 people. About 1 out of every 15 people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are thought to be carriers of the genetic mutation responsible for Gaucher disease. The other types of Gaucher disease do not occur more frequently in people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. In the non-Jewish population, Gaucher disease affects 1 out of every 40,000 people. ' "
What are the types of Gaucher disease?,"'The most common form of the condition is type 1 Gaucher disease. About 90% of people with the condition have this type. The signs and symptoms of this type can vary in their extent of severity. The symptoms can appear in childhood or may be delayed until adulthood. The brain and spinal cord, or central nervous system (CNS), are typically not affected by the disease, so this type is sometimes referred to as non-neuronopathic, meaning that the condition does not affect nerve cells.''This rare type of Gaucher disease affects the nervous system and is termed neuronopathic Gaucher disease. Signs and symptoms include ''seizures'', eye movement problems, and ''brain damage''. Type 2 Gaucher disease is very severe and typically leads to life-threatening medical problems that begin in infancy.''Like Type 2 Gaucher disease, type 3 Gaucher is a neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease that affects the nervous system, but symptoms do not progress as rapidly as in Type 2. The signs and symptoms may appear in infancy or later in childhood.''Perinatal lethal Gaucher disease is the most severe form of the condition. With this type, the life-threatening conditions can appear before birth. There may be excessive swelling and fluid accumulation in the fetus (hydrops fetalis) prior to birth. Other features can include severe neurological disturbances, abnormal facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, and dry or scaly skin. Most infants with this form of the condition survive only a few days after birth.''This type of Gaucher disease, considered a rare subgroup of type 3 disease, primarily affects the ''heart'', leading to calcification or hardening of the heart valves. Sometimes, symptoms and signs of other types of Gaucher disease may also be present.' "
What causes Gaucher disease?,"'All of the types of Gaucher disease are caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, leading to an abnormal buildup of fatty substances, glycolipids, in the body cells. Mutations in the gene known as GBA1 are the cause of the deficient enzyme, and over 300 different GBA1 mutations have been identified in people with Gaucher disease. The mutations are inherited (passed from parent to offspring) in an autosomal recessive manner (see above). The four most common mutations of GBA1 gene are N370S, L444P, 84gg and IVS2[+1]. DNA analysis for these 4 mutations can detect 90%-95% of the mutations associated with Gaucher Disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, and 50%-75% of the associated mutations in the general population.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat Gaucher disease?,"'Patients with Gaucher disease may be treated by a number of different medical specialists, depending on the type of the disease and the specific symptoms and signs of the condition they experience. These may include pediatricians, neonatologists, internists, geneticists, neurologists, orthopedists, critical care specialists, cardiologists, and hematologists. Most patients who are treated with enzyme replacement therapy will have their treatment plan managed by a geneticist and/or hematologist.' "
Is there a test to diagnose Gaucher disease?,'A blood test is used to make the diagnosis of Gaucher disease. The enzyme assay test measures the activity of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme in certain white blood cells. Having less than 15% of normal enzyme activity is diagnostic for Gaucher disease. Genetic analysis is also done to establish the specific type of mutations in the GBA1 gene.' 
What is the treatment for Gaucher disease?,"'There is no cure for Gaucher disease, but medical treatments are available. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the primary form of treatment for people with type 1 and Gaucher disease and for the non-neurologic symptoms of type 3 Gaucher disease. The drug is given intravenously, generally at 2-week intervals. There are three ERT ''drugs'' available, imiglucerase (''Cerezyme''), velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV), and taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso).''Other medications available to treat Gaucher disease include drugs that block the production of the sphingolipids that accumulate in cells and cause symptoms. These drugs are known as glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors and are taken by mouth. Two drugs in this class are miglustat (Zavesca) and eliglustat (Cerdelga). ''Formerly, the condition was often treated by surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy). However, this is typically not necessary given the availability of ERT.'  "
"What is the prognosis, or life expectancy, for someone with Gaucher disease?","'The prognosis for people with type 1 or type 3 Gaucher disease who receive treatment is very good. Many people with Gaucher disease have few symptoms and can expect a normal lifespan even without treatment. One study estimated life expectancy at birth for people with type 1 Gaucher disease to be 68 years, compared with 77 years in the general population. Type 2 Gaucher disease usually results in death within the first few years of life.' "
Should I talk to my family about Gaucher disease?,"'As with any ''inherited disease'', sharing information with family members is important. If Gaucher disease is identified within a family, other family members may wish to be tested to find out if they are carriers for the gene mutation. Carrier testing is simple and can be performed on a sample of blood or saliva. Your health-care professional can help you decide if carrier testing is appropriate and may refer you to a genetic counselor for more information.' "
"What help is available for patients and their families living with Gaucher 
disease?","'Living with Gaucher disease or any chronic illness is stressful for both patient and family. Getting help and support are important for achieving the best quality of life possible while facing the challenges and that the illness brings. The National Gaucher Foundation (800-504-3189) offers educational and support services for affected families, including a mentor program, an electronic pen pal program for young adults, real-life patient stories, and numerous educational programs.' "
What other names are used to refer to Gaucher disease?,'Gaucher disease has been referred to in the medical literature by a number of different names. These include:' cerebroside lipidosis syndrome Gaucher splenomegaly Gaucher syndrome Gaucher's disease Gauchers disease GD glucocerebrosidase deficiency glucocerebrosidosis glucosyl cerebroside lipidosis glucosylceramidase deficiency glucosylceramide beta-glucosidase deficiency glucosylceramide lipidosis kerasin histiocytosis kerasin lipoidosis kerasin thesaurismosis lipoid histiocytosis (kerasin type)
What is Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"""Guillain-Barré\xa0syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of its peripheral nervous system—the network of nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. GBS can range from a very mild case with a brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently. Fortunately, most people eventually recover from even the most severe cases of GBS.\xa0 After recovery, some people will continue to have some degree of weakness.""'Guillain-Barré syndrome can affect anyone. It can strike at any age (although it is more frequent in adults and older people) and both sexes are equally prone to the disorder. GBS is estimated to affect about one person in 100,000 each year.'  "
What are the symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"'Unexplained sensations often occur first, such as tingling in the ''feet'' or hands, or even ''pain'' (especially in children), often starting in the legs or back. Children will also show symptoms with difficulty ''walking'' and may refuse to walk. These sensations tend to disappear before the major, longer-term symptoms appear.\xa0 Weakness on both sides of the body is the major symptom that prompts most people to seek medical attention. The weakness may first appear as difficulty climbing stairs or walking. Symptoms often affect the arms, ''breathing'' muscles, and even the face, reflecting more widespread nerve damage. Occasionally symptoms start in the upper body and move down to the legs and feet.''Most people reach the greatest stage of weakness within the first two weeks after symptoms appear; by the third week, 90 percent of affected individuals are at their weakest.''In addition to muscle weakness, symptoms may include:''These symptoms can increase in intensity over a period of hours, days, or weeks until certain muscles cannot be used at all and, when severe, the person is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases, the disorder is life-threatening—potentially interfering with breathing and, at times, with blood pressure or ''heart'' rate.'   Difficulty with eye muscles and vision Difficulty swallowing, speaking or chewing Pricking or pins and needles sensations in the hands and feet Pain that can be severe, particularly at night Coordination problems and unsteadiness Abnormal heartbeat/rate or blood pressure Problems with digestion and/or bladder control."
What causes Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"'The exact cause of GBS is not known. Researchers don’t know why it strikes some people and not others. It is not ''contagious'' or ''inherited''. \xa0'""What they do know is that the affected person's immune system begins to attack the body itself. It is thought that, at least in some cases, this immune attack is initiated to fight infection and that some chemicals on infecting bacteria and ""'viruses'' resemble those on nerve cells, which, in turn, also become targets of attack.\xa0 Since the body’s own immune system does the damage, GBS is called an autoimmune disease (“auto” meaning “self”). Normally the immune system uses antibodies (molecules produced in an immune response) and special white blood cells to protect us by attacking infecting microorganisms (bacteria and viruses). In Guillain-Barré syndrome, however, the immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy nerves.''Most cases usually start a few days or weeks following a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. Occasionally surgery will trigger the syndrome. In rare cases, ''vaccinations'' may increase the risk of GBS. Recently, some countries worldwide reported an increased incidence of GBS following infection with the ''Zika virus''.' "
How is Guillain-Barré syndrome diagnosed?,"'The initial signs and symptoms of GBS are varied and there are several disorders with similar symptoms.\xa0 Therefore, doctors may find it difficult to diagnose GBS in its earliest stages.''Physicians will note whether the symptoms appear on both sides of the body (the typical finding in Guillain-Barré syndrome) and the speed with which the symptoms appear (in other disorders, muscle weakness may progress over months rather than days or weeks). In GBS, deep tendon reflexes in the legs, such as knee jerks, are usually lost. Reflexes may also be absent in the arms. Because the signals traveling along the nerve are slow, a ''nerve conduction velocity test'' (NCV, which measures the nerve’s ability to send a signal) can provide clues to aid the diagnosis. There is a change in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain in people with GBS. Researchers have found the fluid contains more protein than usual but very few immune cells (measured by white blood cells). Therefore, a physician may decide to perform a spinal tap or ''lumbar puncture'' to obtain a sample of spinal fluid to analyze. In this procedure, a needle is inserted into the person’s lower back and a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn from the spinal cord. This procedure is usually safe, with rare complications.''Key diagnostic findings include:' Recent onset, within days to at most four weeks of symmetric weakness, usually starting in the legs Abnormal sensations such as pain, numbness, and tingling in the feet that accompany or even occur before weakness Absent or diminished deep tendon reflexes in weak limbs Elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein without elevated cell count. This may take up to 10 days from the onset of symptoms to develop. Abnormal nerve conduction velocity findings, such as slow signal conduction Sometimes, a recent viral infection or diarrhea."
How is Guillain-Barré syndrome treated?,"'There is no known cure for Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, some therapies can lessen the severity of the illness and shorten recovery time. There are also several ways to treat the complications of the disease.''Because of possible complications of muscle weakness, problems that can affect any paralyzed person (such as ''pneumonia'' or bed sores), and the need for sophisticated medical equipment, individuals with Guillain-Barré syndrome are usually admitted and treated in a hospital’s intensive care unit.''Acute care''There are currently two treatments commonly used to interrupt immune-related nerve damage. One is plasma exchange (PE, also called plasmapheresis); the other is high-dose immunoglobulin therapy (IVIg). Both treatments are equally effective if started within two weeks of the onset of GBS symptoms, but immunoglobulin is easier to administer. Using both treatments in the same person has no proven benefit.''In the process of plasma exchange, a ''plastic'' tube called a catheter is inserted into the person’s veins, through which some blood is removed. The blood cells from the liquid part of the blood (plasma) are extracted and returned to the person. This technique seems to reduce the severity and duration of the Guillain-Barré episode. Plasma contains antibodies and PE removes some plasma; PE may work by removing the bad antibodies that have been damaging the nerves.''Immunoglobulins are proteins that the immune system naturally makes to attack infecting organisms. IVIg therapy involves intravenous injections of these immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulins are developed from a pool of thousands of normal donors. When IVIg is given to people with GBS, the result can be a lessening of the immune attack on the nervous system. The IVIg can also shorten recovery time. Investigators believe this treatment also lowers the levels of effectiveness of antibodies that attack the nerves by both “diluting” them with non-specific antibodies and providing antibodies that bind to the harmful antibodies and take them out of commission.''Miller-Fisher syndrome is also treated with plasmapheresis and IVIg.''Anti-inflammatory steroid hormones called ''corticosteroids'' have also been tried to reduce the severity of Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, controlled ''clinical trials'' have demonstrated that this treatment is not effective.''Supportive care is very important to address the many complications of paralysis as the body recovers and damaged nerves begin to heal. Respiratory failure can occur in GBS, so close monitoring of a person’s breathing should be instituted initially. Sometimes a mechanical ventilator is used to help support or control breathing. The autonomic nervous system (that regulates the functions of internal organs and some of the muscles in the body) can also be disturbed, causing changes in heart rate, blood pressure, toileting, or ''sweating''. Therefore, the person should be put on a heart monitor or equipment that measures and tracks body function. Occasionally GBS-related nerve damage can lead to difficulty handling secretions in the mouth and throat. In addition to the person choking and/or ''drooling'', secretions can fall into the ''airway'' and cause ''pneumonia''.''Rehabilitative care''As individuals begin to improve, they are usually transferred from the acute care hospital to a rehabilitation setting. Here, they can regain strength, receive physical rehabilitation and other therapy to resume activities of daily living, and prepare to return to their pre-illness life.\xa0''Complications in GBS can affect several parts of the body. Often, even before recovery begins, caregivers may use several methods to prevent or treat complications. For example, a therapist may be instructed to manually move and position the person’s limbs to help keep the muscles flexible and prevent muscle shortening. Injections of blood thinners can help prevent dangerous ''blood clots'' from forming in leg veins. Inflatable cuffs may also be placed around the legs to provide intermittent compression. All or any of these methods help prevent blood stagnation and sludging (the buildup of ''red blood cells'' in veins, which could lead to reduced blood flow) in the leg veins. Muscle strength may not return uniformly; some muscles that get stronger faster may tend to take over a function that weaker muscles normally perform—called substitution. The therapist should select specific exercises to improve the strength of the weaker muscles so their original function can be regained.''Occupational and vocational therapy help individuals learn new ways to handle everyday functions that may be affected by the disease, as well as work demands and the need for assistive devices and other adaptive equipment and technology.'  "
What is the long-term outlook for those with Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"'Guillain-Barré syndrome can be a devastating disorder because of its sudden and rapid, unexpected onset of weakness—and usually actual paralysis. Fortunately, 70% of people with GBS eventually experience a full recovery. With careful intensive care and successful treatment of infection, autonomic dysfunction, and other medical complications, even those individuals with respiratory failure usually survive.''Typically, the point of greatest weakness occurs days to at most 4 weeks after the first symptoms occur. Symptoms then stabilize at this level for a period of days, weeks, or, sometimes months. Recovery, however, can be slow or incomplete. The recovery period may be as little as a few weeks up to a few years. Some individuals still report ongoing improvement after 2 years. About 30 percent of those with Guillain-Barré have a residual weakness after 3 years. About 3 percent may suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations many years after the initial attack. About 15 percent of individuals experience long-term weakness; some may require ongoing use of a walker, wheelchair, or ankle support. Muscle strength may not return uniformly.''Ongoing ''fatigue'', pain, and other annoying sensations can sometimes be troublesome. ''Fatigue'' is best handled by pacing activities and providing time for rest when ''fatigue'' sets in. Those with Guillain-Barré syndrome face not only physical difficulties, but emotionally painful periods as well. It is often extremely difficult for individuals to adjust to sudden paralysis and dependence on others for help with routine daily activities. Individuals sometimes need psychological counseling to help them adapt. Support groups can often ease the emotional strain and provide valuable information.' "
What research is being done on Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"'The mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) is to seek fundamental knowledge of the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological diseases. The NINDS conducts research on disorders including Guillain-Barré syndrome and funds research at major institutions and universities. The NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the leading supporter of biomedical research in the world.''Neuroscientists, immunologists, virologists, and pharmacologists are working collaboratively to learn how to prevent GBS and to make better therapies available when it strikes.''Scientists are concentrating on finding new treatments and refining existing ones. Scientists are also looking at the workings of the immune system to find which cells are responsible for beginning and carrying out the attack on the nervous system. The fact that many cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome begin after a viral or bacterial infection suggests that certain characteristics of some viruses and bacteria may activate the immune system inappropriately. Investigators are searching for those characteristics. Certain proteins or peptides in viruses and bacteria may be the same as those found in myelin, and the production of antibodies to neutralize the invading viruses or bacteria could trigger the attack on the myelin sheath.''Some studies show that normal variations in certain genes could increase the risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome; however, more research is necessary to identify and confirm associated genes. Since many of the genes that may increase the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome are involved in the immune system, their roles in fighting infection might contribute to the development of the condition.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0''NINDS-funded researchers have developed a mouse model with an altered autoimmune regulator gene that generates autoimmunity against the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Using this model, scientists hope to identify which PNS proteins are at the greatest risk of autoimmune attack and which components of the immune system contribute to the autoimmune response against the PNS. A greater understanding of how the immune system damages the PNS could lead to better treatments for autoimmune disorders such as GBS.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0''Other NINDS-funded researchers are investigating the mechanisms by which IVIg treatment lessens the symptoms of GBS. By understanding these mechanisms, it may be possible to develop more effective treatments.' "

What should I know about group B strep?," Group B Streptococcus (GBS) are bacteria found normally in the intestine, vagina, and rectum in about 25% of all healthy pregnant women. Group B strep infections can affect newborn babies and adults. Most pregnant women who are colonized by the bacteria have no symptoms. The infection can be spread to infants before or during birth. Signs and symptoms of GBS neonatal infection may include fever, breathing problems, seizures, lethargy, and poor feeding. Medical professionals diagnose GBS infection by isolating the organism from body fluids. A positive result means that a person is GBS-positive. The treatment for GBS infection is antibiotics. Complications of GBS infection include sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, or occasionally death. The prognosis for GBS infection depends on the patient's age and underlying medical conditions. In pregnant women, prevention of transmitting GBS infection is best achieved by routine screening for colonization with GBS."
What is group B strep?,"'Group B ''Streptococcus'' (GBS) is a type of gram-positive streptococcal bacteria also known as ''Streptococcus agalactiae''. This type of bacteria (not to be confused with ''group A strep'', which causes ''strep throat'') is commonly found in the ''human body'' (this is termed colonization), and it usually does not cause any symptoms. However, in certain cases, it can be a dangerous cause of various infections that can affect nonpregnant adults, pregnant women, and their newborn infants. In the United States, approximately 30,800 cases of invasive GBS disease occur annually across all age groups. Group B ''strep'' disease is the most common cause of neonatal ''sepsis'' and meningitis in the United States.''Group B streptococcal infection can also afflict nonpregnant adults with certain chronic medical conditions, such as ''diabetes'', ''cardiovascular disease'', ''obesity'', and ''cancer''. The incidence of group B streptococcal disease in adults increases with age, with the highest rate in adults 65 years of age and older (25 cases per 100,000). Although the incidence of neonatal group B ''strep'' infection has been decreasing, the incidence of GBS infection in nonpregnant adults has been increasing.'  "
What causes group B strep infection?,"'Group B strep bacteria can normally be found in about 25%-30% of all healthy pregnant women. Group B strep is commonly found in the intestine, vagina, and rectal area. Most women who are carriers of the bacteria (colonized) will not have any symptoms; however, under certain circumstances, perinatal group B strep infection of both the mother and/or the newborn can develop. In newborns, if the GBS infection develops in the first week of life, it is termed early onset disease. If the GBS infection develops from 1 week to 3 months of age, it is referred to as late onset disease. On average, approximately 1,000 babies in the United States develop early onset disease each year, with similar rates for late onset disease. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of early onset infections decreased from 1.7 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 0.22 cases per 1,000 births in 2016.' "
How do people get group B strep?,"'In newborns, group B ''Streptococcus'' infection is acquired through direct contact with the bacteria while in the uterus or during birth; thus, the gestational bacterial infection is transmitted from the colonized mother to her newborn. Approximately 50% of colonized mothers will pass the bacteria to their babies during ''pregnancy'' and vaginal birth. However, not all babies will be affected by the bacteria, and statistics show that about only one of every 200 babies born to a GBS-colonized mother will actually go on to develop GBS infection.''Group B strep infection is more common in African Americans than in whites. There are also maternal risk factors that increase the chance of transmitting group B ''Streptococcus'' to the newborn leading to early onset disease:''Late onset GBS infection occurs more commonly in babies who are born prematurely (<37 weeks) and in those babies whose mother tested positive for GBS during pregnancy.''Group B strep infection is not a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').' Labor or membrane rupture before 37 weeks gestation Membrane rupture more than 18 hours before delivery Urinary tract infection with GBS during pregnancy Previous baby with GBS infection Fever during labor Positive culture for GBS colonization at 35-37 weeks"
What are group B strep infection symptoms and signs?,"'In newborns with early onset GBS infection, the signs and symptoms usually develop within the first 24 hours after birth. Those babies who develop late onset GBS infection are often healthy and thriving, with the signs and symptoms of the disease developing after the first week of life. Signs and symptoms that may be observed with GBS infection in babies include''Adults who develop invasive GBS infection may develop''The exact source of group B streptococcal disease in nonpregnant adults is often not determined.'   fever, breathing problems/grunting sounds, bluish-colored skin (cyanosis), seizures, limpness or stiffness, heart rate and blood pressure abnormalities, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhea, and fussiness. bloodstream infection (sepsis), skin and soft-tissue infection, bone and joint infection, lung infection (pneumonia), urinary tract infection, and rarely, an infection of the fluid and lining tissues surrounding the brain (meningitis)."
What types of health care professionals treat group B strep infections?,"""Group B strep infections may be diagnosed and treated by different specialists, depending on the patient's age and the potential complications encountered by the patient. In pregnant women, a GBS infection may be diagnosed and treated during ""'labor'"" by the patient's obstetrician/gynecologist or by a family practitioner if they are delivering the baby. Babies who develop a GBS infection will be treated by a pediatrician or a neonatologist, and sometimes an infectious disease specialist may be involved. Nonpregnant adults who develop GBS infection will frequently be treated by their family physician, an internist, or an infectious disease specialist, and rarely by a general or orthopedic surgeon if a skin or bone infection requiring surgery is present."" "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose group B strep infection?,"""In newborns and in adults, isolation of the GBS bacteria is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Laboratory studies that isolate the organism from certain body fluids, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine, help establish the diagnosis. For screening of pregnant women, a health care professional will obtain a swab of a woman's vaginal and rectal area to screen for GBS infection at 35-37 weeks of gestation. Test results can take a few days. A ""'lumbar puncture'' (''spinal tap'') may need to be performed when meningitis is suspected. A health care professional may order imaging studies such as a ''chest X-ray'' to evaluate whether ''pneumonia'' is present.' "
What is the treatment for group B strep?,"'For women who test positive for GBS during pregnancy and for those with certain risk factors for developing or transmitting GBS infection during pregnancy, intravenous antibiotics are recommended at the time of ''labor''. The administration of antibiotics to women before labor who are known to be colonized with GBS is not effective in preventing early onset disease, as it has been found that the GBS bacteria can grow back quickly. Pregnant women with GBS isolated from the urine at any time during the pregnancy and those women who have had a previous infant with invasive GBS infection should receive antibiotics during labor, and thereby do not require the routine GBS screening at 35-37 weeks of gestation. Pregnant women who are not aware of their group B strep status should be given antibiotics during labor if they develop preterm labor (less than 37 weeks gestation), if they have membrane rupture for 18 hours or longer, or if they develop fever during labor. ''Penicillin'' or ''ampicillin'' are the recommended antibiotics, while individuals who are penicillin-''allergic'' may be given either cefazolin, ''clindamycin'', or ''vancomycin''. The administration of antibiotics has been shown to significantly decrease GBS early onset infection in newborns; however, it does not prevent late onset GBS infection. If a pregnant carrier of GBS receives intravenous antibiotics during delivery, her baby has a one in 4,000 chance of developing GBS infection. Without antibiotics, her baby has a one in 200 chance of developing GBS infection.''In neonates and nonpregnant adults who develop invasive group B streptococcal disease, intravenous antibiotics are also the mainstay of treatment. There are certain conditions associated with invasive GBS infection that may require surgical intervention, for example surgical debridement in certain patients with soft tissue/skin/bone infections.'  "
What are the complications of group B strep infection?,"'Invasive infection with GBS in babies may result in sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, or occasionally death. In some babies who survive, long-term sequelae of the disease include deafness, ''blindness'', or developmental disabilities.''In pregnant women, infection with GBS may cause ''urinary tract infection'', infection of the uterus and placenta, as well as preterm delivery, fetal death, or ''miscarriage''.''In nonpregnant adults with chronic medical conditions who develop invasive GBS infection, complications may include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis, skin and soft-tissue infection, bone and joint infection, and rarely meningitis.' "
What is the prognosis of a group B strep infection?,"""The prognosis of a GBS infection varies depending on various factors, including the patient's age and the presence of any underlying medical conditions. In the United States, the death rate (mortality rate) for babies with GBS infection is about 5%. Pregnant women who develop symptoms of GBS infection also have low mortality rates, as they tend to be otherwise healthy. Nonpregnant adults who develop invasive GBS infection tend to have higher mortality rates, ranging from 5%-47% depending on the study, as these\xa0patients tend to be older and they frequently have serious underlying medical conditions."" "
Is it possible to prevent group B strep infection?,"'At this point in time, the best measure for preventing GBS infection is through routine screening during pregnancy. This testing has served to decrease the overall number of early onset GBS infections in newborns by about 80% since aggressive preventive measures were instituted in the 1990s. In pregnant women, routine screening for colonization with GBS is strongly recommended. This screening test is performed between 35-37 weeks of gestation. The test involves using a sterile swab to collect a sample from both the vaginal and rectal areas, with results usually available within 24-72 hours.''Antibiotic administration during labor to pregnant women colonized with GBS and for those with the risk factors outlined above can help decrease the transmission of GBS infection, and thus decrease the incidence of early onset GBS disease in newborns.''Although there is currently no licensed ''vaccine'' available for the prevention of GBS infection, there is research under way to try to develop one for use in the future. Further information about GBS can be found at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/groupbstrep/index.html).' "

What is a genetic disease?,"'A genetic disease is any disease caused by an abnormality in the genetic ''makeup'' of an individual. The genetic abnormality can range from minuscule to major -- from a discrete mutation in a single base in the DNA of a single gene to a gross chromosomal abnormality involving the addition or subtraction of an entire chromosome or set of chromosomes. Some people inherit genetic disorders from the parents, while acquired changes or mutations in a preexisting gene or group of genes cause other genetic diseases. Genetic mutations can occur either randomly or due to some environmental exposure.'  "
What are the four types of genetic disorders (inherited)?,'There are a number of different types of genetic disorders (inherited) and include:' Single gene inheritance Multifactorial inheritance Chromosome abnormalities Mitochondrial inheritance
7 single gene inheritance disorders,"'Single gene inheritance is also called Mendelian or monogenetic inheritance. Changes or mutations that occur in the DNA sequence of a single gene cause this type of inheritance. There are thousands of known single-gene disorders. These disorders are known as monogenetic disorders (disorders of a single gene).''Single-gene disorders have different patterns of genetic inheritance, including''Some examples of single-gene disorders include' autosomal dominant inheritance, in which only one copy of a defective gene (from either parent) is necessary to cause the condition; autosomal recessive inheritance, in which two copies of a defective gene (one from each parent) are necessary to cause the condition; and X-linked inheritance, in which the defective gene is present on the female, or X-chromosome. X-linked inheritance may be dominant or recessive. cystic fibrosis, alpha- and beta-thalassemias, sickle cell anemia (sickle cell disease), Marfan syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, and hemochromatosis."
7 common multifactorial genetic inheritance disorders,"'Multifactorial inheritance is also called complex or polygenic inheritance. Multifactorial inheritance disorders are caused by a combination of environmental factors and mutations in multiple genes. For example, different genes that influence ''breast cancer'' susceptibility have been found on chromosomes 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 22. Some common chronic diseases are multifactorial disorders.''Examples of multifactorial inheritance include''Multifactorial inheritance also is associated with heritable traits such as fingerprint patterns, height, eye color, and skin color.'   heart disease, high blood pressure, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, diabetes, cancer, and obesity."
4 chromosomal abnormalities,"'Chromosomes, distinct structures made up of DNA and protein, are located in the nucleus of each cell. Because chromosomes are the carriers of the genetic material, abnormalities in chromosome number or structure can result in disease. Chromosomal abnormalities typically occur due to a problem with cell division.''For example, ''Down syndrome'' (sometimes referred to as ""'""Down's syndrome""'"") or ''trisomy 21'' is a common genetic disorder that occurs when a person has three copies of chromosome 21. There are many other chromosomal abnormalities including:''Diseases may also occur because of chromosomal translocation in which portions of two chromosomes are exchanged.' Turner syndrome (45,X0), Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY), and Cri du chat syndrome, or the ""cry of the cat"" syndrome (46, XX or XY, 5p-)."
3 mitochondrial genetic inheritance disorders,"'This type of genetic disorder is caused by mutations in the non-nuclear DNA of mitochondria. Mitochondria are small round or rod-like organelles that are involved in cellular ''respiration'' and found in the cytoplasm of plant and animal cells. Each mitochondrion may contain 5 to 10 circular pieces of DNA. Since egg cells, but not sperm cells, keep their mitochondria during ''fertilization'', mitochondrial DNA is always inherited from the female parent.''Examples of ''mitochondrial disease'' include' Leber's hereditary optic atrophy (LHON), an eye disease; myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF); and mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), a rare form of dementia."
What is the human genome?,"'The human genome is the entire ""treasury of human inheritance."" The sequence of the human genome obtained by the Human Genome Project, completed in April 2003, provides the first holistic view of our genetic heritage. The 46 human chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes) between them house almost 3 billion base pairs of DNA that contains about 20,500 protein-coding genes. The coding regions make up less than 5% of the genome (the function of all the remaining DNA is not clear) and some chromosomes have a higher density of genes than others.''Most genetic diseases are the direct result of a mutation in one gene. However, one of the most difficult problems ahead is to further elucidate how genes contribute to diseases that have a complex pattern of inheritance, such as in the cases of ''diabetes'', ''asthma'', ''cancer'', and ''mental illness'"". In all these cases, no one gene has the yes/no power to say whether a person will develop the disease or not. It is likely that more than one mutation is required before the disease is manifest, and a number of genes may each make a subtle contribution to a person's susceptibility to a disease; genes may also affect how a person reacts to environmental factors.""

Who should get genetic for breast cancer genes?,"'Ms. G. is a 40-year-old woman with two smallchildren. Like most women, she is concerned about her chances of developing ''breast cancer''. She asks her doctor about her risks. Although ''breast cancer'' is a worry for most women, Ms. G. is especially worried because of a family history of ''breast cancer''. Her mother and sister had breast cancers that were diagnosedat young ages.''A woman with a family history of breast ''cancer''has a lot of concerns. Among other things, she is thinking of her job, children,and husband, as well as how her medical insurance and health team will be ableto serve her needs in the future should she be diagnosed with breast ''cancer''.' "
How do you decide whether she should get genetic testing?,"'The whole issue of genetic testing for breastcancer is complicated. Recent research indicates that the information women seekmost often when they request genetic testing does not match what they canrealistically determine from this testing. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile toconsider the role of this testing and what it involves.''Certain characteristics make a woman at higherrisk for genetic breast cancer disorders. These factors include:''Ms. G. and her doctor determine that she falls within the group with higher risk factorsbecause her sister and mother both had breast cancer at young ages.'  family members with breast cancer, especially at a young age;  breast cancer
in a male family member; both breast and ovarian cancer in the family; 
	 bilateral breast cancer in a single family member; breast
cancer diagnosed at very young ages; and  being of Ashkenazi Jewish descent."
"Women at risk for a genetic breast cancer disorder must understand what the genetic testing 
process involves.","""First, an expert reviews the family medical history to evaluate what sort of pattern of genetic breast cancer may be occurring. Next, the family member's ""'tumor'"" sample, if available, undergoes testing. It is impossible to run tests to analyze every single gene in a woman. Therefore, the nature of the specific disorder is narrowed by testing of the specific tumor from an affected family member. The tests are designed to determine if any of the known inherited genetic breast cancer genes is present. If the defect is found on the tissue sample of the woman's relative, the lab will then know exactly which defect should be tested in the blood sample of the woman herself. In this way, a woman will be able to be counseled about her own risk. Counseling, education, and emotional support are provided both before and after any testing, no matter what the result.""'Prior to undergoing testing, it is essential that women consider the benefits and risks in light of the possible results. For example, if her testis positive (meaning she is affected by a ''genetic disorder'') there are measuresthat can reduce her breast cancer risk. One of these is having breast tissuesurgically removed, knows as prophylactic mastectomies. This is an unpleasant prospect for many women. Removal ofthe ovaries also appears to be helpful in reducing risk. ''Tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex'') and ''raloxifene'' (''Evista'') are two members of the class of ''drugs'' known as selective ''estrogen'' receptor modulators (SERMs) that have been shown in ''clinical trials'' to be effective in preventing breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease, but there are fewer data available on their effects in women who are BRCA mutation carriers. There have been no studies that show that tamoxifen actually prolongs survival in women at high risk for breast cancer, and rare but serious adverse events (''uterine cancer'', ''blood clots'') have been reported. Raloxifene has been tested and shown to be effective in preventing breast cancer in ''postmenopausal'' women but its effectiveness is unknown in younger women. There are no medications specifically approved for use in reducing the risk in women with genetic mutations (BRCA genes) that are known to increase susceptibility to breast cancer. ''While Ms. G. is considering these surgery options,she must also decide a variety of issues such as:''The Genetic Information Non Discrimination Control Act of 2008 and the ''Affordable Care Act'' of 2010 have lessened concerns about insurers taking away insurance based on genetic testing. If she does not desire to inform anyoneabout a positive test and would not consider having surgery, then perhaps shemay not want to be tested in the first place. On the other hand, what if thetest results for Ms. G. are negative? This may be a relief. However, there isalso the frustrating fact that even if a woman has a negative genetic test, sheis still at higher risk for breast cancer than the general population due to therisk factor of having multiple family members with breast cancer. Another possibility with genetic testing is that a non-typical alteration in a breast cancer-related gene is detected, the significance of which is unclear.' whom she would tell,  whether her own children should be tested, and  how her health insurance and/or job will be affected. "
"What about the many women who do not fit the pattern of a genetic breast cancer disorder? How 
worried should they be?","'Although most women who are surveyed think breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women,  ''heart disease'' is actually the leading cause of death in women. ''Heart disease'' kills one out of two women, farin excess of the number of deaths caused by breast cancer. Breast cancer occurs in nearly 240,000 women each year, but only about 40,000 die of it each year. It is important tokeep the perspective that most women who have only one family member with breast cancershould actually be more concerned with discussing heart ''disease prevention'' with theirphysicians than ''breast cancer prevention''.'""In conclusion, any woman in Ms. G.'s situation needs to talk to a doctor who is specially educated to counsel high-risk women regarding if and when they should be tested and how to act on the different test result scenarios -- all prior to testing. There is further counseling after testing, whether results are positive or negative. Research is progressing rapidly, with the results of new studies coming out all the time."" "
Breast Cancer and Genetic Testing Introduction,"'Intensive ''genetic counseling'' is required before undergoing genetic tests for ''breast cancer''. During this educational counseling session, the health care provider can fully explain the benefits and risks of genetic testing and answer any questions you may have.''You will also be required to sign a consent form prior to participating in any genetic tests. The form is an agreement between you and your doctor, showing that you have discussed the test and how its results might affect your family.''Here are some questions to consider when thinking about genetic testing:' Am I prepared to cope with the result? Are my family members also prepared, including my children and my spouse? What are my goals for testing? How would I use my test results? What will I do differently if the results are positive, or if they are negative? Whom will I share my results with? Would a positive test result change relationships with my family?"
What Happens During Genetic Testing?,"""Most importantly, you'll need to obtain a family pedigree to determine if there is a ""'cancer'' development pattern within your family. A family pedigree is a chart that shows the genetic ''makeup'"" of a person's ancestors, and is used to analyze ""'inherited'' characteristics or diseases within a family.''After outlining the family pedigree, a blood test can be given to determine if you have a ''breast cancer gene''. Keep in mind that the vast majority of ''breast cancer'' cases are not associated with a ''breast cancer'' gene. In addition, scientists do not know all of the genes that can cause breast ''cancer'', so doctors can only test you for the known genes.''When someone with a ''cancer'' diagnosis and a family history of the disease has been tested and found to have an altered ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' gene, the family is said to have a ""known mutation."" If an association between the development of breast cancer and a breast cancer gene is made, then all family members willing to participate in genetic testing are asked to give a sample of blood. For many people, knowing their test results is important, because this information may help to guide future health care decisions for themselves and their families.' "
How Do I Interpret the Genetic Test Results?,"'A negative genetic test means that a breast cancer gene mutation was not identified. If genetic testing has previously identified a mutation in your family, then a negative test means you do not carry the specific mutation that was identified in your family. Therefore, you would have the same risk as the general population. If a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has not been previously found in your family, a negative result should be interpreted cautiously.''In such cases, there is still a chance you are at an increased risk to develop breast cancer due to potential mutations in genes other than those we currently can test for.''A positive test result means that a mutation known to increase the risk of breast and ''ovarian cancer'' was identified. Knowing your cancer risk may help guide important health care decisions for you and your family.' "
Should I Be Tested for Genetic Mutations?,"'You may want to discuss genetic testing with your doctor if any of the following scenarios apply to you:' You have two or more blood relatives -- mother, sister, aunt, cousin, or daughter -- with premenopausal breast cancer or ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age. You have been diagnosed with breast cancer, especially if it was diagnosed before you reached menopause, you have a blood relative with breast or ovarian cancer, or if you cancer in both breasts. You have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and you have blood relatives who have had ovarian or breast cancer.  You are related to someone (male or female) who has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. You are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and you have blood relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer, or you have had breast or ovarian cancer."
"What Are my Options if I Have a ""Cancer Gene?""","'Women in high-risk categories (first-degree relative with breast cancer, personal history of breast cancer, prior abnormal ''breast biopsy'' results with atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular ''carcinoma in situ'') and carriers of the genes associated with breast cancer may want to consider starting regular breast ''cancer screening'' at age 25 or 10 years earlier than the age of the youngest person with breast cancer at the time of their diagnosis.''Some women choose preventive (prophylactic) ''mastectomy'"" to decrease the chances of developing breast cancer, although this doesn't offer complete protection.""'Another approach includes using the anti-estrogen drug ''tamoxifen'' or ''raloxifene'' (also known as ''Evista''), a drug used to treat ''osteoporosis'', to help prevent development of breast cancer.' "
What Are the Potential Problems With Genetic Testing?,"'Genetic testing is not 100% accurate. If a test is negative, a person still has a chance of developing breast cancer. If the test is positive, there is still a 15% to 20% chance of not developing breast cancer.''Genetic testing is costly, ranging from about $200 to more than $2,000, depending on the type of test. Insurance policies vary in providing coverage for genetic testing.'""The results of genetic tests won't be available for several weeks. The length of time it takes to get results depends on the tests performed and under what circumstances they are done.""'Genetic testing is highly controversial in society today, and legislation has been enacted to protect individuals who may have a genetic risk of developing cancer from employment and insurance problems. The best course of action a person can take is to become involved with an established genetic registry that can counsel individuals with a genetic risk for cancer.' "
What Are the Benefits of Genetic Testing?,"'For some women, the benefits of genetic testing include the ability to make informed medical and lifestyle decisions while reducing the ''anxiety'' of not knowing their genetic background. Another benefit is the ability to make a proactive decision regarding prophylactic surgery. In addition, many women are able to participate in medical research that may in the long run decrease their risk of death from breast cancer.' "
What About My Privacy?,"'The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 prevents insurance companies from denying health insurance based on genetic information, and prevents them from using genetic information to demonstrate that a health condition existed before application was made for insurance. In addition, many states have passed laws or have legislation pending to address insurance concerns.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is genital herpes?,"'Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by an infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of herpes.''However, both types of herpes simplex virus can infect the mouth or the genital areas, meaning that genital contact (oral sex) with a ''cold sore'' on the mouth can lead to genital herpes. Likewise, kissing someone with a ''cold'' sore can spread the herpes simplex virus infection.'""After the first outbreak of herpes, the virus travels through the nerves and resides in nerve tissue within the body. Reactivations, or repeat occurrences of the blisters, can occur throughout an individual's lifetime. Among people aged 14 to 49, an estimated one out of every six people have the infection.""'Genital herpes is not the same thing as ''genital warts''. ''Genital warts'' are flesh-colored growths that appear on the sexually exposed areas due to infection with certain types of ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'').' HSV-1 is most commonly associated with blisters and ulcers around the mouth known as cold sores (oral herpes). HSV-2 is associated with blistering lesions in genital areas that are exposed during sexual contact."
How common is genital herpes?," Herpes is very common. Among people aged 14 to 49, an estimated one out of every six people (15.5% of the population) have been infected with HSV-2, the virus that is predominantly responsible for genital herpes. Estimates suggest that in the U.S., 776,000 people become infected every year. The viral infection is more common in women than in men. Spread from men to women is known to occur more readily than from women to men. According to WHO estimates, HSV-1 infects 67% of all humans under the age of 50. The majority of infected people are not aware they are infected."
What are genital herpes symptoms and signs?,"'Many people infected with genital herpes have mild symptoms or symptoms that are mistaken for another condition. It also is possible to be infected with the virus and have no herpes symptoms. Not every woman who is infected may be aware of the infection.''When signs and symptoms are present, they consist of:''With the first outbreak of genital herpes, a person may also experience ''flu-like symptoms'' including:''Immediately prior to an outbreak, there may be an ''itching'', burning, or tingling sensation of the skin.''In women, genital herpes usually causes blistering lesions on the vulva and around the vaginal opening that progress to ulcer formation. The infection spreads to involve the cervix in most cases, leading to cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix). In some women, cervicitis may be the only sign of genital herpes infection. Infection and inflammation of the urethra accompanies the infection in some women, leading to ''pain'' on urination.''After the initial infection, a person may or may not have outbreaks later in life.'  Typically painful fluid-filled blisters (that may appear like ""pimples"") around the vaginal area Blisters around the vagina, anus, or buttocks Ulcer formation after the blisters break open Blisters take 2 to 4 weeks to heal.

What causes genital herpes? How does it spread?,"'The herpes ''viruses'' enter the skin or mucous membrane through tiny, even microscopic, breaks in the tissue when there is skin-to-skin contact with an infected person. Because an infected person may spread the disease even when he or she does not have signs or ''symptoms of herpes'', avoiding sexual contact with someone with active blisters does not guarantee protection against the infection. Even normal appearing skin can spread the infection. Clothing that touches genital skin ulcers may transmit herpes simplex virus to others that wear the clothing.''The average incubation period (time until symptoms develop) after exposure is 4 days, but symptoms may develop anywhere from 2 to 12 days after you have been exposed to the virus.''Individual outbreaks of herpes vary among affected people in terms of their frequency and severity. Outbreaks can be related to the function of the immune system and are typically worse in cases in which the immune system is suppressed. For example, at times of physical or emotional ''stress'', during illness, or when taking certain medications, genital herpes outbreaks may be more likely.' "
How do you get genital herpes (transmission)?, Herpes simplex virus infection is transmitted by direct person-to-person contact. Genital herpes is acquired through sexual contact of any type that involves contact with the genital areas. Genital herpes also can be caused by mouth to genital contact (oral sex) with a person who has cold sores or herpes infection of the mouth. Transmission of herpes from an infected male to a female partner is more likely than transmission from an infected woman to a male partner.
Is there a cure for genital herpes?,"""There is no cure for genital herpes, and once a person is infected with genital herpes, the infection persists throughout the individual's life, with the potential for recurrent outbreaks. However, there are medications that can reduce the severity and frequency of outbreaks and treatments to manage the symptoms."" "
How do health care providers diagnose genital herpes?,"'In most cases in which the characteristic signs and symptoms are present, they are sufficient to establish a diagnosis of genital herpes infection. Laboratory tests, such as viral culture and nucleic acid amplification (''polymerase chain reaction'' or ''PCR'') tests to detect the genetic material of the virus, are also available.''Immunologic tests to identify antibodies to genital herpes are other possible tests to establish whether infection has occurred.' "
What are medications and treatment options for genital herpes?,"'Antiviral medicines are available that can help manage the severity and duration of outbreaks, if taken immediately prior to (when there are tingling or unusual skin sensations but no blisters) or within 24 hours of a herpes outbreak. The medications typically used are''These are all typically taken by mouth. In severe cases of viral infection, antiviral medications may be given intravenously, but this is not usually needed for herpes. Topical medications that are applied directly to the herpes sores are also available, but these are less effective than oral medications and are not generally used.''All of these medications may also be given daily as suppressive therapy to decrease the number of outbreaks in people who have frequent herpes outbreaks (more than six outbreaks per year).'

How do doctors manage genital herpes during pregnancy?,"'Oral antiviral medications as described above may be used during pregnancy. One serious concern with genital herpes in pregnancy is transmission of the infection to the baby during delivery. In an infant, genital herpes infection can spread through the bloodstream and have serious consequences. Cesarean delivery (''C-section'') is performed for women who go into ''labor'' while there is an active outbreak of genital herpes in order to prevent infection of the baby during birth.''The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes be offered oral antiviral medication at or beyond 36 weeks until delivery in order to increase the chances of being able to deliver vaginally.' "
Are home remedies or natural treatments effective for genital herpes?,"'There are no home or natural remedies available for genital herpes, and as mentioned above, the infection cannot be cured. Home cares such as warm baths, keeping the blisters dry after washing, and wearing loose-fitting, cotton underwear may help soothe symptoms.' "
"What is the prognosis for 
a person with genital herpes?","'As discussed previously, there is no cure for genital herpes infection, and the infection persists for life. People vary in the number and severity of outbreaks they experience. For those with frequent outbreaks, taking antiviral medications as suppressive therapy can decrease the frequency of outbreaks.' "
What kind of doctors treat genital herpes?,"'Genital herpes is treated by primary care providers including internal medicine and family medicine specialists, as well as pediatricians for adolescents. For women, gynecologists are often the treating physicians. In certain circumstances, other specialists may be consulted, including urologists and infectious disease specialists.' "
Is there a link between genital herpes and HIV?,"'The ''HIV'' virus that causes ''AIDS'' is not the same as the genital herpes virus. However, having the ulcers and sores of herpes makes it more likely to contract ''HIV'' if exposed, or to transmit ''HIV'' if you have been infected. The ulcers of genital herpes cause breaks in the skin that make spreading the HIV virus to a sex partner more likely during sexual contact.' "
Is it possible to prevent genital herpes?," Herpes can be spread both during an outbreak and by infected people even when there is no outbreak of the condition, so prevention can be difficult. While condoms may help prevent the spread of genital herpes to sexual partners during sexual activity, the infection also can be spread from skin contact in areas not covered by a condom, or during oral to genital contact. If you are having an outbreak, thorough hand washing and not sharing clothing that has touched the herpes sores can also help prevent transmitting the virus to others."
Genital Herpes: Common but Misunderstood,"'Genital herpes'' and ''cold sores'' (''oral herpes'') are the names given to two types of infection caused by the two types of ''herpes'' simplex virus (HSV): HSV-1 and HSV-2.''HSV-1 (oral herpes) most commonly affects the oral regions (around the mouth, on the lips, face, and tongue) and results in sores (referred to as ''cold sores'') or ''blisters'' in these regions. HSV-2 (genital herpes) most commonly forms ulcers on the penis, scrotum, anus, and the buttocks.''Clearing the myths by creating awareness regarding the true facts of herpes is crucial to help its further spread. Here are some widespread myths or misconceptions and the associated facts about genital herpes and ''cold sores''.''Myth 1:'' You can know if your partner has herpes by its symptoms.''Fact:'' Around eight of 10 people, who get the herpes simplex ''viruses'' (HSV), do not develop any signs or symptoms. The virus can remain dormant in the body and fail to show any symptoms until the person’s immunity becomes weak.''Myth 2:'' A person who has no symptoms is not infectious.''Fact:'' People with herpes may transmit infections via saliva, genital secretions, or sores. The person may or may not have a sore, but the infection is still possible. A study has shown that even without the sores; 10% of the time, carriers of the herpes virus are infectious. The infection may occur via oral contact, genital contact, or even skin to skin contact.''Myth 3:'' Genital herpes can spread only when you ''sleep'' around with people or have penetrating sex.''Fact:'' Though genital herpes spreads most commonly through sex or even through genital-genital contact, it can also spread when a person has oral sex with an infected person.''Myth 4:'' Only certain people can get herpes.''Fact:'' Anyone who is sexually active is at risk of catching the herpes virus. This is because herpes is mainly transmitted sexually, and many people around are asymptomatic carriers, so you never know from whom you can get the infection.''Myth 5: ''Genital herpes is uncommon and there are fewer chances that you will get it.''Fact:'' It is estimated that, globally, over half a billion people between the ages of 15-49 years have genital herpes infection.''The herpes virus is the most common cause of genital ulcers in the United States. At least one out of every six people aged between 14 to 49 years are affected with genital herpes.''Myth 6: ''Condoms'' are a sure way to protect against genital herpes.''Fact: ''Doctors always recommend wearing a ''condom'' for protection against ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STD''), such as herpes. Using condoms can reduce your risk of getting herpes, but it is not 100% effective in preventing the infection. This is because the virus can also be present on the noninfectious part of the penis, which the condom cannot cover.''Myth 7:'' Herpes can be transmitted through blood.''Fact:'' Herpes is not present in the blood and only its antibodies can be detected from the blood, which can help confirm if the person had a prior active herpes infection. It cannot be passed via blood and people with genital herpes can still donate blood. Only skin to skin contact is essential for the spread of genital herpes, which can be both orally and genitally.''Myth 8:'' If you have genital herpes, you cannot have children.''Fact:'' Herpes does not affect the childbearing capacity in either of the two sexes. There is a slight chance that the ''pregnant'' lady can pass the herpes virus to her baby during delivery. However, some prescription medicines from a doctor can help prevent the mother to baby virus transmission.''Myth 9:'' Herpes can cause ''cervical cancer''.''Fact:'' There are neither any reports nor any evidence that suggests that the herpes virus can cause ''cancer''. The virus that causes ''genital warts'', ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV''), is known to increase the risk of ''cervical cancer'' amongst women.''Myth 10: ''Herpes is a deadly disease.''Fact:'' It is not a life-threatening condition, but herpes is a lifelong infection that has no cure. It is associated with a few outbreaks that occur when the person’s immunity is weak. People only need to manage the discomfort of the sores by taking antiviral medications.' "

How do doctors manage genital herpes during pregnancy?,"'Oral antiviral medications as described above may be used during pregnancy. One serious concern with genital herpes in pregnancy is transmission of the infection to the baby during delivery. In an infant, genital herpes infection can spread through the bloodstream and have serious consequences. Cesarean delivery (''C-section'') is performed for women who go into ''labor'' while there is an active outbreak of genital herpes in order to prevent infection of the baby during birth.''The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes be offered oral antiviral medication at or beyond 36 weeks until delivery in order to increase the chances of being able to deliver vaginally.' "
Are home remedies or natural treatments effective for genital herpes?,"'There are no home or natural remedies available for genital herpes, and as mentioned above, the infection cannot be cured. Home cares such as warm baths, keeping the blisters dry after washing, and wearing loose-fitting, cotton underwear may help soothe symptoms.' "
"What is the prognosis for 
a person with genital herpes?","'As discussed previously, there is no cure for genital herpes infection, and the infection persists for life. People vary in the number and severity of outbreaks they experience. For those with frequent outbreaks, taking antiviral medications as suppressive therapy can decrease the frequency of outbreaks.' "
What kind of doctors treat genital herpes?,"'Genital herpes is treated by primary care providers including internal medicine and family medicine specialists, as well as pediatricians for adolescents. For women, gynecologists are often the treating physicians. In certain circumstances, other specialists may be consulted, including urologists and infectious disease specialists.' "
Is there a link between genital herpes and HIV?,"'The ''HIV'' virus that causes ''AIDS'' is not the same as the genital herpes virus. However, having the ulcers and sores of herpes makes it more likely to contract ''HIV'' if exposed, or to transmit ''HIV'' if you have been infected. The ulcers of genital herpes cause breaks in the skin that make spreading the HIV virus to a sex partner more likely during sexual contact.' "
Is it possible to prevent genital herpes?," Herpes can be spread both during an outbreak and by infected people even when there is no outbreak of the condition, so prevention can be difficult. While condoms may help prevent the spread of genital herpes to sexual partners during sexual activity, the infection also can be spread from skin contact in areas not covered by a condom, or during oral to genital contact. If you are having an outbreak, thorough hand washing and not sharing clothing that has touched the herpes sores can also help prevent transmitting the virus to others."
HPV Virus (Genital Warts ) in Men Introduction,"'Much of the information about ''HPV'' virus (human papillomavirus) centers on women, since having the virus increases their risk of getting ''cervical cancer''. But ''HPV'"" virus in men can cause health problems, too. So it's important for men to understand how to reduce the risks of HPV infection.""""It can increase a man's risk of getting genital ""'cancers'', although these cancers are not common. HPV can also cause ''genital warts'' in men, just as in women. ''More than half of men who are sexually active in the United States will have HPV at some time in their life. Often, a man will clear the virus on his own, with no health problems. ' "
Risks of HPV Virus in Men,"'Some of the 30 or so types of HPV associated with genital cancers can lead to ''cancer of the anus'' or penis in men. Both of these ''cancer'' types are rare. In those with a healthy immune system, they are even rarer. About 1,530 men in the U.S. were diagnosed with ''cancer of the penis'' in 2006, according to American ''Cancer'' Society estimates. About 1,910 men got a diagnosis of ''anal cancer''. ''The risk of ''anal cancer'' is about 17 times higher in sexually active gay and bisexual men than in men who have sex only with women. Men who have ''HIV'' (human immunodeficiency virus) are also at higher risk of getting this ''cancer''. ''Other types of HPV virus rarely cause cancer in men, but they do cause ''genital warts''. At a given point in time, about 1% of sexually active men in the U.S. will have genital ''warts''. ' "
Male HPV: The Symptoms,'The types of high-risk HPV that can cause cancer rarely present any symptoms in men or in women. Genital ''warts'' are the first symptom you may see with low-risk HPV ''strains'' that cause warts but not cancer.' 
Tests for HPV Virus in Men,"""To diagnose genital warts in men, the doctor will visually check a man's genital area to see if warts are present. Some doctors will apply a vinegar solution to help identify warts that aren't raised and visible. But the test is not foolproof. Sometimes normal skin is mistakenly identified as a wart. ""'There is no routine test for men to check for high-risk HPV strains that can cause cancer. However, some doctors are urging anal Pap tests for gay and bisexual men, who are at higher risk of anal cancer caused by HPV. In an anal ''Pap test'', the doctor collects cells from the anus, and then has them checked for abnormalities in a lab. ' "
Treatments for HPV,"'There is no treatment for asymptomatic HPV infection. Instead, doctors treat the health problems that are caused by the HPV virus.''When genital warts appear, a variety of treatments can be used. The patient can apply prescription creams at home. Or a doctor can surgically remove or freeze off the warts. ''Early treatment of warts is discouraged by some doctors because genital warts can go away on their own. It can also take time for all warts to appear. So a person who treats warts as soon as they appear may need another treatment later on. ''Anal cancer can be treated with ''radiation'', ''chemotherapy'', and surgery. The specific treatments depend on the stage of cancer - how big the ''tumor'' is and how far the cancer has spread. ' "
HPV Vaccine for Men?,"'The ''HPV vaccine'' ''Gardasil'', approved for use in women in 2006, is not yet approved for men. ''Studies are still being done to determine if the ''vaccine'' works in males. Eventually, public health experts say, boys and men may be vaccinated. ' "
How to Manage HPV in a Relationship,"""If a man's long-term sexual partner has HPV, chances are good HPV transmission has already occurred and he also has it. HPV in men may clear from the body more easily than in women. Women, in general, often clear the virus in two years or less. ""'The HPV types associated with ''cervical cancer'' usually do not cause health problems for a heterosexual man having sex with an HPV-infected woman. ''If a partner has HPV, it does not necessarily mean they have had sex with someone else recently. The virus can lay dormant in the body for years without causing noticeable symptoms. ' "
How to Prevent Transmission of HPV,"'Abstinence is the only sure way to prevent HPV transmission. Risk of transmission can be lowered if a person has sex only with one person who is not infected and who is monogamous. ''To lower the risk of HPV transmission, men can also limit the number of sex partners and pick partners who have had few or no partners in the past. ''Condoms'"" can provide some protection against HPV transmission. But they aren't 100% effective, since HPV is transmitted primarily by skin-to-skin contact. The virus can still infect the skin uncovered by the ""'condom''. ''In a recent study of young women who had just become sexually active, those whose partners used a condom each time they had sex were 70% less likely to get an HPV infection than were women whose partners used a condom less than 5% of the time.''WebMD Medical Reference''SOURCES: Joel Palefsky, MD, professor of medicine, University of California, San Francisco.

What are genital warts (HPV infection)? Who gets them?,"'HPV infection (genital warts) is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD, ''sexually transmitted infection'', ''STI'') in the U.S. About 75% of the men and women of reproductive age has been infected with sexually transmitted genital warts at some point. Approximately 6 million people become infected with HPV every year in the US, and approximately 50% of those infected are between the ages of 15 and 25.'""HPV infection is common and does not usually lead to the development of warts, cancers, or even symptoms. In fact, the majority of people infected with HPV have no symptoms or lesions at all. Determination of whether or not a person is infected with HPV involves tests that identify the genetic material (DNA) of the virus. Moreover, it has not been definitely established whether the body's immune system is able to permanently clear the body of an HPV infection. Many people will test positive for HPV infection, and then have negative HPV tests for months to years, only to have a positive test result later. Currently, it is unclear if this is due to a latent (continuing but hidden) viral infection or if the person has become re-infected with the virus.""'Asymptomatic people infected with HPVs (those without HPV-induced warts or lesions) are still able to spread the infections to others through sexual contact.''It is important to note that in the U.S. and other developed countries, screening and early treatment of precancerous changes of the cervix have dramatically reduced the incidence of ''cervical cancer''. In developing countries lacking the medical infrastructure or financial means to implement a screening program, the incidence of cervical ''cancer'' resulting from HPV infection is much higher. In fact, cervical ''cancer'' develops in around 500,000 women each year worldwide, and, in many countries, it is the most common cause of cancer deaths.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of genital warts in women?,"'Women who have genital warts inside the vagina may experience symptoms such as bleeding following sexual intercourse or an abnormal ''vaginal discharge''. Rarely, bleeding or urinary obstruction may occur if the wart involves the urethral opening.'  Genital warts appear as raised, flesh-colored lumps or bumps. They may have a corrugated (cauliflower-like) appearance. Many women with genital warts have no symptoms, but sometimes they may occur at the location of the warts, and include:ItchingBurningTenderness Itching Burning Tenderness Size of the warts may vary, and multiple warts may be present at the same time. They may appear anywhere on body surfaces that are exposed in sexual contact, including the vulva, vagina, cervix, or groin in women and the penis, scrotum, thigh, or groin in males."
Are genital warts painful?,"'Usually, genital warts are not painful, although they may be associated with itching, tenderness or burning at the site of the wart.' "
What is the incubation period for genital warts?,"'The time between exposure or infection with HPV and the development of genital warts is very variable. Because most people who have the infection do not have any symptoms and do not develop warts, it is not possible to determine when the warts will arise after infection. Warts may appear days, months, or even years after the infection has been aquired.' "
How do you get genital warts (HPV infection) and What Are HPV Types?," Over 100 types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect humans. Of these, more than 40 types can infect the genital tract and anus (anogenital tract) of men and women. Sometimes, they cause genital lesions known as condylomata acuminata or venereal warts. A subgroup of the HPVs that infect the anogenital tract can lead to precancerous changes in the uterine cervix and cervical cancer. HPV infection is also associated with the development of other anogenital cancers. The HPV types that cause cervical cancer have been linked with both anal and penile cancer in men as well as a subgroup of head and neck (oropharyngeal) cancers in both women and men. Genital warts and HPV infection are transmitted primarily by sexual intimacy, and the risk of infection increases as the number of sexual partner's increases. The most common HPV types that infect the anogenital tract are HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), although other HPV types can also cause infection. Among these, HPV-6 and HPV-11 are most commonly associated with benign lesions such as genital warts are termed ""low-risk"" HPV types. In contrast, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the types found most commonly in cervical and anogenital cancers as well as severe dysplasia of the cervix. These belong to the so-called ""high-risk"" group of HPVs. Other HPV types infect the skin and cause common warts elsewhere on the body. Some types of HPVs (for example, HPV 5 and 8) frequently cause skin cancers in people who have a condition known as epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). The HPV infection is spread through skin-to-skin contact including sexual intercouse."
Is there a vaccine for genital warts and HPV infection?,"'A ''vaccine'' is available against common HPV types associated with the development of genital warts and cervical and anogenital carcinomas.' This vaccine (Gardasil 9) has received FDA approval for use in females and males aged 9 through 45. It confers immunity against 9 HPV types: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. An earlier version of this vaccine (Gardasil) was directed at four common HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18). Another vaccine directed at HPV types 16 and 18, known as Cervarix, was approved for use in females aged 10 to 15, but was withdrawn from the market in 2016 due to low demand."
Is there a treatment or cure for genital warts? Can they be removed or cured?,"'No treatment will cure genital warts or HPV infection. The only treatment is to remove the lesions caused by the virus. Unfortunately, even removal of the warts does not necessarily prevent the spread of the virus, and genital warts frequently recur. None of the available treatment options is ideal or clearly superior to others.''Available treatments for genital warts lesions, signs, and symptoms include:'  A 0.5% solution or gel of podofilox (Condylox). Alternatively, a 5% cream of imiquimod (Aldara), which is a substance that stimulates the body's production of cytokines, chemicals that direct and strengthen the immune response). Only an experienced doctor can perform some of the treatments for genital warts. These include, for example, placing a small amount of a 10% to 25% solution of podophyllin resin on the lesions, and then, after a period of hours, washing off the podophyllin. The treatments are repeated weekly until the genital warts are gone. An 80% to 90% solution of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloracetic acid (BCA) can also be applied weekly by a doctor to the lesions. Injection of 5-flurouracil epinephrine gel into the lesions has also been shown to be effective in treating genital warts. Interferon alpha, a substance that stimulates the body's immune response, has also been used in the treatment of genital warts. Alternative methods include cryotherapy (freezing the genital warts with liquid nitrogen) or laser surgery. Laser surgery and surgical excision both require a local or general anesthetic, depending upon the extent of the lesions. It is important to note that you should not use home remedies or treatments for common skin warts on genital warts."
What happens if genital warts aren't treated?," In some people, genital warts may go away in their own within months to a few years. In other cases they may persist if not removed and may grow larger and form clusters. Even removal is not a guarantee that the warts will not return at some point."
What if a woman has precancerous changes (dysplasia) of the cervix? Can genital warts cause cancer?,"'Women who have evidence of moderate or severe precancerous changes in the uterine cervix require treatment to ensure that these cells do not progress to cancer. In this case, treatment usually involves surgical removal or destruction of the involved tissue.' Conization is a procedure that removes the precancerous area of the cervix using a knife, a laser, or by a procedure known as LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure, which uses an electric current passing through a thin wire that acts as a knife). LEEP is also referred to as LLETZ (large loop excision of the transformation zone). Cryotherapy (freezing) or laser therapy may also be used to destroy tissue areas that contain potentially precancerous changes."
Will birth control protect against genital warts or HPV infection?," Abstinence from sexual activity can prevent the spread of HPVs that are transmitted via sexual contact. A person who abstains from sex may still become infected with other HPV types, such as those that cause common skin warts. Some researchers have postulated that HPV infection might be transmitted from the mother to her infant at the time of delivery because some studies have identified genital HPV infection in populations of young children and cloistered nuns. Hand-genital and oral-genital transmission of HPV has also been documented and is another means of transmission. HPV usually is transmitted by direct genital contact during sexual activity. The virus is not found in or spread by bodily fluids, and HPV is not found in blood or organs harvested for transplantation. Condom use seems to decrease the risk of transmission of HPV during sexual activity, but it does not completely prevent HPV infection. Spermicides and hormonal birth control methods cannot prevent the spread of HPV infection."
What do you do if you have been exposed to genital warts (HPV infection)?,"'Both people with HPV infection and their partners need to be counseled about the risk of spreading HPV and the appearance of the lesions. They should understand that the absence of lesions does not exclude the possibility of transmission and that condoms are not completely effective in preventing the spread of the infection. It is important to note that it is not known whether treatment decreases infectivity.'""Finally, female partners of men with genital warts should be reminded of the importance of regular Pap smears to screen for cervical cancer and precancerous changes in the cervix, as precancerous changes can be treated and reduce a woman's risk of developing cervical cancer. Similarly, men should be informed of the potential risk of anal cancers, although it is not yet been determined how to optimally screen for or manage early ""'anal cancer''.' "
Is there a test to diagnose genital warts?,"'HPV sometimes can be suspected by changes that appear on a ''Pap smear'', since pap smears identify infected abnormal cells that may be precursors to cancer. HPV infection can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix that are recognized on a Pap smear. If a woman has an abnormal Pap smear, more advanced tests may be performed. HPV also can be seen on biopsy (for example, from a ''genital wart'' or from the uterine cervix).' "
Is there a DNA test for types of HPV infection?," In 2009, the U.S. FDA approved the first DNA tests for diagnosis of the common cancer-causing HPV types in cervical samples. Two tests known as Cervista HPV 16/18 and Cervista HPV HR, are used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the two most common HPV types associated with cancer. These are HPV types 16 and 18, as well as other ""high risk"" or cancer-associated HPV types. These tests do not replace standard Pap testing or clinical examination, and they are used in combination with traditional screening methods to help estimate a woman's risk and aid in management decisions."

What are GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and GER (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants and children?,"'Gastroesophogeal reflux (GER) is the upward flow of stomach contents from the stomach into the esophagus (""swallowing tube""). While not required by its definition, these contents may continue from the esophagus into the pharynx (throat) and may be expelled from the mouth, and in infants, through the nostrils.''Gastroesophogeal reflux is different from ''vomiting'' because usually it is not associated with a violent ejection. Moreover, GER is generally a singular event in time, whereas the ''vomiting'' process is commonly several back-to-back events that may ultimately completely empty all stomach contents and yet still persist (""dry heaves""). The difference between GER and GERD (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'') is a matter of severity and associated consequences to the patient.''The large majority of healthy, full term infants will have episodes of ""''spitting up''"" or ""''wet burps'',"" which technically qualify to be considered gastroesophogeal reflux. These infants generally do not seem in distress before, during, or after by the reflux process. Likewise, the loss of calories as an outcome of GER is inconsequential since growth parameters including weight gain are not affected. Lastly, there seem to be no short or long-term consequences of these reflux experiences. In short, infants with GER are ""''messy spitters''.""''GERD implies a much different condition. Infants and children with GERD often experience distress because of their reflux even if the refluxed stomach contents are not completely ejected from the mouth. Infants and young children may lose so many calories by expulsion that growth is compromised. Some infants or children with GERD may even become averse to feeding due to repeated associations with feeding and ''pain''. Finally, there are a number of short and long term consequences of GERD that are not associated with infants and children with GER.'  "
What are the symptoms of GER and GERD in infants and children?,"'Infants with GER generally have no symptoms other than the obvious reflux of fluid out the mouth. As mentioned previously, they do not appear to have any discomfort associated with their reflux.''Infants and children with GERD may have multiple symptoms including:'   frequent fussiness during feeding or thereafter, frequent or recurrent cough, especially when lying down or asleep, recurrent rejection of the breast or bottle which may lead to poor weight gain, wheezing, especially when lying down or asleep, recurrent pneumonia, and descriptions of ""heartburn,"" ""chest pain,"" or upper midline abdominal pain. Older children may have a bitter taste (similar to that associated with vomiting) in their mouth during reflex episodes"
What causes GER and GERD in infants and children?,"'Infants with gastroesophogeal reflux reflect the immaturity their nervous system. In most infants the junction between the esophagus and stomach is ""closed,"" opening only to allow passage of formula or breast milk into the stomach or to allow the escape of swallowed air via burping.''During episodes of reflux, this junction is continuously open allowing a backwards flow of stomach contents into the esophagus. This reverse flow may occur as a consequence of a relatively large volume of fluid relative to a smaller stomach volume, pressure on the abdominal cavity (for example, placed face down [prone] following a feeding), or overfeeding. Infant GER occurs in over 50% of healthy infants with a peak incidence (65%) at approximately 4 months of age. Most episodes resolve by 12 months of age. GER may occur in both ''breastfed'' and/or formula fed infants. Several studies document that breast fed infants empty their stomach faster than formula fed infants and are thus less likely to experience GER symptoms.''Gastroesophogeal reflux disease also reflects a relaxation of the esophageal-stomach junction similar to infant GER. Factors that may contribute to GERD in infants and children include:' Increased pressure on the abdomen (over eating, obesity, straining with stool due to constipation, etc.). Slower than normal emptying of stomach contents may predispose infants or children to GERD. Certain medications, foods, and beverages may also be implicated in facilitating such pathological reflux. Cured meats (salami, pepperoni) and carbonated and caffeinated drinks may aggravate GERD symptoms. Recent studies indicate that between 2% to 8 % of children 3 to 17 years of age experience GERD symptoms (detailed later)."
How are GER and GERD in infants and children diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of GER is based upon characteristic historical facts reported by the infant's parents coupled with an elimination of pathological conditions by a normal physical exam. It is very rare to need laboratory studies to establish or support the diagnosis. Part of the evaluation of an infant who may have GER is to rule out pyloric stenosis. Pyloric stenosis is the thickening of the region of the stomach (pyloris) as it transitions into the first section of the small intestine. Studies show that most infants with pyloric stenosis have recurrent symptoms of forceful emesis shortly after a meal. The child is generally content until just before vomiting. There is a genetic predisposition favoring the first-born male. Diagnostic evaluation includes abdominal ""'ultrasound'' or ''barium swallow'' (see below). A surgical procedure provides a cure of the condition.''Pediatricians diagnosis GERD in infants and children by taking a thorough history supported by a complete physical examination enabling the elimination of other conditions that might cause similar symptoms. While rare, studies may be necessary either to establish/support the diagnosis of GERD or to determine the extent of damage caused by the repeated reflux events.''These studies may include:' Barium swallow/upper GI series: This X-ray study involves drinking a material (barium) that allows visualization of the act of swallowing from mouth into the stomach by the propulsive motions of the esophagus and then emptying of the barium from the stomach into the upper part of the intestinal tract. This test is designed to confirm normal anatomy and function of the areas studies. pH probe studies: This test involves passage of a thin, flexible tube through the nose and into the lower regions of the esophagus. The goal is to document the frequency of reflux of stomach acid contents over a prolonged period (usually 24 hours). Endoscopy: Performed by a pediatric gastroenterologist, this procedure involves the passage of an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a light source and camera at the leading end) from the throat, through the esophagus and into the stomach. Any damage that is caused by GERD because of stomach acid erosion can be seen through the scope. Erosion caused by refluxed stomach acid (esophagitis) is a characteristic finding. Gastric emptying study: This study involves drinking a mildly radioactive dye and monitoring the speed of passage from the stomach into the upper intestinal tract. Delay in emptying of stomach contents may predispose and aggravate GERD symptoms."
How are GER and GERD treated in infants and children?,"'Rarely, an infant with GER\xa0 generates substantial discomfort, demonstrate aversion to feeding, or show suboptimal weight gain. Conversely, toddlers and older children may experience more substantial symptoms, and thus may need a trial of lifestyle modifications including:''There are several groups of medications that may need to be considered in certain cases of infant GER (rare) or toddler/childhood GERD. These include:''The use of these medications follows a stepwise approach (from #1 to #4) based upon severity of symptoms. Consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist may be helpful for patients whose response to the above approach is disappointing.''There are very cases where children whose GERD is so severe that a surgical procedure must be considered to manage symptoms. The procedure, called a Nissen ''fundoplication'', involves wrapping the top part of the stomach around the lower esophagus. The displaced stomach contracts during the digestive process, and thus closes off the lower esophagus and prevents reflux. In extraordinary circumstances, a feeding tube directly into the stomach is necessary to complement the Nissen fundoplication.'   mild elevation of the head of bed, serving smaller but more frequent meals, monitoring your child's diet to determine whether specific foods or drinks may tend to aggravate his or her symptoms, and weight reduction if indicated. Medication to lessen gas, for example, Mylicon or Gaviscon Medication to neutralize stomach acid, for example, Mylanta or Maalox Medication to lessen stomach acid histamine blockers, for example, ranitidine (Zantac), famotidine (Pepcid) or cimetidine (Tagamet), and proton pump inhibitors or PPIs, for example, omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid) or rabeprazole (Aciphex) Medication to promote emptying of stomach contents, for example, metoclopramide (Reglan, however, it has a number of side effects) or erythromycin (more routinely used as an antibiotic but known to have side the effect of increasing stomach contractions, but may be helpful with GERD)"
What natural or home remedies treat GER in infants?,"'Since the fundamental issue for infants with GER is ""tincture of time,"" most infants need no specific therapy. Lifestyle adjustments that have been helpful for some infants include:''Rarely, an infant may require medications to ''bridge'' the gap during the neurologic maturation process that enables your child to ""outgrow"" his or her GER. These medications are discussed later.' Mild elevation of the head of the crib mattress Maintaining an upright position for the first 20 to 30 minutes following a feeding Thickening of the formula with rice cereal Utilization of an ""elemental"" formula (for example, Alimentum) Introduction of solid foods at the safe and appropriate age (please check with your child's pediatrician prior to initiating these processes)."
What is the prognosis for GER and GERD in infants and children?,"'The prognosis for infants with GER is excellent. The majority of infants will have resolved their symptoms by 9 to 12 months of age. Infants who required medications during the first few months of life generally ""outgrow"" their medication during the end of the first year of life.''Children who experience GERD symptoms also have a favorable prognosis though it may require longer use of medications and utilization of life style changes for many months. It is important to note that classic ""heartburn"" symptoms may resolve, but more subtle evidence of reflux (for example, persisting cough, especially when laying face up [supine]) may develop. Your child\'s pediatrician is a valuable asset to help monitor for these less obvious presentations of GERD.' "
What is fundoplication?,"   Fundoplication is the standard surgical method for treating gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD causes inflammation, pain (heartburn), and other serious complications (such as scarring and stricture) of the esophagus. GERD results when acid refluxes (regurgitates, or backwashes) from the stomach back up into the esophagus. Under normal conditions, there is a barrier to the reflux of acid from the stomach. One part of this barrier is the lower-most muscle of the esophagus (called the lower esophageal sphincter). Most of the time, this muscle is contracted (constricted, or tight), which closes off the esophagus from the stomach. In patients with GERD, the sphincter does not function normally. The muscle is either weak or relaxes inappropriately. Fundoplication is a surgical technique that strengthens the barrier to acid reflux when the sphincter does not function normally."
What happens during fundoplication?,"'During the fundoplication procedure, the part of the stomach that is closest to the entry of the esophagus (the fundus of the stomach) is gathered, wrapped, and sutured (sewn) around the lower end of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter. (The gathering and suturing of one tissue to another is called plication.) This procedure increases the pressure at the lower end of the esophagus and thereby reduces acid reflux.''Also, during fundoplication, other surgical steps frequently are taken that also may reduce acid reflux. For instance, if the patient has a ''hiatal hernia'' (which occurs in 80% of patients with GERD), the contents of the ''hernia'' sac (the stomach) may be pulled down from the chest and the opening the ''diaphragm'' (the hiatus) through which the esophagus passes from the chest into the abdomen sutured so that stomach remains within the abdomen. Fundoplication may be done using a large incision (laparotomy in the abdomen or thoracotomy in the chest) or a laparoscope, which requires only several small punctures in the abdomen. The advantage of the laparoscopic method is a speedier recovery and less post-operative ''pain''.' "
What are alternatives to fundoplication?,"'Although fundoplication is the standard surgical method for treating GERD, endoscopic methods for treating GERD are being developed. ''Endoscopy'' utilizes endoscopes, which are long flexible tubes that are passed by the doctor through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach. The inside of the esophagus can be viewed through the endoscope and various instruments can be passed through channels in the endoscope.''In one endoscopic method for treating GERD, an instrument is inserted that delivers an electrical current to the lower esophageal sphincter. This results in scarring which tightens the sphincter. In asecond method, ''sutures'' are placed in the sphincter to tighten the sphincter. Another treatment for GERD invloves placing a ring around the lower esophageal sphincter to prevent acid from refluxing into the esophagus. This is called the LINX procedure.''Other methods also have been employed experimentally. Endoscopic methods offer a simpler way of treating GERD than fundoplication. As more data is being accumulated as to how effective, safe, or long-lasting they are, their use is increasing.' "
What is esophageal pH monitoring?,'Esophageal pH (pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution) monitoring is a procedure for measuring the reflux (regurgitation or backwash) of acid from the stomach into the ''esophagus'' that occurs in ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').' 
When is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is used to diagnose ''GERD'', to determine the effectiveness of medications that are given to prevent ''acid reflux'', and to determine if episodes of acidic reflux are causing episodes of ''chest pain''. Monitoring esophageal pH also can be used to determine if acid is reaching the pharynx (lower throat) and is possibly responsible for such symptoms as ''cough'', ''hoarseness'', and ''sore throat''.'  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring performed?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is performed by passing a thin ''plastic'' catheter a sixteenth of an inch in diameter through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The sensor is positioned in the esophagus so that it is just above the lower esophageal sphincter, a specialized area of esophageal muscle that lies at the junction of the esophagus and stomach and prevents acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus. In this position the sensor records each reflux of acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid. ''The patient is sent home with the catheter and recorder in place and returns the next day to have them removed. During the 24 hours that the catheter is in place, the patient goes about his or her usual activities, for example, eating, sleeping, and working. Meals, periods of ''sleep'', and symptoms are recorded by the patient in a diary and/or by pushing buttons on the recorder.  After the catheter is removed, the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data it has gathered can be downloaded into the computer where it is analyzed and put into graphic form. The procedure can be modified by placing the sensor in the upper esophagus or pharynx to determine if refluxed acid is reaching the pharynx.''The most recently-developed device for monitoring esophageal pH uses a capsule also known as the Bravo Capsule. The capsule contains an acid sensing probe, a battery, and a transmitter. The probe monitors the acid in the esophagus and transmits the information to a recorder that is worn by the patient on a belt. The capsule is introduced into the esophagus on a catheter through the nose or mouth and is attached to the lining of the esophagus with a clip. The catheter then is detached from the capsule and removed. Thus, there is no catheter protruding from the nose. The capsule transmits for two days or three days, and then the battery dies. Five to seven days later, the capsule falls off the esophageal lining and is passed in the ''stool'' as the capsule is not reusable. ''The advantages of the capsule device are related to the absence of a catheter connecting the probe to the recorder.  There is greater comfort without a catheter in the back of the throat, and patients are more likely to go to work and do more of their normal activities without feeling self-conscious about the appearance of the catheter to others. The disadvantages of the capsule are that it cannot be used in the pharynx (where it would be impossibly uncomfortable) and, so far, it has not been used in the stomach. '  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Almost everyone has some acidic reflux, but the amount of reflux is small and rarely causes inflammation of the esophagus (''esophagitis''). As the amount of acid reflux increases above the normal range, so does the probability of developing esophagitis and its symptoms. In patients with symptoms that suggest acid reflux, a diagnosis of reflux can be made by demonstrating an acid pH in the esophagus for a greater than normal amount of time.'""A common alternative method to diagnose reflux is to treat patients with medications that reduce reflux. If the patient's symptoms stop, then the symptoms are likely to be due to acid reflux. Another way of diagnosing acid reflux as the cause of symptoms is to demonstrate that episodes of acid reflux recorded by esophageal pH monitoring occur at exactly the same time as esophageal ""'pain''.''Esophageal pH monitoring also can be used to determine why treatment for reflux is not working. For example, a patient treated for acidic reflux may continue to have symptoms. If so, then the question must be asked as to why the symptoms are continuing. Is it because the medication is not adequate or is it because the symptoms are not due to reflux and, therefore, are not going to respond to treatment for reflux? If the pH monitoring study performed while the patient takes his or her medication for reflux shows abnormal amounts of reflux, then treatment is inadequate and needs to be changed. If the amount of acid reflux is within the normal range, then it is likely that the symptoms are not being caused by acid reflux, and other potential problems need to be considered as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What are the limitations of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'The demonstration of abnormal amounts of acid reflux does not mean that symptoms are being caused by the reflux.  Only treatment with medications that treat reflux coupled with a marked reduction of symptoms can be used to substantiate reflux as the cause of the symptoms.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that treatment is associated with a placebo response. For instance, 10% to 20% of patients without acid reflux report an improvement in  symptoms with anti-reflux medications.  Therefore, even a good response to treatment does not definitely prove that reflux is the cause of symptoms.''Some of the strongest evidence that episodic ''chest pain'' is being caused by acid reflux is provided by demonstrating that the painful episodes coincides with an episode of acid reflux.  If there are very frequent episodes of reflux, however, it may not be possible to separate a true association between a symptom and reflux from a chance association due to the great frequency of episodes of reflux.  Conversely, if a symptom occurs infrequently, for example, once every few days, it is unlikely that the symptom will occur during a routine 24 hour monitoring session, and therefore, a correlation will not be possible.  One attempt to get around the latter problem is to extend the monitoring to several days, but this extended monitoring is done infrequently.' "
Are there other ways in which pH monitoring can be used?,"'If the pH sensor is left in the stomach instead of the esophagus, it is possible to determine the effectiveness of medications that shut off the production of acid in the stomach.  This information may be useful in determining the proper doses of medications among patients with acid-related conditions of the stomach and duodenum (for example, peptic ulcers).  It also is possible to place a catheter with two acid sensors so that one sensor is in the stomach and the other is in the lower esophagus.  With this catheter, it is possible to evaluate both acidic ''esophageal reflux'' and the effectiveness of acid-suppressing medications.''The pH sensor may be placed in the upper esophagus or in the pharynx just above the upper esophageal sphincter in patients with unexplained symptoms of ''sore throat'', ''hoarseness'', or ''cough''.  In these patients, the demonstration of acid reflux into the upper esophagus or pharynx suggests that acid reflux may be the cause of the symptoms. Recent studies however have shown that the association of these symptoms with acidic reflux may not be reliable.' "
What are the side effects of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are very few side effects of esophageal pH monitoring. Although there may be mild discomfort in the back of the throat while the catheter is in place, particularly during swallows, the majority of patients have no difficulty eating, sleeping, or going about their daily activities. Most patients, however, prefer not to go to work because they feel self-conscious about the catheter protruding from their nose. The capsule device may cause discomfort when swallowing. The discomfort is felt in the chest and may be due to food or the wave of esophageal contraction tugging on the capsule as it passes.' "
Are there alternatives to esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are no alternatives for obtaining the information that esophageal pH monitoring provides.  Nevertheless, the presence of esophagitis visually at the time of ''endoscopy'"" strongly suggests the presence of acidic reflux among patients who don't have other likely causes of esophageal ""'pain''.  This may obviate the need to do a pH monitoring study.' "
What are the complications of GERD?,"'If GERD is left untreated, the protective lining of the esophagus gets corroded by the ''acid reflux'' and can give rise to complications. These below complications make the healing of GERD difficult:' Esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus) Esophageal ulcers (sores in the lining of the esophagus) Barrett esophagus (abnormal changes in the esophagus that can lead to cancer) Esophageal stricture (narrowing of the esophagus) Dental problems (wearing of the teeth enamel, dental cavities) Increased risk of esophageal cancer Asthma flare-ups (GERD worsens asthma and asthma worsens GERD)"
What lifestyle changes can help prevent GERD symptoms?,"'Diet'' and lifestyle changes form the cornerstone of therapy for managing and preventing the ''symptoms of GERD''. These include:''Cut down on foods that can trigger GERD. These include:' Eat frequent smaller meals (instead of three large meals) Maintain a healthy weight (belly fat puts pressure on your stomach) Relax when you eat (stress triggers heartburn) Beat the stress (try relaxation therapies, such as deep breathing, meditation, massage, or yoga) Remain upright during and after eating (for at least 45-60 minutes) Eat at least three hours before going to bed (do not eat anything just before bed) Avoid tight accessories (such as tight belts, waistbands) and other clothing on your belly (these can put pressure on your stomach) High-fat foods (including dairy products) Spicy dishes Tomatoes Tomato sauce Garlic Onions Citrus fruits (lemons, oranges) Carbonated drinks Coffee Chocolate Peppermint Alcoholic drinks Avoid smoking Raise the head of your bed by at least 6-8 inches (use wooden blocks under the bedposts)"
What medications are used to treat GERD?,"'Treatment of GERD aims at controlling symptoms, healing esophagitis (if present), and preventing recurrent esophagitis or other complications. The standard medications include:''Proton pump inhibitors'':''H2 blockers:''Antacids:'' These provide relief more quickly than most other medicines by neutralizing the digestive acids in the stomach and esophagus.''Prokinetic agents:'' These medicines help empty the stomach of its contents so that they do not flow back towards the esophagus. They can also improve muscle tone in the esophagus. The only one approved for use in the United States is ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan'').' Omeprazole (Prilosec, Prilosec OTC, Zegerid) Lansoprazole (Prevacid) Pantoprazole (Protonix) Famotidine (Pepcid, Pepcid AC) Cimetidine (Tagamet, Tagamet HB) Aluminum hydroxide gel (Alternagel, Amphojel) Calcium carbonate (Alka-Seltzer, Tums) Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia)"
About rubella,"'Rubella'', sometimes called German ''measles'' or three-day ''measles'', is a ''contagious'' disease caused by a virus. The infection is usually mild with ''fever'' and ''rash''.' "
Symptoms,"'Rubella'' usually causes the following symptoms in children:''These symptoms last 2 or 3 days.''Older children and adults may also have swollen glands and symptoms like a ''cold'' before the rash appears. Aching joints occur in many cases, especially among young women.''About half of the people who get ''rubella'' do not have symptoms.'   Rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body Low fever (less than 101 degrees)"
Complications,"'Birth defects'' if acquired by a ''pregnant'' woman: deafness, ''cataracts'', ''heart'' defects, mental retardation, and ''liver'' and spleen damage (at least a 20% chance of damage to the fetus if a woman is infected early in ''pregnancy'').' "
Transmission,"'Spread by contact with an infected person, through ''coughing'' and ''sneezing''.' "
Prevention,'Rubella ''vaccine'' (contained in MMR vaccine) can prevent this disease.' 
Does my child need this vaccine?,"'Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine:''These are the recommended ages. But children can get the second dose at any age, as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose.' The first dose at 12-15 months of age The second dose at 4-6 years of age"
"As an adult, do I need this vaccine?","'You do NOT need the measles, ''mumps'', rubella vaccine (MMR) if:''You SHOULD get the measles vaccine if you are not among the categories listed above, and' You had blood tests that show you are immune to measles, mumps, and rubella. You are a man born before 1957. You are a woman born before 1957 who is sure she is not having more children, has already had rubella vaccine, or has had a positive rubella test. You already had two doses of MMR or one dose of MMR plus a second dose of measles vaccine. You already had one dose of MMR and are not at high risk of measles or mumps exposure. You are a college student, trade school student, or other student beyond high school. You work in a hospital or other medical facility. You travel internationally, or are a passenger on a cruise ship. You are a woman of childbearing age."
What is gestational diabetes?,"'Gestational diabetes is diabetes, or ''high blood sugar'' levels, that develops during pregnancy. It occurs in about 4% of all ''pregnancies''. Gestational diabetes usually is diagnosed in the later ''stages of pregnancy'', and often occurs in women who have no prior history of diabetes.' "
How can gestational diabetes affect your baby?,"'Women with gestational diabetes who receive proper care typically go on to deliver healthy ''babies''. However, if you have persistently elevated blood glucose levels throughout pregnancy, the fetus will also have elevated blood glucose levels. High blood glucose can cause the fetus to be larger than normal, possibly making delivery more complicated. The baby is also at risk for having low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) immediately after birth.''Other serious complications of poorly controlled gestational diabetes in the ''newborn'' can include''The baby is also at a greater risk of becoming ''overweight'' and developing ''type 2 diabetes'' later in life.''If diabetes is present in an early pregnancy, there is an increased risk of ''birth defects'' and ''miscarriage'' compared to that of mothers without diabetes.' a greater risk of jaundice, an increased risk for respiratory distress syndrome, and a higher chance of dying before or following birth."
What are the warning signs and symptoms of gestational diabetes?,"'Gestational diabetes typically does not cause any noticeable signs or symptoms. This is why screening tests are so important. Rarely, an increased ''thirst'' or increased urinary frequency may be noticed.'  "
What causes gestational diabetes?,"'Gestational diabetes is thought to arise because the many changes, hormonal and otherwise, that occur in the body during pregnancy predispose some women to become resistant to ''insulin''. Insulin is a hormone made by specialized cells in the pancreas that allows the body to effectively metabolize glucose for later usage as fuel (energy). When levels of insulin are low, or the body cannot effectively use insulin (i.e., ''insulin resistance''), blood glucose levels rise.' "
What are the complications of gestational diabetes for the mother?," Women with gestational diabetes have a greater chance of needing a Cesarean birth (C-section), in part due to large infant size. Gestational diabetes may increase the risk of preeclampsia, a maternal condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Women with gestational diabetes are also at increased risk of having type 2 diabetes after the pregnancy."
What are risk factors for gestational diabetes?,"'Some degree of insulin resistance and ''impaired glucose tolerance'' is normal in late pregnancy. However, in some women, this is enough to produce diabetes of pregnancy, or gestational diabetes. Several risk factors that can increase your risk of getting gestational diabetes include:' Obesity A history of gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy Previous delivery of an infant with a high birth weight (over 9 pounds) A parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes A personal history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic, or Pacific Islander American ethnicity Having prediabetes"
What blood tests diagnose gestational diabetes?,"'Gestational diabetes is diagnosed with blood tests. Most pregnant women are tested between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy, but if you have risk factors, your doctor may decide to test earlier in the pregnancy.''Blood testing confirms the diagnosis. A screening ''glucose tolerance test'' involves drinking a sugary beverage and having your blood drawn to test the glucose levels an hour later. If the screening test is not normal, you may need additional testing.''Another type of test is an oral glucose challenge test (OGTT). For this test your baseline blood glucose level is checked and then measured at 1, 2, and sometimes 3 hours after consuming a sugary drink. A blood glucose level of 140mg/dL or higher on this test will identify 80% of women with gestational diabetes. When that cutoff is lowered to 130mg/dL, the identification rate increases to 90%. Women who had a level of blood glucose greater than 130 mg/dL are typically recommended to take another diabetes screening test that requires fasting (not eating anything) before the test.''Glycosylated ''hemoglobin'', or ''hemoglobin A1c'', is another test that may be performed. This test is used to monitor long-term blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. The hemoglobin A1c level offers a measure of the average blood glucose level over the past few months.' "
Should all pregnant women get tested for gestational diabetes?,'All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes during their pregnancy. Most pregnant women are tested between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy.' 
What is the treatment for gestational diabetes?,"'It is important to receive proper treatment for gestational diabetes because research studies have shown that the incidence of problems and complications is decreased when blood glucose levels are normalized. Treatment for gestational diabetes involves attention to maintaining a proper ''diet''. Nutritional modification is the mainstay of therapy, and many women will achieve adequate glucose control by following a nutritional plan. Regular ''exercise'' can also contribute to tight glucose control.''Testing your blood glucose levels at home at specific times or after meals will be recommended to determine if your glucose levels are within acceptable limits. Testing at least four times per day is typical.''You may also be asked to test your urine for ketones, substances that are produced when your body metabolizes fat. Ketones are elevated when the body is unable to use glucose for energy.''If ''diet'' and ''exercise'' are not sufficient to maintain tight control of your blood glucose levels, it may be necessary to institute insulin therapy. Insulin is the only officially approved medication for treating gestational diabetes in the U.S.; however, oral medications are used by many doctors to control the blood ''sugar'' in selected women with gestational diabetes. As the pregnancy progresses, insulin requirements may change and insulin doses may need to be adjusted.'  "
Is there a special diet plan for women with diabetes during pregnancy?,"'While there is no one specific diet that is recommended for all women with gestational diabetes, following a meal plan can help keep your blood ''sugar'' levels under control and avoid complications.' A nutritionist may be helpful in designing a meal plan that takes into account individual schedules and preferences. Eating a variety of foods is recommended, and it is better to eat smaller portions throughout the day (e.g. 3 small to moderate meals and 2-4 snacks) rather than just a few large meals. Many women with gestational diabetes will be advised to eat fewer carbohydrates than in their normal diet and to eat complex carbohydrates that contain fiber. It’s important to limit consumption of foods containing large amounts of simple sugars. High-fiber foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as whole-grain products, are not only nutritious but also effective in keeping blood sugar levels stable. Skipping meals is not recommended because this leads to undesirable fluctuations in blood sugar levels."
Can gestational diabetes be cured?,"'Most women with gestational diabetes who receive treatment go on to deliver healthy babies. The risk of complications increases when blood glucose levels are not properly controlled. While some women with gestational diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes following delivery, this risk can be reduced by following a good nutritional plan, exercising, and maintaining a healthy weight.' "
Can you prevent diabetes during pregnancy?,"'Gestational diabetes cannot always be prevented; however, obesity is a prime determinant for developing the disease. Maintaining a healthy weight and following a good nutritional plan both before and during pregnancy can decrease your chances of developing gestational diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight can also decrease your chances of developing type 2 diabetes following pregnancy.' "
Can you get trichomoniasis without being sexually active?,"'Trichomoniasis'' is passed from an infected person to another primarily during sexual activity. In very rare cases, it can be transferred from an infected mother to her unborn child.''This parasitic infection does not spread through casual contact, so you can’t get it from sharing food or ''drinks'', kissing, hugging and holding hands. Toilet seats also do not provide the ideal environment for the parasite to grow and infect a person.''If women who have ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') get trich, they have a high risk of more complications. It can be controlled with proper treatment. Successful treatment of a trich infection may reduce ''HIV'' transmission by mucosal routes.''Trich mostly infects women who are sexually active or those who are between the ages of\xa0 35 to 40 years old. Other predisposing factors may include sex trading, ''smoking'', multiple sexual partners and low socioeconomic status.\xa0' Any sexual activity during vaginal, oral or anal sex can cause the infection to spread. Even if your partner has no symptoms, they can spread the infection. Sometimes, even if a man does not ejaculate the infection can still spread to the woman through genital contact. Trich can also be passed between women who have sex with women. Infected sex toys can also transmit the infection."
How do you avoid getting trichomoniasis?,"'The best way to prevent a ''sexually transmitted infection'' (''STI'') is to not have vaginal, oral or anal sex. If this is not possible, other means to decrease the risk of transmission include' Using condoms correctly every time during sex to help to reduce the risk of trich or any other STIs. Being monogamous or limiting sexual activity with unknown partners can prevent the spread of the infection. Getting yourself tested if you have any symptoms or doubt will be helpful. Male circumcision can prevent trich transmission in men. Women should avoid douching, which may remove the normal bacterial layer in the vagina that protects them from infection."
How does a doctor treat trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis'' is easily curable with antibiotics, such as ''metronidazole'' or tinidazole. These antibiotics usually come in a pill form that you can swallow in a single dose.''During antibiotic treatment\xa0' Take all the medicine prescribed even if your symptoms go away. You need to finish all the antibiotics to avoid antimicrobial resistance. Sexual partners must also be treated. Only initiate sexual activity at least seven days after completing the course of antibiotics."
What are the complications of untreated trichomoniasis?,'Untreated trich can cause genital inflammation that makes it easier to become infected with human immunodeficiency virus (''HIV'').''Women with ''trichomoniasis'' have a high risk of''Pregnant'' women with trichomoniasis are at a high risk of\xa0''Your gynecologist may prescribe metronidazole antibiotic to treat a trichomoniasis infection during any stage of ''pregnancy''.

What is giant cell arteritis?,"'Giant cell arteritis, also called ''temporal arteritis'' or ''cranial arteritis'', is a serious disease characterized by inflammation of the walls of the blood vessels (''vasculitis''). The vessels affected are the arteries (hence the name ""arteritis""). Giant cell arteritis occurs in 10%-15% of patients with ''polymyalgia rheumatica''. The age of affected patients is over 50 years of age, identical to that of polymyalgia rheumatica. The onset of giant cell arteritis may be years before, after, or without accompanying polymyalgia rheumatica. Giant cell arteritis is abbreviated GCA.' "
What causes giant cell arteritis?,"'The cause of giant cell arteritis is not known. Recent research is looking into possible infectious causes, and some information suggests a possible relationship to the microbe ''chlamydia''. This will require further studies for verification.' "
What are giant cell arteritis symptoms and signs?,"'Because giant cell arteritis is commonly due to inflammation of the arterial blood vessels affecting the head, it frequently leads to ''headaches'', ''pain in the jaw'' when repetitively chewing, and tenderness of the ''scalp'' (usually over the inflamed arteries of the sides of the head). It is also commonly associated with ''fatigue'', low-grade ''fevers'', and ''weight loss''. The muscle aching of polymyalgia rheumatica is seen in nearly half of the patients with giant cell arteritis, either before, during, or after the onset of the arteritis.''When the arteries affected by giant cell arteritis become inflamed, they can narrow to the degree that the blood flow through them is limited. This can cause serious deficiency of oxygen supply to the tissues normally supplied by these arteries. Inadequate oxygenation of the eyes or brain can lead to impaired or ''double vision'', blindness, or ''stroke''. Less commonly, inflammation of the blood vessels supplying the arms can lead to ''arm pain'' when the arms are working.' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose giant cell arteritis?,"'The diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is suspected when a patient over the age of 50 (usually over 60) develops symptoms above and/or suddenly develops blindness or ''stroke''. The diagnosis is supported by signs of inflammation in the blood indicated by an elevation in the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' and/or ''C-reactive protein''.''The diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy of an artery, usually an artery on the side of the scalp called the temporal artery. This biopsy is performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting. It requires an incision into the scalp over the artery in the skin. The tissue of this area is supplied by blood from many vessels and does just fine after removal of the piece of the artery.' "
What is the treatment for giant cell arteritis?,"'The goal of the treatment of giant cell arteritis is to suppress the inflammation within the arteries. When giant cell arteritis is diagnosed, high doses of cortisone medications, either intravenously or by mouth are necessary. The high doses required to quiet the inflamed arteries frequently are associated with side effects, including sweats, ''weight gain'', ''bruising'', puffiness of the face, erratic emotions, ''insomnia'', and others.''Also, in order to maintain optimal blood flow, low-dose ''aspirin'' is often given to optimize circulation of blood and prevent unwarranted blood clotting within diseased arteries. Studies have shown that low-dose aspirin can reduce the risk of ''stroke'' and ''visual loss'' in patients with giant cell arteritis.''Because the cortisone medications are associated with potential bone toxicity, causing ''osteoporosis'', patients should consider calcium and ''vitamin D'' supplementation. Appropriate patients should have ''bone mineral density'' testing, and ''osteoporosis'' medications, such as estrogen, ''alendronate'' (''Fosamax''), and ''risedronate'' (''Actonel''), are considered.' "
What is the prognosis for patients with giant cell arteritis?,"'Giant cell arteritis usually runs a self-limited course, over months to years. Rarely, the inflammation may not respond to high doses of cortisone, and stronger medications that suppress the immune system have been tried, such as ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). In most patients, the cortisone medications can gradually be tapered according to the symptoms while the ESR blood test is monitored.''The effects of the arteritis depend not only on the amount of inflammation in the arteries but also on the location of the arteries in various body tissues. Research scientists studying arteritis have discovered that the location of the inflamed arteries in the body and whether it is associated with polymyalgia rheumatica seem to relate to different features of specialized white blood cells (T cells) that are infiltrating the artery walls. If these T cell differences can be further classified according to the patterns of inflammation in patients, this could lead to a new era of ""customized"" treatments for giant cell arteritis.' "
Is it possible to prevent giant cell arteritis?,'There is no prevention for giant cell arteritis. Prevention measures focus on preventing side effects of medications used to treat giant cell arteritis.' 
What are complications of giant cell arteritis?,"'Giant cell arteritis can lead to blindness and/or stroke. This is because, in some patients with giant cell arteritis, inflammation of the arteries that supply oxygen to the eyes and brain can impair the circulation to these organs.''Additional complications can result from medications used to treat giant cell arteritis.

What is Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,"'The Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (B-SS) is a rare ''inherited'' ''bleeding disorder'' caused by abnormal platelets and subsequent abnormal clotting.  It is one of the giant platelet syndromes. This syndrome was originally described in 1948 by two physicians who were treating a patient with a bleeding problem.  They discovered that this patient had a prolonged bleeding time, fewer platelets, and larger platelets than the normal individual.  Since then, the platelet abnormality has been described and determined to be due to the platelets lacking the ability to stick adequately to injured blood-vessel walls. This is a crucial aspect of the process of forming a ''blood clot'', and as a result of this problem, there is excessive bleeding.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,"'Bernard-Soulier syndrome usually presents in the ''newborn'' period, infancy, or early childhood with ''bruises'', ''nosebleeds'' (epistaxis), and/or gum (gingival) bleeding.  Later problems can occur with anything that can induce bleeding such as ''menstruation'', ''trauma'', surgery, or stomach ulcers.' "
What is the cause of Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,"'Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a rare ''inherited disease'' and is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that both parents must carry a gene for the Bernard-Soulier syndrome and transmit that gene to the child for the child to have the disease. The prevalence is believed to be less than one in 1 million individuals. The molecular basis is now known and is due to a defect in the platelet glycoprotein complex 1b-IX-V. This is referred to as an adhesion complex and forms a receptor that enables platelets to stick together to form a clot. Normal platelets circulate in the blood and are the primary cells responsible for initiating clotting. Without this receptor, platelets cannot stick together and clotting does not occur normally. The parents of a child with B-SS will have a decrease in the glycoprotein but no impairment of platelet function and no abnormal bleeding. The Bernard-Soulier gene has been mapped to the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 (in the region 17pter-17p12).' "
How is Bernard-Soulier syndrome diagnosed?,"'Patients are often diagnosed with B-SS after seeking medical attention following prolonged or recurring bleeding episodes. Some infants are diagnosed after excessive bleeding following ''circumcision''. Other children and adults may be diagnosed after bleeding excessively following trauma or tooth extraction. Very frequently there is a history of another family member with similar symptoms, and the physician evaluating the patient will often document a detailed family history to assist in the diagnosis. B-SS ultimately is a laboratory diagnosis and usually requires a specialized laboratory to confirm the suspicion of the disease and involves platelet aggregation studies (testing for the ""stickiness"" of platelets) and flow cytometry. It is important to distinguish this syndrome from other platelet disorders (such as von Willebrand disease and immune ''thrombocytopenia'' purpura), since the treatments and management differ.' "
What is the treatment for Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,"'There is no specific treatment for Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Patients should avoid any ''drugs'' which may interfere with clot formation, such as ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'', and ''naproxen''.  Severe bleeding episodes may require platelet and blood transfusions.  Recombinant clotting factors and a coagulation drug known as ''DDAVP'' may also be of short-term benefit in selected patients. Affected individuals should avoid participation in contact sports.  ''Iron supplements'' are often recommended to patients with the disease to help minimize the ''anemia'' often observed in patients with frequent blood loss.' "
Is there a cure for Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,'Currently there is no cure for B-SS; however researchers are studying the efficacy of bone-marrow transplantation and have had some success in treating the syndrome in several severely affected patients.' 
What is giardiasis?,"   Giardiasis (gee-ar-die-a-sis with a soft ""G"") is an infection of the small intestine that is caused by the parasite, Giardia duodenalis, also known as Giardia lamblia and Giardia intestinalis. It is the most common cause of parasitic gastrointestinal disease; it is estimated that 20,000 cases of giardiasis occur each year in the U.S., and there is a 20% to 40% prevalence in the world's population. Giardia lamblia exists in two forms, an active form called a trophozoite, and an inactive form called a cyst. The active trophozoite attaches to the lining of the small intestine with a ""sucker"" and is responsible for causing the signs and symptoms of giardiasis. The trophozoite cannot live long outside of the body, therefore it cannot spread the infection to others. The inactive cyst, on the other hand, can exist for prolonged periods outside the body. When it is ingested, stomach acid activates the cyst, and the cyst develops into the disease-causing trophozoite. It takes ingestion of only ten cysts to cause infection. Trophozoites are important not only because they cause the symptoms of giardiasis, but also because they produce the cysts that exit the body in the feces and spread the infection to others. Cysts of Giardia are present in the feces of infected persons. Thus, the infection is spread from person to person by contamination of food with feces, or by direct fecal-oral contamination. Cysts also survive in water, for example in fresh water lakes and streams. As a result, giardiasis is the most common cause of water-borne, parasitic illness in the U.S. Domestic mammals (for example, dogs, cats, calves) and wild mammals (for example, beavers) can become infected with Giardia; however, it is not clear how often domestic or wild mammals transmit giardiasis to humans. Giardiasis also has occurred as outbreaks from recreational water sources such as swimming pools, water parks, and hot tubs, most likely because of an infected user rather than a source of water that was contaminated."
Who is at risk for giardiasis?,"'Giardiasis occurs where there is inadequate sanitation or inadequate treatment of drinking water. Giardiasis is one of the causes of ""''traveler'""'s ""'diarrhea''"" that occurs during travel to less-developed countries, for example the Soviet Union, Mexico, Southeast Asia, and western South America. Giardiasis is a common cause of outbreaks of ''diarrhea'' in day-care centers because of the high probability of fecal-oral contamination from children; the children, their families, and day care center workers, all are at risk for infection. In fact, children are three times more likely to develop giardiasis than adults. Hikers exploring back-country areas who drink from contaminated fresh water lakes also are at risk for developing giardiasis. Individuals who practice anal/oral sex also may become infected.' "
What signs and symptoms does giardiasis cause?,"'The most common manifestations of giardiasis are ''diarrhea'' and ''abdominal pain'', particularly cramping; however, diarrhea is not invariable and occurs in 60% to 90% of patients. Other common manifestations include:''Fever'' is unusual. The severity of the symptoms may vary greatly from mild or no symptoms to severe symptoms. Stools may be foul smelling when the Giardia interferes with the absorption of fat from the intestine (malabsorption). The illness or the malabsorption may cause loss of weight.''Symptoms and signs of giardiasis do not begin for at least seven days following infection'', but can occur as long as three or more weeks later. In most patients the illness is self-limiting and lasts 2-4 weeks. In many patients who are not treated, however, infection can last for several months to years with continuing symptoms. Children with chronic infection may fail to thrive. Some patients recover from their giardiasis, with or without treatment, but symptoms continue, perhaps because of a condition referred to as postinfectious ''irritable bowel syndrome''. The cause of the continuing symptoms is not clear but may be due to bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine.'   bloating, nausea with or without vomiting, malaise, and fatigue."
How do medical professionals diagnose giardiasis?,"'The best single test for diagnosing giardiasis is antigen testing of the ''stool''. For antigen testing, a small sample of ''stool'"" is tested for the presence of Giardial proteins. The antigen test will identify more than 90% of people infected with Giardia. Giardia also can be diagnosed by examination of stool under the microscope for cysts or trophozoites; however, it takes three samples of stool to diagnose 90% of cases. Despite requiring three samples of stool, microscopic examination of stool identifies other parasites in addition to Giardia that can cause diarrheal illness. Therefore, microscopical examination of stool has value beyond diagnosing giardiasis, as it can identify and diagnose other parasites as the cause of a patient's illness.""""Other tests that can be used for diagnosing giardiasis are collection and examination of fluid from the duodenum or biopsy of the small intestine, but these require tests that involve expense and discomfort. The string test is a more comfortable method for obtaining a sample of duodenal fluid. For the string test, a gelatin capsule that contains a loosely-woven string is swallowed. One end of the string protrudes from the capsule and is taped to the patient's outer cheek. Over several hours, the gelatin capsule dissolves in the stomach, and the string uncoils, with the last 12 inches or so passing into the duodenum. In the duodenum the string absorbs a small amount of duodenal fluid. The string then is untapped from the cheek and is removed. The collected duodenal fluid is expressed from the string and is examined under the microscope. Although more comfortable than some of the other tests, it is not clear how sensitive the string test is in diagnosing giardiasis."" "
What is the treatment for giardiasis?,"'The most common treatment for giardiasis is ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl'') for 5-10 days. It has an efficacy rate of 75% to 100%, but it often causes gastrointestinal side effects such as ''nausea'' and a ''metallic taste'' as well as ''dizziness'' and ''headache''. Despite its effectiveness, metronidazole is not approved by the FDA in the U.S. for treatment of giardiasis.''Tinidazole has replaced ''furazolidone'' as the FDA-approved drug for treatment of the condition, and is highly effective at treating giardiasis (>90%). It also can be given as a single dose and is well tolerated. Furazolidone and Quinacrine are effective for treating giardiasis but are no longer available in the U.S. ''Albendazole''\xa0and ''mebendazole'' are effective alternative agents, but these are not approved for used in the U.S. Paromomyin is\xa0less effective than other treatments.''Occasionally, treatment fails to eradicate Giardia. In such cases, the drug may be changed or a longer duration or higher dose may be used. Combination therapy also may be effective (e.g., quinacrine and metronidazole).'  "
Is there a way to prevent giardiasis?," Drink only water that has been treated in established treatment facilities. If there is any doubt about the adequacy of the treatment of water, boil the water or filter it through a filter with a pore size of <1 micrometer, which will exclude trophozoites and cysts. Do not drink from fresh water streams or lakes without boiling or filtering the water. Do not use ice or drink beverages made from tap water that may be contaminated. Do not brush teeth with tap water that may be contaminated. Do not eat uncooked or unpeeled fruits or vegetables grown in conditions in which contamination with Giardia might occur. Wash hands before eating food, after changing diapers, using the bathroom, or touching pets. Avoid oral/anal sex."

What is Gilbert syndrome?,"'Gilbert Syndrome'' is a common, harmless genetic condition in which a ''liver'' enzyme essential to the disposal of ''bilirubin'' (the chemical that results from the normal breakdown of ''hemoglobin'' from ''red blood cells'') is abnormal. The condition has also been referred to as constitutional hepatic dysfunction and familial nonhemolytic ''jaundice''. The enzyme abnormality in Gilbert syndrome results in mild elevations of bilirubin in the blood, particularly after starvation, consumption of ''alcohol'', or ''dehydration''.' "
What causes Gilbert syndrome?,"'Gilbert syndrome is the result of a genetic mutation in the promoter region of a gene for the enzyme UGT1A (one of the enzymes called UGT glucuronosyltransferases that are important for bilirubin metabolism). The gene is located on chromosome 2. Other types of mutations in the same gene cause the Crigler-Najjar syndrome, which is a more severe and dangerous form of hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin in the blood).''People with two copies of the abnormal promoter region for the UGT1A gene (one ''inherited'"" from each parent) have Gilbert's syndrome and elevated bilirubin levels, suggesting an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. This means that both parents require the gene for expression of the abnormality in the offspring.""'Gilbert syndrome is a frequent finding in people in the United States and Europe. The condition is usually detected serendipitously (purely by accident) in the course of routine blood screening.' "
What are the symptoms of Gilbert syndrome?,"'The elevated bilirubin pigment can sometimes cause mild yellowing (''jaundice'') of the eyes. People with Gilbert syndrome are otherwise entirely normal with no other signs or symptoms. Their liver enzyme levels in blood serum are also entirely normal.''Gilbert syndrome is most commonly diagnosed after  ''puberty'', when alterations in sex hormone levels cause the blood bilirubin levels to rise. Situations that aggravate elevated blood bilirubin levels (such as fasting, destruction of red blood cells, or illnesses) may be the initial factors that cause the patient to seek medical attention.'  "
What is the treatment for Gilbert syndrome?,"'There is no need for treatment, and the prognosis (outlook) is excellent.'  "
What is gingivitis (gum disease or periodontal disease)?,"'Gingivitis'' (''gum disease'' or periodontal disease) is inflammation of the ''gingiva'' (structures in the mouth including the gums, mucous membranes, and fibrous tissue that covers the tooth-containing edge of the jaw). ''Gingivitis'' is commonly termed gum disease and medically termed periodontal disease. ''Gingivitis'' is considered to be the early stage of periodontal disease by some investigators. The majority of individuals with gingivitis have bacteria under the gingival area, and these bacteria cause inflammation. Some bacteria that play a role in gingivitis also play a role in causing ''cavities''.'  "
Is gingivitis contagious?,"'The answer is controversial and depends on what experts you ask. For example, many factors that lead to the disease are due to actions taken by the individual (examples include poor ''dental hygiene'', no flossing of ''teeth'', ''stress'', hard to clean crooked teeth, ''smoking'', medications like steroids and some antiseizure medications, and a poor ''diet'' containing heavy amounts of ''sugar'' and carbohydrates). However, researchers have shown that gingivitis-causing bacteria (including ''Streptococcus'' mutans'', ''Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans'', ''Porphyromonas gingivalis'') can be passed from parents to children and exchanged between men and women living together by sharing silverware, utensils, saliva, drinking cups, and other items. Theoretically, it may be transmitted or spread by kissing.''Currently, the American Dental Association considers gingivitis to be ''contagious''. However, other factors such as those described above usually need to be present for an individual to develop gingivitis.''If one sides with those who consider gingivitis is mainly due to actions taken by an individual, then one sides with those who think gingivitis is not contagious. However, if one agree with the reasons established by the American Dental Association, then one sides with those who think gingivitis is contagious. There is a middle ground for some who think gingivitis occurs when certain factors are present in an individual (such as when the gingivitis-causing bacteria are present in an individual with poor dental hygiene, etc.).' "
How does gingivitis spread?,"'The American Dental Association suggests that initial spread of those gingivitis-causing bacteria (and many others) spread from mothers to their children. Children by the age of 3 are about 26 times more likely to have gingivitis-causing bacteria such as ''A. actinomycetemcomitans'' if their mothers have that strain of bacterium in their mouths. Similarly, cohabiting men and women develop similar bacterial populations. The spread of these organisms to other people occurs through sharing utensils, food, kissing, and other direct and indirect physical contacts.' "
How will one know if he or she has gingivitis?,"'For many people, there will be few if any symptoms, and these individuals will not know they have gingivitis for years. Once bacteria begin to cause inflammation, the symptoms of gingivitis may begin to appear as early as a week, but the incubation period is highly variable and depends on both colonization by bacteria that cause gingivitis and other factors that stimulate the growth of these bacteria. Consequently, it could take years for gingivitis to develop in certain individuals. Gingivitis is usually diagnosed during a dental checkup or tooth cleaning. However, some people may develop symptoms of ''bad breath'', swollen gums, receding gums, ''gums that bleed'' when an individual flosses or brushes their teeth, and/or develop a reddish coloration of the gums instead of the normal pinkish gum coloration. These are symptoms and signs that suggest that gingivitis is occurring.'  "
How will someone know when he or she no longer has gingivitis?,"'Fortunately, gingivitis is reversible in most individuals.''Dental care with tooth cleaning, plaque removal, and advice about how to avoid gingivitis is important. Dentists will advise people to avoid sugary ''drinks'' and food, stop ''smoking'', and to reduce ''stress''. Some individuals may require a change in their medications. Although it may be impossible to remove all of the bacteria that cause the gingivitis, gingivitis can be stopped and reversed. Consequently, gingivitis is reversible. When symptoms of gingivitis resolve, an individual should have relatively normal-appearing gum structures. This may take weeks or months with more than one dental visit.' "
When should someone seek medical care for gingivitis?,"'Although gingivitis is not a medical emergency, the following problems should cause an individual to seek dental care:''It is important to have a dentist or medical ''caregiver'' investigate these problems to distinguish between gingivitis and other even more severe conditions.' Red and/or swollen tender gums Gums that bleed easily with tooth brushing Persistent bad breath or a bad taste in the mouth Gums that have receded or pulled away from the teeth Changes in the way one's teeth or dentures fit when biting down Teeth that are becoming loose Any lesions that develop on or in the gums"
What should I know about swollen lymph nodes (glands)?," Lymph nodes, also referred to as lymph glands, are important part of the immune system. Lymph nodes are located throughout the body but are visible and able to be felt (palpable) only when they are enlarged or swollen. Lymph nodes are regional, and each group of them corresponds to a particular region of the body and reflects abnormalities in that region. Common areas where swollen lymph nodes are more prominent and more readily noticeable are:Behind the earIn the neckThe groinUnder the chinIn the armpits Behind the ear In the neck The groin Under the chin In the armpits Doctors and other health care professionals check these areas for enlarged or swollen lymph nodes. A wide variety infections are the most common causes of swelling of the lymph nodes, for example, strep throat, ear infections, and mononucleosis. More serious medical problems such as HIV infection, lymphomas (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) or other cancers, or lupus may cause swollen lymph glands. Rarely, a medication can cause the problem. Symptoms associated with lymph node swelling and related diseases can include pain in the area of the swelling, fever, and fatigue. Not all swollen lymph nodes are abnormal."
What are lymph nodes? What do they do?," Lymph nodes are an important part of the body's immune system and to help fight infections. Swollen lymph nodes usually caused by infection are referred to as lymphadenitis. Lymph nodes (sometimes called lymph glands) are small, soft, round, or oval structures found throughout the body and connected to each other in chain- Lymph is a watery fluid that circulates within the lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are found near these vessels. Within the capsule, lymph nodes contain certain kinds of immune cells. These cells are mainly lymphocytes, which produce proteins that capture and fight viruses and other microbes, and macrophages, which destroy and remove the captured material."
Where are the lymph nodes located in the body (pictures)?,"'Lymph nodes are located throughout the body. Some are directly under the skin while others are deep inside the body. Even the most superficial (close to the skin) lymph nodes usually are not visible or palpable (felt by touching), unless they are swollen or enlarged. Lymph nodes are connected to each other by loosely bound lymphatic essels. Lymph nodes generally coalesce in different regions in the body where they are responsible for filtering the blood and performing their immunologic function for that particular area of the body. Fluid from the lymphatic vessels eventually feeds into the venous system (veins) in the body.' "
Are swollen lymph nodes painful?,"'In general, swollen lymph nodes caused by infections, inflammation, or cancers can be painful or tender. Some benign causes of swollen lymph nodes may not be painful.' "
Common locations of swollen lymph nodes,"'Lymph nodes in various parts of the body may become swollen for different reasons. People can often see swollen lymph nodes''Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw:'' Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw are the most common. They may represent an infection around that area, such as a tooth infection or ''abscess'', throat infection, viral illness, or ''upper respiratory infection''. Most of the causes of swollen lymph nodes in this area are benign (noncancerous) but sometimes swelling of these lymph nodes may also suggest a ''cancer'' in the head and neck area.''Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear and in the occipital area (base of the skull):'' Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear or in the base of the skull may correspond to an infection around the ''scalp'' or possibly an eye (''conjunctival'') infection. The most common cause of swollen scalp lymph nodes are ''skin conditions'' affecting the scalp, such as ''dandruff'' (''seborrheic dermatitis''); or an abscess, or soft tissue infection.''The lymph nodes in the underarm (armpit, axilla):'' The lymph nodes in the underarm are anatomically important in ''breast cancer''. They are often checked physically in patients undergoing investigation for ''breast cancer''. They also play an important role in staging (determining the extent) and predicting the outcome of ''breast cancer'' during removal of the ''cancer'' tissue from the breast. Many cancers including lymphoma and ''leukemia'' can cause enlargement of these lymph nodes. (Lymphomas are cancers that originate in the lymph nodes.) These lymph nodes can also become reactive and enlarge due to ''trauma'' to or an infection of the arm on the same side.''Enlarged lymph nodes'' above the collarbone:'' Enlarged lymph nodes above the collarbone (supraclavicular ''lymphadenopathy'') are always considered abnormal. These generally suggest a ''cancer'' of or an infection in the region close by. Examples include lung infection, ''lung cancer'', lymphoma in the chest ''cavity'', or breast cancer. Occasionally cancers that are more distant may seed these lymph nodes, such as genital cancers or ''colon cancer''. Some inflammatory causes of the swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone (clavicle) can include ''tuberculosis'' or ''sarcoidosis''.''Swollen lymph nodes in the groin:'' Swollen lymph nodes in the groin may be normal in young people but they could also result from some ''sexually transmitted diseases'', local infections, infections of a lower extremity (including the foot and toes), or genital cancers.' on the neck, behind the ear, at the base of the skull (occipital area), under the jaw, above the collar bone, under the arms, and around the groin."
How do you check for swollen lymph nodes?,"'Usually lymph nodes are not visible. Once they enlarge, they can become visible in certain areas of the body. Especially behind the ear, or in your neck or groin, you might notice them as enlarged ""''bumps''."" Enlarged lymph glands can also often be felt by slowly moving your hands around the swollen area. You can determine if they are tender or not.' "
What infections and viruses cause swollen lymph nodes?,"'There are many causes for swollen lymph nodes, sometimes referred to as ""swollen glands"" (lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis). In general, lymph nodes become swollen when they are active due to either a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, inflammation, or cancer.''Viral infections are the most common causes of swollen lymph nodes. The most common cause is viral upper respiratory infections such as the ''common cold''.''Viruses that can cause swollen lymph nodes include:'

"What bacteria, parasites, and fungi cause swollen lymph nodes?","'There are many different causes of swollen lymph glands or nodes, for example:''Bacteria''Parasites' Streptococcus Staphylococcus Cat scratch disease Tuberculosis Syphilis Chlamydia Other sexually transmitted diseases Toxoplasmosis Leishmaniasis Coccidiomycosis Histoplasmosis"
"Inflammatory diseases, cancers, and other conditions that cause swollen lymph nodes","'Inflammatory and immunologic causes of swollen lymph nodes include diseases such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''lupus'' as well as sensitivity to some medications.''Many cancers can also cause swelling of lymph nodes. These cancers may originate from the lymph nodes or blood cells such as lymphomas and some types of ''leukemia''. They may also be cancers that spread from another organ in the body (metastatic cancers). For example, breast cancer may spread to the nearest lymph nodes in the underarm (axilla), or ''lung cancer'' may spread to the lymph nodes around the collarbone.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic ''lipid'' storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, ''sarcoidosis'', and many other conditions.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic lipid storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, sarcoidosis, and various other conditions.''Lymph node swelling is not always a sign of an underlying disease. Sometimes swollen lymph nodes can be normal. For example, small (less than 1 centimeter), flat lymph nodes under the jaw (submandibular lymph nodes) in healthy children and young adults or small (up to 2 centimeters), groin lymph nodes (inguinal lymph nodes) in young individuals may be normal.''In many instances, a definitive cause for swollen lymph nodes may not be determined even after performing through examination and testing.' "
Signs and symptoms of swollen lymph nodes,"'Symptoms of swollen lymph nodes vary widely. A person could be completely free of symptoms (asymptomatic) and swollen lymph nodes are may only be found when a doctor notes them during a general physical examination.''Sometimes, swollen lymph nodes can be extremely tender, painful, and disfiguring.''Other signs and symptoms related to an underlying disease that accompany the lymph node swelling may be more significant and clinically relevant than the lymph node swelling alone. Signs and symptoms of more serious medical conditions that may cause swollen lymph nodes may include:'   Fever Night sweats Weight loss Loss of appetite Abdominal pain Swelling of multiple lymph nodes or only an isolated one Localized red patches of the skin over the lymph nodes Hard lumps or masses felt under the skin in the area of the swollen lymph node Sore throat or runny nose Local infections (toothache, sore throat)"
When should I see the doctor for swollen lymph nodes?," If you notice swollen lymph nodes, see your primary care doctor for an evaluation and possible treatment. Depending on the reason for the swelling of the lymph nodes, you might need treatment by a hematologist/oncologist (if the swollen lymph nodes can't be explained or are due to an underlying cancer) or an infectious disease specialist (if they are due to a complicated infection). Sometimes you might be referred to a surgeon to biopsy or remove the lymph node. If swollen lymph nodes are associated with fevers, night sweats, or weight loss, and the person does not have any obvious infection, he or she may need a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. People who were appropriately treated for an infection but have persistent swollen lymph nodes should see their doctor. If a person has a known cancer, or was treated for one in the past and new lymph nodes in the general area of the cancer are noted, see a doctor."
How is the cause of swollen lymph nodes diagnosed?,"""Swollen lymph nodes closer to the surface of the body are generally diagnosed by a doctor's examination and feeling for areas known to have coalescence of lymph nodes, for example, swollen lymph nodes under the arms (axillary lymph nodes), swollen lymph nodes in the sides of the neck (cervical lymph nodes), or swollen lymph nodes in the groin (inguinal lymph nodes). These swollen lymph nodes can be seen and felt easily.""'Other times, deeper lymph nodes could be seen on imaging studies, such as ''CT scan'' (computed tomography), of different parts of the body.''Tonsils'' in the back of the throat are also lymph nodes, and they are the most visible ones in the body.''Diagnosing the cause of swollen lymph nodes may be challenging. The most important component of evaluating a swollen lymph node is a thorough medical history and a complete physical examination by a doctor. The doctor may ask about symptoms such as ''sore throat'', fever and ''chills'', ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'"", a complete list of medications, sexual activity, vaccination history, recent travels, and the patient's own and his/her family's previous history of cancers if any.""'A group of lymph nodes in a particular area of the body reacts to disturbances in that general region. If there is a specific infection in the region of the swollen lymph nodes, that may be the most likely cause of swelling. For instance, infections of the leg or some sexually transmitted diseases can cause swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin area.''Physicians usually examine the lymph nodes by feeling them and characterize them based upon what the lymph nodes feel like. They could be characterized, for example, as:''These characteristics can be useful in suggesting the cause of the lymph node swelling.

What are treatments and remedies for swollen lymph nodes?,"'There is no specific treatment for swollen lymph nodes. The underlying cause needs to be treated, which may result in the resolution of the swollen lymph node.' If an enlarged lymph node causes local discomfort, home remedies include a warm, wet compress to help with pain relief. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used to help reduce swelling and pain. Prescription corticosteroid medications such as Prednisone, Medrol or Decadron may also be used for swelling. Viral infections may be treated with antiviral medications. Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for cancer may consist of chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Medications to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus may be prescribed."
How long does it take swollen lymph nodes to resolve (go away )?,"'The time it takes for a swollen lymph node to go away varies widely and depends on the underlying cause.' If an infection causes swollen lymph nodes, they may resolve in a few weeks. However, it is common for lymph nodes to remain enlarged for time even after an infection has been treated. If swollen lymph nodes are a result of an autoimmune disorder, they may shrink in size during periods of remission and then enlarge again when the illness flares up. If swollen lymph nodes are due to cancers, it depends on the type and stage of the cancer and whether it has metastasized (spread) to other parts of the body and the lymph nodes may remain enlarged for the duration of the treatment."
What are the complications of swollen lymph nodes?,"'There may be complications associated with enlarged lymph nodes. If the lymph node swelling is related to an infection that is not treated, then an abscess (a pus-containing ''cavity'') may result, which may require incisional drainage and antibiotics. The skin underlying the enlarged lymph node may also become infected.''In other cases, the lymph node may become very large and compress other nearby structures in the body. This could be a serious and debilitating problem that may require immediate medical or surgical attention. For example, the lymph node in the underarm (axilla) can compress the blood vessels and nerves supplying the arm. An enlarged lymph node inside the abdomen may compress the ''intestines'' and cause an obstruction of the intestines.'  "
What should I know about swollen lymph nodes (glands)?," Lymph nodes, also referred to as lymph glands, are important part of the immune system. Lymph nodes are located throughout the body but are visible and able to be felt (palpable) only when they are enlarged or swollen. Lymph nodes are regional, and each group of them corresponds to a particular region of the body and reflects abnormalities in that region. Common areas where swollen lymph nodes are more prominent and more readily noticeable are:Behind the earIn the neckThe groinUnder the chinIn the armpits Behind the ear In the neck The groin Under the chin In the armpits Doctors and other health care professionals check these areas for enlarged or swollen lymph nodes. A wide variety infections are the most common causes of swelling of the lymph nodes, for example, strep throat, ear infections, and mononucleosis. More serious medical problems such as HIV infection, lymphomas (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) or other cancers, or lupus may cause swollen lymph glands. Rarely, a medication can cause the problem. Symptoms associated with lymph node swelling and related diseases can include pain in the area of the swelling, fever, and fatigue. Not all swollen lymph nodes are abnormal."
What are lymph nodes? What do they do?," Lymph nodes are an important part of the body's immune system and to help fight infections. Swollen lymph nodes usually caused by infection are referred to as lymphadenitis. Lymph nodes (sometimes called lymph glands) are small, soft, round, or oval structures found throughout the body and connected to each other in chain- Lymph is a watery fluid that circulates within the lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are found near these vessels. Within the capsule, lymph nodes contain certain kinds of immune cells. These cells are mainly lymphocytes, which produce proteins that capture and fight viruses and other microbes, and macrophages, which destroy and remove the captured material."
Where are the lymph nodes located in the body (pictures)?,"'Lymph nodes are located throughout the body. Some are directly under the skin while others are deep inside the body. Even the most superficial (close to the skin) lymph nodes usually are not visible or palpable (felt by touching), unless they are swollen or enlarged. Lymph nodes are connected to each other by loosely bound lymphatic essels. Lymph nodes generally coalesce in different regions in the body where they are responsible for filtering the blood and performing their immunologic function for that particular area of the body. Fluid from the lymphatic vessels eventually feeds into the venous system (veins) in the body.' "
Are swollen lymph nodes painful?,"'In general, swollen lymph nodes caused by infections, inflammation, or cancers can be painful or tender. Some benign causes of swollen lymph nodes may not be painful.' "
Common locations of swollen lymph nodes,"'Lymph nodes in various parts of the body may become swollen for different reasons. People can often see swollen lymph nodes''Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw:'' Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw are the most common. They may represent an infection around that area, such as a tooth infection or ''abscess'', throat infection, viral illness, or ''upper respiratory infection''. Most of the causes of swollen lymph nodes in this area are benign (noncancerous) but sometimes swelling of these lymph nodes may also suggest a ''cancer'' in the head and neck area.''Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear and in the occipital area (base of the skull):'' Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear or in the base of the skull may correspond to an infection around the ''scalp'' or possibly an eye (''conjunctival'') infection. The most common cause of swollen scalp lymph nodes are ''skin conditions'' affecting the scalp, such as ''dandruff'' (''seborrheic dermatitis''); or an abscess, or soft tissue infection.''The lymph nodes in the underarm (armpit, axilla):'' The lymph nodes in the underarm are anatomically important in ''breast cancer''. They are often checked physically in patients undergoing investigation for ''breast cancer''. They also play an important role in staging (determining the extent) and predicting the outcome of ''breast cancer'' during removal of the ''cancer'' tissue from the breast. Many cancers including lymphoma and ''leukemia'' can cause enlargement of these lymph nodes. (Lymphomas are cancers that originate in the lymph nodes.) These lymph nodes can also become reactive and enlarge due to ''trauma'' to or an infection of the arm on the same side.''Enlarged lymph nodes'' above the collarbone:'' Enlarged lymph nodes above the collarbone (supraclavicular ''lymphadenopathy'') are always considered abnormal. These generally suggest a ''cancer'' of or an infection in the region close by. Examples include lung infection, ''lung cancer'', lymphoma in the chest ''cavity'', or breast cancer. Occasionally cancers that are more distant may seed these lymph nodes, such as genital cancers or ''colon cancer''. Some inflammatory causes of the swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone (clavicle) can include ''tuberculosis'' or ''sarcoidosis''.''Swollen lymph nodes in the groin:'' Swollen lymph nodes in the groin may be normal in young people but they could also result from some ''sexually transmitted diseases'', local infections, infections of a lower extremity (including the foot and toes), or genital cancers.' on the neck, behind the ear, at the base of the skull (occipital area), under the jaw, above the collar bone, under the arms, and around the groin."
How do you check for swollen lymph nodes?,"'Usually lymph nodes are not visible. Once they enlarge, they can become visible in certain areas of the body. Especially behind the ear, or in your neck or groin, you might notice them as enlarged ""''bumps''."" Enlarged lymph glands can also often be felt by slowly moving your hands around the swollen area. You can determine if they are tender or not.' "
What infections and viruses cause swollen lymph nodes?,"'There are many causes for swollen lymph nodes, sometimes referred to as ""swollen glands"" (lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis). In general, lymph nodes become swollen when they are active due to either a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, inflammation, or cancer.''Viral infections are the most common causes of swollen lymph nodes. The most common cause is viral upper respiratory infections such as the ''common cold''.''Viruses that can cause swollen lymph nodes include:'

These cancers may originate from the lymph nodes or blood cells such as lymphomas and some types of ''leukemia''. They may also be cancers that spread from another organ in the body (metastatic cancers). For example, breast cancer may spread to the nearest lymph nodes in the underarm (axilla), or ''lung cancer'' may spread to the lymph nodes around the collarbone.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic ''lipid'' storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, ''sarcoidosis'', and many other conditions.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic lipid storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, sarcoidosis, and various other conditions.''Lymph node swelling is not always a sign of an underlying disease. Sometimes swollen lymph nodes can be normal.

Signs and symptoms of swollen lymph nodes,"'Symptoms of swollen lymph nodes vary widely. A person could be completely free of symptoms (asymptomatic) and swollen lymph nodes are may only be found when a doctor notes them during a general physical examination.''Sometimes, swollen lymph nodes can be extremely tender, painful, and disfiguring.''Other signs and symptoms related to an underlying disease that accompany the lymph node swelling may be more significant and clinically relevant than the lymph node swelling alone. Signs and symptoms of more serious medical conditions that may cause swollen lymph nodes may include:'   Fever Night sweats Weight loss Loss of appetite Abdominal pain Swelling of multiple lymph nodes or only an isolated one Localized red patches of the skin over the lymph nodes Hard lumps or masses felt under the skin in the area of the swollen lymph node Sore throat or runny nose Local infections (toothache, sore throat)"
When should I see the doctor for swollen lymph nodes?," If you notice swollen lymph nodes, see your primary care doctor for an evaluation and possible treatment. Depending on the reason for the swelling of the lymph nodes, you might need treatment by a hematologist/oncologist (if the swollen lymph nodes can't be explained or are due to an underlying cancer) or an infectious disease specialist (if they are due to a complicated infection). Sometimes you might be referred to a surgeon to biopsy or remove the lymph node. If swollen lymph nodes are associated with fevers, night sweats, or weight loss, and the person does not have any obvious infection, he or she may need a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. People who were appropriately treated for an infection but have persistent swollen lymph nodes should see their doctor. If a person has a known cancer, or was treated for one in the past and new lymph nodes in the general area of the cancer are noted, see a doctor."
How is the cause of swollen lymph nodes diagnosed?,"""Swollen lymph nodes closer to the surface of the body are generally diagnosed by a doctor's examination and feeling for areas known to have coalescence of lymph nodes, for example, swollen lymph nodes under the arms (axillary lymph nodes), swollen lymph nodes in the sides of the neck (cervical lymph nodes), or swollen lymph nodes in the groin (inguinal lymph nodes).

What is glaucoma?,"'Glaucoma is a disease of the major nerve of vision, called the optic nerve. The optic nerve receives light-generated nerve impulses from the retina and transmits these to the brain, where we recognize those electrical signals as vision. Glaucoma is characterized by a particular pattern of progressive damage to the optic nerve that generally begins with a subtle loss of side vision (peripheral vision). If glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it can progress to loss of ''central vision'' and blindness.''Glaucoma is usually, but not always, associated with elevated pressure in the eye (intraocular pressure). Generally, it is this elevated eye pressure that leads to damage of the eye (optic) nerve. In some cases, glaucoma may occur in the presence of normal eye pressure. This form of glaucoma is believed to be caused by poor regulation of blood flow to the optic nerve.' "
How common is glaucoma?,"'Worldwide, glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness. In fact, as many as 6 million individuals are blind in both eyes from this disease. In the United States alone, according to one estimate, more than 3 million people have glaucoma. As many as half of these individuals with glaucoma may not know that they have the disease. The reason they are unaware of the presence of the disease is that glaucoma initially causes no symptoms, and the subsequent loss of side vision (peripheral vision) is usually not recognized.' "
What causes glaucoma?,"'Elevated pressure in the eye is the main factor leading to glaucomatous damage to the eye (optic) nerve. Glaucoma with normal intraocular pressure is discussed below in the section on the different types of glaucoma. The optic nerve, which is located in the back of the eye, is the main visual nerve for the eye. This nerve transmits the images we see back to the brain for interpretation. The eye is firm and round, like a basketball. Its tone and shape are maintained by a pressure within the eye (the intraocular pressure), which normally ranges between 8 millimeters (mm) and 22 mm of mercury. When the pressure is too low, the eye becomes softer, while elevated pressure causes the eye to become harder. The optic nerve is the most susceptible part of the eye to high pressure because the delicate fibers in this nerve are easily damaged either by direct pressure on the nerve or decreased blood flow to the nerve.''The front of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called the aqueous humor, which provides nourishment to the structures in the front of the eye. This fluid is produced constantly by the ciliary body, which surrounds the ''lens'' of the eye. The aqueous humor then flows through the pupil and leaves the eye through tiny drainage channels called the trabecular meshwork. These channels are located at what is called the drainage angle of the eye. This angle is where the clear ''cornea'', which covers the front of the eye, attaches to the base (root or periphery) of the ''iris'', which is the colored part of the eye. The cornea covers the iris and the pupil, which are in front of the lens. The pupil is the small, round, black-appearing opening in the center of the iris. Light passes through the pupil, on through the lens, and to the retina at the back of the eye. Please see the figure, which is a diagram that shows the drainage angle of the eye.''Legend for figure'': This diagram of the front part of the eye is in cross-section to show the filtering, or drainage, angle. This angle is between the cornea and the iris, which join each other right where the drainage channels (trabecular meshwork) are located. The arrow shows the flow of the aqueous fluid from the ciliary body, through the pupil, and into the drainage channels. This figure is recreated from ''Understanding and Treating Glaucoma'', a book by Tim Peters and Company Inc., Gladstone N.J.''In most people, the drainage angles are wide open, but in some individuals, they can be narrow. For example, the usual angle is about 45 degrees, whereas a narrow-angle is about 25 degrees or less. After exiting through the trabecular meshwork in the drainage angle, the aqueous fluid then drains into tiny blood vessels (capillaries) into the main bloodstream. The aqueous humor should not be confused with tears, which are produced by the lacrimal glands under the upper ''eyelid'' outside of the eyeball itself.'""This process of producing and removing the fluid from the eye is similar to that of a sink with the faucet always turned on, producing and draining the water. If the sink's drain becomes clogged, the water may overflow. If this sink were a closed system, as is the eye, and unable to overflow, the pressure within the sink would rise. Likewise, if the eye's trabecular meshwork becomes clogged or blocked, the intraocular pressure may become elevated. Also, if the sink's faucet is too high, the water may overflow. Again, if this sink were a closed system, the pressure within the sink would increase. Likewise, if too much fluid is being produced within the eye, the intraocular pressure may become too high. In either event, since the eye is a closed system, if it cannot adequately remove the increased fluid, the pressure builds up and optic-nerve damage may result."" "
What are glaucoma risk factors?,"'Glaucoma is often called ""the sneak thief of sight."" This is because, as already mentioned, in most cases, the intraocular pressure can build up and destroy sight without causing obvious symptoms. Thus, awareness and early detection of glaucoma are extremely important because this disease can usually be successfully treated when diagnosed early. While everyone is at risk for glaucoma, certain people are at a much higher risk and need to be checked more frequently by their eye doctor. The major risk factors for glaucoma include the following:'   Age over 45 years Family history of glaucoma Black racial ancestry Diabetes History of elevated intraocular pressure Decrease in corneal thickness and rigidity Nearsightedness (high degree of myopia), which is the inability to see distant objects clearly History of injury to the eye Use of cortisone (steroids), either in the eye or systemically (orally or injected) Farsightedness (hyperopia), which is seeing distant objects better than close ones (Farsighted people may have narrow drainage angles, which predispose them to acute [sudden] attacks of angle-closure glaucoma.)"
What are the different types of glaucoma?,"'There are two main types of glaucoma. Most, however, can be classified as either open-angle glaucomas, which are usually conditions of long duration (chronic), or angle-closure (closed-angle) glaucomas, which include conditions occurring both suddenly (acute) and over a long period of time (chronic). Primary glaucoma is not a result of another eye disease, while secondary glaucoma is a result of other ''eye conditions'', ''trauma'', or medication. The glaucomas usually affect both eyes, but the disease can progress more rapidly in one eye than in the other. The involvement of just one eye occurs only when the glaucoma is brought on by factors such as a prior injury, inflammation, or the use of steroids only in that eye.''Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)'' is by far the most common type of glaucoma. Moreover, its frequency increases greatly with age and it is a chronic, not acute, disease. This increase occurs because the drainage mechanism gradually may become clogged secondary to ''aging'', even though the drainage angle is open. As a consequence, the aqueous fluid does not drain from the eye properly. The pressure within the eye, therefore, builds up painlessly and without symptoms. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, since the resulting loss of vision starts on the side (peripherally), people are usually not aware of the problem until the loss encroaches near or into their central visual area. This type of glaucoma is said to be primary because its cause cannot be attributed to any discernable structural changes within the eye.''Normal-tension (pressure) glaucoma or low tension glaucoma'' are variants of primary chronic open-angle glaucoma that are being recognized more frequently than in the past. This type of glaucoma is thought to be due to decreased blood flow to the optic nerve. This condition is characterized by progressive optic nerve damage and loss of peripheral vision (visual field) despite intraocular pressures in the normal range or even below normal. This type of glaucoma can be diagnosed by repeated examinations by the eye doctor to detect the nerve damage or the visual field loss.''Congenital glaucoma (infantile glaucoma)'' is a relatively rare, ''inherited'' type of open-angle glaucoma. In this condition, the drainage area is not properly developed before birth. This results in increased pressure in the eye that can lead to the loss of vision from optic nerve damage and also to an enlarged eye. The eye of a young child enlarges in response to increased intraocular pressure because it is more pliable than the eye of an adult. Early diagnosis and treatment with medication and/or surgery are critical in these infants and children to preserve their sight.''Secondary open-angle glaucoma'' is another type of open-angle glaucoma. It can result from an eye (''ocular'') injury, even one that occurred many years ago. Other causes of secondary glaucoma are inflammation in the iris of the eye (''iritis''), ''diabetes'', ''cataracts'', or in steroid- susceptible individuals, the use of topical (drops) or systemic (oral or injected) steroids (cortisone). It can also be associated with a ''retinal detachment'' or retinal vein occlusion or blockage. (The retina is the layer that lines the inside of the back of the eye.) The treatments for the secondary open-angle glaucomas vary, depending on the cause.''Pigmentary glaucoma'' is a type of secondary glaucoma that is more common in younger men. In this condition, for reasons not yet understood, granules of pigment detach from the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. These granules then may block the trabecular meshwork, which, as noted above, is a key element in the drainage system of the eye. Finally, the blocked drainage system leads to elevated intraocular pressure, which results in damage to the optic nerve.''Exfoliative glaucoma'' (pseudoexfoliation or ''PXE'') is another type of glaucoma that can occur with either open or closed angles. This type of glaucoma is characterized by deposits of flaky material on the front surface of the lens (anterior capsule) and in the angle of the eye. The accumulation of this material in the angle is believed to block the drainage system of the eye and raise the eye pressure. While this type of glaucoma can occur in any population, it is more prevalent in older people and people of Scandinavian descent. It has recently been shown to often be associated with ''hearing loss'' in older people.''Angle-closure glaucoma (closed-angle glaucoma) is a less common form of glaucoma in the Western world but is extremely common in Asia. Angle-closure glaucoma may be acute or chronic. The common element in both is that a portion of or the entire drainage angle becomes anatomically closed so that the aqueous fluid within the eye cannot reach all or part of the trabecular meshwork. In ''acute angle-closure glaucoma'"", the patient's intraocular pressure, which ordinarily is normal, can go up very suddenly (acutely). This sudden pressure increase occurs because the drainage angle becomes closed and blocks off all the drainage channels. This type of glaucoma can occur when the pupil dilates (widens or enlarges). As a result, the peripheral edge of the iris can become bunched up against its corneal attachment, thereby causing the drainage angle to close. Thus, the problem in angle-closure glaucoma is the difficulty with access to the eye fluid to the drainage system (trabecular meshwork). In contrast, remember that the problem in open-angle glaucoma is clogging within the drainage system itself. In chronic open-angle glaucoma, portions of the drainage angle remain closed over a long period of time and damage the drainage system. As more and more areas become closed, the pressure within the eye rises, often over a period of months or years.""'People with small eyes are predisposed to developing angle-closure glaucoma because they tend to have narrow drainage angles. Small eyes are not obvious from their appearance, but the size of the eye can be measured by an eye doctor. Thus, individuals who are farsighted or of Asian descent may have smaller eyes, narrow drainage angles, and an increased risk of developing angle-closure glaucoma. Furthermore, this condition may be acutely triggered by medications that can dilate the pupils. These agents can be found in certain eye drops, ''cold'' remedies, ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, ''topiramate'' (''Topamax''), or patches used to prevent seasickness. This condition can also occur spontaneously in a darkened room or a movie theater when the pupil automatically dilates to let in more light. Sometimes, therefore, people with narrow angles are given eye drops to keep their pupils small. (See the section below on parasympathomimetic agents.)''An attack of acute angle-closure glaucoma may be associated with severe ''eye pain'' and ''headache'', a red (inflamed) eye, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and blurry vision. In addition, the high intraocular pressure leads to corneal swelling (''edema''), which causes the patient to see haloes around lights. Sometimes, acute glaucoma is treated with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. (See the section below on these medications.) An attack of acute glaucoma, however, is usually relieved by eye surgery. In this operation, the doctor makes a small hole in the iris with a laser (laser iridotomy) to allow the fluid to resume draining into its normal outflow channels.' "
What are glaucoma symptoms and signs?,"'Patients with open-angle glaucoma and chronic angle-closure glaucoma in general have no symptoms early in the course of the disease. Visual field loss (side ''vision loss'') is not a symptom until late in the course of the disease. Rarely patients with fluctuating levels of intraocular pressure may have haziness of vision and see haloes around lights, especially in the morning.''On the other hand, the symptoms of acute angle-closure are often extremely dramatic with the rapid onset of severe eye ''pain'', ''headache'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', and visual blurring. Occasionally, the nausea and vomiting exceed the ocular symptoms to the extent that an ocular cause is not considered when attempting to make a diagnosis.''The eyes of patients with open-angle glaucoma or chronic angle-closure glaucoma may appear normal in the mirror or to family or friends. Some patients get slightly ''red eyes'' from the chronic use of eyedrops. The ophthalmologist, on examining the patient, may find elevated intraocular pressure, optic-nerve abnormalities, or visual field loss in addition to other less common signs.''The eyes of patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma will appear red, and the pupil of the eye may be large and nonreactive to light. The cornea may appear cloudy to the naked eye. The ophthalmologist will typically find decreased visual acuity, corneal swelling, highly elevated intraocular pressure, and a closed drainage angle.'  "
What specialists treat glaucoma?,'Ophthalmologists diagnose and medically and surgically treat glaucoma. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who has undergone additional training to specialize in diseases and surgery of the eye.' 
How do physicians diagnose glaucoma?,"'An eye doctor (ophthalmologist) can usually detect those individuals who are at risk for glaucoma (because of, for example, a narrow drainage angle or increased intraocular pressure) before nerve damage occurs. The doctor also can diagnose patients who already have glaucoma by observing their nerve damage or visual field loss. The following six tests, all of which are painless, maybe part of this evaluation.'  Tonometry determines the pressure in the eye by measuring the tone or firmness of its surface. Several types of tonometers are available for this test, the most common being the applanation tonometer. After the eye has been numbed with anesthetic eye drops, the tonometer's sensor is placed against the front surface of the eye. The firmer the tone of the surface of the eye, the higher the pressure reading. Pachymetry measures the thickness of the cornea. After the eye has been numbed with anesthetic eye drops, the pachymeter tip is touched lightly to the front surface of the eye (cornea). Studies have shown that corneal thickness can affect the measurement of intraocular pressure. Thicker corneas may give falsely high eye pressure readings and thinner corneas may give falsely low-pressure readings. Furthermore, thin corneas may be an additional risk factor for glaucoma. Once a doctor knows the thickness of a patient's cornea, he or she can more accurately interpret the patient's tonometry. Gonioscopy is done by numbing the eye with anesthetic drops and placing a special type of contact lens with mirrors onto the surface of the eye. The mirrors enable the doctor to view the interior of the eye from different directions. The purpose of this test is to examine the drainage angle and drainage area of the eye. In this procedure, the doctor can determine whether the angle is open or narrow and find any other abnormalities, such as increased pigment in the angle or long-standing damage to the angle from prior inflammation or injury. As indicated earlier, individuals with narrow angles have an increased risk for a sudden closure of the angle, which can cause an acute angle-closure glaucomatous attack. Gonioscopy can also determine whether the eye is subject to chronic angle closure, whether blood vessels are abnormal, or whether hidden tumors might be blocking the drainage of the aqueous fluid out of the eye. Ophthalmoscopy is an examination in which the doctor uses a handheld device, a head-mounted device, or a special lens and the slit lamp to look directly through the pupil (the opening in the colored iris) into the eye. This procedure is done to examine the optic nerve (seen as the optic disc) at the back of the eye. Damage to the optic nerve, called cupping of the disc, can be detected in this way. Cupping, which is an indentation of the optic disc, can be caused by increased intraocular pressure. Asymmetry in the degree of optic nerve cupping between the two eyes can be a sign of glaucoma, as an increase in optic nerve cupping over a period of time. Additionally, the pale color of the nerve can suggest damage to the nerve from poor blood flow or increased intraocular pressure. Special cameras can be used to take photographs of the optic nerve to compare changes over time. Visual field testing actually maps the visual fields to detect any early (or late) signs of glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve. In order to find and follow glaucoma, visual fields are measured by a computer one eye at a time. One eye is covered and the patient places his or her chin in a type of bowl. Lights of various intensity and size are randomly projected around the inside of the bowl. When the patient sees a light, he or she pushes a button. This process produces a computerized map of the visual field, outlining the areas where each eye can or cannot see. In glaucoma, there are characteristic changes in the visual field examination. Confocal laser scanning systems and optical coherence tomography are noninvasive imaging systems that create a three-dimensional image of the optic nerve and retina to evaluate the degree of cupping and the thicknesses of the retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layers to better evaluate and quantify the presence of ocular damage from all types of glaucoma."
How often should someone be screened for glaucoma?,"""The following are the American Academy of Ophthalmology's recommended intervals for eye exams:""'These routine screening eye examinations are mandatory since glaucoma usually causes no symptoms (asymptomatic) in its early stages. Once damage to the optic nerve has occurred, it cannot be reversed. Thus, in order to preserve vision, glaucoma must be diagnosed early and followed regularly. Patients with glaucoma need to be aware that it is a lifelong disease. Compliance with scheduled visits to the eye doctor and with prescribed medication regimens offers the best chance for maintaining vision.' Age 20 to 29: Individuals of African descent (African-Americans) or with a family history of glaucoma should have an eye examination every three to five years. Others should have an eye exam at least once during this period. Age 30 to 39: Individuals of African descent or with a family history of glaucoma should have an eye examination every two to four years. Others should have an eye exam at least twice during this period. Age 40 to 64: Individuals should have an eye examination every two to four years. Age 65 or older: Individuals should have an eye examination every one to two years."
What is the treatment for glaucoma?,"'Although nerve damage and visual loss from glaucoma cannot usually be reversed, glaucoma is a disease that can generally be controlled. That is, treatment can make the intraocular pressure normal and, therefore, prevent or retard further nerve damage and visual loss. Treatment may involve the use of eyedrop medications, pills (rarely), laser, or incisional surgery.''In the United States, eyedrop medications are usually used first in treating most types of open-angle glaucoma. In contrast, in Europe, laser or surgery is sometimes the first choice of treatment. One or more types of eyedrops may have to be taken up to several times a day to lower intraocular pressure. These drops work either by reducing the production of the aqueous fluid (shutting the faucet) or by increasing the drainage of the fluid out of the eye. Each type of therapy has its benefits and potential complications.''It is important to remember that many patients at risk for glaucoma or who have glaucoma also may have other eye diseases such as ''cataract'' or ''macular degeneration''. An ophthalmologist can determine whether any visual loss that one is experiencing is being caused by glaucoma or by other eye abnormalities.''There are many patients whose examination reveals elevated eye pressure and increased risk for glaucoma but no definite evidence of eye damage from glaucoma. These patients have what is termed ocular ''hypertension'' (OHT), formerly known as ""pre-glaucoma"" or ""glaucoma suspect."" Patients with OHT have no visual field loss but are at increased risk of glaucoma because of the presence of elevated intraocular pressure or optic nerve changes visible on ophthalmoscopy or imaging. Some of the patients with OHT require treatment. These patients with OHT need to be observed frequently so that treatment can be initiated prior to the onset of glaucomatous damage.'  "
What medications (eyedrops) treat glaucoma?,"'Beta-adrenergic antagonists act against, or block, adrenaline-like substances. These drops work in the treatment of glaucoma by reducing the production of the aqueous humor. For years, they were the gold standard (to which other agents are compared) for treating glaucoma. A few of these medications are ''timolol'' (''Timoptic''), levobunolol (Betagan), carteolol (''Ocupress''), and metipranolol (''Optipranolol'').''Used once or twice daily, these drops are very effective. However, side effects, such as the worsening of ''asthma'' or ''emphysema'', bradycardia (slow ''heart'' rate), ''low blood pressure'', ''fatigue'', and ''impotence'' prohibit their use in some patients. ''Betaxolol'' (''Betoptic'') is a beta-adrenergic antagonist that is more selective in working just on the eye and, therefore, carries less risk of heart (cardiac) or lung (pulmonary) side effects than other drops of this type.''Prostaglandin analogs'"" are similar in chemical structure to the body's prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that are involved in a wide range of functions throughout the body. These drops work in glaucoma by increasing the outflow (drainage) of fluid from the eye.""'The prostaglandin analogs have replaced ''beta-blockers'' as the most commonly prescribed drops for glaucoma. They can be used just once a day. This class of medications has fewer systemic (involving the rest of the body) side effects than ''beta blockers'', but can change the color of the iris as well as thicken and darken the eyelashes. In addition, some atrophy of the fat around the eye may occur. These drops are also more likely to cause ''redness of the eyes'' than some other classes of eye drops. In some patients, they may also cause inflammation inside the eye. Examples of these medications include ''latanoprost'' (''Xalatan''), travoprost (''Travatan''), ''bimatoprost'' (''Lumigan''), and tafluprost (Zioptan).''Adrenergic agonists'' are a type of drops that act like adrenaline. They work in glaucoma by both reducing the production of fluid by the eye and increasing its outflow (drainage). The most popular adrenergic agonist is ''brimonidine'' (''Alphagan''). However, there is at least a 12% risk of significant local (eye) ''allergic'' reactions. Other members of this class of drops include epinephrine, dipivefrin (Propine), and apraclonidine (''Iopidine'').''Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors'' work in glaucoma by reducing the production of fluid in the eye. Eyedrop forms of this type of medication include ''dorzolamide'' (''Trusopt'') and brinzolamide (''Azopt''). They are used two or three times daily. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be rarely taken as pills (systemically) to remove fluid from the body, including the eye. Oral forms of these medications used for glaucoma include ''acetazolamide'' (''Diamox'') and ''methazolamide'' (''Neptazane''). Their use in this condition, however, is limited due to their systemic (throughout the body) side effects, including reduction of body potassium, ''kidney stones'', numbness or tingling sensations in the lips, arms, and legs, ''fatigue'', and nausea.''Parasympathomimetic agents,'' which are also called ''miotics'' because they narrow (constrict) the pupils, act by opposing ''adrenalin''-like substances. They work in glaucoma by increasing the aqueous outflow from the eye.''The parasympathomimetics were used for many years to treat glaucoma, but because of the development of beta-blockers and prostaglandins, they are now used infrequently because they need to be used three to four times a day and produce side effects in the eye. These side effects include a small pupil, ''blurred vision'', an aching brow, and an increased risk of ''retinal detachment''. Currently, ''pilocarpine'' is used primarily to keep the pupil small in patients with a particular iris configuration (plateau iris) or in patients with a narrow angle prior to laser iridotomy. (See the section above on angle-closure glaucoma.)''Osmotic agents'' are an additional class of medications used to treat sudden (acute) forms of glaucoma where the eye pressure remains extremely high despite other treatments. These medications include isosorbide (Ismotic, given by mouth) and ''mannitol'' (''Osmitrol''), given through the veins. These medications must be used cautiously as they have significant side effects, including nausea, fluid accumulation in the heart and/or ''lungs'' (''congestive heart failure'' and/or ''pulmonary edema''), bleeding in the brain, and kidney problems. Their use is prohibited in patients with uncontrolled ''diabetes'', heart, kidney, or ''liver'' problems.''Ophthalmologists often prescribe an eyedrop containing more than one class of drug to patients who require more than one type of drug for control of their glaucoma. This simplifies the taking of drops by the patient. Examples of these include the combination of timolol and dorzolamide in the same drop (Cosopt), the combination of timolol and brimonidine in the same drop (Combigan), and the combination of brinzolamide and brimonidine in the same drop (Simbrinza). Combination drops that include both beta-adrenergic antagonists and prostaglandin analogs are available in Europe and Japan but have not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the U.S.''Several new classes of glaucoma drops have recently been approved by the FDA and will soon be available for use in patients with glaucoma. These include a nitrous oxide donating medication combined with a prostaglandin (Latanoprostene and a rho-kinase [Rhopressa]). Although ''marijuana'' use has been shown to reduce intraocular pressure, eyedrops are available that accomplish the same purpose and with greater efficacy and less systemic risk.' "
What types of surgery or laser therapy treat glaucoma?,"'There are several forms of laser therapy for glaucoma. ''Laser iridotomy'' (see the section above on angle-closure glaucoma) involves making a hole in the colored part of the eye (iris) to allow fluid to drain normally in eyes with narrow or closed angles. Argon laser trabeculoplasty and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) are laser procedures performed only in eyes with open angles. ''Laser trabeculoplasty'' does not cure glaucoma, but may be done instead of increasing the number of different eyedrops, or may be recommended when a patient is already using multiple eyedrops (maximal medical therapy). In some cases, it is used as the initial or primary therapy for open-angle glaucoma. This procedure is a quick, relatively painless, and safe method of lowering the intraocular pressure. With the eye numbed by anesthetic drops, the laser treatment is applied through a mirrored contact lens to the angle of the eye. Microscopic laser ''burns'' to the angle allow fluid to better exit the drainage channels.''Laser trabeculoplasty is often done in two sessions, weeks or months apart. Unfortunately, the improved drainage as a result of the treatment may last only about two years, by which time the drainage channels tend to clog again. There are different types of laser trabeculoplasty including argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). ALT is generally not repeated after the second session due to the formation of ''scar tissue'' in the angle. SLT is less likely to produce scarring in the angle, so, theoretically, it can be repeated multiple times. However, the likelihood of success with additional treatments when prior attempts have failed is low. Thus, the options for the patient at that time are to increase the use of eyedrops or proceed to surgery.''Laser cyclo-ablation'' (also known as ciliary body destruction or cyclophotocoagulation) is another form of laser treatment generally reserved for patients with severe forms of glaucoma with poor visual potential. This procedure involves applying laser ''burns'' to the part of the eye that makes the aqueous fluid (ciliary body). This therapy destroys the cells that make the fluid, thereby reducing the eye pressure. This type of laser is typically performed after other more traditional therapies have failed. Cyclocryopexy is the use of freezing, rather than laser, to achieve a similar purpose of reducing aqueous production.''Trabeculectomy'' is a delicate microsurgical procedure used to treat glaucoma. In this operation, a small piece of the clogged trabecular meshwork is removed to create an opening and a new drainage pathway is made for the fluid to exit the eye. As part of this new drainage system, a tiny collecting bag is created from ''conjunctival'' tissue. (The ''conjunctiva'' is the clear covering over the white of the eye.) This bag is called a ""filtering bleb"" and looks like a cystic raised area that is at the top part of the eye under the upper lid. The new drainage system allows fluid to leave the eye, enter the bag/bleb, and then pass into the capillary blood circulation (thereby lowering the eye pressure). Trabeculectomy is the most commonly performed glaucoma surgery. If successful, it is the most effective means of lowering the eye pressure.''Aqueous shunt devices (glaucoma implants or tubes)'' are artificial drainage devices used to lower the eye pressure. They are essentially ''plastic'' microscopic tubes attached to a plastic reservoir. The reservoir (or plate) is placed beneath the conjunctival tissue. The actual tube (which extends from the reservoir) is placed inside the eye to create a new pathway for fluid to exit the eye. This fluid collects within the reservoir beneath the conjunctiva creating a filtering bleb. This procedure may be performed as an alternative to trabeculectomy in patients with certain types of glaucoma. Shunts used today are either valved (Ahmed type) or non-valved (Baerveldt type). Mini shunts without a reservoir are also used to improve safety and reduce the post-surgery chance of pressures that are too low.''In the past few years, ''minimally-invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS)'' has been under development and is more frequently used as a surgical procedure. Various devices such as the Trabectome, the IStent, the CyPass Micro-''Stent'', the Xen glaucoma implant, the Hydrus Microstent, the InnFocus Microshunt, viscocanaloplasty, and gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) have been either approved for human use or are in advanced ''clinical trials''. These provide alternative surgical procedures used to lower eye pressure. These procedures are directed at creating openings in the trabecular meshwork, the drainage ring in the wall of the angle of the eye. These surgeries are less invasive than trabeculectomy and aqueous shunt surgery, have less potential for side effects or complications but may not lower pressure as much.''The surgeon sometimes creates other types of drainage systems. While glaucoma surgery is often effective, complications, such as infection or bleeding, are possible. Accordingly, surgery is usually reserved for cases that cannot otherwise be controlled.'  "
What is the prognosis of glaucoma?,"'The prognosis for glaucoma depends on when the disease is detected. If the diagnosis is made before significant optic nerve damage occurs, the prognosis is generally good if the patient is compliant with the treatment suggested by the ophthalmologist. Since optic nerve damage is permanent and previously damaged optic nerves are more prone to additional damage, a delayed diagnosis (one made after significant optic nerve damage and field loss has already occurred) requires more aggressive therapy and carries a prognosis for future visual loss, which is guarded over the long term.' "
Is it possible to prevent glaucoma?,"'Primary open-angle glaucoma cannot be prevented, given our current state of knowledge. However, the optic-nerve damage and visual loss resulting from glaucoma can be prevented by earlier diagnosis, effective treatment, and compliance with treatment.''Secondary types of glaucoma can often be prevented by avoidance of trauma to the eye and prompt treatment of eye inflammation and other diseases of the eye or body that may cause secondary forms of glaucoma.''Most cases of visual loss from angle-closure glaucomas can be prevented by the appropriate use of laser iridotomy in eyes at risk for the development of acute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma.' "
What is in the future for glaucoma?,"'New eyedrops will continue to become available for the treatment of glaucoma. Some drops will be new classes of agents. Other drops will combine some already existing agents into one bottle to achieve an additive effect and to make it easier and more economical for patients to take their medication. Research is being done at the National Eye Institute and at most medical-school-affiliated institutions.''Although lowering intraocular pressure is still the primary method of treating glaucoma, experts see the disease as more of a neurological condition than an eye disorder. Researchers are investigating the therapeutic role of neuroprotection of the optic nerve, especially in patients who seem to be having progressive nerve damage and visual field loss despite relatively normal intraocular pressures. Animal models have shown that certain chemical mediators can reduce injury or death of nerve cells. Proving such a benefit for the human optic nerve, however, is more difficult because, for one thing, biopsy or tissue specimens are not readily available. Nevertheless, if any of these mediators in eyedrops can be shown to protect the human optic nerve from glaucomatous damage, this would be a wonderful advance in preventing blindness.''In other studies, new surgical methods are being evaluated to lower the intraocular pressure more safely without significant risk of damage to the eye or loss of vision.''Finally, increased efforts to enhance public awareness of glaucoma, national free screenings for those individuals at risk, earlier diagnosis and treatment and better compliance with treatment are our best hopes to reduce vision loss from glaucoma.' "
What causes glaucoma?,"'Glaucoma occurs due to optic nerve damage. The nerve gradually loses function, causing blind spots to develop in the visual field. The exact cause of this is unknown, but it is believed that nerve damage usually occurs due to increased pressure in the eyes.''Eye pressure increases due to'' the build-up of internal fluid (aqueous humor) that flows throughout the eyes. The fluid drains through a tissue called the trabecular meshwork at the angle where the ''iris'' (colored part of the eye) and ''cornea'' meet. If there is an overproduction of the fluid or if the fluid doesn’t drain properly, the fluid builds up causing increased eye pressure.''Risk factors of glaucoma:' High intraocular pressure (eye pressure) Age over 60 years Black, Asian, or Hispanic races  Family history of glaucoma Diabetes Heart disease Hypertension (high blood pressure) Sickle cell anemia Corneas that are thin in the center Myopia (Extreme nearsightedness) or hypermetropia (farsightedness) Trauma History of eye surgery Taking corticosteroid medications, especially eye drops, for a long time"
What are the types of glaucoma?,"'There are several types of glaucoma. These include:' Open-angle glaucoma: This is the most common form of the disease. The drainage angle formed by the cornea and iris remains open, but the trabecular meshwork is partially blocked, causing eye pressure to gradually increase. It may be asymptomatic until vision loss occurs. Angle-closure glaucoma: This is also called closed-angle glaucoma. It occurs when the iris bulges, narrowing or blocking the drainage angle formed by the cornea and iris. Angle-closure glaucoma may occur suddenly (acute angle-closure glaucoma), which is a medical emergency, or gradually (chronic angle-closure glaucoma). Normal-tension glaucoma: The optic nerve gets damaged despite the eye pressure being normal. The exact cause is unknown. It could be due to optic nerve sensitivity or decreased blood supply to the optic nerve. Glaucoma in children: It may be caused by drainage blocks or a developmental eye abnormality. Pigmentary glaucoma: Activities such as running, jogging, or other sports can cause pigment granules from the iris to dislodge and deposit in the trabecular meshwork, blocking fluid drainage and causing increased eye pressure."
What are the signs and symptoms of glaucoma?,"'The signs and symptoms of glaucoma vary depending on the type and stage of your condition:''Open-angle glaucoma:''Acute angle-closure glaucoma:' Patchy blind spots on the peripheral (sides) or central vision, usually in both the eyes Tunnel vision in the advanced stages Severe headache and eye pain Nausea and vomiting Blurring of vision Halos around lights Redness of eyes"
How is glaucoma treated?,"""The damage caused by glaucoma can't be reversed. However, early treatment and regular follow-ups can help delay the progression or prevent vision loss, especially in the early stages. Treatment options include:""'Prescription eye drops:''Oral medications'': Oral medications such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitor may be prescribed.''Surgery and other therapies'':''Treating acute angle-closure glaucoma'': This is a medical emergency and usually will require both emergency medical and laser or other surgical procedures. Laser peripheral iridotomy is a procedure in which a small opening is created in the iris, resulting in improved drainage.''Treatment of underlying medical conditions'': Treatment of medical conditions such as ''diabetes'' and ''hypertension'' that make you prone to glaucoma.' Prostaglandins: These increase the drainage of the aqueous humor (fluid in the eye), resulting in decreased eye pressure. Beta-blockers: These reduce the production of fluid in the eyes, resulting in decreased eye pressure. Alpha-adrenergic agonists: These reduce the production of eye fluid and increase the drainage of fluid.  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: These reduce the production of fluid in the eyes.  Rho-kinase inhibitor: This suppresses the enzyme, rho kinase, responsible for the fluid increase.  Miotic or cholinergic agents: These increase the drainage of eye fluid.  Laser therapy: Laser trabeculoplasty may be done for open-angle glaucoma. A small laser beam is used to open clogged channels in the trabecular meshwork. Trabeculectomy: A part of the trabecular meshwork is removed. Drainage tubes: A small tube/shunt is inserted in the eye to drain excess fluid and lower eye pressure. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS): These procedures reduce eye pressure and usually require less postoperative care and have less risk than trabeculectomy or installing a drainage device. They can be combined with cataract surgery. "
Key Points," Burning mouth syndrome is burning pain in the mouth that may occur every day for months or longer. Doctors and dentists do not have a specific test for burning mouth syndrome, which makes it hard to diagnose. Your doctor or dentist will rule out other conditions before diagnosing burning mouth syndrome. No specific treatment works for all people. However, your doctor can prescribe medicine to help you manage mouth pain, dry mouth, or other symptoms."
Symptoms,"'The main symptom of burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is pain in the mouth that is burning, scalding, or tingling. Or, the pain may happen with a feeling of numbness, which comes and goes. Other symptoms include ''dry mouth'' or altered taste in the mouth.''BMS is a painful condition. Usually, the tongue is affected, but the pain may also be in the lips or roof of the mouth, or throughout the mouth.''BMS pain can last for months or years. Some people feel constant pain every day. For others, pain increases throughout the day. For many people, the pain is reduced when eating or drinking.'  "
Diagnosis,"""BMS is hard to diagnose. One reason is that people with BMS often don't have a mouth problem that the doctor or dentist can see during an exam. Your dentist or doctor may refer you to a specialist. Specialists who diagnose BMS include dentists who specialize in oral medicine or ""'oral surgery''. Other specialists include doctors who are ear, nose, and throat specialists; gastroenterologists; dermatologists; neurologists; ''rheumatologists''; and/or allergists.''The dentist or doctor will review your medical history and examine your mouth. A lot of tests may be needed. Tests may include:' Blood tests to check for certain medical problems Oral swab tests Allergy tests Salivary flow test Biopsy of tissue Imaging tests"
Primary and Secondary BMS,"'Primary BMS'': If tests do not reveal an underlying medical problem, the diagnosis is primary BMS. Experts believe that primary BMS is caused by damage to the nerves that control pain and taste.''Secondary BMS'': Certain medical conditions can cause BMS. Treating the medical problem will cure the secondary BMS. Common causes of secondary BMS include...'   Hormonal changes (such as from diabetes or thyroid problem) Allergies to dental products, dental materials (usually metals), or foods Dry mouth, which can be caused by certain disorders (such as Sjögren's syndrome) and treatments (such as certain drugs and radiation therapy) Certain medicines, such as those that reduce blood pressure Nutritional deficiencies (such as a low level of vitamin B or iron) Infection in the mouth, such as a yeast infection Acid reflux"
Treatment,"'Your doctor will help you get relief. Medicine can help control pain and relieve ''dry mouth''.''Because BMS is a complex pain disorder, the treatment that works for one person may not work for another.''Symptoms of secondary BMS go away when the underlying medical condition, such as ''diabetes'' or ''yeast infection'', is treated. If a drug is causing secondary BMS, then your doctor may switch you to a new medicine.'  "
Helpful Tips,"'To help ease the pain of BMS, sip a cold beverage, suck on ice chips, or chew sugarless gum.''Avoid irritating substances, such as...''Ask your dentist and doctor for other helpful tips.'   Tobacco Hot, spicy foods Alcoholic beverages Mouthwashes that contain alcohol Products high in acid, such as citrus fruits and juices"
What is the glucose tolerance test?,"'Though no longer routinely used for diagnosing ''diabetes''.' The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was the gold standard for making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It is still commonly used during pregnancy for diagnosing gestational diabetes. With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least 8 hours, but not more than 16 hours). The next morning, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives a dose of oral glucose (the dose depends upon the length of the test). There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person drinks. Blood samples are taken up to four times at different time points after consumption of the sugar to measure the blood glucose."
How reliable is the glucose tolerance test?,"'For the glucose tolerance test to give reliable results, the person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a ''common cold''). Also, the person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital) and should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose.' In preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test, the person should eat and drink as they normally would. The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or consume caffeine."
What does the glucose tolerance test measure?,"'The classic oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels five times over a period of three hours. Some physicians simply take a baseline blood sample followed by a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without ''diabetes'', the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with ''diabetes'', glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast.''People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic levels have so-called ''impaired glucose tolerance'' (IGT). People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes.''Each year, 5% to 10% of people whose test results show impaired glucose tolerance actually develop diabetes. ''Weight loss'' and ''exercise'' may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as ''metformin'' (''Glucophage''), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes. Studies have shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the development of ''heart disease'', and whether impaired glucose tolerance turns out to be an entity that deserves treatment itself is something that physicians are currently debating.' "
What is the preparation for a glucose tolerance test?," As mentioned previously, preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test involves fasting overnight (from 8 to 16 hours) and participating normally in activities of daily living. The individual should eat and drink as they normally do prior to the test. The morning of the test, the person should not consume caffeine or smoke."
How are the results of the glucose tolerance test evaluated?,"'Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:' Normal response: A person is said to have a normal 
  response when the two hour glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values 
  between 0 and 2 hours are less than 200 mg/dl. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): A person is said to have impaired 
  glucose tolerance when the fasting plasma glucose is 
  less than 126 mg/dl and the two hour glucose level is between 140 and 199 
  mg/dl. This is sometimes referred to as ""prediabetes"" because people with IGT 
  have a higher risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes: A person has diabetes when two diagnostic 
  tests done on different days show that the blood glucose level is high. This means either the 
  two hour levels is greater than 200 mg/dl or the fasting glucose is noted as greater than 126 mg/dl.
  A 
  glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5% or more also supports a 
  diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes during pregnancy: A pregnant woman has diabetes 
	if she has a fasting plasma glucose of over 92 mg/dl, or a two hour glucose level 
	greater than 153 mg/dl."
What about glucose tolerance testing during pregnancy?,"'As mentioned previously, the glucose tolerance test is used for the diagnosis of ''gestational diabetes'' (diabetes that develops during pregnancy). It may be used if there are equivocal fasting or random blood glucose results, or to screen for gestational diabetes in pregnant women between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation who are not known to have diabetes.\t ''The test may also be used in the postpartum period to detect diabetes in women who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Women who had gestational diabetes do not always develop diabetes later in life, but they should undergo diabetes screening at least every three years throughout their life.\t ' "
What is a gluteal injury? What are the types of gluteal injuries?,"'A gluteal ''contusion'' is a bruise to the muscle area. A gluteal muscle strain is a stretch or partial tear of the muscle or tendon.''Trauma'', either by a fall or a direct blow to the buttock area, causes most gluteal injuries.''Overuse injuries of the hip may cause inflammation and damage to the gluteal muscles that help move the hip or to the tendons that attach the gluteal muscles to the greater trochanter of the hip.' "
What causes a gluteal injury?,"'Falls are a common cause of a gluteal or buttock ''contusion''. In patients who are anticoagulated or on blood thinners, a large amount of bleeding can occur within and around the muscle, causing significant ''pain'' and swelling.''Gluteal muscle and tendon ''strains'' occur because of overuse injuries, usually of the hip joint. Repetitive motions like squatting and lifting at work may cause inflammation in tissues surrounding the hip.''In athletes, gluteal tendinopathies may mimic ''hip bursitis''. Injuries may occur because of overtraining, especially with weightlifting and squats.''Inflammation of the hip, piriformis, ''iliotibial band'', and the gluteus muscles are common ''running'' injuries.' "
What are signs and symptoms of a gluteal injury?,"'Falls or direct blows to the buttock can cause bleeding, inflammation, and swelling. This leads to ''pain'', making it difficult to sit on the buttocks, or stand and/or walk normally because of the decreased range of motion of the hip. When the gluteal muscles are inflamed, movement of the hip joint causes ''pain''. Because of bleeding that may be deep and not immediately apparent on the surface of the skin, inflammation may occur causing the buttock to feel swollen, warm, and become slightly red.'  "
How do medical professionals diagnose a gluteal injury?,"'History is the first important step in helping the health care provider make a diagnosis.''Physical examination will focus on the low back, buttock, and hips.' Was there an injury or fall? It is important that other parts of the body be examined to look for other potential injuries. Did it just happen or has the pain been persistent and ongoing? Is this an acute injury, or has it been a chronic ongoing problem? Is the patient able to walk, and if so, is there a limp? Any fall or blow may be associated with fractures or broken bones of the pelvis, hip, or lower back (sacrum, lumbar spine). Is the patient taking blood thinners? Gluteal injuries may have significant bleeding in these patients. Is there any numbness or tingling or pain that radiates down the leg? The health care professional may check for sciatic nerve inflammation and the cause of gluteal or buttock pain. Has there been any issue with the ability to urinate or have a bowel movement? Acute changes in bowel or bladder function are associated with potential spinal cord injury, like cauda equina syndrome, a medical emergency. Inspection or looking at the buttock area might reveal bruising of the skin or the buttock may appear swollen and red. Palpation, or feeling the buttock, may expose tenderness associated with a contusion. The overlying skin might feel warm. Swelling, redness, and warmth may be due to a gluteal contusion but also might signal a deep infection. Examining the hip may uncover pain with tenderness over the joint line or the greater trochanter. This can be associated with gluteal tendinopathy (inflammation and damage of the gluteus tendon that attach the gluteal muscles to the greater trochanter). An injury may decrease hip range of motion. Moving the hip may cause pain in the buttock due to muscle inflammation and damage. X-rays may be done to look for fractures of the hip, pelvis, and lumbar spine. CT scan or MRI may be considered if the health care professional has a high index of suspicion for a hip fracture, but the plain X-rays are normal. Ultrasound may be helpful to look for a large collection of blood deep in the buttock muscle or to look for an abscess if infection is a concern. Blood tests are not usually done, except for patients who take warfarin (Coumadin) as a blood thinner."
What is the treatment for a gluteal injury?,"'Should the gluteal injury be due to a direct blow or fall, resulting in a contusion, treatment aims to decrease the inflammation in the area.''Ice, elevation, and rest may be helpful. Most commonly, gluteus muscle injuries heal with time and no further treatment.''A rubber donut may be used to decrease the pain of sitting on a swollen buttock''Some patients with gluteal injuries have difficulty sitting on the commode and become constipated. A ''stool softener'' may be considered for a short period of time.''If the gluteal injury is due to overuse, or an abnormal gait (pattern of ''walking''), physical therapy may be considered to prevent further injury and inflammation.''Physical therapy may also be helpful in treating tendinopathies and other inflammation of the gluteus muscles not due to trauma. Treatment modalities may include ''massage'' and ''ultrasound''. Rehab may include exercises to strengthen muscles and maintain range of motion to prevent future injury.''In some circumstances, medical professionals may consider administering steroid injections. Using ultrasound, a long needle is guided near the injury site so that the injected steroid can work directed at the site of inflammation.''Surgery is not commonly considered but may be an option when nonsurgical treatments have failed, and torn muscles need to be repaired.'

Is it possible to prevent a gluteal injury?,"'People may sometimes avoid accidental falls. It is important to have good footwear, be aware of surroundings, especially when the weather is rainy, snowy, or icy. This is especially true for elderly patients and those who may have impaired balance. Warming up and stretching before activities may help decrease injury risk.' "
How to determine high vs low-glycemic foods,"'The ''glycemic index'' (GI) is a numeric value assigned to foods based on how slowly or quickly they can increase your blood glucose levels. It is a rating system for carbohydrate-containing foods. Foods having a low GI are the ones that tend to release glucose slowly and steadily. By contrast, foods that fall high on the GI scale release glucose rapidly.''GI is assigned with reference to pure glucose that is arbitrarily given a GI of 100. Thus, if a food has a GI of 30, it means it will boost blood glucose by only 30% compared with pure glucose.''Based upon the GI value, foods are divided into three categories' Low-GI foods: This refers to foods with a GI value of 55 or less. Low-GI foods include most fruits and vegetables, whole or minimally processed grains, beans, pasta, low-fat dairy products and nuts. Moderate-GI foods: Foods belonging to this category have a GI of 56 to 69. They include white potatoes, sweet potatoes, white rice, corn, couscous and breakfast cereals such as Mini-Wheats and Cream of Wheat. High-GI foods: Foods in this category have a GI of 70 or more. Foods with high GI include white bread, cakes, doughnuts, cookies, rice cakes, most crackers, bagels, croissants and most packaged breakfast cereals."
Are eggs a low-glycemic food?,"'Are eggs a low-glycemic food?Eggs are a low-glycemic food. Additionally, they have a satiating effect making the person feel fuller longer.

Are high-glycemic foods bad for health?,"'High-glycemic foods have a glycemic index (GI) of 70 or more. These foods are not bad if consumed in low to moderate amounts. High-glycemic foods tend to cause more rapid and higher blood ''sugar'' spikes than low-glycemic foods. Blood sugar spikes are considered bad because a ''high blood sugar'' level places a higher demand for the ''insulin'' release on the body. This may cause a substantial drop in blood sugar levels after the spike. The dips cause more hunger, carbohydrate cravings and ''weakness''. Frequent consumption of high-GI foods is associated with higher insulin levels in the body and consequent beta cell ''fatigue'' (reduced insulin production by beta cells).''High-glycemic foods are associated with a higher risk of ''diabetes'', ''heart disease'', obesity, ''high blood pressure'' and certain cancers such as ''colorectal cancer''.''Foods with high GI include white bread, cakes, candies, doughnuts, cookies, rice cakes, most crackers, bagels, croissants and most packaged breakfast cereals.\xa0' "
What is Turner syndrome?,"'Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition that alters development in females. Women with this condition tend to be shorter than average and are usually unable to conceive a child (''infertile'') because of an absence of ovarian function. Other features of this condition that can vary among women who have Turner syndrome include: extra skin on the neck (webbed neck), puffiness or swelling (''lymphedema'') of the hands and feet, skeletal abnormalities, heart defects and kidney problems.''This condition occurs in about 1 in 2,500 female births worldwide, but is much more common among ''pregnancies'' that do not survive to term (miscarriages and stillbirths).''Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition related to the X chromosome.''Researchers have not yet determined which genes on the X chromosome are responsible for most signs and symptoms of Turner syndrome. They have, however, identified one gene called SHOX that is important for bone development and growth. Missing one copy of this gene likely causes short stature and skeletal abnormalities in women with Turner syndrome.' "
What are the symptoms for Turner syndrome?,"'Girls who have Turner syndrome are shorter than average. They often have normal height for the first three years of life, but then have a slow growth rate. At ''puberty'' they do not have the usual growth spurt.'""Non-functioning ovaries are another symptom of Turner syndrome. Normally a girl's ovaries begin to produce sex hormones (estrogen and ""'progesterone'') at puberty. This does not happen in most girls who have Turner syndrome. They do not start their periods or develop breasts without hormone treatment at the age of puberty.''Even though many women who have Turner have non-functioning ovaries and are ''infertile'', their vagina and womb are totally normal.''In early childhood, girls who have Turner syndrome may have frequent middle ''ear infections''. Recurrent infections can lead to ''hearing loss'' in some cases.''Girls with Turner Syndrome are usually of normal intelligence with good verbal skills and reading skills. Some girls, however, have problems with math, memory skills and fine-finger movements.''Additional symptoms of Turner syndrome include the following:' An especially wide neck (webbed neck) and a low or indistinct hairline. A broad chest and widely spaced nipples. Arms that turn out slightly at the elbow. A heart murmur, sometimes associated with narrowing of the aorta (blood vessel exiting the heart). A tendency to develop high blood pressure (so this should be checked regularly). Minor eye problems that are corrected by glasses. Scoliosis (deformity of the spine) occurs in 10 percent of adolescent girls who have Turner syndrome. The thyroid gland becomes under-active in about 10 percent of women who have Turner syndrome. Regular blood tests are necessary to detect it early and if necessary treat with thyroid replacement. Older or over-weight women with Turner syndrome are slightly more at risk of developing diabetes. Osteoporosis can develop because of a lack of estrogen, but this can largely be prevented by taking hormone replacement therapy."
How is Turner syndrome diagnosed?,"'A diagnosis of Turner syndrome may be suspected when there are a number of typical physical features observed such as webbed neck, a broad chest and widely spaced nipples. Sometimes diagnosis is made at birth because of heart problems, an unusually wide neck or swelling of the hands and feet.''The two main clinical features of Turner syndrome are short stature and the lack of the development of the ovaries.''Many girls are diagnosed in early childhood when a slow growth rate and other features are identified. Diagnosis sometimes takes place later when puberty does not occur.''Turner syndrome may be suspected in ''pregnancy'' during an ''ultrasound'' test. This can be confirmed by ''prenatal'' testing - chorionic villous sampling or ''amniocentesis'' - to obtain cells from the unborn baby for chromosomal analysis. If a diagnosis is confirmed prenatally, the baby may be under the care of a specialist pediatrician immediately after birth.''Diagnosis is confirmed by a blood test, called a karyotype. This is used to analyze the chromosomal composition of the female. More information about this will be discussed in the section ""Is Turner syndrome inherited?""'  "
What is the treatment for Turner syndrome?,"'During childhood and adolescence, girls may be under the care of a pediatric endocrinologist, who is a specialist in childhood conditions of the hormones and metabolism.''Growth hormone injections are beneficial in some individuals with Turner syndrome. Injections often begin in early childhood and may increase final adult height by a few inches.'""Estrogen replacement therapy is usually started at the time of normal puberty, around 12 years to start breast development. Estrogen and progesterone are given a little later to begin a monthly 'period,' which is necessary to keep the womb healthy. Estrogen is also given to prevent ""'osteoporosis''.''Babies'' born with a ''heart murmur'' or narrowing of the aorta may need surgery to correct the problem. A heart expert (cardiologist) will assess and follow up any treatment necessary.''Girls who have Turner syndrome are more likely to get middle ''ear infections''. Repeated infections may lead to ''hearing loss'' and should be evaluated by the pediatrician. An ear, nose and throat specialist (ENT) may be involved in caring for this health issue.''High blood pressure'' is quite common in women who have Turner syndrome. In some cases, the elevated ''blood pressure'' is due to narrowing of the aorta or a kidney abnormality. However, most of the time, no specific cause for the elevation is identified. Blood pressure should be checked routinely and, if necessary, treated with medication. Women who have Turner syndrome have a slightly higher risk of having an under active thyroid or developing ''diabetes''. This should also be monitored during routine health maintenance visits and treated if necessary.''Regular health checks are very important. Special clinics for the care of girls and women who have Turner syndrome are available in some areas, with access to a variety of specialists. Early preventive care and treatment is very important.''Almost all women are ''infertile'', but pregnancy with donor embryos may be possible.''Having appropriate medical treatment and support allows a woman with Turner syndrome to lead a normal, healthy and happy life.'  "
Is Turner syndrome inherited?,"'Turner syndrome is not usually inherited in families. Turner syndrome occurs when one of the two X chromosomes normally found in women is missing or incomplete. Although the exact cause of Turner syndrome is not known, it appears to occur as a result of a random error during the formation of either the eggs or sperm.'""Humans have 46 chromosomes, which contain all of a person's genes and DNA. Two of these chromosomes, the sex chromosomes, determine a person's gender. Both of the sex chromosomes in females are called X chromosomes. (This is written as XX.) Males have an X and a Y chromosome (written as XY). The two sex chromosomes help a person develop ""'fertility'' and the sexual characteristics of their gender.''In Turner syndrome, the girl does not have the usual pair of two complete X chromosomes. The most common scenario is that the girl has only one X chromosome in her cells. Some girls with Turner syndrome do have two X chromosomes, but one of the X chromosomes is incomplete. In another scenario, the girl has some cells in her body with two X chromosomes, but other cells have only one. This is called mosaicism.'  "
What is gonorrhea? How do you get it?,"'Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection caused by the organism\xa0''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''\xa0that is transmitted during unprotected sex. Gonorrhea is one of the oldest known ''sexually transmitted diseases''. Among individuals who are infected with gonorrhea, 50% to 70% also will be infected with ''chlamydia'', another type of bacteria that causes another ''STD''.''Contrary to popular belief, gonorrhea cannot be transmitted from toilet seats or door handles. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea requires very specific conditions for growth and reproduction. It cannot live outside the body for more than a few seconds or minutes, nor can it live on the skin of the hands, arms, or legs. It survives only on moist surfaces within the body and is found most commonly in the vagina, and, more commonly, the cervix. (The cervix is the end of the uterus that protrudes into the vagina.) It can also live in the tube (urethra) through which urine drains from the bladder. ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' can even exist in the back of the throat (from oral sex) and in the rectum (from anal sex).' "
Is gonorrhea an STD?,"'Sexually transmitted diseases (''STDs'') are infections that can be transferred from one sexual partner to another through any type of sexual contact. ''STDs'' are sometimes referred to as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since they involve the transmission of a disease-causing organism from one person to another during sexual activity. It is important to realize that sexual contact includes more than just sexual intercourse (vaginal and anal). Sexual contact includes kissing, oral sex, and the use of sexual ""toys,"" such as vibrators. STDs probably have been around for thousands of years, but the most dangerous of these conditions, the ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS'') was first recognized in 1981, and the causative\xa0''human immunodeficiency virus''\xa0(''HIV''), was first identified in 1984.''Many STDs are treatable, but effective cures are lacking for others, such as ''HIV'', ''HPV''\xa0(human papilloma virus), and possibly\xa0''hepatitis B''. Even gonorrhea, once easily cured, has become resistant to many of the older traditional antibiotics. Many STDs can be present in, and spread by, people who do not have any symptoms of the condition and have not yet been diagnosed with an STD. Therefore, public awareness and education about these infections and the methods of preventing them is important.''There really is no such thing as ""safe"" sex. The only truly effective way to prevent STDs is abstinence. Sex in the context of a monogamous relationship wherein neither party is infected with a STD also is considered ""safe."" Most people think that kissing is a safe activity. Unfortunately, ''syphilis'', ''herpes'', and other infections can be contracted through this relatively simple and apparently harmless act. All other forms of sexual contact carry some risk. ''Condoms'' are commonly thought to protect against STDs. While condoms are useful in decreasing the spread of certain infections, such as ''chlamydia'' and gonorrhea, they do not fully protect against other infections such as ''genital herpes'', ''genital warts'', ''syphilis'', and ''AIDS''. ''Prevention'' of the spread of STDs is dependent upon the counseling of at-risk individuals and the early diagnosis and treatment of infections.' "
What are the early symptomssigns and of gonorrhea? What symptoms develop later?,"'Most infected women have no symptoms, especially in the early stages of the infection.''Gonorrhea symptoms and signs include:''Untreated gonorrhea can lead to a severe pelvic infection with inflammation of the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. Gonorrheal infection of the Fallopian tubes can lead to a serious, painful infection of the pelvis known as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' or PID. PID occurs in many women with gonorrheal infection of the uterine cervix. Symptoms of pelvic infection include ''fever'', pelvic cramping, ''pelvic pain'', or ''pain'' with intercourse. Pelvic infection can lead to difficulty in ''becoming pregnant'' or even ''infertility'' because of tubal damage or obstruction. Occasionally, if the infection is severe enough, a localized area of infection and pus-like discharge (an abscess) forms (tubo-ovarian abscess) that can be life-threatening, and major surgery may be necessary. Gonorrhea infections in people with conditions causing seriously ''depressed'' immune function, such as ''AIDS'' or immunosuppressive treatments, can be even more serious.'  Burning Frequent, and/or painful urination Yellowish vaginal discharge Redness and swelling of the genitals Burning or itching of the vaginal area Sore throat"
How is gonorrhea diagnosed?,"'Testing for gonorrhea is done by swabbing the infected site (rectum, throat, cervix) and identifying the bacteria in the laboratory either through culturing of the material from the swab (growing the bacteria) or identification of the genetic material from the bacteria. Sometimes the tests do not show bacteria because of sampling errors (the sampled area does not contain bacteria) or other technical difficulties, even when the woman has an infection. Newer tests to diagnose gonorrhea involve the use of DNA probes or amplification techniques (for example, ''polymerase chain reaction'', or ''PCR'') to identify the genetic material of the bacteria. These tests are more expensive than cultures but typically yield more rapid results.' "
What are the treatments for gonorrhea? Can gonorrhea be cured?,"'In the past, the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea was fairly simple. A single injection of ''penicillin'' cured almost every infected person. Unfortunately, there are new ''strains'' of gonorrhea that have become resistant to various antibiotics, including ''penicillins'', and are therefore more difficult to treat. Fortunately, gonorrhea can still be treated by other injectable or oral medications.''Uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum, are usually treated by a single injection of ceftriaxone intramuscularly or by\xa0''cefixime'' (''Suprax'') in a single oral dose. For uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the pharynx, the recommended treatment is ceftriaxone in a single IM dose.''Alternative regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum is spectinomycin in nonpregnant women (not available in the United States) in a single IM dose or single doses of cephalosporins (ceftizoxime or cefoxitin, administered with ''probenecid'' (Benemid), or cefotaxime).''Treatment should always include medication that will treat ''chlamydia'' [for example, ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'', ''Zmax'') or ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox'' and others)] as well as gonorrhea, because gonorrhea and chlamydia frequently exist together in the same person. The sexual partners of women who have had either gonorrhea or chlamydia must receive treatment for both infections since their sex partners may be infected as well. Treating the sex partners also prevents reinfection of the woman. Women suffering from PID require more aggressive treatment that is effective against the bacteria that cause gonorrhea as well as against other organisms. These women often require hospitalization and intravenous administration of antibiotics.''It is important to note that doxycycline, one of the recommended ''drugs'' for treatment of PID, is not recommended for use in ''pregnant'' women.''Gonorrhea is one of the easier STIs to prevent because the bacterium that causes the infection can survive only under certain conditions. The use of condoms protects against gonorrhea infection. Since the organism can live in the throat, condoms should be used during oral-genital contact as well.' "
What is cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol is a naturally occurring fat that the body needs to produce important structures and chemicals. It is one of the main components of cell membranes, the outer lining that protects the internal structures that make body cells work and function properly. Cholesterol is also a building block for many of the hormones in the body including mineralocorticoids that control ''electrolyte'' levels in the body, glucocorticoids involved in carbohydrate ''metabolism'', and sex hormones including testosterone, ''estrogen'', and ''progesterone''. Cholesterol is one of the building blocks that assists in forming ''vitamin D'' in the body. ''Vitamin D'' is responsible for calcium ''metabolism'' in the body.''There are two important types of cholesterol, ''high density lipoprotein (HDL)'' and ''low density lipoprotein (LDL)''. LDL is the bad cholesterol that deposits in arteries when too much is present. HDL is considered the good cholesterol because it can bind to ''LDL cholesterol'' and return it to the ''liver'' where it can be removed from the body. ''While most of the cholesterol in the body is obtained through the foods we eat, it is also produced in the ''liver'"" to meet the body's demands. The body attempts to regulate the amount of total cholesterol, but when too much cholesterol is present, the excess can be deposited in arteries throughout the body. This leads to artery narrowing and increases the risk of ""'heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. Elevated LDL levels increase the risk of these diseases, and elevated HDL levels decrease the risk.' "
What does a cholesterol test measure?,"'Cholesterol tests are blood tests that measure the amount of cholesterol in the body. The health-care professional may order only a cholesterol test with results showing:''In addition to cholesterol level, the health-care professional also may order a ''lipid profile'' test. \xa0The ''lipid'' profile test will also measure ''triglyceride levels'' and another fatty substance found in the blood.'   The total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL levels."
How do I prepare for a cholesterol test?,"'For the best and most accurate results, it is important to fast for many hours before the cholesterol blood test is taken. Each laboratory has its own guidelines for not eating, and the fast may range from 9-16 hours. It is acceptable to drink water.' "
Do I need to call my doctor for my test results?,"'It usually takes a day or two from the time the blood is drawn until your health-care professional receives the results of the cholesterol test. Ideally, the health-care professional will contact you with those results and explain their significance. However, if you have not been contacted in a short period of time, it is reasonable to contact your health-care professional and ask for the test results.''There are home cholesterol test kits available that have been U.S. FDA approved, but their accuracy is not necessarily as good as that of a certified laboratory. These tests usually measure total cholesterol only, but some also can measure HDL, LDL and cholesterol. If you use one of the home kits, it is wise to discuss the results with your health-care professional.''The purpose of the cholesterol blood test is to determine whether treatment is needed for ''high cholesterol''. That treatment may include dietary and lifestyle modifications, medications, or both to control ''cholesterol levels'' and decrease the risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and peripheral ''vascular disease''. ' "
How do I interpret my cholesterol test results?,"'Cholesterol levels'' are but one of the risk factors for ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. It is important to control cholesterol levels to minimize risk just as it is important to control ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', and avoid ''smoking''.''Guidelines for cholesterol levels have been developed by many health organizations including the American ''Heart'' Association. It is important to remember that tests may need to be repeated over time to help monitor treatment and disease risk ''prevention''.\xa0' "
Facts you should know about gout (gouty arthritis)," Gout is a type of arthritis that causes inflammation, usually in one joint, that begins suddenly. Gouty arthritis is caused by the deposition of needle-like crystals of uric acid in a joint. Gout symptoms and signs includenodules under the skin called tophi,joint redness,swollen joints,joint pain, andwarmth of the joint. nodules under the skin called tophi, joint redness, swollen joints, joint pain, and warmth of the joint. The most reliable method to diagnose gout is to have fluid removed from an inflamed joint and examined under a microscope for urate crystals. Chronic gout is treated using medications that lower the uric acid level in the body. Left untreated, gout can cause irreversible joint damage, kidney problems, and tophi. Triggers for acute attacks (flare-ups) of gout include surgery, dehydration, beverages sweetened with sugar or high fructose corn syrup, beer, liquor, red meat, and seafood. Cherries may help prevent gout attacks."
What is gout?,"'Gout is a type of arthritis that causes sudden ''joint inflammation'', usually in a single joint. Severe gout can sometimes affect many joints at once. This is known as polyarticular gout.'  "
What causes gout?,"'Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the bloodstream and accumulation of urate crystals in tissues of the body. Uric acid crystal deposits in the joint cause inflammation of the joint leading to ''pain'', redness, heat, and swelling. Uric acid is normally found in the body as a byproduct of the way the body breaks down certain proteins called purines. Causes of an elevated blood uric acid level (hyperuricemia) include genetics, ''obesity'', certain medications such as diuretics (water pills), and chronic decreased kidney function (''kidney disease'').' "
What are risk factors for gout?,"'There are many risk factors for gout. Having ''high blood pressure'' is a risk factor for gout. Gout is more common after surgery, ''trauma'', and ''dehydration''. Certain medications such as diuretics (commonly known as water pills), which treat ''high blood pressure'', that raise the level of uric acid in the bloodstream are risks for gout. Surprisingly, medications that lower the level of uric acid in the bloodstream, such as ''allopurinol'' (Zyloprim, Aloprim), can also initially cause a flare of gout. This is because anything that raises or lowers the uric acid level can cause a gout flare by causing uric acid crystals to deposit in a joint. Low-dose ''aspirin'' can precipitate gout attacks. The treatment of certain types of ''cancer'' can cause gout because of high levels of uric acid released when the ''cancer'' cells are destroyed. ''Degenerative arthritis'' also makes affected joints more likely to be the site of a gouty attack.' "
What are gout symptoms and signs?,"'The characteristic symptoms and signs of gout are''These symptoms and signs usually affect a single joint. The pain is typically severe, reflecting the severity of inflammation in the joint. The affected joint is often very sensitive to touch to the point that some people with gout attacks experience pain from something as simple as pulling the bedsheets over the inflamed joint. The affected joint becomes swollen. The medical term for excessive fluid in a joint is a ""joint effusion.""''Gout frequently involves joints in the lower extremities. The classic location for gout to occur is the big toe (first metatarsophalangeal joint). ''Podagra'' is the medical term for inflammation at the base of the big toe. Gout can also affect the foot, knee, ankle, elbow, wrist, hands, or nearly any joint in the body. When gout is more severe or longstanding, multiple joints may be affected at the same time. This causes pain and ''joint stiffness'' in multiple joints.''Another sign of gout is the presence of tophi. A tophus is a hard nodule of uric acid that deposits under the skin. Tophi can be found in various locations in the body, commonly on the elbows, upper ear cartilage, and on the surface of other joints. When a tophus is present, it indicates that the body is substantially overloaded with uric acid. When tophi are present, the uric acid level in the bloodstream typically has been high for years. The presence of tophi indicates tophaceous gout and treatment with medications is necessary.''Longstanding untreated gout can lead to joint damage and physical deformity.''Kidney stones'' may be a sign of gout as uric acid crystals can deposit in the kidney and cause kidney stones.'

   sudden onset of joint pain, joint swelling, heat in the affected area, and joint redness."
What types of doctors treat gout?,"'Rheumatologists'' traditionally have expertise in diagnosing and treating gout, especially complicated situations. Other specialists such as internists, general practitioners, family medicine doctors, and orthopedists can manage straightforward cases of gout. Nephrologists may treat patients with uric-acid-lowering medications such as allopurinol in order to prevent damage to the kidneys, which can occur with elevated uric acid levels (hyperuricemia).' "
How do health care providers diagnose gout?,"'The most reliable method to diagnose gout is by demonstrating uric acid crystals in joint fluid that has been removed from an inflamed joint (''arthrocentesis''). Specially trained physicians, such as a ''rheumatologist'' or orthopedist, can carefully remove fluid from the joint. The fluid is then examined under a microscope to determine if uric acid crystals are present. This is important because other medical conditions and diseases, such as ''pseudogout'' (a type of arthritis caused by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals) and infection, can have symptoms similar to gout.' "
When should patients seek treatment for gout?,"'Changes in lifestyle, such as limiting foods associated with gout, should be initiated in anyone who has had gouty attacks. Treatment of gout with medications is necessary when frequent disabling gouty attacks occur, when kidney stones caused by uric acid are present, when there is evidence of joint damage from gout on ''X-rays'', or when tophi are present. Treatment should be individualized to the patient.' "
What are treatments and home remedies for gout?,"'When gout is mild, infrequent, and uncomplicated, it can be treated with ''diet'' and lifestyle changes. However, studies have shown that even the most rigorous ''diet'' does not lower the serum uric acid enough to control severe gout, and therefore medications are generally necessary. When attacks are frequent, uric acid kidney stones have occurred, tophi are present, or there is evidence of joint damage from gout attacks, medications are typically used to lower the uric acid blood level.''Medications for the treatment of gout generally fall into one of three categories: uric-acid-lowering medications, prophylactic medications (medications used in conjunction with uric-acid-lowering medications to prevent a gout flare), and rescue medications to provide immediate relief from gout pain.''Urate-lowering medications are the primary treatment for gout. These medications decrease the total amount of uric acid in the body and lower the serum uric acid level. For most patients, the goal of uric-acid-lowering medication is to achieve a serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dl. These medications also are effective treatments to decrease the size of tophi, with the ultimate goal of eradicating them. Uric-acid-lowering medications include allopurinol (Zyloprim, Aloprim), ''febuxostat'' (''Uloric''), ''probenecid'', and pegloticase (Krystexxa).''Prophylactic medications are used during approximately the first six months of therapy with a medication to lower high levels of uric acid to either prevent gout flares or decrease the number and severity of flares. This is because any medication or intervention that either increases or decreases the uric acid level in the bloodstream can trigger a gout attack. ''Colcrys'' (''colchicine'') and any of the ''NSAIDs'' (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'') such as ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin'', ''Indocin-SR''), ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren'', ''Cataflam'', Voltaren-XR, ''Cambia''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''), or ''naproxen'' sodium (''Aleve'') are frequently used as prophylactic medications to prevent gout flares during uric-acid lowering. By taking one of these prophylactic or preventative medications during the first six months of treatment with allopurinol, febuxostat, or probenecid, the risk of having a gout attack during this time is decreased. Prophylactic medications are not used in combination with Krystexxa.''The third category of medications are those used during attacks of acute gout to decrease pain and inflammation. Both colchicine (Colcrys) and NSAIDs can be used during an acute gout attack to decrease inflammation and pain. ''Corticosteroids'' such as ''prednisone'', ''methylprednisolone'' (''Medrol''), and ''prednisolone'' (''Orapred''), also can be used during an acute gouty flare. However, the total dose of steroids is generally limited due to potential side effects such as ''cataract'' formation and bone loss. Steroid medications are extremely helpful in treating gout flares in patients who are unable to take colchicine or NSAIDs.''Home remedies for an acute gout attack include drinking plenty of water. ''Over-the-counter'' NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, ''Motrin'') and naproxen sodium (Aleve), can be used when there are no contra-indications, such as decreased kidney function or stomach ulcers.''Home remedies may be very beneficial for the management of chronic gout, as well. The dietary modifications detailed above can be very effective in certain patients. Drinking plenty of water to remain well-hydrated can be beneficial in preventing gout attacks.'  "
Do gout medications have any side effects?," Gout medications are well tolerated by most people. However, like other medications, they have potential side effects. Allopurinol is well tolerated by most people, but in some people, it can cause an allergic rash. Very severe rashes rarely can occur after taking allopurinol, and any allergic type rashes that develop while a patient is taking allopurinol are taken seriously. Colchicine (Colcrys) can cause signs and symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and rarely muscle weakness and abnormal blood counts. Probenecid is generally well tolerated but should not be used in patients who have uric acid kidney stones, as it can worsen the kidney stones and potentially harm the kidneys in these patients. Febuxostat (Uloric) can cause liver abnormalities, nausea, and rash. NSAIDs can cause irritation of the stomach and ulcers in some cases. The liver and the kidneys are periodically monitored in patients taking NSAIDs over the long term. Krystexxa is administered as an intravenous infusion. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in a minority of people receiving Krystexxa."
What foods should people with gout eliminate from their diet?,"'Uric acid is formed when proteins in the food we eat, called purines, are broken down. Therefore, there has been a great deal of interest in dietary management of gout by avoiding high-purine (purine-rich) foods. However, a diet very low in purines is extremely difficult to follow, because purines are a natural part of many healthy foods. Even when a diet very low in purines is followed strictly, the uric acid level in the bloodstream is only slightly lowered.''The following dietary principles are important in the management of gout:'   Gout is associated with obesity, and significant weight loss can dramatically improve the management of gout. A calorie-reduced diet is helpful for weight loss. A diet low in saturated fat, with increased protein and replacement of refined carbohydrates (for example, sugar, white bread, potatoes) with complex carbohydrates (such as vegetables and whole grains) reduces the serum uric acid. Decreased consumption of seafood and red meat. The consumption of low-fat dairy products decreases the risk of gout. Drinking beer and liquor increase the risk of gout. However, drinking wine does not appear to increase the risk of gout. In one study, consumption of fresh cherries was associated with a 35% decreased risk of gout. Some people believe that black cherry juice or dried cherries have the same effect, but this has not been proven. Drinking beverages sweetened with sugar or high fructose corn syrup increases the risk of gout."
What complications are associated with gout?,"'Longstanding untreated gout can cause irreversible joint damage.''Uric acid can deposit in the kidneys and cause kidney stones and decreased kidney function.''Uric acid can deposit in the soft tissues, especially around joints, and cause nodules known as tophi, which can be large and unsightly.' "
What is the prognosis of gout?,"'Gout is a chronic condition. Left untreated, patients may suffer from recurrent painful and disabling acute attacks of gout. Joint damage and other complications of gout may occur. However, excellent treatments for gout are available, and most patients respond very well to gout treatment with a good prognosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent gout?,"'Some of the risk factors for gout are genetic, and those are not preventable. However, many of the risk factors for gout, such as obesity and diet, are controllable. Maintaining a healthy weight and a diet low in refined carbohydrates and low in saturated fat and red meat may prevent gout.' "
What is the latest research on gout?,'Research is being done on using medications that block a chemical signal known as interleukin-1 to treat gout flares in patients who do not respond to other therapies. ''Anakinra'' (''Kineret'') and canakinumab (Ilaris) are two medications that block interleukin-1. They are currently used for other conditions and are under investigation for use in gout flare-ups.''There is ongoing research in using a specialized ''CT scan'' known as a dual energy CT scan to diagnose gout. There is also a great deal of research investigating the various uric acid transporter genes that are responsible for uric acid metabolism.' 
What is granulomatosis with polyangiitis?,"'Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an uncommon type of inflammation of small arteries and veins (vasculitis). It classically involves inflammation of the arteries that supply blood to the tissues of the ''lungs'', the nasal passages (sinuses), and the kidneys. ""Incomplete"" forms exist that only involve one of these areas. When both lungs and kidneys are affected, the condition is sometimes referred to as generalized granulomatosis with polyangiitis. When only the lungs are involved, the condition is sometimes referred to as limited granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The terminology ""granulomatosis with polyangiitis"" highlights the two central pathologic features of the disease, granuloma formation and inflammation of blood vessels (''angiitis'' or vasculitis).''The name ""Wegener\'s granulomatosis"" is no longer used because the German physician Friedrich Wegener, the disease\'s former namesake, was a member of the Nazi party and allegedly linked to Nazi war crimes.''Granulomatosis with polyangiitis usually affects young or middle-aged adults. Although it is uncommon in children, it can affect people at any age. The cause of the condition is not known.' "
What are symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis?,"'Symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis include:''Nasal ulcerations and even bloody nasal discharge can occur. Other areas of the body that can also become inflamed in patients with GPA include the eyes, the nerves (neuropathy), the middle ear (''otitis media''), and the skin resulting in skin nodules or ulcers.'   bloody sputum, fevers, fatigue, joint pains, shortness of breath, sinus inflammation (sinusitis), and weight loss."
How is granulomatosis with polyangiitis diagnosed?,"'Abnormal lab findings in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis include urine tests that detect protein and ''red blood cells'' in the urine (not visible to the naked eye) and ''X-rays'' of the chest and sinuses, which detect abnormalities resulting from lung and sinus inflammation. Blood tests that detect the abnormal inflammation include the ''sedimentation rate'' (sed rate) and ''C-reactive protein''. A more specific blood test used to diagnose and monitor granulomatosis with polyangiitis is the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA test), which is commonly elevated when the disease is active.''The diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis is confirmed by detecting both abnormal cellular formations, called granulomas, and vasculitis in a biopsy of tissue involved with the inflammatory process. For examples, an open lung biopsy or a kidney biopsy are commonly used in making a diagnosis of the condition.' "
What is the treatment for granulomatosis with polyangiitis?,"'Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a serious disease and without treatment can be fatal within months. Treatment is directed toward stopping the inflammation process by suppressing the immune system.''A newer and more effective treatment for granulomatosis with polyangiitis is ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan''), given intravenously weekly for four weeks in combination with cortisone medication. These new regimens are welcome news for patients with as medical researchers are searching for better treatments.'   Medications used to treat granulomatosis with polyangiitis include high-dose cortisone (prednisone) and the immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). Recent reports also suggest that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) also can be helpful to prevent relapse of disease activity in patients with the condition. Cytoxan that is taken by mouth with prednisone until the disease is in remission and then switched to methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) for two years and tapered off has been reported to be effective and less toxic than the traditional long-term Cytoxan treatment. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) has been introduced as a drug for Cytoxan treatment failures. Moreover, it now appears that Cytoxan will not be necessary in order to maintain long-term remission, and that doctors can convert to the less toxic methotrexate for maintenance. Reports also demonstrate that methotrexate can eventually be tapered off entirely after two years. Azathioprine (Imuran) has also been used as a maintenance medication after Cytoxan. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) has been shown to be helpful in treating relapses of granulomatosis with polyangiitis."
What is the prognosis for granulomatosis with polyangiitis?,"'The prognosis for granulomatosis with polyangiitis depends on which organs are involved, to what degree they are involved, the duration of the disease, and the response to treatment. Today, with an optimal response to treatment, people with the condition scan lead normal lives.' "
What is graft-versus-host disease?,"""Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an immune condition that occurs after transplant procedures when immune cells from the donor (known as the graft or graft cells) attack the recipient patient host's tissues; the disease is a side effect that is common after an allogeneic ""'bone marrow transplant'' (stem cell transplant). An allogeneic transplant is one in which a patient receives bone marrow tissue or cells from a donor. Stem cell transplantation is a common treatment for many different ''cancers'' (malignancies), including cancers that affect the blood and ''lymph nodes'', as well as some other (non-''cancer'') conditions that affect the blood or immune system. A stem cell transplant is sometimes performed after a relapse of ''leukemia'' or ''lymphoma'' that occurs after initial treatment. In addition to bone marrow transplant procedures, GVHD can also occur after transplantation of solid organs that may contain immune system cells such as white blood cells.'""Tissues from healthy donors are checked prior to bone marrow transplant to see how closely matched they are to the host's own cells. When there is a close match in certain genetic markers, the risk of the disease is lower. The disease can range from mild to life-threatening in severity. There are two types of GVHD: acute GVHD and chronic GVHD.""'The chance of developing GVHD is around 30%-40% when the donor and recipient are related and around 60%-80% when the donor and recipient are not related. The disease can affect many different organs in the body.' "
What causes graft-versus-host disease?,'The pathophysiology of graft versus host disease is complex. GVHD is the result of a series of complex interactions between the immune cells of the donor (the graft) and the host tissues; the disease is most likely to occur after a transplantation procedure when donor and recipient tissues are not genetically similar. A number of cytokines and other immune signaling compounds are believed to be important in the development of the condition.' 
What are risk factors for GVHD?,"'Patients undergoing bone marrow transplant (stem cell transplant) from a donor are at increased risk for GVHD. Medical research has also shown that the likelihood of developing GVHD increases with certain underlying disease states. The disease is also more likely to occur in older people. The risk is slightly elevated when the donor and patient are of different gender. Before the transplanted cells are given to the patient, a pretreatment regimen of drugs is given to suppress the immune system and to help prevent GVHD. Other risk factors for the disease include having a tissue donor who has been ''pregnant'' and advanced age of either the donor or recipient.' "
What are graft-versus-host disease symptoms and signs? What are the types of GVHD?,"'There are two main types of GVHD: acute GVHD and chronic GVHD.''Acute GVHD'' typically occurs within 100 days after the stem cell transplantation. ""Acute"" is a medical term that means that a condition appears early or suddenly, while ""chronic"" refers to a condition that develops over time. Acute graft-versus-host disease usually involves a distinct set of clinical symptoms and signs that include the following:''Chronic GVHD'' usually begins after the first 100 days following a transplant. Chronic graft-versus-host disease is more likely to occur in patients who experienced the acute form of the disease, but it can also develop on its own in someone who never has had GVHD before.''The symptoms of both acute and chronic GVHD may be staged as mild, moderate, or severe enough to be life-threatening. Some patients may develop other types of GVHD:'  Dermatitis, or skin inflammation, is characterized by an itchy, red, and possibly painful rash. Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, may not have symptoms at the outset but can also lead to jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) and other signs of liver failure. Enteritis, or inflammation of the intestinal tract, can lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, cramping, abdominal pain, or blood in the stool. The diarrhea of acute GVHD has been described as greenish, watery, mucoid or having mucus, and/or containing sloughed intestinal lining cells that may appears as casts (lumps or clumps of cells) in the stool. Dry eyes or mouth Vision changes White patches inside the mouth or mouth ulcers Difficulty swallowing Hair loss Sensitivity to spicy or acidic foods Mouth pain Pulmonary symptoms include wheezing or shortness of breath Muscle or joint pain and weakness Fatigue Skin rash that is red to purple, flat or raised, and may be accompanied by thickened skin and raised areas of skin Skin discoloration Vaginal dryness Loss of appetite and weight loss Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes Abdominal pain or tenderness Persistent, recurrent, late-onset GVHD: Patients develop acute GVHD symptoms more than 100 days post-transplant. Overlap syndrome: anytime when post transplant patients develop symptoms of both acute and chronic GVHD"
What specialists treat GVHD?,"""Patients with GVHD are treated by the team of medical specialists that manage the transplantation process. Hematologist-oncologists (medical doctors specializing in the treatment of cancerous tumors and blood diseases) who are transplant specialists typically lead these teams and coordinate the patient's care."" "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose GVHD?,"""A tissue biopsy (a small sample of tissue removed for examination under a microscope by a pathologist physician) is a common test used to diagnose GVHD when the patient's clinical signs and symptoms suggest that GVHD is present. Sometimes, biopsies from other sites in the body are done instead of or in addition to the skin biopsy.""'Blood tests that can be helpful in managing the patient with GVHD include blood cell counts and blood chemistry profiles. Blood tests that assess ''liver function'' are also commonly performed when GVHD is suspected or diagnosed.' "
What are GVHD treatment options?,"'Immunosuppressant medications are the hallmark of treatment for GVHD. These include both ''corticosteroid'' drugs (such as ''prednisolone'' or ''methylprednisolone'') and more advanced medications and techniques that reduce the immune response. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy for GVHD, but other medications may be added or given when the GVHD does not respond well to steroid treatment. A number of different medications and combinations of medications are available to treat GVHD, and ''clinical trials'' are ongoing to examine new treatments as well as treatments for GVHD that does not respond to steroid treatment.''Some nonsteroid immune-suppressing drugs and treatments that have been used to treat GVHD include the following:''An increased risk of infections, including bacterial and ''fungal infections'', is the main health risk and side effect of treatment with immune-suppressing drugs.''Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) is a treatment that involves a combination of leukopheresis and ''photodynamic therapy'', in which patient blood is exposed to a sensitizing agent followed by ultraviolet A irradiation and reinfused into the patient.'

What is the prognosis of graft-versus-host disease?,"'The prognosis or outcome of GVHD depends both upon the severity and extent of the symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. GVHD is highly variable, with symptoms that can range from mild to life-threatening. Signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD may last for years or may be permanent in some people.' "
Is it possible to prevent GVHD?,"'Advances in medical transplantation techniques have helped to reduce the risk of developing acute GVHD, including more precise techniques to determine whether donor cells are a good match for the recipient and processing of the donor cells to remove T cells, or T lymphocytes; a T cell is a type of immune cell that mediates the reaction in GVHD. Using umbilical cord blood as a source of donor cells can also reduce the likelihood of developing GVHD. Finally, patients undergoing stem cell transplants are given a regimen of immune-suppressing drugs such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, ''tacrolimus'' (''Prograf''), ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''Cellcept''), or ''sirolimus'' (''Rapamune'') to decrease the likelihood of developing the condition. Even with advancing technology, it is not always possible to prevent GVHD.' "
What is Graves' disease?,"""Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes ""'hyperthyroidism'', or overactive thyroid. With this disease, your immune system attacks the thyroid and causes it to make more ''thyroid hormone'' than your body needs. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. Thyroid hormones control how your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body - even the way your heart beats.''If left untreated, ''hyperthyroidism'' can cause serious problems with the heart, bones, muscles, ''menstrual cycle'', and ''fertility''. During pregnancy, untreated ''hyperthyroidism'"" can lead to health problems for the mother and baby. Graves' disease also can affect your eyes and skin."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of Graves' disease?,"""If you have Graves' disease, you may have common ""'symptoms of hyperthyroidism'' such as'""Rarely, people with Graves' disease develop a reddish thickening of the skin on the shins, a condition called pretibial myxedema or Graves' dermopathy. This skin problem is usually painless and mild, but it can be painful for some.""""Graves' ophthalmopathy (Graves' orbitopathy) can cause retracted eyelids, meaning the eyelids are pulled back from the eye. Graves' orbitopathy can also cause ""'bulging eyes'', ''double vision'', and ''swelling around the eyes''.'   fast and irregular heartbeat frequent bowel movements or diarrhea goiter heat intolerance nervousness or irritability tiredness or muscle weakness trembling hands trouble sleeping weight loss"
What causes Graves' disease?,"""Researchers aren't sure why some people develop autoimmune disorders such as Graves' disease. These disorders probably develop from a combination of genes and an outside trigger, such as a virus.""""With Graves' disease, the immune system makes an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that attaches to thyroid cells. TSI acts like thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a hormone made in the ""'pituitary gland'' that tells the thyroid how much ''thyroid hormone'' to make. TSI causes the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.'  "
Is Graves' disease a problem during pregnancy?,"""Thyroid hormone levels that are just a little high are usually not a problem in pregnancy. However, more severe hyperthyroidism that isn't treated can affect both the mother and the baby. If you have Graves' disease, be sure your hyperthyroidism is under control before ""'becoming pregnant''.'  "
Who gets Graves' disease? Is it common?,"""Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. The disease affects about 1 in 200 people.""""Graves' disease usually affects people between ages 30 and 50, but can occur at any age. The disease is seven to eight times more common in women than men.3 A person’s chance of developing Graves’ disease increases if other family members have the disease.""""People with other autoimmune disorders are more likely to develop Graves' disease than people without these disorders. Conditions linked with Graves' disease include"" rheumatoid arthritis, a disorder that affects the joints and sometimes other body systems pernicious anemia, a condition caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency lupus, a chronic, long-term disorder that can affect many parts of your body Addison's disease, a hormonal disorder celiac disease, a digestive disorder vitiligo, a disorder in which some parts of the skin are not pigmented type 1 diabetes"
What tests diagnose Graves' disease?,"""Your health care provider may suspect Graves' disease based on your symptoms and findings during a physical exam. One or more blood tests can confirm that you have hyperthyroidism and may point to Graves' disease as the cause.""""Other clues that hyperthyroidism is caused by Graves' disease are""""If the diagnosis is uncertain, your doctor may order further blood or imaging tests to confirm Graves' disease as the cause."" an enlarged thyroid signs of Graves' eye disease, present in about one out of three people with Graves' disease a history of other family members with thyroid or autoimmune problems A blood test can detect TSI. However, in mild cases of Graves' disease, TSI may not show up in your blood. The next step may be one of two imaging tests that use small, safe doses of radioactive iodine. Your thyroid collects iodine from your bloodstream and uses it to make thyroid hormones; it will collect radioactive iodine in the same way. Radioactive iodine uptake test. This test measures the amount of iodine the thyroid collects from the bloodstream. If your thyroid collects large amounts of iodine, you may have Graves' disease. Thyroid scan. This scan shows how and where iodine is distributed in the thyroid. With Graves' disease, the entire thyroid is involved, so the iodine shows up throughout the gland. With other causes of hyperthyroidism such as nodules - small lumps in the gland - the iodine shows up in a different pattern."
What is the treatment for Graves' disease? Can it be cured?,"""You have three treatment options: medicine, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy is the most common treatment for Graves' disease in the United States, but doctors are beginning to use medicine more often than in the past. Based on factors such as your age, whether you are ""'pregnant'', or whether you have other medical conditions, your doctor may recommend a specific treatment and can help you decide which one is right for you.' "
Is there a diet for Graves' disease? What foods should you avoid?,"""People with Graves' disease may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine - such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed - may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism. Taking iodine ""'supplements'' can have the same effect.''Talk with your health care professional about what foods you should limit or avoid, and let him or her know if you take iodine ''supplements''. Also, share information about any ''cough syrups'' or ''multivitamins'' that you take because they may contain iodine.' "
Radioiodine therapy for Graves' disease,"'For radioiodine therapy, you take radioactive iodine-131 (I-131) by mouth as a capsule or liquid. I-131, at a higher dose than the dose used for imaging tests, slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. The dose of I-131 usually used for radioiodine therapy does not affect other body tissues. You take radioactive iodine-131 as a capsule or liquid.'""Although it's unlikely, you may need more than one radio-iodine treatment to bring your thyroid hormone levels into the normal range. In the meantime, treatment with medicines called ""'beta blockers'' can control your symptoms.''Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops ''hypothyroidism'', or ''underactive thyroid'', because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. However, ''hypothyroidism'' is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. People with hypothyroidism can completely control the condition with daily thyroid hormone medicine.'""Doctors don't use radioiodine therapy to treat ""'pregnant'' women or women who are ''breastfeeding'"". Radioactive iodine can harm the fetus' thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in ""'breast milk''.'  "
Beta blockers,"'Beta blockers don’t stop your thyroid from producing thyroid hormone but can reduce symptoms until other treatments take effect. These medicines act quickly to relieve many of the ''symptoms of hyperthyroidism'', such as trembling, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. Most people feel better within hours of taking beta blockers.' "
Antithyroid medications,"'Antithyroid therapy is the simplest way to treat hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid medicines cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. These medicines usually don’t provide a permanent cure, but in some people, the effects last a long time after they stop taking the medicine. Doctors most often use the antithyroid medicine ''methimazole''.''Doctors usually treat pregnant and ''breastfeeding'' women with antithyroid medicine, since this treatment may be safer for the baby than other treatments. Doctors use ''propylthiouracil'' more often than methimazole during the first 3 months of pregnancy because methimazole may harm the fetus, although this happens rarely. Also rarely, propylthiouracil may affect the fetus, but any effects are less harmful than having uncontrolled hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.'""Once treatment with antithyroid medicine begins, your thyroid hormone levels may not move into the normal range for several weeks or months. The total average treatment time is about 12 to 18 months, but treatment can continue for many years in people who don’t want radioiodine or surgery to treat their Graves' disease.""'Antithyroid medicines can cause side effects in some people, including''Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms:' allergic reactions such as rashes and itching a decrease in the number of white blood cells in your body, which can lower resistance to infection liver failure, in rare cases Fever Constant sore throat Tiredness Weakness Dull pain in your abdomen Loss of appetite Skin rash or itching Easy bruising Yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes, called jaundice"
Surgery for Graves' disease,"""The least-used treatment for Graves' disease is surgery to remove the thyroid gland. Sometimes doctors use surgery to treat people with large goiters, or pregnant women who are ""'allergic'' to or have side effects from antithyroid medicines.''Before surgery, your doctor will prescribe antithyroid medicines to bring your thyroid hormone levels into the normal range. This treatment prevents a condition called ''thyroid storm'' - a sudden, severe worsening of symptoms - that can occur when people with hyperthyroidism have general anesthesia.''After surgery to remove your thyroid, you will develop hypothyroidism and need to take thyroid hormone medicine every day for life. After surgery, your doctor will continue to check your thyroid hormone levels and adjust your dose as needed.' "
What complications (death) are caused by untreated Graves' disease?,"""Without treatment, Graves' disease can cause some serious and potentially fatal health problems, including:"" An irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems An eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy or Graves' orbitopathy (GO), which can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and Eye pain - and, rarely, can lead to vision loss Thinning bones Osteoporosis Death"
What is grief?,"'Grief is the normal internal feeling one experiences in reaction to a loss, while bereavement is the state of experiencing that loss. Although people often suffer emotional ''pain'"" in response to loss of anything that is very important to them (for example, a job, a friendship or other relationship, one's sense of safety, a home), grief usually refers to the loss of a loved one through death. Grief is quite common, in that three out of four women outlive their spouse, with the average age of becoming a widow being 59 years. More than half of women in the United States are widowed by the time they reach age 65. Every year in the United States, 4% of children under the age of 15 experience the loss of a parent through death.""""Although not a formal medical diagnosis, prolonged grief, formerly called complicated grief, refers to a reaction to loss that lasts more than one year. It is characterized by the grief reaction intensifying to affect the sufferer's close relationships, disrupting his or her beliefs, and it tends to result in the bereaved experiencing ongoing longing for their deceased loved one. About 15% of bereaved individuals will suffer from complicated grief, and one-third of people already getting mental-health services have been found to suffer from this extended grief reaction.""'Anticipatory grief is defined as the feelings loved ones have in reaction to knowing that someone they care about is terminally ill. It occurs before the death of the afflicted loved one and can be an important part of the grieving process since this allows time for loved ones to say goodbye to the terminally ill individual, begin to settle affairs, and plan for the funeral or other rituals on behalf of the person who is dying.' "
What is mourning?,"""As opposed to grief, which refers to how someone may feel the loss of a loved one, mourning is the outward expression of that loss. Mourning usually involves culturally determined rituals that help mourners make sense of the end of their loved one's life and give structure to what can feel like a very confusing time. Therefore, while the internal ""'pain'' of grief is a more universal phenomenon, how people mourn is influenced by their personal, familial, cultural, religious, and societal beliefs and customs. Everything from how families prepare themselves and their loved ones for death, and understand and react to the passing to the practices for preserving memories of the deceased, their funeral or memorial, burial, cremation, or other ways of handling the remains of the deceased is influenced by internal and external factors.''The length of time for a formal mourning period and sometimes the amount of bereavement leave people are allowed to take from work is determined by a combination of personal, familial, cultural, religious, and societal factors. Mourning customs also affect how bereaved individuals may feel comfortable seeking support from others as well as the appropriate ways for their friends and family to express sympathy during this time. For example, cultures may differ greatly in how much or how little the aggrieved individual may talk about their loss with friends, family members, and coworkers and may determine whether or not participating in a bereavement support group or ''psychotherapy'' is acceptable.' "
What are the effects of losing a loved one?,"'The potential negative effects of a grief reaction can be significant. For example, research shows that about 40% of bereaved people will suffer from some form of ''anxiety disorder'' in the first year after the death of a loved one, and there can be up to a 70% increase in death risk of the surviving spouse within the first six months after the death of his or her partner. For these reasons, questionnaires that assess how much ''stress'' a person is experiencing usually place the loss of a loved one at the top of the list of the most serious stresses to endure.''When considering the death of a loved one, the effects of losing a pet should not be minimized. Pets are often considered another member of the family, and therefore their loss is grieved as well. Making the decision to euthanize (painlessly put to death) the family pet once a family works with their veterinarian to determine that the pet is suffering as a result of their age, specific illness, and/or general declining health can add ''stress'' to the bereavement process by leaving family members feeling guilty initially, but if done properly, can help families understand that they spared their beloved pet unnecessary suffering.'""In addition to grief as an initial reaction to loss, the process can be aggravated by events that remind the bereaved individuals of their loved one or the circumstances surrounding their loss. Such events are often referred to as grief triggers. Father's Day or the beginning of the school year may cause the parent who has lost a child (or a child who has lost a parent) to feel distraught. A shared song, television show, or activity can cause anguish by reminding the widower of the wife he lost or the child of the grandparent who is no longer living. Watching another child play with a pet may reduce a child whose pet has died to tears."" "
What are the causes and risk factors of prolonged grief?,"'The risk factors for experiencing more serious symptoms of grief for a longer period of time can be related to the physical and emotional health of the survivor before the loss, the relationship between the bereaved and their loved one, as well as to the nature of the death. For example, it is not uncommon for surviving loved ones who had a contentious or strained relationship, or otherwise unresolved issues with the deceased to suffer severe feelings of sorrow. Parents who have lost their child are at a significantly higher risk of divorce compared to couples who have not. They are also at increased risk for a decline in emotional health, including being psychiatrically hospitalized following the loss. This is a particular risk for mothers who have lost a child.''Bereaved individuals who have experienced an unexpected or violent death of a loved one may be at greater risk for suffering from mental disorders like major ''depression'', ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), or complicated grief. According to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-5''), the accepted diagnostic reference for ''mental health'' afflictions, major ''depression'' is a psychiatric disorder characterized by sadness and/or irritability that lasts at least two weeks in a row and is accompanied by a number of other symptoms, like problems with ''sleep'', appetite, weight, concentration, or energy level and may also lead to the sufferer experiencing unjustified guilt, losing interest in activities he or she used to enjoy, or thoughts of wanting to kill themselves or someone else.''PTSD refers to a condition that involves the sufferers enduring an experience that significantly threatened their sense of safety or well-being (for example, the ''suicide'' or homicide of a loved one), then re-experiencing the event through intrusive memories, physical or emotional reactions, ''nightmares'' or flashbacks (feeling as if the ''trauma'' is happening again at times when the sufferer is awake); developing a hypersensitivity to events that are normal (for example, being quite irritable, getting startled very easily, having trouble sleeping, or difficulty trusting others); avoiding things that remind the person of the traumatic event (for example, people, places, or things that the sufferer may associate with the death of their loved one) and developing or worsening negative ''moods'' or ways of thinking after the traumatic event (for example, trouble recalling an important aspect of the trauma, persistent negative beliefs, blaming oneself or others for the trauma, feeling detached from others, or persistent trouble experiencing positive emotions).''Being able to care for a dying loved one tends to promote the healing process for those who are left behind. That care can either be provided at home, in the hospital, or in ''hospice'' care. Hospice is a program or facility that provides special care for people whose health has declined to the point that they are near the end of their life. Such programs or facilities also provide special care for their families.' "
"What are the signs, symptoms, and stages of grief?","'Perhaps the most well-known model for understanding grief was developed by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, MD, in her 1969 book titled ''On Death and Dying''. The five stages of the grief cycle that she outlined are'""These stages also apply to the stages of dying, the grief associated with one's own death. She described the stage of denial as the bereaved having difficulty believing what has happened, the anger phase as the survivors questioning the fairness of the loss, the bargaining stage as wishing to make a deal with fate to gain more time with the one who was or will be lost, the depression stage as the period when the bereaved individuals get\xa0in touch with how very sad they are about losing their loved one, and acceptance as feeling some resolution to their grief and more ability to go on with their own life.""""Kübler-Ross apparently felt these phases can be applied to any significant personal loss (for example, of a job, relationship, one's own health, anticipating one's own death), as well as the death of a loved one. It also seems that she believed these stages don't all have to occur, can take place in different order, and can reoccur many times as part of an individual's specific grief process. Other grief experts describe seven stages of grieving, specifically""'The shock or disbelief stage is understood as the numbness often associated with initially receiving the news of the death of a loved one. The guilt stage of grief refers to feelings of regret about difficult aspects of the relationship with the deceased.''In addition to the emotional pain already discussed, symptoms of grief can be physical, social, cultural, or religious in nature. Physical symptoms can range from mild ''sleep'' or appetite problems to ''heart attack''. Social symptoms of bereavement include isolation from other loved ones and difficulty functioning at home, school, and/or at work.''For children and adolescents, reactions to the death of a parent or other loved one tend to be consistent with their reaction to any severe stress. Such reactions usually reflect the particular developmental stage of the child or adolescent. For example, since infants up to about 2 years of age cannot yet talk, their reaction to the loss of a loved one tends to involve crying and being more irritable or clingy. They further show physical symptoms of sleep or appetite problems, changes in activity level, and being more watchful of (vigilant toward) their surroundings.''Since preschoolers from 3 to 5 years of age begin to be able to remember the one who died but have not yet developed the ability to understand the permanence of death, they may believe they somehow magically caused the death and can make the person come back. In addition to showing signs of grief that are similar to those of infants, they may have more difficulty separating from caregivers.''Early school-aged children, from 6 to 8 years of age, more likely understand that death is permanent compared to younger children, often feel guilt about the death of the loved one, become preoccupied with memories about the departed, and try to master the loss they have suffered by talking about it frequently. While symptoms of grief in school-aged children from 9 to 11 years of age are quite similar to those of early school-aged children, this older group is more vulnerable to a decrease in self-esteem because they feel different from their peers if they have experienced the loss of a loved one. They are also more prone to defend against their feelings of sorrow by becoming engrossed in school, social, and/or extracurricular activities.''In keeping with their budding need for independence, young adolescents 12 to 14 years of age may experience mixed feelings about the deceased individual and exhibit a wide range of emotions. They may avoid talking about the loss. Older ''teens'' usually experience grief similarly to adults, enduring sadness, ''anxiety'', and anger. They tend to deny their feelings of loss to parents but discuss them in detail with peers. For children, adolescents, and adults, as with any major stress, grief may cause a person to regress emotionally, in that they go back to former, often less mature ways of thinking, behaving, and coping.''Symptoms of complicated grief include intense emotion and longings for the deceased, severely intrusive thoughts about the lost loved one, extreme feelings of isolation and emptiness, avoiding doing things that bring back memories of the departed, new or worsened ''sleeping problems'', and having no interest in activities that the sufferer used to enjoy. Teens tend to react to the loss of a loved one that died through ''suicide'' similarly to the ways in which adults experience complicated grief, but it is noteworthy that their lack of life experience to draw strength from and high level of involvement with their peers may make teens more vulnerable to contemplating suicide themselves when a loved one commits suicide. Mental health professionals often refer to this type of vulnerability as contagion.''Regardless of age, individuals who lose a loved one from suicide are more at risk for becoming preoccupied with the reason for the suicide while wanting to deny or hide the cause of death, wondering if they could have prevented it, feeling blamed for the problems that preceded the suicide, feeling rejected by their loved one, and stigmatized by others.' denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. shock or disbelief, denial, bargaining, guilt, anger, depression, acceptance/hope."
How do health care professionals assess grief?,"'Although practitioners sometimes use paper and pencil survey tests to determine if a person is suffering from grief, the assessment is usually made by the health care professional asking questions to assess what symptoms an individual is experiencing, then considering whether he or she is suffering from normal grief, complicated grief, or some other issue. Those questions tend to explore whether there are emotional, physical, and/or social symptoms of grief, and if so, how severe and how long the symptoms have been present. The practitioner may also try to determine what stages of the grief process the person has experienced and what stage currently dominates his or her feelings at the time of the assessment.' "
How can people cope with grief?,"'There remains some controversy about how to best help people survive the loss of a loved one. While many forms of support are available and do help certain individuals, little scientific research has shown clear benefits for any particular approach for grief reactions in general. That is thought to be because each approach to support is so different that it is hard to scientifically compare one to another, intervention procedures are not consistently reported in publications, and the ways these interventions have been studied are flawed. Although there has been some concern that grief counseling for uncomplicated grief sufferers works against bereavement recovery, there is research to the contrary. One approach to treating grief is the dual process model, which endorses the bereavement process as being the dynamic struggle between the pain of the death of the loved one (loss-oriented) and recovery (restoration-oriented). This model of treatment recommends that bereaved individuals alternate between directly working on their loss (confrontation) and taking a break from (avoidance) that process when appropriate. For couples who are grieving the occurrence of a ''miscarriage'', brief professional counseling has been found to be helpful.'""Quite valuable tips for journaling as an effective way of managing bereavement rather than just stirring up painful feelings are provided by the Center for Journal Therapy. While encouraging those who choose to write a journal to apply no strict rules to the process, some of the ideas encouraged include limiting the time journaling to 15 minutes per day or less to decrease the likelihood of worsening grief, writing how one imagines his or her life will be a year from the date of the loss, and clearly identifying feelings to allow for easier tracking of the individual's grieving process.""'To help children and adolescents cope emotionally with the death of a friend or family member, it is important to ensure they receive consistent caretaking and frequent interaction with supportive adults. For children of school age and older, appropriate participation in school, social, and extracurricular activities is necessary to a successful resolution of grief. For adolescents, maintaining positive relationships with peers becomes important in helping teens figure out how to deal with grief. Depending on the adolescent, they even may find interactions with peers and family more helpful than formal sources of support like their school counselor. All children and teens can benefit from being reassured that they did not cause their loved one to die, and such reassurance can go a long way toward lessening the developmentally appropriate tendency children and adolescents have for blaming themselves and any angry feelings they may have harbored against their lost loved one for the death.'""Effective coping tips for grieving are nearly as different and numerous as there are bereaved individuals. The bereaved individual's caring for him/herself through continuing nutritious and regular eating habits, getting extra rest, and communicating with surviving friends and family members are some ways for grief sufferers to ease the grief process. The use of supportive structure can also go a long way to helping aggrieved individuals come to terms with their loss. Anything from reciting comforting prayers or affirmations, to returning to established meal and bedtimes, as well as returning to work or school routines can help grieving individuals regain a sense of normalcy in their lives. As death involves the loss of an imperfect relationship involving imperfect individuals, forgiveness of the faults of the lost loved one and of the inherently imperfect relationship between the bereaved and the deceased can go a long way toward healing for the bereaved. While the painful aspects of dealing with death are clear, bereavement sometimes also leads to enhanced personal development.""  "
What are the legal issues associated with dying and death?,"'To appreciate the legal aspects of death and dying, it may help to understand death and the process of dying. In order to declare (pronounce) a person as having died, a physician performs a physical examination to assess that the person shows signs of death, such as the absence of ''breathing'' and heartbeat, and the individual does not respond in any way to pain. The doctor then completes a death certificate, which indicates the name, date of birth, and date of death, as well as the location of death and its immediate cause, like stopped breathing (''respiration'') or ''heart'' (cardiac) functioning and the medical condition that is thought to have resulted in the cause of death (for example, infection, ''cancer'', ''diabetes'', bleeding from being shot).'""Consulting with a legal expert, such as an attorney, is advisable when either planning for or managing the legal matters associated with a death. Some of the major legal issues involved with dying include the person's right to have informed consent to receive or refuse treatment, advance directives, establishing a living will, and making funeral arrangements, if desired. Informed consent, which is required by law for every patient or patient's guardian to give, is the responsibility of treating practitioners to provide that opportunity to patients. It involves the doctor or other health professional explaining to the patient and/or patient's legal guardian the options for treatment of whatever condition from which the individual suffers, the possible benefits as well as risks for each treatment, and why the health professional may be recommending one treatment over another. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the professional to let their patient know that they have the right to choose whatever treatment they want or to choose to refuse treatment. Particularly when discussing chronic or terminal illness, conditions over which there is little control over the ultimate outcome of care provided, having the individuals and their family feel as much control over their treatment options as possible is of great importance.""'Advance directives are those decisions individuals would like to express to their family and treating professionals prior to potentially becoming no longer able to communicate their wishes prior to death. Examples of advance directives include what, if any, forms of life support the individuals would like to receive to maintain their life, as well as what ""heroic"" or aggressive interventions, if any, they would like made immediately should their heart or breathing stop. Getting food and liquids through a tube, having their breathing or heart rate performed by a machine, and opting for palliative care (care that will address pain and otherwise make them comfortable rather than try to cure them) are choices individuals often consider\xa0in terms of what they want done or not done to maintain their life. In the event that individuals express\xa0a desire to have no heroic or aggressive medical interventions made should their heartbeat or breathing stop, a do not resuscitate order (DNR) is indicated in their medical chart. Opting for such an order is by no means a request to stop all medical treatment. In other words, managing any condition other than actual loss of life (for example, infections, ''anemia'') will continue. Another important example of an advanced directive is whether or not the dying individual would like to be considered as a possible organ donor.'""In order to have their medical and financial wishes carried out, it is important for individuals to name a health proxy, someone trusted to make decisions that are in keeping with the individual's in the event that those wishes are unknown and the person can no longer express his or her wishes. In order to formally appoint a health proxy, an attorney must write a durable ""'power of attorney'"", the legal document appointing the health proxy. In addition to having that document signed, witnessed and notarized, a copy of it must be placed in the individual's medical chart.""""Similar to the medical power of attorney, a durable power of attorney of finances can be helpful to establish who would be in charge of the person's finances if she or he were living but unable to be in charge of their own financial matters.""'Last but not least, if the individual has any strong preferences regarding a funeral or whether his or her remains are buried or cremated, making those wishes known in writing can prevent placing the burden of those decisions on surviving family members, who may struggle with agreeing on these issues, particularly as they grieve the loss of their loved one. As painful as it is to watch a loved one die and as difficult as it may be to talk about their death with them before it happens, many are the families who suffer even more than need be because steps are not taken to address these important legal issues.'

What should I know about group B strep?," Group B Streptococcus (GBS) are bacteria found normally in the intestine, vagina, and rectum in about 25% of all healthy pregnant women. Group B strep infections can affect newborn babies and adults. Most pregnant women who are colonized by the bacteria have no symptoms. The infection can be spread to infants before or during birth. Signs and symptoms of GBS neonatal infection may include fever, breathing problems, seizures, lethargy, and poor feeding. Medical professionals diagnose GBS infection by isolating the organism from body fluids. A positive result means that a person is GBS-positive. The treatment for GBS infection is antibiotics. Complications of GBS infection include sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, or occasionally death. The prognosis for GBS infection depends on the patient's age and underlying medical conditions. In pregnant women, prevention of transmitting GBS infection is best achieved by routine screening for colonization with GBS."
What is group B strep?,"'Group B ''Streptococcus'' (GBS) is a type of gram-positive streptococcal bacteria also known as ''Streptococcus agalactiae''. This type of bacteria (not to be confused with ''group A strep'', which causes ''strep throat'') is commonly found in the ''human body'' (this is termed colonization), and it usually does not cause any symptoms. However, in certain cases, it can be a dangerous cause of various infections that can affect nonpregnant adults, pregnant women, and their newborn infants. In the United States, approximately 30,800 cases of invasive GBS disease occur annually across all age groups. Group B ''strep'' disease is the most common cause of neonatal ''sepsis'' and meningitis in the United States.''Group B streptococcal infection can also afflict nonpregnant adults with certain chronic medical conditions, such as ''diabetes'', ''cardiovascular disease'', ''obesity'', and ''cancer''. The incidence of group B streptococcal disease in adults increases with age, with the highest rate in adults 65 years of age and older (25 cases per 100,000). Although the incidence of neonatal group B ''strep'' infection has been decreasing, the incidence of GBS infection in nonpregnant adults has been increasing.'  "
What causes group B strep infection?,"'Group B strep bacteria can normally be found in about 25%-30% of all healthy pregnant women. Group B strep is commonly found in the intestine, vagina, and rectal area. Most women who are carriers of the bacteria (colonized) will not have any symptoms; however, under certain circumstances, perinatal group B strep infection of both the mother and/or the newborn can develop. In newborns, if the GBS infection develops in the first week of life, it is termed early onset disease. If the GBS infection develops from 1 week to 3 months of age, it is referred to as late onset disease. On average, approximately 1,000 babies in the United States develop early onset disease each year, with similar rates for late onset disease. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of early onset infections decreased from 1.7 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 0.22 cases per 1,000 births in 2016.' "
How do people get group B strep?,"'In newborns, group B ''Streptococcus'' infection is acquired through direct contact with the bacteria while in the uterus or during birth; thus, the gestational bacterial infection is transmitted from the colonized mother to her newborn. Approximately 50% of colonized mothers will pass the bacteria to their babies during ''pregnancy'' and vaginal birth. However, not all babies will be affected by the bacteria, and statistics show that about only one of every 200 babies born to a GBS-colonized mother will actually go on to develop GBS infection.''Group B strep infection is more common in African Americans than in whites. There are also maternal risk factors that increase the chance of transmitting group B ''Streptococcus'' to the newborn leading to early onset disease:''Late onset GBS infection occurs more commonly in babies who are born prematurely (<37 weeks) and in those babies whose mother tested positive for GBS during pregnancy.''Group B strep infection is not a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').' Labor or membrane rupture before 37 weeks gestation Membrane rupture more than 18 hours before delivery Urinary tract infection with GBS during pregnancy Previous baby with GBS infection Fever during labor Positive culture for GBS colonization at 35-37 weeks"
What are group B strep infection symptoms and signs?,"'In newborns with early onset GBS infection, the signs and symptoms usually develop within the first 24 hours after birth. Those babies who develop late onset GBS infection are often healthy and thriving, with the signs and symptoms of the disease developing after the first week of life. Signs and symptoms that may be observed with GBS infection in babies include''Adults who develop invasive GBS infection may develop''The exact source of group B streptococcal disease in nonpregnant adults is often not determined.'   fever, breathing problems/grunting sounds, bluish-colored skin (cyanosis), seizures, limpness or stiffness, heart rate and blood pressure abnormalities, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhea, and fussiness. bloodstream infection (sepsis), skin and soft-tissue infection, bone and joint infection, lung infection (pneumonia), urinary tract infection, and rarely, an infection of the fluid and lining tissues surrounding the brain (meningitis)."
What types of health care professionals treat group B strep infections?,"""Group B strep infections may be diagnosed and treated by different specialists, depending on the patient's age and the potential complications encountered by the patient. In pregnant women, a GBS infection may be diagnosed and treated during ""'labor'"" by the patient's obstetrician/gynecologist or by a family practitioner if they are delivering the baby. Babies who develop a GBS infection will be treated by a pediatrician or a neonatologist, and sometimes an infectious disease specialist may be involved. Nonpregnant adults who develop GBS infection will frequently be treated by their family physician, an internist, or an infectious disease specialist, and rarely by a general or orthopedic surgeon if a skin or bone infection requiring surgery is present."" "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose group B strep infection?,"""In newborns and in adults, isolation of the GBS bacteria is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Laboratory studies that isolate the organism from certain body fluids, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine, help establish the diagnosis. For screening of pregnant women, a health care professional will obtain a swab of a woman's vaginal and rectal area to screen for GBS infection at 35-37 weeks of gestation. Test results can take a few days. A ""'lumbar puncture'' (''spinal tap'') may need to be performed when meningitis is suspected. A health care professional may order imaging studies such as a ''chest X-ray'' to evaluate whether ''pneumonia'' is present.' "
What is the treatment for group B strep?,"'For women who test positive for GBS during pregnancy and for those with certain risk factors for developing or transmitting GBS infection during pregnancy, intravenous antibiotics are recommended at the time of ''labor''. The administration of antibiotics to women before labor who are known to be colonized with GBS is not effective in preventing early onset disease, as it has been found that the GBS bacteria can grow back quickly. Pregnant women with GBS isolated from the urine at any time during the pregnancy and those women who have had a previous infant with invasive GBS infection should receive antibiotics during labor, and thereby do not require the routine GBS screening at 35-37 weeks of gestation. Pregnant women who are not aware of their group B strep status should be given antibiotics during labor if they develop preterm labor (less than 37 weeks gestation), if they have membrane rupture for 18 hours or longer, or if they develop fever during labor. ''Penicillin'' or ''ampicillin'' are the recommended antibiotics, while individuals who are penicillin-''allergic'' may be given either cefazolin, ''clindamycin'', or ''vancomycin''. The administration of antibiotics has been shown to significantly decrease GBS early onset infection in newborns; however, it does not prevent late onset GBS infection. If a pregnant carrier of GBS receives intravenous antibiotics during delivery, her baby has a one in 4,000 chance of developing GBS infection. Without antibiotics, her baby has a one in 200 chance of developing GBS infection.''In neonates and nonpregnant adults who develop invasive group B streptococcal disease, intravenous antibiotics are also the mainstay of treatment. There are certain conditions associated with invasive GBS infection that may require surgical intervention, for example surgical debridement in certain patients with soft tissue/skin/bone infections.'  "
What are the complications of group B strep infection?,"'Invasive infection with GBS in babies may result in sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, or occasionally death. In some babies who survive, long-term sequelae of the disease include deafness, ''blindness'', or developmental disabilities.''In pregnant women, infection with GBS may cause ''urinary tract infection'', infection of the uterus and placenta, as well as preterm delivery, fetal death, or ''miscarriage''.''In nonpregnant adults with chronic medical conditions who develop invasive GBS infection, complications may include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis, skin and soft-tissue infection, bone and joint infection, and rarely meningitis.' "
What is the prognosis of a group B strep infection?,"""The prognosis of a GBS infection varies depending on various factors, including the patient's age and the presence of any underlying medical conditions. In the United States, the death rate (mortality rate) for babies with GBS infection is about 5%. Pregnant women who develop symptoms of GBS infection also have low mortality rates, as they tend to be otherwise healthy. Nonpregnant adults who develop invasive GBS infection tend to have higher mortality rates, ranging from 5%-47% depending on the study, as these\xa0patients tend to be older and they frequently have serious underlying medical conditions."" "
Is it possible to prevent group B strep infection?,"'At this point in time, the best measure for preventing GBS infection is through routine screening during pregnancy. This testing has served to decrease the overall number of early onset GBS infections in newborns by about 80% since aggressive preventive measures were instituted in the 1990s. In pregnant women, routine screening for colonization with GBS is strongly recommended. This screening test is performed between 35-37 weeks of gestation. The test involves using a sterile swab to collect a sample from both the vaginal and rectal areas, with results usually available within 24-72 hours.''Antibiotic administration during labor to pregnant women colonized with GBS and for those with the risk factors outlined above can help decrease the transmission of GBS infection, and thus decrease the incidence of early onset GBS disease in newborns.''Although there is currently no licensed ''vaccine'' available for the prevention of GBS infection, there is research under way to try to develop one for use in the future. Further information about GBS can be found at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/groupbstrep/index.html).' "
What Is the Growth Plate?,"'The growth plate, also known as the epiphyseal plate or physis, is the area of growing tissue near the end of the long bones in children and adolescents. Each long bone has at least two growth plates: one at each end. The growth plate determines the future length and shape of the mature bone. When growth is complete--sometime during adolescence--the growth plates close and are replaced by solid bone. ' "
Who Gets Growth Plate Injuries?,"'These injuries occur in children and adolescents. The growth plate is the weakest area of the growing skeleton, weaker than the nearby ligaments and tendons that connect bones to other bones and muscles. In a growing child, a serious injury to a joint is more likely to damage a growth plate than the ligaments that stabilize the joint. An injury that would cause a sprain in an adult can be associated with a growth plate injury in a child. ''Injuries to the growth plate are ''fractures''. They comprise 15 percent of all childhood fractures. They occur twice as often in boys as in girls, with the greatest incidence among 14- to 16-year-old boys and 11- to 13-year-old girls. Older girls experience these fractures less often because their bodies mature at an earlier age than boys. As a result, their bones finish growing sooner, and their growth plates are replaced by stronger, solid bone. ''Approximately half of all growth plate injuries occur in the lower end of the outer bone of the forearm (radius) at the wrist. These injuries also occur frequently in the lower bones of the leg (tibia and fibula). They can also occur in the upper leg bone (femur) or in the ankle, foot, or hip bone. '  "
What Causes Growth Plate Injuries? ,"'While growth plate injuries are caused by an acute event, such as a fall or a blow to a limb, chronic injuries can also result from overuse. For example, a gymnast who practices for hours on the uneven bars, a long-distance runner, or a baseball pitcher perfecting his curve ball can all have growth plate injuries.''In one large study of growth plate injuries in children, the majority resulted from a fall, usually while ''running'' or playing on furniture or playground equipment. Competitive sports, such as football, basketball, softball, track and field, and gymnastics, accounted for one-third of all injuries. Recreational activities, such as biking, sledding, skiing, and skateboarding, accounted for one-fifth of all growth plate fractures, while car, motorcycle, and all-terrain-vehicle accidents accounted for only a small percentage of fractures involving the growth plate. ''Whether an injury is acute or due to overuse, a child who has ''pain'' that persists or affects athletic performance or the ability to move or put pressure on a limb should be examined by a doctor. A child should never be allowed or expected to ""work through the ''pain''."" '""Children who participate in athletic activity often experience some discomfort as they practice new movements. Some aches and pains can be expected, but a child's complaints always deserve careful attention. Some injuries, if left untreated, can cause permanent damage and interfere with proper growth of the involved limb. ""'Although many growth plate injuries are caused by accidents that occur during play or athletic activity, growth plates are also susceptible to other disorders, such as bone infection, that can alter their normal growth and development. ''Adapted from ''Play It Safe, a Guide to Safety for Young Athletes'' with permission of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. ' Child abuse can be a cause of skeletal injuries, especially in very young children, who still have years of bone growth remaining. One study reported that half of all fractures due to child abuse were found in children younger than age 1, whereas only 2 percent of accidental fractures occurred in this age group.  Injury from extreme cold (for example, frostbite) can also damage the growth plate in children and result in short, stubby fingers or premature degenerative arthritis.  Radiation, which is used to treat certain cancers in children, can damage the growth plate. Moreover, a recent study has suggested that chemotherapy given for childhood cancers may also negatively affect bone growth. The same is true of the prolonged use of steroids for rheumatoid arthritis.  Children with certain neurological disorders that result in sensory deficit or muscular imbalance are prone to growth plate fractures, especially at the ankle and knee. Similar types of injury are seen in children who are born with insensitivity to pain.  The growth plates are the site of many inherited disorders that affect the musculoskeletal system. Scientists are just beginning to understand the genes and gene mutations involved in skeletal formation, growth, and development. This new information is raising hopes for improving treatment of children who are born with poorly formed or improperly functioning growth plates.  Inability to continue play because of pain following an acute or sudden injury  Decreased ability to play over the long term because of persistent pain following a previous injury  Visible deformity of the child's arms or legs  Severe pain from acute injuries that prevent the use of an arm or leg. 
"
How Are Growth Plate Fractures Diagnosed? ,"'After learning how the injury occurred and examining the child, the doctor will use x rays to determine the type of ''fracture'"" and decide on a treatment plan. Because growth plates have not yet hardened into solid bone, they don't show on x rays. Instead, they appear as gaps between the shaft of a long bone, called the metaphysis, and the end of the bone, called the epiphysis. Because injuries to the growth plate may be hard to see on x ray, an x ray of the noninjured side of the body may be taken so the two sides can be compared. ""'Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), which is another way of looking at bone, provides useful information on the appearance of the growth plate. In some cases, other diagnostic tests, such as computed tomography (CT) or ''ultrasound'', will be used. ''Adapted from ''Disorders and Injuries of the Musculoskeletal System'"", 3rd Edition. Robert B. Salter, Baltimore, Williams and Wilkins, 1999. Used with the author's permission. """"Since the 1960's, the Salter-Harris classification, which divides most growth plate fractures into five categories based on the type of damage, has been the standard. The categories are as follows: ""'The epiphysis is completely separated from the end of the bone or the metaphysis, through the deep layer of the growth plate. The growth plate remains attached to the epiphysis. The doctor has to put the fracture back into place if it is significantly displaced. Type I injuries generally require a cast to keep the fracture in place as it heals. Unless there is damage to the blood supply to the growth plate, the likelihood that the bone will grow normally is excellent.''This is the most common type of growth plate fracture. The epiphysis, together with the growth plate, is separated from the metaphysis. Like type I fractures, type II fractures typically have to be put back into place and immobilized. ''This fracture occurs only rarely, usually at the lower end of the tibia, one of the long bones of the lower leg. It happens when a fracture runs completely through the epiphysis and separates part of the epiphysis and growth plate from the metaphysis. Surgery is sometimes necessary to restore the joint surface to normal. The outlook or prognosis for growth is good if the blood supply to the separated portion of the epiphysis is still intact and if the fracture is not displaced. ''This fracture runs through the epiphysis, across the growth plate, and into the metaphysis. Surgery is needed to restore the joint surface to normal and to perfectly align the growth plate. Unless perfect alignment is achieved and maintained during healing, prognosis for growth is poor. This injury occurs most commonly at the end of the humerus (the upper arm bone) near the elbow. ''This uncommon injury occurs when the end of the bone is crushed and the growth plate is compressed. It is most likely to occur at the knee or ankle. Prognosis is poor, since premature stunting of growth is almost inevitable. ''A newer classification, called the Peterson classification, adds a type VI fracture, in which a portion of the epiphysis, growth plate, and metaphysis is missing. This usually occurs with an ''open wound'' or ''compound fracture'', often involving lawnmowers, farm machinery, snowmobiles, or gunshot wounds. All type VI fractures require surgery, and most will require later reconstructive or corrective surgery. Bone growth is almost always stunted. '  "
What Kind of Doctor Treats Growth Plate Injuries?,"'For all but the simplest injuries, the doctor may recommend that the injury be treated by an orthopaedic surgeon (a doctor who specializes in bone and joint problems in children and adults). Some problems may require the services of a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal disorders in children. ' "
How Are Growth Plate Injuries Treated?,"'As indicated in the previous section, treatment depends on the type of fracture. Treatment, which should be started as soon as possible after injury, generally involves a mix of the following: ''The affected limb is often put in a cast or splint, and the child is told to limit any activity that puts pressure on the injured area. '""If the fracture is displaced, the doctor will have to put the bones or joints back in their correct positions, either by using his or her hands (called manipulation) or by performing surgery (open reduction and internal fixation). After the procedure, the bone will be set in place so it can heal without moving. This is usually done with a cast that encloses the injured growth plate and the joints on both sides of it. The cast is left in place until the injury heals, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to two or more months for serious injuries. The need for manipulation or surgery depends on the location and extent of the injury, its effect on nearby nerves and blood vessels, and the child's age. ""'These treatments may also be recommended after the fracture is healed. '""Long-term followup is usually necessary to monitor the child's recuperation and growth. Evaluation includes x rays of matching limbs at 3- to 6-month intervals for at least 2 years. Some fractures require periodic evaluations until the child's bones have finished growing. Sometimes a growth arrest line may appear as a marker of the injury. Continued bone growth away from that line may mean that there will not be a long-term problem, and the doctor may decide to stop following the patient. ""  "
What Is the Prognosis for Growth in the Involved Limb of a Child With a Growth Plate Injury?,"'About 85 percent of growth plate fractures heal without any lasting effect. Whether an arrest of growth occurs depends on the following factors, in descending order of importance: ''Treatment depends on the above factors and also bears on the prognosis. ''The most frequent complication of a growth plate fracture is premature arrest of bone growth. The affected bone grows less than it would have without the injury, and the resulting limb could be shorter than the opposite, uninjured limb. If only part of the growth plate is injured, growth may be lopsided and the limb may become crooked. ''Growth plate injuries at the knee are at greatest risk of complications. Nerve and blood vessel damage occurs most frequently there. Injuries to the knee have a much higher incidence of premature growth arrest and crooked growth. ' Severity of the injury--If the injury causes the blood supply to the epiphysis to be cut off, growth can be stunted. If the growth plate is shifted, shattered, or crushed, a bony bridge is more likely to form and the risk of growth retardation is higher. An open injury in which the skin is broken carries the risk of infection, which could destroy the growth plate.  Age of the child--In a younger child, the bones have a great deal of growing to do; therefore, growth arrest can be more serious, and closer surveillance is needed. It is also true, however, that younger bones have a greater ability to remodel.  Which growth plate is injured--Some growth plates, such as those in the region of the knee, are more responsible for extensive bone growth than others.  Type of growth plate fracture--The five fracture types are described in the section, How Are Growth Plate Fractures Diagnosed? Types IV and V are the most serious. "
What Are Researchers Trying To Learn About Growth Plate Injuries?,"'Researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health continue to seek better ways to diagnose and treat growth plate injuries and to improve patient outcomes.''Examples of such work include:''NIAMS currently funds Core Centers for Musculoskeletal Disorders at major medical centers. These centers provide the resources for established, currently funded investigators who are often from different disciplines, to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to common research problems in musculoskeletal disorders.' Use of therapies to enhance the body's production of chondrocytes. These cells are essential to growth at the ends of the bones. Research on drugs that protect the growth plate during radiation treatment. Identifying radiologic predictors for premature closure of the growth plate following fractures. By predicting the injuries most likely to result in arrested growth, doctors could opt to treat them differently and more aggressively. Research on cancer drugs to determine which ones are likely to affect the growth plates. Further investigating the mechanisms responsible for cartilage and growth-plate defects. Development of methods to regenerate musculoskeletal tissue by using principles of tissue engineering."

What is the glucose tolerance test?,"'Though no longer routinely used for diagnosing ''diabetes''.' The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was the gold standard for making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It is still commonly used during pregnancy for diagnosing gestational diabetes. With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least 8 hours, but not more than 16 hours). The next morning, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives a dose of oral glucose (the dose depends upon the length of the test). There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person drinks. Blood samples are taken up to four times at different time points after consumption of the sugar to measure the blood glucose."
How reliable is the glucose tolerance test?,"'For the glucose tolerance test to give reliable results, the person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a ''common cold''). Also, the person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital) and should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose.' In preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test, the person should eat and drink as they normally would. The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or consume caffeine."
What does the glucose tolerance test measure?,"'The classic oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels five times over a period of three hours. Some physicians simply take a baseline blood sample followed by a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without ''diabetes'', the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with ''diabetes'', glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast.''People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic levels have so-called ''impaired glucose tolerance'' (IGT). People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes.''Each year, 5% to 10% of people whose test results show impaired glucose tolerance actually develop diabetes. ''Weight loss'' and ''exercise'' may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as ''metformin'' (''Glucophage''), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes. Studies have shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the development of ''heart disease'', and whether impaired glucose tolerance turns out to be an entity that deserves treatment itself is something that physicians are currently debating.' "
What is the preparation for a glucose tolerance test?," As mentioned previously, preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test involves fasting overnight (from 8 to 16 hours) and participating normally in activities of daily living. The individual should eat and drink as they normally do prior to the test. The morning of the test, the person should not consume caffeine or smoke."
How are the results of the glucose tolerance test evaluated?,"'Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:' Normal response: A person is said to have a normal 
  response when the two hour glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values 
  between 0 and 2 hours are less than 200 mg/dl. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): A person is said to have impaired 
  glucose tolerance when the fasting plasma glucose is 
  less than 126 mg/dl and the two hour glucose level is between 140 and 199 
  mg/dl. This is sometimes referred to as ""prediabetes"" because people with IGT 
  have a higher risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes: A person has diabetes when two diagnostic 
  tests done on different days show that the blood glucose level is high. This means either the 
  two hour levels is greater than 200 mg/dl or the fasting glucose is noted as greater than 126 mg/dl.
  A 
  glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5% or more also supports a 
  diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes during pregnancy: A pregnant woman has diabetes 
	if she has a fasting plasma glucose of over 92 mg/dl, or a two hour glucose level 
	greater than 153 mg/dl."
What about glucose tolerance testing during pregnancy?,"'As mentioned previously, the glucose tolerance test is used for the diagnosis of ''gestational diabetes'' (diabetes that develops during pregnancy). It may be used if there are equivocal fasting or random blood glucose results, or to screen for gestational diabetes in pregnant women between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation who are not known to have diabetes.\t ''The test may also be used in the postpartum period to detect diabetes in women who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Women who had gestational diabetes do not always develop diabetes later in life, but they should undergo diabetes screening at least every three years throughout their life.\t ' "
What is Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"""Guillain-Barré\xa0syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of its peripheral nervous system—the network of nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. GBS can range from a very mild case with a brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently. Fortunately, most people eventually recover from even the most severe cases of GBS.\xa0 After recovery, some people will continue to have some degree of weakness.""'Guillain-Barré syndrome can affect anyone. It can strike at any age (although it is more frequent in adults and older people) and both sexes are equally prone to the disorder. GBS is estimated to affect about one person in 100,000 each year.'  "
What are the symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"'Unexplained sensations often occur first, such as tingling in the ''feet'' or hands, or even ''pain'' (especially in children), often starting in the legs or back. Children will also show symptoms with difficulty ''walking'' and may refuse to walk. These sensations tend to disappear before the major, longer-term symptoms appear.\xa0 Weakness on both sides of the body is the major symptom that prompts most people to seek medical attention. The weakness may first appear as difficulty climbing stairs or walking. Symptoms often affect the arms, ''breathing'' muscles, and even the face, reflecting more widespread nerve damage. Occasionally symptoms start in the upper body and move down to the legs and feet.''Most people reach the greatest stage of weakness within the first two weeks after symptoms appear; by the third week, 90 percent of affected individuals are at their weakest.''In addition to muscle weakness, symptoms may include:''These symptoms can increase in intensity over a period of hours, days, or weeks until certain muscles cannot be used at all and, when severe, the person is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases, the disorder is life-threatening—potentially interfering with breathing and, at times, with blood pressure or ''heart'' rate.'   Difficulty with eye muscles and vision Difficulty swallowing, speaking or chewing Pricking or pins and needles sensations in the hands and feet Pain that can be severe, particularly at night Coordination problems and unsteadiness Abnormal heartbeat/rate or blood pressure Problems with digestion and/or bladder control."
What causes Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"'The exact cause of GBS is not known. Researchers don’t know why it strikes some people and not others. It is not ''contagious'' or ''inherited''. \xa0'""What they do know is that the affected person's immune system begins to attack the body itself. It is thought that, at least in some cases, this immune attack is initiated to fight infection and that some chemicals on infecting bacteria and ""'viruses'' resemble those on nerve cells, which, in turn, also become targets of attack.\xa0 Since the body’s own immune system does the damage, GBS is called an autoimmune disease (“auto” meaning “self”). Normally the immune system uses antibodies (molecules produced in an immune response) and special white blood cells to protect us by attacking infecting microorganisms (bacteria and viruses). In Guillain-Barré syndrome, however, the immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy nerves.''Most cases usually start a few days or weeks following a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. Occasionally surgery will trigger the syndrome. In rare cases, ''vaccinations'' may increase the risk of GBS. Recently, some countries worldwide reported an increased incidence of GBS following infection with the ''Zika virus''.' "
How is Guillain-Barré syndrome diagnosed?,"'The initial signs and symptoms of GBS are varied and there are several disorders with similar symptoms.\xa0 Therefore, doctors may find it difficult to diagnose GBS in its earliest stages.''Physicians will note whether the symptoms appear on both sides of the body (the typical finding in Guillain-Barré syndrome) and the speed with which the symptoms appear (in other disorders, muscle weakness may progress over months rather than days or weeks). In GBS, deep tendon reflexes in the legs, such as knee jerks, are usually lost. Reflexes may also be absent in the arms. Because the signals traveling along the nerve are slow, a ''nerve conduction velocity test'' (NCV, which measures the nerve’s ability to send a signal) can provide clues to aid the diagnosis. There is a change in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain in people with GBS. Researchers have found the fluid contains more protein than usual but very few immune cells (measured by white blood cells). Therefore, a physician may decide to perform a spinal tap or ''lumbar puncture'' to obtain a sample of spinal fluid to analyze. In this procedure, a needle is inserted into the person’s lower back and a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn from the spinal cord. This procedure is usually safe, with rare complications.''Key diagnostic findings include:' Recent onset, within days to at most four weeks of symmetric weakness, usually starting in the legs Abnormal sensations such as pain, numbness, and tingling in the feet that accompany or even occur before weakness Absent or diminished deep tendon reflexes in weak limbs Elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein without elevated cell count. This may take up to 10 days from the onset of symptoms to develop. Abnormal nerve conduction velocity findings, such as slow signal conduction Sometimes, a recent viral infection or diarrhea."
How is Guillain-Barré syndrome treated?,"'There is no known cure for Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, some therapies can lessen the severity of the illness and shorten recovery time. There are also several ways to treat the complications of the disease.''Because of possible complications of muscle weakness, problems that can affect any paralyzed person (such as ''pneumonia'' or bed sores), and the need for sophisticated medical equipment, individuals with Guillain-Barré syndrome are usually admitted and treated in a hospital’s intensive care unit.''Acute care''There are currently two treatments commonly used to interrupt immune-related nerve damage. One is plasma exchange (PE, also called plasmapheresis); the other is high-dose immunoglobulin therapy (IVIg). Both treatments are equally effective if started within two weeks of the onset of GBS symptoms, but immunoglobulin is easier to administer. Using both treatments in the same person has no proven benefit.''In the process of plasma exchange, a ''plastic'' tube called a catheter is inserted into the person’s veins, through which some blood is removed. The blood cells from the liquid part of the blood (plasma) are extracted and returned to the person. This technique seems to reduce the severity and duration of the Guillain-Barré episode. Plasma contains antibodies and PE removes some plasma; PE may work by removing the bad antibodies that have been damaging the nerves.''Immunoglobulins are proteins that the immune system naturally makes to attack infecting organisms. IVIg therapy involves intravenous injections of these immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulins are developed from a pool of thousands of normal donors. When IVIg is given to people with GBS, the result can be a lessening of the immune attack on the nervous system. The IVIg can also shorten recovery time. Investigators believe this treatment also lowers the levels of effectiveness of antibodies that attack the nerves by both “diluting” them with non-specific antibodies and providing antibodies that bind to the harmful antibodies and take them out of commission.''Miller-Fisher syndrome is also treated with plasmapheresis and IVIg.''Anti-inflammatory steroid hormones called ''corticosteroids'' have also been tried to reduce the severity of Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, controlled ''clinical trials'' have demonstrated that this treatment is not effective.''Supportive care is very important to address the many complications of paralysis as the body recovers and damaged nerves begin to heal. Respiratory failure can occur in GBS, so close monitoring of a person’s breathing should be instituted initially. Sometimes a mechanical ventilator is used to help support or control breathing. The autonomic nervous system (that regulates the functions of internal organs and some of the muscles in the body) can also be disturbed, causing changes in heart rate, blood pressure, toileting, or ''sweating''. Therefore, the person should be put on a heart monitor or equipment that measures and tracks body function. Occasionally GBS-related nerve damage can lead to difficulty handling secretions in the mouth and throat. In addition to the person choking and/or ''drooling'', secretions can fall into the ''airway'' and cause ''pneumonia''.''Rehabilitative care''As individuals begin to improve, they are usually transferred from the acute care hospital to a rehabilitation setting. Here, they can regain strength, receive physical rehabilitation and other therapy to resume activities of daily living, and prepare to return to their pre-illness life.\xa0''Complications in GBS can affect several parts of the body. Often, even before recovery begins, caregivers may use several methods to prevent or treat complications. For example, a therapist may be instructed to manually move and position the person’s limbs to help keep the muscles flexible and prevent muscle shortening. Injections of blood thinners can help prevent dangerous ''blood clots'' from forming in leg veins. Inflatable cuffs may also be placed around the legs to provide intermittent compression. All or any of these methods help prevent blood stagnation and sludging (the buildup of ''red blood cells'' in veins, which could lead to reduced blood flow) in the leg veins. Muscle strength may not return uniformly; some muscles that get stronger faster may tend to take over a function that weaker muscles normally perform—called substitution. The therapist should select specific exercises to improve the strength of the weaker muscles so their original function can be regained.''Occupational and vocational therapy help individuals learn new ways to handle everyday functions that may be affected by the disease, as well as work demands and the need for assistive devices and other adaptive equipment and technology.'  "
What is the long-term outlook for those with Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"'Guillain-Barré syndrome can be a devastating disorder because of its sudden and rapid, unexpected onset of weakness—and usually actual paralysis. Fortunately, 70% of people with GBS eventually experience a full recovery. With careful intensive care and successful treatment of infection, autonomic dysfunction, and other medical complications, even those individuals with respiratory failure usually survive.''Typically, the point of greatest weakness occurs days to at most 4 weeks after the first symptoms occur. Symptoms then stabilize at this level for a period of days, weeks, or, sometimes months. Recovery, however, can be slow or incomplete. The recovery period may be as little as a few weeks up to a few years. Some individuals still report ongoing improvement after 2 years. About 30 percent of those with Guillain-Barré have a residual weakness after 3 years. About 3 percent may suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations many years after the initial attack. About 15 percent of individuals experience long-term weakness; some may require ongoing use of a walker, wheelchair, or ankle support. Muscle strength may not return uniformly.''Ongoing ''fatigue'', pain, and other annoying sensations can sometimes be troublesome. ''Fatigue'' is best handled by pacing activities and providing time for rest when ''fatigue'' sets in. Those with Guillain-Barré syndrome face not only physical difficulties, but emotionally painful periods as well. It is often extremely difficult for individuals to adjust to sudden paralysis and dependence on others for help with routine daily activities. Individuals sometimes need psychological counseling to help them adapt. Support groups can often ease the emotional strain and provide valuable information.' "
What research is being done on Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"'The mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) is to seek fundamental knowledge of the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological diseases. The NINDS conducts research on disorders including Guillain-Barré syndrome and funds research at major institutions and universities. The NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the leading supporter of biomedical research in the world.''Neuroscientists, immunologists, virologists, and pharmacologists are working collaboratively to learn how to prevent GBS and to make better therapies available when it strikes.''Scientists are concentrating on finding new treatments and refining existing ones. Scientists are also looking at the workings of the immune system to find which cells are responsible for beginning and carrying out the attack on the nervous system. The fact that many cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome begin after a viral or bacterial infection suggests that certain characteristics of some viruses and bacteria may activate the immune system inappropriately. Investigators are searching for those characteristics. Certain proteins or peptides in viruses and bacteria may be the same as those found in myelin, and the production of antibodies to neutralize the invading viruses or bacteria could trigger the attack on the myelin sheath.''Some studies show that normal variations in certain genes could increase the risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome; however, more research is necessary to identify and confirm associated genes. Since many of the genes that may increase the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome are involved in the immune system, their roles in fighting infection might contribute to the development of the condition.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0''NINDS-funded researchers have developed a mouse model with an altered autoimmune regulator gene that generates autoimmunity against the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Using this model, scientists hope to identify which PNS proteins are at the greatest risk of autoimmune attack and which components of the immune system contribute to the autoimmune response against the PNS. A greater understanding of how the immune system damages the PNS could lead to better treatments for autoimmune disorders such as GBS.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0''Other NINDS-funded researchers are investigating the mechanisms by which IVIg treatment lessens the symptoms of GBS. By understanding these mechanisms, it may be possible to develop more effective treatments.' "

What is dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease)?,"'Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease (GWD), is an infection caused by the parasite ''Dracunculus medinensis''. A parasite is an organism that feeds off of another to survive. GWD is spread by drinking water containing Guinea worm larvae. Larvae are immature forms of the worm. GWD affects poor communities in remote parts of Africa that do not have safe water to drink. GWD is considered by global health officials to be a neglected tropical disease (NTD) -- the first parasitic disease slated to be eradicated.''Many federal, private, and international agencies are helping the countries that still have local GWD cases to eradicate this disease. During 2014, only four countries had local GWD cases: Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. Cases have gone from 3.5 million per year in 1986 to 126 in 2014.' "
How does Guinea worm disease spread?,"'People become infected with Guinea worm by drinking water from ponds and other stagnant water containing tiny ""water fleas"" that carry the Guinea worm larvae. The larvae are eaten by the water fleas that live in these water sources.''Once drunk, the larvae are released from copepods in the stomach and penetrate the digestive track, passing into the body cavity. During the next 10-14 months, the female larvae grow into full-size adults. These adults are 60-100 centimeters (2-3 feet) long and as wide as a cooked spaghetti noodle.''When the adult female worm is ready to come out, it creates a blister on the skin anywhere on the body, but usually on the legs and feet. This blister causes a very painful burning feeling and it bursts within 24-72 hours. Immersing the affected body part into water helps relieve the ''pain''. It also causes the Guinea worm to come out of the wound and release a milky white liquid into the water that contains millions of immature larvae. This contaminates the water supply and starts the cycle over again. For several days, the female worm can release more larvae whenever it comes in contact with water.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Guinea worm disease?,"'People do not usually have symptoms until about one year after they become infected. A few days to hours before the worm comes out of the skin, the person may develop a ''fever'', swelling, and pain in the area. More than 90% of the worms come out of the legs and feet, but worms can appear on other body parts too.'""People in remote rural communities who have Guinea worm disease often do not have access to health care. When the adult female worm comes out of the skin, it can be very painful, slow, and disabling. Often, the wound caused by the worm develops a secondary bacterial infection. This makes the pain worse and can increase the time an infected person is unable to function to weeks or even months. Sometimes, permanent damage occurs if a person's joints are infected and become locked.""  "
What is the treatment for Guinea worm disease?,"'There is no drug to treat Guinea worm disease and no vaccine to prevent infection. Once part of the worm begins to come out of the wound, the rest of the worm can only be pulled out a few centimeters each day by winding it around a piece of gauze or a small stick. Sometimes the whole worm can be pulled out within a few days, but this process usually takes weeks. Medicine, such as ''aspirin'' or ''ibuprofen'', can help reduce pain and swelling. Antibiotic ointment can help prevent secondary ''bacterial infections''. The worm can also be surgically removed by a trained doctor in a medical facility before a blister forms.' "
Where is Guinea worm disease found?,"'Only four countries reported local Guinea worm disease in 2014. These countries were Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. Many other African countries and all of Asia are now free of GWD. As of January 2015, the World Health Organization had certified 198 countries, territories, and areas, representing 186 WHO Member States as being free of GWD transmission.' "
Who is at risk for infection with Guinea worm disease?,'Anyone who drinks pond and other stagnant water contaminated by persons with GWD is at risk for infection. People who live in villages where GWD is common are at greatest risk.' 
Is Guinea worm disease a serious illness?,"'Yes. The disease causes preventable suffering for infected people and is a financial and social burden for affected communities. Adult female worms come out of the skin slowly and cause great pain and disability. ''Parents'' with active Guinea worm disease might not be able to care for their ''children''. The worm often comes out of the skin during planting and harvesting season. Therefore, people might also be prevented from working in their fields and tending their animals. This can lead to financial problems for the entire family. Children may be required to work the fields or tend animals in place of their sick parents. This can keep them from attending school. Therefore, GWD is both a disease of poverty and also a cause of poverty because of the disability it causes.' "
Is a person immune to Guinea worm disease once he or she has it?,'No. No one is immune to Guinea worm disease. People in affected villages can suffer year after year.' 
Is it possible to prevent Guinea worm disease?,"'Guinea worm disease can be prevented by avoiding drinking unsafe water. Teaching people to follow these simple control tactics can completely prevent the spread of the disease:' Drink only water from protected sources (such as from boreholes or hand-dug wells) that are free from contamination. Prevent people with swellings and wounds from entering ponds and other water used for drinking. Always filter drinking water from unsafe sources, using a cloth filter or a pipe filter, to remove the tiny ""water fleas"" that carry the Guinea worm larvae. Treat unsafe drinking water sources with an approved larvicide, such as ABATE®*. This will kill the tiny ""water fleas."" Provide communities with new safe sources of drinking water and repair broken safe water sources (e.g., hand-pumps) if possible."

Sometimes the whole worm can be pulled out within a few days, but this process usually takes weeks. Medicine, such as ''aspirin'' or ''ibuprofen'', can help reduce pain and swelling. Antibiotic ointment can help prevent secondary ''bacterial infections''. The worm can also be surgically removed by a trained doctor in a medical facility before a blister forms.' "
Where is Guinea worm disease found?,"'Only four countries reported local Guinea worm disease in 2014. These countries were Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. Many other African countries and all of Asia are now free of GWD. As of January 2015, the World Health Organization had certified 198 countries, territories, and areas, representing 186 WHO Member States as being free of GWD transmission.' "
Who is at risk for infection with Guinea worm disease?,'Anyone who drinks pond and other stagnant water contaminated by persons with GWD is at risk for infection. People who live in villages where GWD is common are at greatest risk.' 
Is Guinea worm disease a serious illness?,"'Yes. The disease causes preventable suffering for infected people and is a financial and social burden for affected communities. Adult female worms come out of the skin slowly and cause great pain and disability. ''Parents'' with active Guinea worm disease might not be able to care for their ''children''. The worm often comes out of the skin during planting and harvesting season. Therefore, people might also be prevented from working in their fields and tending their animals. This can lead to financial problems for the entire family. Children may be required to work the fields or tend animals in place of their sick parents. This can keep them from attending school. Therefore, GWD is both a disease of poverty and also a cause of poverty because of the disability it causes.' "
Is a person immune to Guinea worm disease once he or she has it?,'No. No one is immune to Guinea worm disease. People in affected villages can suffer year after year.' 
Is it possible to prevent Guinea worm disease?,"'Guinea worm disease can be prevented by avoiding drinking unsafe water. Teaching people to follow these simple control tactics can completely prevent the spread of the disease:' Drink only water from protected sources (such as from boreholes or hand-dug wells) that are free from contamination. Prevent people with swellings and wounds from entering ponds and other water used for drinking. Always filter drinking water from unsafe sources, using a cloth filter or a pipe filter, to remove the tiny ""water fleas"" that carry the Guinea worm larvae. Treat unsafe drinking water sources with an approved larvicide, such as ABATE®*. This will kill the tiny ""water fleas."" Provide communities with new safe sources of drinking water and repair broken safe water sources (e.g., hand-pumps) if possible."
What is gum disease (gingivitis)?,"'Gingivitis'', the earliest stage of gum disease, is inflammation of the tissues surrounding and supporting the ''teeth'' and is most commonly a result of poor ''dental hygiene''. ''Gingivitis'' is a very common condition and varies widely in severity. It is characterized by red, swollen gums that bleed easily when ''teeth'' are brushed or flossed. Gingivitis is not the same thing as periodontitis. Gingivitis always precedes and acts as a warning sign for the more serious condition of periodontitis.'""Gingivitis starts when food debris mixes with saliva and bacteria which, in turn, forms dental plaque that sticks to the surfaces of teeth. If dental plaque isn't removed by brushing with ""'toothpaste'' and flossing, it can become mineralized and form tartar, or calculus. Tartar is very hard, and only a professional dental cleaning can remove it.'""Both dental plaque and tartar are filled with harmful bacteria, and if they aren't removed from teeth, they will begin to irritate the gums and cause gingivitis. If left untreated, gingivitis will often extend from the gums to the bone and lead to periodontitis."" "
What is the difference between gingivitis and periodontitis?,"'While gingivitis is inflammation of the gums around the teeth, periodontitis occurs when the bone below the gums gets inflamed or infected. Periodontitis derives from the word ''periodontal,'' which means ""around the tooth"" and refers to the structures that surround and support teeth such as gum and bone. Periodontology is the study of the supporting structures of the teeth.''When the underlying bone gets infected, the gums will start to recede away from the teeth and form deep gum pockets. This is called attachment loss. These pockets readily collect plaque and bacteria. Because these pockets are very difficult to keep clean, more bone loss occurs. As periodontal disease progresses into later stages (early, moderate, and advanced) and more bone tissue is lost, the gum pockets are deeper and the teeth may eventually become loose and fall out.' "
What causes gum disease?,"'Improper oral hygiene that allows bacteria in plaque and calculus to remain on the teeth and infect the gums is the primary cause of gum disease. But there are other factors that increase the risk of developing gingivitis. Here are some of the most common risk factors:' Smoking or chewing tobacco prevents the gum tissue from being able to heal. Crooked, rotated, or overlapping teeth create more areas for plaque and calculus to accumulate and are harder to keep clean. Hormonal changes in puberty, pregnancy, and menopause typically correlate with a rise in gingivitis. The increase in hormones causes the blood vessels in the gums to be more susceptible to bacterial and chemical attack. At puberty, the prevalence of gingivitis ranges between 70%-90%. Cancer and cancer treatment can make a person more susceptible to infection and increase the risk of gum disease. Alcohol negatively affects oral defense mechanisms. Stress impairs the body's immune response to bacterial invasion. Mouth breathing can be harsh on the gums when they aren't protected by the lips, causing chronic irritation and inflammation. Poor nutrition, such as a diet high in sugar and carbohydrates and low in water intake, will increase the formation of plaque. Also, a deficiency of important nutrients such as vitamin C will impair healing. Diabetes mellitus impairs circulation and the gums ability to heal. Medications such as antiseizure medications increase the risk for gum disease. Infrequent or no dental care Poor saliva production"
Does gum disease cause bad breath?,"'Bad breath'', or ''halitosis'', is most frequently associated with gum disease. The oral bacteria that is present in the mouth release chemical gases called volatile sulfur compounds that have a strong odor. ''Bad breath'' can also come from the bacterial plaque that builds up on the tongue. When the plaque and tartar are removed from the teeth and tongue with regular brushing, flossing, and professional dental cleanings, the halitosis can be eliminated. This is the easiest way to reverse bad breath, but it can take a while for the mouth odor to completely disappear. A person needs to be consistent and persistent with oral hygiene to reverse the condition.''Other causes of bad breath include partially erupted ''wisdom teeth'', ''dry mouth'', mouth breathing, ''postnasal drip'', infections in the throat or ''lungs'', ''tonsil stones'', ''smoking'', digestive problems, and systemic diseases like ''diabetes''.' "
What does gum disease look like? What are gum disease symptoms and signs?,"'A person with gum disease will typically have one or more of the following signs and symptoms:''As gingivitis progresses (chronic gingivitis), various complications may arise. If gingivitis advances to periodontitis, the affected person may develop receding gums or areas where the root of the tooth becomes uncovered by the shrinking, diseased gums. Deep pockets may also develop around the teeth that trap food, plaque, and debris. As periodontitis develops, the person may lose gum tissue or bone around the teeth and the teeth may become loose or fall out. These changes can develop either very slowly or very rapidly and can affect either a few teeth or the entire mouth. If oral hygiene is almost never performed or if the person becomes immune-compromised, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis can develop (ANUG, formerly termed trench mouth). This is a painful condition where infected gums swell, ulcerate, and slough off dead tissue.''In the case of ''dental implants'', peri-implant disease occurs where bacteria can cause irritation, inflammation, and destruction of the surrounding gum and bone much in the same way that periodontal disease affects the surrounding structures of teeth.'""It is possible to have gingivitis or periodontitis and not notice any signs or symptoms, so regular visits to a dental professional are vital in determining a patient's specific risk level. The dentist is the primary care provider of the mouth and will be able to provide all of the facts and information necessary in diagnosing the disease and taking steps in treating gum disease.""   Bright red, swollen gums that bleed very easily, even during brushing or flossing A bad taste or persistent mouth odor White spots or plaques on the gums Gums that look like they're pulling away from the teeth Pus between gums or interdental spaces A change in the way the teeth fit together in the mouth or spaces opening up between teeth Loose teeth or tooth loss Change in the way partial dentures fit"
How do health care professionals diagnose gum disease?,"'The following methods and symptoms and signs are very useful in the diagnosis of gum disease during routine checkups:' Measuring the gums: A dentist or dental hygienist will use a periodontal probe to measure the depths of the pockets around all of the teeth in the mouth generally once per calendar year. Healthy gums will have pockets 1 mm-3 mm deep. Beyond that, the deeper the pockets, the more severe the disease. Taking X-rays: Dental X-rays, particularly bitewing X-rays, will help show the level of the underlying bone and whether any bone has been lost to periodontal disease. Examining sensitive teeth: Teeth that have become sensitive around the gum line may indicate areas of receding gums. Check for loose teeth: Teeth may become loose due to bone loss or an incorrect bite. Checking the gums: A dentist or hygienist will look for red, swollen, or bleeding gums."
What is the treatment for gum disease?,"'The treatment goals for gingivitis are to identify and eliminate the factors that make the person more susceptible to gum disease. Most factors can be eliminated by establishing more consistent and thorough oral hygiene habits and professional dental cleanings. If there are certain risk factors such as ''smoking'' or uncontrolled ''diabetes'' that are contributing to the gum disease, they need to be addressed or eliminated to have success in reversing gingivitis. After the plaque and tartar are removed by a dentist or dental hygienist, the patient can usually eliminate gingivitis by brushing and flossing after every meal. Under the supervision of a dentist, a patient can use a prescription mouth rinse that specifically targets oral bacteria that cause gum disease. This is especially helpful in patients where conventional oral hygiene practices like brushing and flossing are impaired due to age or special needs.'""In individuals where gingivitis has led to periodontal disease and there are deep pockets that are difficult to clean, the patient may require deep scaling and root planing to clean teeth that are surrounded by deep pockets. They may need surgical treatment to gain access to all the tooth surfaces for a more thorough cleaning. This surgical procedure is called flap surgery and can be combined with a pocket-reduction surgery to make the areas around the teeth easier for the patient to clean with brushing and flossing. This procedure consists of numbing the gums and then lifting them back to expose and clean the teeth and sometimes reshape the bone. The gums are then repositioned back around the teeth so there aren't the deep pockets that existed before treatment.""'Soft-tissue grafts cover up root surfaces exposed by receding gums. This can help eliminate sensitive teeth and protect the root surfaces that are softer and more difficult to clean.''Laser therapy is another treatment to help increase gum health. The gum pocket is treated with a soft-tissue laser to eliminate the harmful bacteria deep in the periodontal pockets, remove unhealthy tissue, and help stimulate healing.'  "
What types of specialists treat gum disease?,"'Periodontists are dentists who have completed additional training in periodontology after dental school. They are focused entirely on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of disease of the gum and bone surrounding the teeth. In advanced cases of gingivitis or periodontitis, a general dentist may recommend a gross debridement of superficial plaque and tartar and will then refer the affected patient to a periodontist for evaluation. Periodontists may recommend a variety of nonsurgical or surgical procedures to help stabilize the gum condition. Periodontists are also very skilled at performing treatments of other conditions of the gums and bone including gum and bone grafts, functional and esthetic gingivectomy, gingivoplasty, implants, and ''crown'' lengthening. Because gum disease in its advanced stages is the primary cause of tooth loss today, periodontists are especially important in working to treat a difficult disease.' "
What types of medications are used to treat gum disease?,"'Chlorhexidine gluconate (''Peridex'') is an antiseptic mouthwash that can be used under the direction of a dentist to help reduce the bacteria that cause gum disease. Additionally, antibiotic therapy can be combined in various ways to help treat periodontitis. Pellets or gels like PerioChip that contain the chlorhexidine or ''doxycycline'' can be placed in deep gum pockets after deep scaling and root planing to kill stubborn bacteria and reduce the size of periodontal pockets. These modes of delivering medications are very effective because the agent is released slowly over the course of about seven days. Additional medications such as ''Xylocaine'' and ''NSAIDs'' may be needed for ''pain'' control during and after treatment.' "
Are home remedies or natural treatments effective for gum disease?,"'There has been evidence to suggest the effectiveness of the following ''over-the-counter'' and natural treatments for gum disease:'   Green tea has antioxidants that reduce inflammation in the body. Hydrogen peroxide helps kill bacteria when used as a mouthwash or as a gel in a custom fitted tray, but it cannot be swallowed. Warm saltwater rinses can help to soothe sore mouth tissue. Baking soda diluted in water can be used to rinse and brush the teeth and gumline to help neutralize the acids that irritate the gum tissue. Oil pulling (swishing or rinsing): There has been little evidence to prove that sesame oil or coconut oil can help reduce bacteria that cause gum disease, but has been become a recent trend. On a case by case basis, people have noticed improvement with this treatment. In addition, see the section on prevention of gum disease and on toothpaste."
Is it possible to reverse gum disease?,"'As long as the causes of early stage gum disease (gingivitis) are correctly identified and the patient is persistent in improving their oral hygiene and seeking necessary treatment, gum disease can be reversible. The prognosis is best when treatment is obtained in early stages of gingivitis. At this stage, the affected person usually just needs a professional dental cleaning and more thorough brushing and flossing to reverse the disease. Once the bacteria spreads to the bones in periodontitis, irreversible changes can start to take place with loss of attachment of the gums and bone loss. Therefore, it is very important to catch and treat gum disease as early as possible.' "
Is gum disease associated with other health problems?,"'There have been many attempts to understand the link between gum disease and other systemic health problems such as ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and '""Alzheimer's""' disease. Comparing the bacteria that cause dental plaque with the bacteria involved in ''heart disease'' suggests a correlation between gum disease and ''heart disease'', but researchers have been unable to establish a cause and effect relationship. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, recent studies have shown that periodontal disease bacteria may play a role in the pathology of '""Alzheimer's""' disease. These types of relationships are difficult to prove or disprove, so it is fair to assume that aiming for a life free of gum disease will only help in leading a generally healthier life.'""While it may be hard to prove what health problems are directly caused by gum disease, it is known that certain health problems can cause gum disease. If there are any sudden changes to a person's medical condition, they should ask their primary care provider or dentist if there might be any effects on ""'oral health'"". Healthy gums can quickly become threatened when the body's overall health diminishes or changes for any reason.""  "
How is gum disease managed in children?,"'A child should start having his or her teeth brushed with a pea-sized amount of toothpaste beginning at 12 months of age. Emphasis should be placed on brushing all surfaces of the teeth including the gum line. As soon as the gaps between the teeth start to close, it is important to start flossing. At the beginning, the parents should establish a routine to brush the teeth so the child can get used to it. As soon as the child is able, the brushing and flossing should be passed over to him or her and monitored by the parent to ensure good thorough technique and consistency. According to the American Dental Association, a child should get regular dental visits starting at about one year of age. Abiding by these guidelines will help prevent and treat gum disease in most children.''It is common for there to be an increase in gingivitis during puberty due to the hormonal changes that occur throughout the body. Adolescents should be monitored for good oral hygiene habits and taken to the dentist regularly to treat gum disease with professional dental cleanings.' "
How is gum disease managed in pregnancy?,"'Many women who become ''pregnant'"" think that they should avoid the dentist to keep their pregnancy safe, but they shouldn't miss their professional cleanings as long as they feel strong and comfortable enough. During pregnancy, women are at risk of developing pregnancy gingivitis. Because of the increase in hormones that occurs with pregnancy, the gum tissues are more susceptible to attack from bacteria and other pathogens. Pregnant women will often notice an increase in swollen, bleeding gums even if their oral hygiene has remained consistent. It may be necessary to get dental cleanings more often than usual during pregnancy to help combat this increased risk."" "
Is it possible to prevent gum disease?,"'Prevention of gingivitis and periodontitis is very simple in most cases. Gum disease is best prevented through proper plaque control. This involves brushing to remove plaque from the outer surfaces of the teeth and flossing to remove food particles and plaque from in between the teeth. Electronic toothbrushes tend to make it easier to remove plaque from some of the harder to reach areas of the mouth. Using a mouthwash after brushing and flossing can also help by reducing the bacteria that cause gingivitis.''Besides these basic oral hygiene practices, there are other things that can be done to eliminate the factors that lead to an increase in gum disease:' Sleep/stress: The immune system is very important in controlling disease, and getting adequate sleep and reducing stress will help the body fight gum disease, too. Stop smoking: Smokers are much more likely to develop gingivitis and periodontitis. Avoiding tobacco should be a primary goal to achieve healthy gums. Orthodontic therapy or braces: It is much easier to remove plaque from straight teeth than crowded, overlapped, and crooked teeth. Braces can make a big difference in having healthier gums. Diet: Limiting the frequency of plaque-causing sugars and carbohydrates will help limit plaque. Eating a well-balanced diet will help keep the body's immune system healthy and ready to fight infection."
What is the best toothpaste to use to prevent gum disease?,"'The goal of toothbrushing is to remove plaque on the teeth that will harbor bacteria and cause gum disease and ''tooth decay''. Just about any toothpaste when used with consistent thorough brushing habits will accomplish this goal. Fluoride in toothpaste, particularly stannous fluoride, helps to kill mouth bacteria. There are other ingredients in toothpastes that help remove plaque more effectively and help keep plaque off the teeth after they have been brushed. The abrasive agents in toothpaste such as silicates and calcium carbonates help remove sticky plaque. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is a detergent in toothpaste that causes the foaming effect of toothpastes. Toothpastes vary in the amount of SLS they contain; a high concentration of SLS can cause problems for patients who have ''dry mouth'"" or low saliva flow. Some toothpastes include plaque-control agents such as pyrophosphates and zinc citrate that prevent plaque from sticking to the teeth after they've been brushed. Using a toothpaste that contains any combination of these ingredients will increase the effectiveness of oral hygiene."" "
Is gum disease contagious?,"'While most of the factors that lead to gingivitis and periodontal disease are dependent on the individual, there has been some limited scientific evidence to affirm that gingivitis and periodontitis-causing bacteria can be passed down from parents to children and between couples.' "
What are common types of gum problems?,"   The most common gum problem is gingivitis and is found in over 50% of the adult U.S. population. Gingivitis is defined as inflammation of the gums. Signs of gum inflammation include bleeding during tooth-brushing, swollen-looking gums, and red gums. Healthy gums generally appear firm, coral-pink, and do not bleed with stimulation. Gums can appear dark from pigmentation in certain ethnic populations, and this is considered normal. The second most common gum problem is gum disease (periodontal disease, periodontitis). According to the American Dental Association, 47.2% of Americans over 30 years of age are affected by periodontitis. Periodontitis exhibits similar signs to gingivitis except it also results in gum tissue and jawbone loss. The damage of periodontitis is particularly concerning in that the loss of gum tissue and bone loss cannot be recovered. Periodontitis typically progresses over time and may not produce painful symptoms until the disease reaches the later stages of damage. Unfortunately, this explains why gum disease is the leading cause of tooth loss. A common adult gum problem is gum recession. Gum recession is when the root (or cementum) of the tooth becomes exposed as the gum line pulls away from its original attachment. This could be a result of gum disease as the jawbone surrounding the teeth is lost. Wherever jawbone is lost, gums will follow, and this exposes the root of the tooth. Exposed roots can be sensitive to temperature, are more prone to decay, and can present a cosmetic concern. Other causes for gum recession include teeth grinding, use of chewing tobacco, brushing too aggressively, hereditary weak gums, orthodontic treatment, or trauma. Another gum problem is a gum abscess (periodontal abscess). It presents as a blister or a bump in the gum that contains pus. It is caused by a bacterial infection that takes place in a deep gum pocket and causes pain and swelling. A less common gum problem is oral cancer. Oral cancer can occur on all soft-tissue structures within the mouth. On the gums, it may appear as a red or white patch or a sore that does not heal."
What causes gum problems?,"'A healthy mouth is host to a complex and dynamic community of bacteria. In fact, the presence of oral bacteria is generally beneficial to the well-being of the mouth. Problems begin when there is a change in the balance of the bacteria in the mouth. Oral bacteria are able to adhere to teeth and gums in the form of dental plaque, which is the soft, sticky film that forms on teeth every day. If dental plaque remains for a prolonged period of time, it turns into a hardened calcified deposit called tartar that sticks to teeth near the gums. Tartar cannot be brushed or flossed away. Furthermore, tartar creates an environment for more dental plaque to accumulate. With the overgrowth of dental plaque and buildup of tartar, the balance of oral bacteria in the mouth shifts to unhealthy proportions.''With the presence of dental plaque, the gums respond with inflammation. Our body\'s immune system response through inflammation is the process that can ultimately lead to loss of gum attachment, or ""periodontal ligament"" and jawbone deterioration.''Other causes of gum problems may involve foreign bodies affecting the gums, such as poorly contoured dental work, or sensitivity to material in dental work. Viral infection can also be a cause of gum disease. In children, gingivostomatitis is a condition that causes symptoms of swelling and sores around the mouth or gums. It may be caused by a bacterial or viral infection or poor oral hygiene.''Certain medications or damage to the salivary glands can cause gum problems by decreasing saliva flow in the mouth, leading to a condition called ''dry mouth''. Among its functions, saliva is essential in helping break down our food for ''digestion'', aiding in oral hygiene and keeping the mouth tissues from drying out. Diminished saliva flow or complete lack of saliva allows for bacterial growth in the mouth. In turn, tooth decay and gum problems can occur.''In the case of oral ''cancer'', changes at the microscopic level within a cell can occur. Our bodies have mechanisms to destroy this abnormal cell, but sometimes, the cell is able to escape these mechanisms and progress to develop ''cancer''.'  "
What are the risk factors for gum problems?,"'Poor ''dental hygiene'' practices that allow for dental plaque to build up are directly linked to gum problems. Devices around teeth, such as dental ''braces'' (orthodontic treatment), can make it difficult to properly brush and floss around teeth. Additional risk factors to consider are as follows:' Smoking: This habit is a strong factor in the progression of gum disease and oral cancer. Genetics: Family history may influence who is more susceptible to gum problems. Diabetes: This systemic disease may cause an individual to have a weaker immune system against gum problems. Other systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis have been linked to gum problems, as well. Age: Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that more than 70% of the U.S. population age 65 and older has periodontitis. Poor nutrition: Vitamin or nutrient deficiencies in diet can adversely affect the body's ability to fight off infections, including those related to the gums."
What are signs and symptoms of gum problems?,"'Healthy gums should appear coral pink and firm without bleeding. Signs and symptoms of gum inflammation include''A discolored area or an ulceration that does not heal within two weeks are signs of a gum problem that could be unrelated to inflammation or periodontitis.' redness, swelling, bleeding with brushing or flossing, bad breath, and pain. Gums that bleed and/or feel sore while brushing is an indication of a problem. Receding gums may also be a sign of gum disease. Gums recede as a result of the destruction of the underlying bone surrounding the teeth. Once the bone is lost, the gums recede and expose the root surface of a tooth. Persistent bad breath can indicate periodontal disease. Bacteria specific to periodontal disease release volatile sulfur compounds that are often responsible for the symptom of bad breath."
How do orthodontists diagnose gum problems?,"'A periodic gum exam performed at the dental office measures the spaces between the gum and teeth called ""periodontal pockets,"" the amount of root that is exposed for each tooth called ""gum recession,"" and other signs of bone loss.\xa0Collectively, these measurements give an indication of the overall health of the gums and what areas are problematic.''Other indicators of gum problems include;''If necessary, a biopsy of the affected tissue is performed for diagnosis.' the presence of bleeding with measurements, gum redness, gum swelling, bad breath, or a persistent sore or mass that lasts for more than two weeks."
Can gum problems be a sign or symptom of something that can kill you?,"'Given the fact that gum disease is the leading cause of tooth loss, having healthy gums is certainly something for which we should strive. Loss of teeth can negatively impact an individual in many ways through loss of ''nutrition'', psychosocial concerns, and self-esteem issues.''Periodontal disease has been linked to several health problems, most notably, ''heart disease''. Inflammation appears to be the key factor that links ''heart'' disease to gum problems. Research suggests that having periodontitis increases the risk of heart disease in an individual. One study shows that mouth bacteria were found in the fatty deposits of people with ''atherosclerosis''. Those fatty deposits can clog arteries and restrict blood flow. If a blocked artery supports the heart or brain, it can result in a ''heart attack'' or ''stroke''.''A discolored area, lump, or mass that appears to persist for longer than two weeks may be a sign of oral cancer. Early diagnosis by a health care professional is crucial to improve treatment outcomes in this situation.' "
What types of treatment cure gum disease? Can you treat and cure it at home without treatment?,"'A gum exam performed by a dentist can determine the best way to treat a gum problem. Deep gum pockets may indicate advanced periodontal disease. Periodontal disease treatment can begin at the dental office with a thorough dental cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist. A gum specialist (periodontist) can treat more advanced gum problems that persist after initial treatment.''In the case of gingivitis, a professional dental cleaning may be needed to remove the buildup of tartar and plaque around the teeth. This procedure allows the gums to heal. Additionally, specific oral hygiene instruction and a recommended schedule for routine care are equally important to maintaining gum health.''For periodontal disease, treatment is more involved. The first step usually involves a more thorough deep professional dental cleaning called ""scaling and root planing."" This removes the tartar deposits and plaque that are deeply sequestered in the pockets of the gums. Medications can also be employed to control bacteria infecting the gums. The medications come in the form of antimicrobial (antibacterial) mouthwashes, oral antibiotics, and antibiotics placed directly into the gum pockets. Lastly, there is gum surgery to treat areas that do not respond to scaling and root planing and/or medications. The goal of gum surgery is to remove diseased tissue, preserve the remaining gums and bone, and create an environment that is easy to keep clean. Periodontists perform gum surgeries such as gingivectomy (to trim or recontour gums), connective tissue graft (to strengthen weak areas of the gum line), and pocket reduction (to eliminate deep pockets that trap food debris and bacteria).''Usually, gum recession is left alone unless there is an extensive amount of recession that compromises the health of the tooth or there is a cosmetic concern. A procedure called a ""gum graft"" may be performed that takes tissue from another area in the mouth (such as the roof of the mouth) and surgically grafts it onto the area of recession.''For a gum abscess, scaling and root planing is performed to clear out debris, diseased tissue, and any pus that may be present. The area is irrigated with antimicrobial rinses and may have antibiotics directly placed into the pocket. Oral antibiotics may also be prescribed to help control the infection. Once the abscess disappeared, the area can be assessed for further treatment such as surgery to avoid a reoccurring gum problem.''At-home remedies after dental professional care may help soothe sore gums. Make a mouthwash using ¼ teaspoon baking soda, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1 cup of warm water. Regularly brushing teeth well and massaging gums at the gumline with a fluoride ''toothpaste'' can help eliminate dental plaque and debris to promote further healing. Additionally, flossing to reach between teeth is essential to maintain gum health.''Gum (oral) cancer treatment varies based on the stage of disease. Treatment modalities include surgery, ''chemotherapy'', and ''radiation''. A combination of treatment modalities are often used.' "
What are the complications with gum problems?,"'Gum problems that go untreated usually progress to more advanced stages depending on the primary problem. For gingivitis and periodontitis, the biggest complication is jawbone deterioration and eventual tooth loss. Untreated, a periodontal abscess will grow and allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream to infect the entire body. Oral cancer that goes undetected will progress and spread.' "
What is the best way to care for your gums?,"'The best way to care for gums is to develop a routine of good oral hygiene at home and regular visits to your dental professional. Seek specific advice about how to properly clean around the teeth. As a general rule, it is recommended to brush twice a day and floss daily. More care and attention is especially important for those with dental ''braces'' and dental work such as ''dental crowns'' because dental plaque is often retained around these areas. Address any changed areas such as sores or discolored areas that persist in the mouth so that early treatment is possible if needed. During ''pregnancy'', hormonal changes make the gums more sensitive and easily prone to inflammation. Good dental hygiene is essential at this time to prevent a quick progression of periodontal problems.'  "
"What is the prognosis for gingivitis, oral cancer, and other gum problems?","'The prognosis for gum problems largely depends on when the condition is discovered and treated. Gum problems treated in the early stages have the best prognosis, and the condition process can be reversed. This is especially true of gingivitis, which is a reversible condition. Conversely, periodontal disease has irreversible effects due to the bone loss that can never be regained. Given that periodontal disease is the leading cause of tooth loss, the prognosis can range from fair to hopeless depending on the level of disease present.''For oral cancer, early diagnosis is crucial for the best treatment outcome. The latest data shows that five-year survival after the diagnosis of oral cancer is 57%. Survival rates are higher for ''cancers'' diagnosed in the early stages.' "
Can you prevent gum problems?,"'Most gum problems are preventable or, at the very least, can be controlled. For some individuals with ''inherited'' periodontal disease, it can be a lifelong effort to keep the condition in check. Identifying problems at an early stage with self-monitoring and regular dental exams is key to avoid potentially bigger problems down the line. Finally, good dental care is essential at home and with your routine dental professional visits.' "
What is graft-versus-host disease?,"""Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an immune condition that occurs after transplant procedures when immune cells from the donor (known as the graft or graft cells) attack the recipient patient host's tissues; the disease is a side effect that is common after an allogeneic ""'bone marrow transplant'' (stem cell transplant). An allogeneic transplant is one in which a patient receives bone marrow tissue or cells from a donor. Stem cell transplantation is a common treatment for many different ''cancers'' (malignancies), including cancers that affect the blood and ''lymph nodes'', as well as some other (non-''cancer'') conditions that affect the blood or immune system. A stem cell transplant is sometimes performed after a relapse of ''leukemia'' or ''lymphoma'' that occurs after initial treatment. In addition to bone marrow transplant procedures, GVHD can also occur after transplantation of solid organs that may contain immune system cells such as white blood cells.'""Tissues from healthy donors are checked prior to bone marrow transplant to see how closely matched they are to the host's own cells. When there is a close match in certain genetic markers, the risk of the disease is lower. The disease can range from mild to life-threatening in severity. There are two types of GVHD: acute GVHD and chronic GVHD.""'The chance of developing GVHD is around 30%-40% when the donor and recipient are related and around 60%-80% when the donor and recipient are not related. The disease can affect many different organs in the body.' "
What causes graft-versus-host disease?,'The pathophysiology of graft versus host disease is complex. GVHD is the result of a series of complex interactions between the immune cells of the donor (the graft) and the host tissues; the disease is most likely to occur after a transplantation procedure when donor and recipient tissues are not genetically similar. A number of cytokines and other immune signaling compounds are believed to be important in the development of the condition.' 
What are risk factors for GVHD?,"'Patients undergoing bone marrow transplant (stem cell transplant) from a donor are at increased risk for GVHD. Medical research has also shown that the likelihood of developing GVHD increases with certain underlying disease states. The disease is also more likely to occur in older people. The risk is slightly elevated when the donor and patient are of different gender. Before the transplanted cells are given to the patient, a pretreatment regimen of drugs is given to suppress the immune system and to help prevent GVHD. Other risk factors for the disease include having a tissue donor who has been ''pregnant'' and advanced age of either the donor or recipient.' "
What are graft-versus-host disease symptoms and signs? What are the types of GVHD?,"'There are two main types of GVHD: acute GVHD and chronic GVHD.''Acute GVHD'' typically occurs within 100 days after the stem cell transplantation. ""Acute"" is a medical term that means that a condition appears early or suddenly, while ""chronic"" refers to a condition that develops over time. Acute graft-versus-host disease usually involves a distinct set of clinical symptoms and signs that include the following:''Chronic GVHD'' usually begins after the first 100 days following a transplant. Chronic graft-versus-host disease is more likely to occur in patients who experienced the acute form of the disease, but it can also develop on its own in someone who never has had GVHD before.''The symptoms of both acute and chronic GVHD may be staged as mild, moderate, or severe enough to be life-threatening. Some patients may develop other types of GVHD:'  Dermatitis, or skin inflammation, is characterized by an itchy, red, and possibly painful rash. Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, may not have symptoms at the outset but can also lead to jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) and other signs of liver failure. Enteritis, or inflammation of the intestinal tract, can lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, cramping, abdominal pain, or blood in the stool. The diarrhea of acute GVHD has been described as greenish, watery, mucoid or having mucus, and/or containing sloughed intestinal lining cells that may appears as casts (lumps or clumps of cells) in the stool. Dry eyes or mouth Vision changes White patches inside the mouth or mouth ulcers Difficulty swallowing Hair loss Sensitivity to spicy or acidic foods Mouth pain Pulmonary symptoms include wheezing or shortness of breath Muscle or joint pain and weakness Fatigue Skin rash that is red to purple, flat or raised, and may be accompanied by thickened skin and raised areas of skin Skin discoloration Vaginal dryness Loss of appetite and weight loss Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes Abdominal pain or tenderness Persistent, recurrent, late-onset GVHD: Patients develop acute GVHD symptoms more than 100 days post-transplant. Overlap syndrome: anytime when post transplant patients develop symptoms of both acute and chronic GVHD"
What specialists treat GVHD?,"""Patients with GVHD are treated by the team of medical specialists that manage the transplantation process. Hematologist-oncologists (medical doctors specializing in the treatment of cancerous tumors and blood diseases) who are transplant specialists typically lead these teams and coordinate the patient's care."" "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose GVHD?,"""A tissue biopsy (a small sample of tissue removed for examination under a microscope by a pathologist physician) is a common test used to diagnose GVHD when the patient's clinical signs and symptoms suggest that GVHD is present. Sometimes, biopsies from other sites in the body are done instead of or in addition to the skin biopsy.""'Blood tests that can be helpful in managing the patient with GVHD include blood cell counts and blood chemistry profiles. Blood tests that assess ''liver function'' are also commonly performed when GVHD is suspected or diagnosed.' "
What are GVHD treatment options?,"'Immunosuppressant medications are the hallmark of treatment for GVHD. These include both ''corticosteroid'' drugs (such as ''prednisolone'' or ''methylprednisolone'') and more advanced medications and techniques that reduce the immune response. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy for GVHD, but other medications may be added or given when the GVHD does not respond well to steroid treatment. A number of different medications and combinations of medications are available to treat GVHD, and ''clinical trials'' are ongoing to examine new treatments as well as treatments for GVHD that does not respond to steroid treatment.''Some nonsteroid immune-suppressing drugs and treatments that have been used to treat GVHD include the following:''An increased risk of infections, including bacterial and ''fungal infections'', is the main health risk and side effect of treatment with immune-suppressing drugs.''Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) is a treatment that involves a combination of leukopheresis and ''photodynamic therapy'', in which patient blood is exposed to a sensitizing agent followed by ultraviolet A irradiation and reinfused into the patient.'  Antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin) Denileukin diftitox (Ontak) Daclizumab (Zenapax) Infliximab (Remicade) Sirolimus (Rapamune) Tacrolimus (Prograf) Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) Etanercept (Enbrel) Pentostatin (Nipent) Thalidomide (Thalomid)"
What is the prognosis of graft-versus-host disease?,"'The prognosis or outcome of GVHD depends both upon the severity and extent of the symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. GVHD is highly variable, with symptoms that can range from mild to life-threatening. Signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD may last for years or may be permanent in some people.' "
Is it possible to prevent GVHD?,"'Advances in medical transplantation techniques have helped to reduce the risk of developing acute GVHD, including more precise techniques to determine whether donor cells are a good match for the recipient and processing of the donor cells to remove T cells, or T lymphocytes; a T cell is a type of immune cell that mediates the reaction in GVHD. Using umbilical cord blood as a source of donor cells can also reduce the likelihood of developing GVHD. Finally, patients undergoing stem cell transplants are given a regimen of immune-suppressing drugs such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, ''tacrolimus'' (''Prograf''), ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''Cellcept''), or ''sirolimus'' (''Rapamune'') to decrease the likelihood of developing the condition. Even with advancing technology, it is not always possible to prevent GVHD.' "
What is gynecomastia (enlarged male breasts)?,"'Gynecomastia is enlargement of the glandular tissue of the male breast. During infancy, ''puberty'', and in middle-aged to older men, gynecomastia can be common. Gynecomastia must be distinguished from pseudogynecomastia or lipomastia, which refers to the presence of fat deposits in the breast area of ''obese'' men. True gynecomastia results from growth of the glandular, or breast tissue, which is present in very small amounts in men. The condition is the most common reason for medical evaluation of the male breast.'  "
Who gets gynecomastia?,"'Normally developing pubertal males may be at risk for gynecomastia that is part of the normal developmental process. Normal male infants also may have gynecomastia.''Other risk factors include:' Aging, since aging may promote decreases in testosterone production that can cause the problem. The risks for developing enlarged male breasts related to specific diseases and conditions (such as cirrhosis of the liver) are the same risk factors that predispose to those conditions. Taking certain medications may increase the risk of developing the problem."
What are the signs and symptoms of gynecomastia?,"'The primary symptom of gynecomastia is enlargement of the male breasts. As mentioned before, gynecomastia is the enlargement of glandular tissue rather than fatty tissue. It is typically symmetrical in location with regard to the ''nipple'' and may have a rubbery or firm feel. Gynecomastia usually occurs on both sides but can be unilateral in some cases. The enlargement may be greater on one side even if both sides are involved. Tenderness and sensitivity may be present, although there is typically no severe ''pain''.''The most important distinction with gynecomastia is differentiation from ''male breast cancer'', which accounts for about 1% of overall cases of ''breast cancer''. Usually, ''cancer'' is confined to one side, is not necessarily centered around the ''nipple'', feels hard or firm, and can be associated with dimpling of the skin, retraction of the nipple, ''nipple discharge'', and enlargement of the underarm (axillary) ''lymph nodes''.'  "
What causes gynecomastia during puberty? How long does it last?,"'Gynecomastia results from an imbalance in hormone levels in which levels of estrogen (female hormones) are increased relative to levels of androgens (male hormones). Gynecomastia that occurs in normally growing infant and pubertal boys that resolves on its own with time is known as physiologic gynecomastia.''All individuals, whether male or female, possess both female hormones (''estrogens'') and male hormones (androgens). During puberty, levels of these hormones may fluctuate and rise at different levels, resulting in a temporary state in which estrogen concentration is relatively high. Studies regarding the prevalence of gynecomastia in normal adolescents have yielded widely varying results, with prevalence estimates as low as 4% and as high as 69% of adolescent boys. These differences probably result from variations in what is perceived to be normal and the different ages of boys examined in the studies.''Gynecomastia caused by transient changes in hormone levels with growth usually disappears on its own within six months to two years. Occasionally, gynecomastia that develops in puberty and persists beyond two years is referred to as ''persistent pubertal gynecomastia''.' "
What diseases and conditions cause gynecomastia?,"'A number of medical conditions may also result in gynecomastia:' Malnutrition and re-feeding (recovery from malnutrition) have both been shown to create a hormonal environment that may lead to gynecomastia. Similarly, cirrhosis of the liver alters normal hormone metabolism and may lead to gynecomastia. Disorders of the male sex organs (testes) can result in decreased testosterone production and relatively high estrogen levels, leading to gynecomastia. These disorders may be genetic, such as Klinefelter's syndrome or acquired due to trauma, infection, reduced blood flow, or aging. Testicular cancers may also secrete hormones that cause gynecomastia. Other conditions that are associated with an altered hormonal environment in the body and may be associated with gynecomastia are chronic renal failure and hyperthyroidism. Rarely, cancers other than testicular tumors may produce hormones that can cause gynecomastia."
What medications cause gynecomastia?,"'Gynecomastia can be a side effect of many medications, for example:''It is appropriate to consult a doctor or other healthcare professional if you think you may be developing or have the condition.' spironolactone (Aldactone), a diuretic that has anti-androgenic activity Calcium channel blockers used to treat hypertension (such as nifedipine [Procardia and others]) ACE inhibitor drugs for hypertension (captopril [Capoten], enalapril [Vasotec]) Some antibiotics (for example, isoniazid, ketoconazole [Nizoral, Extina, Xolegel, Kuric], and metronidazole [Flagyl]) Anti-ulcer drugs (such as ranitidine [Zantac], cimetidine [Tagamet], and omeprazole [Prilosec]) Anti-androgen or estrogen therapies for prostate cancer methyldopa (Aldomet) Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV disease, which may cause fat redistribution leading to pseudogynecomastia or, in some cases, true gynecomastia digitoxin diazepam (Valium) Drugs of abuse (for example, alcohol, marijuana, heroin) Lavender oil and tea tree oil, when used in skin-care products, have been associated with gynecomastia"
How do I know if I have gynecomastia (diagnosis)?,"'The definition of gynecomastia is the presence of breast tissue greater than 0.5 cm in diameter in a male. As previously discussed, gynecomastia is the presence of true breast (glandular) tissue, generally located around the nipple. Fat deposition is not considered true gynecomastia.''In most cases, gynecomastia can be diagnosed by a physical examination. A careful medical history is also important, including medication and ''drug use''. If there is a suspicion of ''cancer'', a ''mammogram'' may be ordered by a health care practitioner. Further tests may be recommended to help establish the cause of gynecomastia in certain cases. These can include blood tests to examine liver, kidney, and thyroid function. Measurement of hormone levels in the bloodstream may also be recommended in some cases.' "
How long does it take for gynecomastia to go away?,"'Although pubertal gynecomastia typically regresses on its own, in rare cases it may persist, requiring treatment. Rarely, it may persist, which requires treatment. Gynecomastia that has been present over 12 months or more (long term) may undergo scarring (fibrosis), which makes treatment with medications much more difficult, if not impossible to achieve a response.''Psychological consequences can occur if the breast enlargement is pronounced or is a source of embarrassment.' "
What drugs are used for the treatment of gynecomastia?,"'Gynecomastia, especially in pubertal males, often goes away on its own within about six months, so observation is preferred over specific treatment in many cases. Stopping medications and treatment of existing medical problems or health conditions that cause enlarged breasts in men also are mainstays of treatment.'   Medical treatments are available to treat gynecomastia, but data on their effectiveness are limited. No drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of gynecomastia; however, medications that have been used to treat the condition include: Testosterone replacement has been effective in older men with low levels of testosterone, but it is not effective for men who have normal levels of the male hormone. Clomiphene can be used to treat gynecomastia. It can be taken for up to 6 months. The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen (Nolvadex) has been shown to reduce breast volume in gynecomastia, but it was not able to entirely eliminate all of the breast tissue. This type of therapy often is most used for severe or painful gynecomastia. Danazol is a synthetic derivative of testosterone that decreases estrogen synthesis by the testes. It works by inhibition of pituitary secretion of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), substances that direct the sex organs to produce hormones. It is less commonly used to treat gynecomastia than other medications."
What about surgery for the treatment of gynecomastia? Can it be cured?,"'Medications are more effective in reducing gynecomastia in the early stages, since scarring often occurs after about 12 months. After the tissue has become scarred, medications are not likely to be effective, and surgical removal is the only possible treatment.''Reduction mammoplasty (''breast reduction'' surgery) has been used in severe cases of the condition, long-term gynecomastia, or in cases in which drug therapies have not been effective to help restore a normal breast appearance.''Typically, gynecomastia is not associated with long-term problems.' "
Are gynecomastia and male breast cancer related?,"'Men with gynecomastia have about a five-fold greater risk for developing male ''breast cancer'' when compared with the general population. It is believed that the gynecomastia itself is not a ''precancerous'' condition, but rather that the hormonal changes (relative increase in estrogens, lower levels of androgens) that produce gynecomastia in adult men also increase their risk of developing ''breast cancer''.' "
Can gynecomastia be prevented?,'Gynecomastia that occurs because of hormonal fluctuations with growth or ''aging'' cannot be prevented. Gynecomastia related to medical conditions can only be prevented to the extent that the underlying or responsible condition can be prevented.'
