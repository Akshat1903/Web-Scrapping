What is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?,"""Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are known as the ""'inflammatory bowel'"" diseases (IBD). The precise cause of IBD remains unknown. These diseases are believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic, or environmental factors (for example, infections) that interact with the body's immune (defense) system. When the intestinal immune system does not function properly, many white blood cells accumulate in the inner lining (mucosa) of the gut. The white cells then release chemicals that lead to tissue injury (inflammation). This inflammation of the mucosa can cause ""'diarrhea'"", which is the most common symptom of  ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, with or without the intestinal complications.""  "
What are the intestinal complications of IBD?,"'''The intestinal complications of IBD occur when the intestinal inflammation is severe, extends beyond the inner lining (mucosa) of the intestines, is widespread, and/or is of long duration (chronic). For example, severe mucosal inflammation can cause ulcers, bleeding, and toxic megacolon (a condition in which the colon widens, or dilates, and loses its ability to properly contract). Inflammation that extends beyond the inner lining and through the intestinal wall is responsible for strictures (scarring that causes narrowing of the intestinal wall) and fistulas (tubular passageways originating from the bowel wall and connecting to other organs or the skin). Strictures, in turn, can lead to bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine (SIBO). If the inflammation of the small bowel is widespread, malabsorption of nutrients can be a complication. Chronic inflammation can also be associated with colon ''cancer''.'' The majority of IBD patients experience periods during which their disease intensifies (flares) or subsides (remissions). Although most patients require medication for IBD, they are able to live normal, productive lives. Some patients, but certainly not all, will develop intestinal complications of IBD. When these complications occur, they should be recognized and usually treated. Some patients with IBD develop complications outside of the intestine (extraintestinal), such as certain kinds of ''arthritis'', skin ''rashes'', ''eye problems'', and ''liver disease''. These extraintestinal complications are discussed in other articles on IBD.'' This review will describe the various types of intestinal complications that are associated with IBD, and will also summarize methods for their diagnosis and treatment. Please note that the terms bowel, intestine, and gut are used synonymously. The small bowel, or intestines, includes from top to bottom, the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large bowel is also called the colon.' "
Are the intestinal complications of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease different?,"""Some intestinal complications of IBD occur in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. For example, ulceration of the inflamed inner intestinal lining (mucosa), which causes ""'abdominal pain'"" and intestinal bleeding, may complicate both diseases. Since both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease involve the colon,  complications that are associated with the colon, such as toxic megacolon and  colon ""'cancer'"", occur in both diseases. Additionally, there are no intestinal complications that occur only in ulcerative colitis and not in  Crohn's disease. On the other hand, certain intestinal complications of IBD occur predominantly in Crohn's disease (for example, fistulas) or exclusively in Crohn's disease and not in  ulcerative colitis (for example, malabsorption and SIBO)."""" The differences in intestinal complications between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease depend on the characteristically dissimilar behaviors of the inflammation associated with these diseases. In Crohn's disease, the inflammation usually extends from the inner lining (mucosa) through the entire thickness of the bowel wall. This spreading inflammatory process may thereby lead to fistulas, abscesses, or strictures of the bowel. By contrast, the inflammation in ulcerative colitis is limited to the inner lining of the colon. The development of these particular complications is, therefore, much less common in ulcerative colitis. Also, Crohn's disease can affect any area of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus, whereas ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon. Therefore, complications involving the small intestine, such as malabsorption and SIBO, as previously noted, occur only in Crohn's disease and not in ulcerative colitis."" "
Do intestinal ulcers occur in IBD?,"""When the inflammation in the inner lining of the intestine becomes severe, it can break through the inner lining to form ulcers. The ulcers associated with ulcerative colitis are located in the colon, whereas ulcers in Crohn's disease may be found anywhere in the gut from the mouth (aphthous ulcers) to the anus. When examined, ulcerative colitis ulcers are typically shallow and more numerous, while Crohn's disease ulcers are usually deeper and with more distinct borders.""'The symptoms caused by intestinal ulcers are predominantly ''abdominal pain'', ''cramps'', and bleeding. Sometimes, however, ulcers may be present in IBD but are not associated with any symptoms (asymptomatic).'""In Crohn's disease, the inflammation and accompanying ulcers occur most commonly in the ileum, jejunum, and colon, but can occasionally occur in the duodenum. Note, however, that these ulcers are entirely different from the far more common acid-related peptic ulcers in the duodenum."" "
How are ulcers in IBD diagnosed and treated?,"'Intestinal ulcers can be diagnosed by directly viewing the lining of the intestines. Various procedures, utilizing viewing instruments called endoscopes, are available. Endoscopes are flexible, thin, tubular instruments that are inserted into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through either the mouth or rectum, depending on the procedure. Which procedure is done depends on the part of the GI tract that is being examined. ''Endoscopy'' can be done for either the upper or ''lower GI'' tracts. The endoscope is inserted through the mouth for ''upper endoscopy'' or through the rectum for lower endoscopy. The colon is examinedeither by ''sigmoidoscopy'' (using sigmoidoscopes) for the lower (sigmoid) part ofthe colon or by ''colonoscopy'' (using a ''colonoscope'') for the entire colon.''The upper GI tract is examined by a procedure called esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (''EGD'""). An upper GI endoscope is used for this procedure. EGD is useful in detecting Crohn's disease ulcers in the ""'esophagus'', stomach, and the duodenum.''Crohn\'s disease ulcers in the small intestine may be seen by a procedure called enteroscopy, in which a special endoscope (called an enteroscope) is used. But enteroscopies need special equipments and are not widely available. Ulcers in the small intestine, however, are more often diagnosed with an X-ray study called a ""small bowel follow-through"" (SBFT). In this test, the patient swallows a few cups of barium, which coats the lining of the small intestine. On the X-ray, the barium may show the presence of ulcers. However, SBFT may not be accurate, and may not detect small ulcers in the small bowel. In patients suspected of having small bowel Crohn\'s disease ulcers and yet have normal SBFT studies, CT (''computerized tomography'') of the small bowel and capsule enteroscopy may be helpful in diagnosis.''Capsule enteroscopy is a procedure where a patient swallows a small camera the size of a pill. The camera located inside ''the pill'"" takes multiple images of the inside of the small bowel and transmits these images wirelessly onto a recorder worn around the patient's waist. The recorded images are later reviewed by a doctor. Both CT of the small bowel and capsule enteroscopy in some studies have been found to be more accurate than the traditional SBFT in diagnosing Crohn's disease of the small bowel.""'The treatment of ulcers in IBD is aimed at decreasing the underlying inflammation with various medications. These medications include ''mesalamine'' (''Asacol'', ''Pentasa'', or ''Rowasa''), ''corticosteroids'', antibiotics, or immunosuppressive\xa0medications such as 6-MP (6-''mercaptopurine'', ''Purinethol'') or ''azathioprine'' (Imuran). In some cases, ulcers can be very resistant to these treatments and the use of stronger ''drugs'' may be required. These drugs include an immunosuppressive medication, ''cyclosporine'' (''Neoral'' or ''Sandimmune''), or the newer ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'""), which is an antibody to one of the body's inflammation-inducing chemicals called ""'tumor'' necrosis factor (TNFa). ''Adalimumab'' (''Humira'') and ''certolizumab'' (''Cimzia'') are also in the same class of drugs as infliximab. Occasionally, therapy with medications fails to heal IBD ulcers and surgical treatment is needed.' "
Does gastrointestinal bleeding occur in IBD?,"""Bleeding from the intestinal tract, or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, may complicate the course of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. ""'GI bleeding'' is often referred to as ''rectal bleeding'' when the blood comes out of the rectum, usually with the stools. If the source of bleeding is in the colon, the blood is usually a red color. The longer the blood the remains in the intestine, however, the darker it becomes. Thus, ''rectal bleeding'' originating from higher up in the intestinal tract is usually black, except for very rapid bleeding, which can still be red.'' Patients with ulcerative colitis usually experience some degree of chronic (long duration) rectal bleeding, which can be continuous or intermittent. The bleeding may be mild, as when it is limited to occasional drops on the toilet paper or streaks of blood around the stools. At times, however, the bleeding may be more severe or acute, with the passage of greater amounts of blood or large ''blood clots'"". The more severe rectal bleeding is most likely due to more severe inflammation and extensive ulceration of the colon. In Crohn's disease, mild or severe intestinal inflammation also may occur, but the ulcers and bleeding are less frequent than in ulcerative  colitis. Because of the deep nature of ulcers in Crohn's disease, however, the GI bleeding tends to be acute (sudden and brief) and sporadic. Furthermore, in Crohn's disease, the site of bleeding can be anywhere in the GI tract, including the colon."" "
How is gastrointestinal bleeding in IBD diagnosed and treated?,"'''Intestinal bleeding in IBD is usually diagnosed by EGD for the upper GI tract or colonoscopy for the lower GI tract. These methods allow for direct visualization of the bleeding site, which can be particularly helpful. Additionally, special instruments can be used through the upper GI endoscopes or colonoscopes, which may effectively treat the bleeding lesions and stop ongoing blood loss. Sometimes, if the bleeding is severe and the bleeding site is suspected to be in the small intestine, other tests may be needed. One of these tests is a special X-ray study called an ''angiogram'', which uses a dye to visualize the intestinal blood vessels that may be bleeding. Another test is a nuclear medicine study called a tagged red blood cell scan, which tracks the ''red blood cells'' from the blood stream to the gut. Each of these tests can help identify the site of bleeding. Pinpointing the bleeding site becomes additionally important if surgery is ultimately needed.'' No medications as yet have been shown to specifically stop acute GI bleeding in IBD. Nevertheless, the initial approach to IBD-associated GI bleeding is aggressive medical treatment of the underlying inflammation and ulceration. Chronic bleeding might respond to medications if the inflammation resolves and the ulcers heal. If the medications or endoscopic treatments do not stop acute or severe chronic bleeding, however, surgical removal (resection) of the bleeding area of the gut may be necessary.' "
How do intestinal strictures form in IBD?,"'When inflammation is present for a long time (chronic), it sometimes can cause scarring (fibrosis). ''Scar tissue'' is typically not as flexible as healthy tissue. Therefore, when fibrosis occurs in the intestines, the scarring may narrow the width of the passageway (lumen) of the involved segments of the bowel. These constricted areas are called strictures. The strictures may be mild or severe, depending on how much they block the contents of the bowel from passing through the narrowed area.'""Crohn's disease is characterized by inflammation that tends to involve the deeper layers of the intestines. Strictures, therefore, are more commonly found in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Additionally, strictures in Crohn's disease may be found anywhere in the gut. Remember that the intestinal inflammation in ulcerative colitis is confined to the inner lining (mucosa) of the colon. Accordingly, in chronic ulcerative colitis, benign (not ""'malignant'') strictures of the colon occur only rarely. In fact, a narrowed segment of the colon in ulcerative colitis may well be caused by a colon cancer rather than by a benign (non-cancerous), chronic inflammatory stricture.' "
"What are symptoms of intestinal strictures, and how are they diagnosed and treated?","'Individuals may not know that they have an intestinal stricture. The stricture may not cause symptoms if it is not causing significant blockage (obstruction) of the bowel. If a stricture is narrow enough to hinder the smooth passage of the bowel contents, however, it may cause abdominal ''pain'', cramps, and ''bloating'' (distention). If the stricture causes an even more complete obstruction of the bowel, patients may experience more severe ''pain'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and an inability to pass stools.''An ''intestinal obstruction'' that is caused by a stricture can also lead to perforation of the bowel. The bowel must increase the strength of its contractions to push the intestinal contents through a narrowing in the bowel. The contracting segment of the intestine above the stricture, therefore, may experience increased pressure. This pressure sometimes weakens the bowel wall in that area, thereby causing the intestines to become abnormally wide (dilated). If the pressure becomes too high, the bowel wall may then rupture (perforate). This perforation can result in a severe infection of the abdominal ''cavity'' (''peritonitis''), abscesses (collections of infection and pus), and fistulas (tubular passageways originating from the bowel wall and connecting to other organs or the skin). Strictures of the small bowel also can lead to bacterial overgrowth, which is yet another intestinal complication of IBD.''Intestinal strictures of the small intestine may be diagnosed with a small bowel follow-through (SBFT) X-ray. For this study, the patient swallows barium, which outlines the inner lining of the small intestine. Thus, the X-ray can show the width of the passageway, or lumen, of the intestine. Upper GI endoscopy (EGD) and enteroscopy are also used for locating strictures in the small intestine. For suspected strictures in the colon, barium can be inserted into the colon (''barium enema''), followed by an X-ray to locate the strictures. Colonoscopy is another diagnostic option.''Intestinal strictures may be composed of a combination of ''scar'' tissue (fibrosis) and tissue that is inflamed and, therefore, swollen. A logical and sometimes effective treatment for these strictures, therefore, is medication to decrease the inflammation. Some medications for IBD, such as infliximab, however, may make some strictures worse. The reason is that these medications may actually promote the formation of scar tissue during the healing process. If the stricture is predominantly scar tissue and is only causing a mild narrowing, symptoms may be controlled simply by changes in the ''diet''. For example, the patient should avoid high ''fiber'' foods, such as raw carrots, celery, beans, seeds, nuts, fiber, bran, and dried fruit.'""If the stricture is more severe and can be reached and examined with an endoscope, it may be treated by stretching (dilation) during the endoscopy. In this procedure, special instruments are used through the endoscope to stretch open the stricture, usually with a balloon thatis passed through an endoscope. Once the balloon traverses the stricture, it is inflated and the force of the balloon dilates the stricture to a bigger size, thus opening the lumen to make it wider. If that doesn't work, some patients will require surgery. Typically, this procedure does not produce long-lasting results.""'Surgery sometimes is needed to treat intestinal strictures. The operation may involve cutting out (resecting) the entire narrowed segment of bowel, especially if it is a long stricture. More recently, a more limited operation, called stricturoplasty, has been devised. In this procedure, the surgeon simply ''cuts'"" open the strictured segment lengthwise and then sews the tissue closed crosswise so as to enlarge the width of the bowel's passageway (lumen). After surgery in Crohn's disease patients, medication still should be taken to prevent inflammation from recurring, especially at the site of the stricture. The reason for this recommendation is that after abdominal operations, recurrent intestinal inflammation is a common problem in Crohn's disease. Furthermore, the risk of post-operative intestinal fistulas and abscesses is increased in Crohn's disease patients. Therefore, only abdominal surgery that is absolutely necessary should be done in patients with Crohn's disease."" "
What are intestinal fistulas?,"""Intestinal fistulas are tubular connections between the bowel and other organs or the skin. Fistulas form when inflammation extends through all of the layers of the bowel and then proceeds to tunnel through the layers of other tissues. Accordingly, fistulas are much more common in Crohn's disease than in  ulcerative colitis. (In the latter, as you recall, the inflammation is confined to the inner lining of the large intestine.) Fistulas often are multiple. They may connect the bowel to other loops of the bowel (enteroenteric fistulas), to the abdominal wall (enterocutaneous), to the skin around the anus (perianal), and to other internal locations such as the urinary bladder (enterovesical), vagina (enterovaginal), muscles, and scrotum."""" In Crohn's disease patients, fistulas may form in conjunction with intestinal strictures. One reason for this association is that both fistulas and strictures can begin with inflammation of the entire thickness of the bowel wall (transmural inflammation). Subsequent scarring (fibrosis) causes strictures while continuing inflammation and tissue destruction leads to the fistulas. A stricture can also help create a fistula. As already mentioned, a perforation of the intestine can occur above an obstructing stricture. The perforation can create a tract outside of the bowel wall. A fistula then may develop in this tract."" "
What symptoms do fistulas cause and how are they diagnosed and treated?,"""Some fistulas, especially those that connect adjacent loops of bowel, may not cause significant symptoms. Other fistulas, however, can cause significant abdominal pain and external drainage, or create a bypass of a large segment of intestine. Such a bypass can occur when a fistula connects one part of the bowel to another part that is further down the intestinal tract. The fistula thereby creates a new route for the intestinal contents. This new route bypasses the segment of intestine between the fistula's upper and lower connections to the intestine. Sometimes, fistulas can open and close sporadically and unevenly. Thus, for example, the outside of a fistula might heal before the inside of the fistula. Should this occur, the bowel contents can accumulate in the fistulous tract and result in a pocket of infection and pus (""'abscess''). An abscess may be quite painful and can be dangerous, especially if the infection spreads to the bloodstream.''Fistulas sometimes are difficult to detect. Although the outside opening of a fistula may be simple to see, the inside opening that is connected to the bowel may not be easy to locate. The reason for this difficulty is that fistulas from the bowel can have long, winding tunnels that finally lead to the skin or an internal organ. Endoscopy might detect the internal opening of a fistula, but it can easily be missed. Sometimes, a small bowel barium X-ray will locate a fistula. Often, however, an exam under general anesthesia may be required to fully examine areas that have fistulas, especially around the anus and vagina.''Intestinal fistulas that do not cause symptoms often require no treatment. Fistulas that cause significant symptoms, however, usually require treatment, although they are frequently difficult to heal.''Fistulas located around the anus (perianal) sometimes can be improved by treatment with the antibiotics, ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl'') or ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'""). In response to the antibiotics, some of these fistulas even close completely. Also, treatment with the immunosuppressive medications, azathioprine or 6MP, improves fistulas located around the anus (perianal) in almost two thirds of patients, including complete healing in one third. More recently, the new drug infliximab (Remicade), which is an antibody to one of the body's inflammation-inducing chemicals, has been shown to produce very similar results. Remember, however, that infliximab might worsen strictures, which, as mentioned, can sometimes be associated with fistulas.""'When medications for the treatment of fistulas are discontinued, they usually re-open within 6 months to a year. Steroids do not heal fistulas and should not be used for this purpose. Other medications that suppress the immune system, such as cyclosporine or ''tacrolimus'' (FK506 or ''Prograf''), are currently being studied for the treatment of fistulas. Sometimes, resting the bowel by feeding the patient solely with total parenteral (intravenous) ''nutrition'' (TPN), and thus nothing by mouth, is required to treat fistulas. Even if these fistulas heal in response to the TPN, they commonly recur when eating is resumed.'""Fistulas sometimes require surgery. For example, when fistulas around the anus become very severe, they can interfere with the patient's ability to control bowel movements (continence). In this situation, the surgeon might make an opening (ostomy) to the skin from the bowel above the fistulas. The intestinal contents are thereby diverted away from the fistulas. Occasionally, when absolutely necessary, intestinal fistulas are surgically removed, usually along with the involved segment of the bowel. Fistulas from the intestine to the bladder or vagina are frequently very difficult to close with medical treatment alone and often require surgery."" "
What are fissures and how are they treated?,"""Fissures are tears in the lining of the anus. They may be superficial or deep. Fissures are especially common in Crohn's disease. They differ from fistulas in that fissures are confined to the anus and do not connect to other parts of the bowel, other internal organs, or the skin. Still, fissures can cause mild to severe ""'rectal pain'' and bleeding, especially with bowel movements. The most common treatment for anal fissures is periodic sitz baths or topical creams that relax the muscle (sphincter) around the anus. Injections of tiny amounts of botulinum toxin into the muscles around the anus have been reported to be helpful in relaxing the sphincter, thereby allowing the fissures to heal. The benefit of this type of therapy, however, is still controversial. Sometimes, surgery is needed to relieve the persistent pain or bleeding of an ''anal fissure'"". For example, the surgeon may cut out (excise) the fissure. Alternatively, the muscle around the anus can be cut (sphincterotomy) to relax the sphincter so that the fissure can heal. However, as is the cases with any surgery in patients with Crohn's disease, post-operative intestinal complications can occur frequently.""  "
What is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)?,"""Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can occur as a complication of Crohn's disease but not of ulcerative colitis since the small intestine is not involved in ulcerative colitis. SIBO can result when a partially obstructing small bowel stricture is present or when the natural barrier between the large and small intestines (ileocecal valve) has been surgically removed in Crohn's disease. Normally, the small bowel contains only few bacteria, while the colon has a tremendous number of resident bacteria. If a stricture is present or the ileocecal valve has been removed, bacteria from the colon gain access to the small bowel and multiply there. With SIBO, the bacteria in the small bowel begin to break down (digest) food higher up than normal in the GI tract. This ""'digestion'' produces ''gas'"" and other products that cause abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. In addition, the bacteria chemically alter the bile salts in the intestine. This alteration impairs the ability of the bile salts to transport fat. The resulting malabsorption of fat is another cause of diarrhea in Crohn's disease. (As previously mentioned, inflammation of the intestinal lining is the most common cause of diarrhea in patients with IBD.)""'SIBO can be diagnosed with a hydrogen breath test (HBT). In this test, the patient swallows a specified amount of glucose or another ''sugar'' called ''lactulose''. If bacteria have reproduced in the small bowel, the glucose or lactulose is metabolized by these bacteria, which causes the release of hydrogen in the breath. The amount of hydrogen in the breath is measured at specific time intervals after the ingestion of the ''sugar''. In a patient with SIBO, the hydrogen is eliminated into the breath sooner than the hydrogen that is produced by the normal bacteria in the colon. Accordingly, the detection of large amounts of hydrogen at an early interval in the testing indicates the possibility of SIBO. Another test, which may be more specific, uses a sugar called xylose. In this test, the swallowed xylose is tagged with a very small amount of radioactive carbon 14 (C14). The C14 is measured in the breath and interpreted by applying the same principles as used for hydrogen in the HBT.'' The best treatment for bacterial overgrowth is antibiotics for approximately 10 days using, for example, ''neomycin'', metronidazole, or ciprofloxacin. After this treatment, the breath test may be repeated to confirm that the bacterial overgrowth has been eliminated. SIBO may recur, however, if the stricture itself is not treated, or if the bacterial overgrowth is due to the surgical removal of the ileocecalvalve.' "
Does colon cancer occur in IBD?,"""The risk of developing colon cancer is 20 times higher for patients with IBD than it is for the general population. The association with colon cancer is more clearly established in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. An increased risk most likely also exists, however, for patients with Crohn's disease that affects the colon. In ulcerative colitis, the risk of acquiring colon cancer increases according to how much of the colon is involved and the duration of colitis. Thus, after about 8 to 10 years of ulcerative colitis, especially if the entire colon is involved, the risk of developing colon cancersubstantially increases. Other risk factors for colon cancer in IBD patients include a ""'liver disease'' called ''primary sclerosing cholangitis'' (''PSC''), a family history of colon cancer, and a history of ''liver'' transplantation. Additional possible risk factors include the use of concurrent immunosuppressive medications and a deficiency of the vitamin, ''folic acid''.''The way in which colon cancer develops in IBD patients is thought to be different from the way in which it develops in other people. In individuals without IBD, usually a benign (not malignant) polyp initially forms in the colon. Then, depending on the type of polyp and the genetic ''makeup'' of the patient, the polyp may eventually become cancerous. In IBD, the constant processof inflammatory injury and repair of the lining of the colon (colonic mucosa) isbelieved to make the individual more susceptible to the cancer. The idea is that the mucosal cells are dividing so rapidly that they are liable to make mistakes in their DNA (mutations). These mutated cells can then become pre-cancerous (dysplastic) cells, which later can turn into cancer.''Additionally, pre-cancerous cells in IBD develop in ways other than in a polyp. In fact, pre-cancerous cells can develop in tissue that appears completely normal or exhibits only mild irregularities. For this reason, a colon cancer may not be discovered in IBDpatients until the cancer has progressed to a later stage. In later stages, thecancer can invade tissues beyond the colon or spread (''metastasize'') to otherparts of the body.'""As already mentioned, patients with IBD, especially ulcerative colitis, have an increasedrisk of developing colon cancer. Performing a colectomy (removal of the colon)before the cancer develops in these patients is a sure way to prevent coloncancer. Actually, the concept is to remove the pre-cancerous cells (dysplasia)in the colon before they can turn into cancer. Accordingly, inspection for dysplasia and cancer by yearly colonoscopies with multiple colonic biopsies isrecommended for patients with ulcerative colitis. The monitoring is suggested to begin after thepatient has had ulcerative colitis for 8 to10 years. Many physicians recommend a similarmonitoring program for Crohn's disease patients who have inflammation of the colon (colitis),even though the association with colon cancer is less well established in Crohn's disease.Remember that ulcerative colitis involves only the colon, whereas Crohn's disease, which involves the smallbowel, colon, or both, often does not affect the colon.""'Colonoscopy clearly is the best method for monitoring colon cancer. An otherwise negative colonoscopy in ulcerative colitis, however, does not guarantee that the colon is free of cancer orpre-cancerous cells. The reason for this is that the multiple biopsies that aredone during the colonoscopy still make up only a tiny percentage of the entire lining of the colon. However, if pre-cancerous cells are found on a microscopic examination of the biopsies, a colectomy (surgical removal of the colon) may be recommended to prevent cancer from developing. One caution here is that the diagnosis of dysplasia should be made only in the absence of concurrent, active, inflammation of the colon. This is due to the fact that inflammation sometimes can mimic the microscopic appearance of dysplasia.'""In patients with Crohn's disease, there is an increased risk of developing ""'lymphoma'' oradenocarcinoma of the small intestine. Since the small intestine is not involved in ulcerative colitis, there is no increased risk of this cancer in ulcerative colitis patients. Even though there is a higher risk of these ''cancers'"" in Crohn's disease, the percentage of patients actually contracting them is very small. Still, certain conditions predispose Crohn's disease patients to an even higher cancer risk. These conditions include bypassed segments of the bowel and chronic fissures, fistulas, or strictures. Even so,routine monitoring for small bowel cancer in Crohn's disease patients by X-ray or enteroscopy is not currently recommended because these diagnostic procedures are difficult, time-consuming, and not very effective for this purpose. If however, after many years of Crohn's disease, the disease suddenly changes its course or becomes difficult to treat, the possibility of a small bowel cancer should be investigated."" "
What should be done about polyps in IBD?,"'Not all polyps that are found in IBD patients are pre-cancerous or cancerous.Some polyps form as a result of the inflammatory and healing processes. These polyps are called inflammatory polyps or pseudopolyps, and they do not turn into cancer. The only way to make sure that polyps do not have pre-cancerous or cancerous cells, however, is to remove (biopsy) and examine them under the microscope.' "
What is toxic megacolon and what are its causes and symptoms?,"'Toxic megacolon is a widened (dilated) segment of the colon in a patient withsevere inflammation of the colon (colitis). The megacolon develops when thelining of the colon is so inflamed that the colon loses its ability to contractproperly. When this happens, the propelling (peristaltic) contractions areunable to move the ''intestinal gas'' along through the colon. The colon, therefore, accumulates excessive amounts of gas. The gas then increases the pressure on thebowel wall, which causes the colon to dilate.''Patients with toxic megacolon usually are very ill, with abdominal pain, bloating (distention), and ''fever''. Thedilated colon can allow bacteria to leak through the bowel wall into the bloodstream (septicemia). With continuing dilation, the inflamed colonic wall becomesat high risk for bursting (perforating) and causing inflammation of the abdominal ''cavity'' (peritonitis). Both septicemia and peritonitis are serious infections, which, in some cases, can even lead to death.'""Toxic megacolon typically occurs when inflammation of the colon is severe. This complication, however, does not occur exclusively in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Thus, a toxic megacolon can develop in other types of colitis, such as amebiasis or bacillary dysentery (""'shigella''). Narcotics, ''codeine'', or anti-diarrheal medications such asdiphenoxylate (Lomotil) or ''loperamide'' (Imodium) can decrease the contractions ofthe colon and allow excessive gas to accumulate. These medications, therefore, predispose to the development of toxic megacolon and should be avoided during severe episodes (flares) of colitis.' "
What kind of malabsorption occurs in IBD?,"""Malabsorption means abnormal intestinal absorption. Crohn's disease usually affects the small intestine, which is the part of the gut that absorbs most nutrients.Remember that Crohn's disease involves the small bowel and/or the colon, while ulcerative colitis involves only the colon. Crohn's disease of the upper part (duodenum) and middle part (jejunum) of the small intestine may interfere with the absorption of proteins, sugars, iron,""'vitamins'', and ''fats'"". This widespread malabsorption in Crohn's disease, which does not occur in ulcerative colitis, may lead to ""'weight loss'"" and malnutrition. In addition, some unabsorbed nutrients can cause the small or large intestine to secrete increased amounts of liquid, which worsens the diarrhea in Crohn's disease. (As previously mentioned, diarrhea is the most common symptom in patients with IBD, with or without the intestinal complications.) The lower end (ileum) of the small intestine is the part of the bowel most commonly involved in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, however, the function of the ileum is normal. When the ileum is involved in patients with Crohn's disease (or surgically removed),a decreased absorption of vitamin B12 may occur. If a deficiency of B12 develops, a particular type of ""'anemia'' called ''pernicious anemia'' can result.''The ileum is also the major area for intestinal absorption of bile acids. The bile acids are compounds that are secreted in the bile by the liver into the duodenum. The major function of bile acids is to help transport and absorb fats,mostly in the jejunum. Bile acids that are not absorbed by a diseased or removed ileum pass into the colon. The bile acids then induce the colon to secrete liquid, which aggravates the diarrhea. If the bile acids are not sufficiently absorbed in the colon and consequently become deficient, fat malabsorption and more diarrhea can result.'""Extensive Crohn's disease, usually involving the surgical removal of several intestinal segments over the years, can lead to a debilitating condition known as short bowel syndrome. In this condition, the patients hav emany of the intestinal complications of Crohn's disease, including severe malabsorption. They can also suffer from the previously mentioned complications not directly affecting the intestinal tract (extraintestinal). Additionally, these patients frequently have certain other extraintestinal complications, such asosteoporosis (thin or porous bones), osteomalacia (soft bones), ""'gallstones'', and ''kidney stones''.''The treatment of malabsorption in patients with IBD includes medications to treat the underlying intestinal inflammation. Decreasing the inflammation can improve the intestinal absorption of the nutrients that were malabsorbed. The malabsorption or deficiency of B12 may need to be treated by administering the vitamin in the vein or into the muscle. Diarrhea that is induced by bile acid scan be treated with ''cholestyramine'', a compound that works by binding the bile acids.''Supplemental calories and nutrients may be administered as special liquid diets. These so-called elemental diets are composed of proteins, carbohydrates,''vitamins'', and fats that are broken down into smaller particles that are easier for the intestine to absorb. Unfortunately, however, these diets often do not smell or taste very good. Nevertheless, they can be administered through a small tube inserted through the nose (enteral feeding). For patients who are unable to tolerate any food or liquid by mouth or by enteral feeding, ''nutrition'"" may need to be given solely through the veins (total parenteral nutrition). Finally, a small bowel transplant can now be done for patients with severe Crohn's disease or otherwise unmanageable short bowel syndrome."" "
What Is Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)?,"'Inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD'') is a term that includes a group of diseases that cause chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI, digestive) tract. The two most common types of ''inflammatory bowel disease'"" are Crohn's disease (""'Crohn disease'') and ''ulcerative colitis'"" (UC). In Crohn's disease, the inflammation appears in patches anywhere in the GI tract from the mouth to the anus. In ""'ulcerative colitis'', there is chronic inflammation and sores (ulcers) that are continuous along the small intestine and colon.'  "
What Is an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diet Plan?,"'There is no special ''diet'' that is recommended for treating ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD'""), but some people with Crohn's disease or ""'ulcerative colitis'' manage symptoms with dietary changes and a low-residue or low-''fiber'' ''diet'' that includes:''People with Crohn’s disease may have difficulty tolerating dairy products because of intolerance to milk (''lactose intolerance''). They also are more prone to nutritional deficiencies because of the lack of nutrient absorption in the intestine. If you have ''IBD'', discuss any dietary changes with your doctor, registered dietitian, nutritionist, or other health care professional.' Eating smaller and more frequent meals Taking vitamins and other nutritional supplements Avoiding problem or trigger foods such as fatty and fried foods, meats, spicy foods, diary, and fiber-rich foods because they often trigger symptoms of bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain and cramping."
Foods to Avoid in an IBD Diet,"'Some people with ''inflammatory bowel'"" disease, for example, Crohn's ulcerative ""'colitis'', find that certain foods or products trigger flares, which worsens the disease. Examples of foods to avoid if you have ''IBD'' include:'  Fatty, fried foods Spicy foods Meats Creamy sauces High-fiber foods including raw fruits and vegetables Nuts, seeds, and beans Caffeinated beverages Sweets including candy, soda, and juice Alcohol"
Foods to Include in an IBD Diet,"""People with\xa0Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis'' often find it difficult to get their daily nutritional needs because of their disease. ''Vitamins'' and other nutritional ''supplements'' can help provide some of the necessary nutritional needs to people with ''IBD''.''A low-residue ''diet''\xa0can relieve flare-ups. Include foods that are soft and bland, for example:''Talk with a doctor, nutritionist, dietician, or other health care professional about your specific dietary needs if you have ''inflammatory bowel'' disease.'  Applesauce Bananas Oatmeal Lean poultry or fish, plain Eggs Mashed potatoes Canned fruit Rice Noodles White bread Diluted juices Plain cereals"
IBS vs. IBD: Are they the same bowel disease?," IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) are not the same problems with the digestive tract. IBS usually causes no ulcers or lesions in the bowel, and it involves only the colon. IBD is a term used for a group of bowel diseases that cause inflammation in the digestive tract. The most common forms of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. IBD causes ulcers in the tissue of the digestive tract that may occur almost anywhere from the mouth to the anus. (Crohn's disease can affect any portion of the GI tract, while ulcerative colitis only affects the large and small intestine, rectum, and anus). Researchers don not know the exact cause of IBS or IBD, however, they suspect multiple factors may cause IBS, and an immune system problem may cause IBD. These diseases are often confused because they have some similar symptoms (for example, persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea and/or vomiting), they sound similar, and have almost identical abbreviations. There is no cure for IBS or IBD, (Crohn's disease and UC), but IBD has more serious symptoms than IBS. For example; ulcers in the bowel, rectum, or anus; rectal bleeding, and anemia. Treatment requires medication, and some patients need surgery. IBS is treated and managed with medications and lifestyle changes like diet and stress reduction."
What is IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)?,"'IBS (''irritable bowel syndrome'') is a common disorder of the ''large intestine'' (colon) that causes symptoms of cramping, ''abdominal pain'', ''bloating'', ''gas'', ''diarrhea'', and/or ''constipation''. Researchers and doctors do not know the exact cause of IBS, but they suspect that multiple factors, for example, foods, ''stress'', hormones, or other illnesses combined with gut bacteria trigger abnormal bowel muscle contractions in the gastrointestinal (GI) nervous system.'  "
What is IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)?,"'Inflammatory bowel disease'' (IBD) is a term used to describe a group of inflammatory conditions mainly in the large and small bowels. The two most common types of IBD that occur are Crohn’s disease and ''ulcerative colitis'', or UC. Other types of IBD include ulcerative proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, left-sided ''colitis'', ''pancolitis'', and acute severe ''ulcerative colitis''.'  "
Where does the pain occur in IBS vs. IBD?,"'Abdominal pain'' in IBS may be spread over a wide area of the abdomen, but it can localize in the lower left area of it. The ''pain'' may intensify while eating meals, when ''gas'' is present in the GI tract, and from abdominal ''bloating''. A bowel movement may reduce the ''pain''.''Abdominal pain'' in IBD may occur anywhere in the abdomen, and its location may suggest the type of IBD that you may have (for example, left-sided ''abdominal pain'' is a classic symptom of ''ulcerative colitis'').' "
What are the similarities in signs and symptoms of IBS and IBD?,"'Initially, it is difficult for doctors to \xa0diagnose IBS and IBD\xa0because sometimes some of the symptoms are similar, for example:' Abdominal pain Diarrhea Abdominal cramping Nausea, and/or vomiting An urgent need for a bowel movement"
What are the differences between the signs and symptoms of IBS vs. IBD?,"'Some people with IBS have ''IBS-D'' in which ''diarrhea'' is one of the primary symptoms, or ''IBS-C'' in which ''constipation'' is one of the primary symptoms.''Symptoms unique to IBD'"" (Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis'') are more serious, and include:'   Changes in bowel movement Changes in how the stools look Abdominal bloating Whitish mucus in the stool A feeling of not having finished a bowel movement. Sexual dysfunction Fibromyalgia Urinary frequency and urgency Anemia Eye redness or pain Feeling tired Fever Joint pain or soreness Skin changes Unintended weight loss Loss of appetite Rectal bleeding"
What causes IBS vs. IBD?,"'Although some patients may show microscopic areas of inflammation in IBS, the causes are speculative and may include hyperreactivity to bacterial gut infections, accelerated or delayed transit of contents through the GI tract (''diarrhea'' or ''constipation''), and abnormal bowel contractions caused by triggers such as foods or ''stress''.''The exact cause of IBD is not known. Researchers suggest the IBD types are caused by an immune system malfunction in the bowel tissue, with a genetic predisposition to develop IBD, and the individual’s response to gut microorganisms.' "
Does stress affect IBS or IBD?, 
What are the treatments of IBS vs. IBD?,"'Treatment for IBD includes anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' like aminosalicylates and ''corticosteroids'', immune system suppressors (many types like ''azathioprine'', ''cyclosporine'', and ''methotrexate''), and antibiotics (''metronidazole'' or ''ciprofloxacin''). Some patients may require surgery (removal of the entire colon and rectum or in others, removal of damaged segments of small bowel).''Treatment for IBS is mainly ''diet'', however, several ''drugs'', for example, ''alosetron'' (''Lotronex''), ''rifaximin'' (''Xifaxan''), ''lubiprostone'' (''Amitiza'') are approved to treat IBS.''Other medications may be used to reduce symptoms of either condition, for example, ''Tylenol'', ''antiemetics'', laxatives, and ''antidepressants''.' "
How does diet effect IBS diet vs. IBD?,"'An IBD ''diet'' is designed to reduce any bowel problems aggravated by food. Recommendations include:''If you have ''irritable bowel syndrome'' or ''inflammatory bowel disease'' diet changes may be useful for patients with IBS, and especially IBD, to seek advice from a dietician.'  Limit dairy products. Eat low-fat foods. High-fiber foods may aggravate IBD. Avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeine. Eat small meals. Drink plenty of water. Consider taking a multivitamin. The diet for IBS is far simpler. Drink plenty of water. Avoid any foods that make you bloated or “gassy.” Do not over-eat fiber as this may cause gas and bloating. Probiotics may help reduce symptoms."
Is there a cure for IBS or IBD?,"'There is no cure for IBD, but treatments can reduce symptoms. There are claims that IBS can be cured with treatments. Discuss treatments with your primary care doctor and your ''gastroenterologist''.' "
What is IBS?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the presence of a cluster of symptoms and signs in adults or children that include cramping, ''abdominal pain'', increased gas, altered bowel habits, food intolerance, and bloating (distention).''Irritable bowel'' syndrome is a ""functional"" disorder. This term refers to the changes in the functioning of the ''digestive system'' that results in the collection of symptoms referred to as IBS, meaning that it is a problem with the movement (motility) rather than any damage to the tissues of the digestive system.''In the past, ''irritable bowel'' syndrome was also called spastic colon or bowel, functional bowel disease, mucous ''colitis'', or nervous colon.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of IBS?,"'Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized mostly by abdominal ''pain'' and cramping. Other symptoms and signs include:''While not technically a symptom, nearly 70% of people with IBS also experience ''indigestion''.''Symptoms are often relieved by bowel movements. Women with IBS may have more symptoms during their menstrual periods.'   Diarrhea: IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) can come with sudden urges to have bowel movements and loose stools. Constipation: IBS with constipation (IBS-C) can be accompanied by straining during bowel movements and infrequent stools. Increased gas Abdominal swelling or bloating Abdominal pain or discomfort Cramping pain after eating certain foods Nausea Mucousy or foamy stool Unexplained weight loss Loss of appetite"
What causes IBS?,"'The exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome is unknown. It is believed to be due to a number of factors, including alteration in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract motility, abnormal nervous system signals, increased sensitivity to pain, and food intolerances. The following are risk factors thought to cause IBS:' Abnormal movements of the colon and small intestines (too fast or slow, or too strong) Hypersensitivity to pain from a full bowel or gas Food sensitivities, possibly caused by poor absorption of sugars or acids in food Gastroenteritis (""stomach flu"" or ""stomach bug""), a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and intestines, may trigger IBS symptoms Psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression are observed in many people with IBS, though these conditions have not been found to be a direct cause of IBS. Reproductive hormones or neurotransmitters may be off-balance in people with IBS. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) Genetics is thought to be a possible cause of IBS, but so far, this hereditary link has not been proven."
Is there an IBS diet? What foods trigger IBS?,"'What you eat and how you eat can affect symptom of this condition. While it may not be possible to completely prevent IBS symptoms, you may find that certain foods trigger IBS symptoms. To help figure out which foods cause you symptoms, a doctor may suggest keeping a food diary.''Some foods can help in the ''prevention'' of symptoms.'   Dietary fiber supplements Water Low-fat foods High-carbohydrate foods (such as whole wheat pasta, brown rice, and whole grain breads) Probiotics (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus a and Bifidobacterium) and prebiotics Some people report kefir or Aloe Vera juice helps symptoms. Talk to a doctor about these home remedies. A high-fiber diet may help relieve constipation in some cases of IBS, but it may also worsen some symptoms such as bloating and gas. The current recommended daily fiber intake is 20-35 grams daily. Most people fall short of this daily fiber intake and can benefit from a small increase in fiber, but it is best to increase the amount in your diet slowly to reduce gas. Dairy products, including milk and cheese (Lactose intolerance symptoms can be similar to IBS symptoms.) Certain vegetables that increase gas (such as cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts) and legumes (such as beans) Fatty or fried foods Alcohol, caffeine, or soda Foods high in sugars Artificial sweeteners Chewing gum Nuts"
What is a low FODMAP diet?,"'A ''low FODMAP diet'' may also help relieve ''symptoms of IBS''. ''FODMAP'' refers to a group of short-chain carbohydrates (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) that are not well absorbed in the small intestine and are rapidly fermented by bacteria in the gut. These bacteria produce gas, which can contribute to IBS symptoms.''The lists of foods both high and low in ''FODMAPs'' are extensive. The International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, Inc. (IFFGD) has suggestions of foods to eat and foods to avoid if you follow the FODMAP diet for IBS. Talk to your doctor for more information.' "
What are IBS-D (IBS with diarrhea) and IBS-C (IBS with constipation)?, IBS-D stands for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. The most common symptoms of IBS-D include:Frequent stoolsFeeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movementsNausea.People with IBS-D also may experience signs and symptoms of:GasAbdominal pain or discomfortSudden urges to have a bowel movementLoose stools Frequent stools Feeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movements Nausea. People with IBS-D also may experience signs and symptoms of:GasAbdominal pain or discomfortSudden urges to have a bowel movementLoose stools Gas Abdominal pain or discomfort Sudden urges to have a bowel movement Loose stools IBS-C stands for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. The most common symptoms of IBS-C include:Infrequent stoolsStraining during bowel movementsFeeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movementsFeeling as if you need to have a bowel movement but are unableAbdominal painBloatingGas Infrequent stools Straining during bowel movements Feeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movements Feeling as if you need to have a bowel movement but are unable Abdominal pain Bloating Gas
IBS vs. IBD are the same bowel disease?,"'While both irritable bowel syndrome and ''inflammatory bowel disease'' can have similar symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and urgent bowel movements; however, IBS is not the same as ''IBD''.' IBD is a group of separate diseases that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and is a more severe condition. Irritable bowel syndrome is considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder because there is abnormal bowel function. IBS is a group of symptoms and not a disease in itself, which is why it’s called a ‘syndrome,’ and it is considered less serious than IBD. Irritable bowel syndrome does not cause inflammation like inflammatory bowel disease, and it does not result in permanent damage to the intestines, intestinal bleeding, rectal bleeding, ulcers, or the harmful complications that are often seen with IBD."
IBS vs. SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)? Are they the same disease?,"'Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is considered one of the factors that may produce signs and ''symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome'' (IBS). The medical data from studies done on SIBO are conflicting.''Some studies show an increase in gas production by intestinal bacteria as a cause of the pain and bloating associated with IBS. However, other studies done to determine if SIBO is the cause of IBS and if antibiotic treatment of SIBO is helpful in reducing or eliminating IBS symptoms have not been conclusive.' "
How is IBS diagnosed?,"'Irritable bowel syndrome is diagnosed by excluding other GI disorders that can cause similar symptoms. A complete history and physical is taken to determine the duration and frequency of symptoms. To be diagnosed with the condition, the duration of symptoms should be at least six months and should occur at least three times a month.''A doctor may order tests, including blood tests, ''stool'' tests, ''X-rays'', or ''CT scans''. There is no specific finding on these tests that can confirm the diagnosis of IBS, however, other problems can be ruled out by performing them.''Two relatively new blood tests may help diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. One test is for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), and the other is for irritable bowel syndrome with both diarrhea and constipation (irritable bowel syndrome mixed IBS-M). Neither test is able to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).''Both blood tests are for anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies. It is thought that these antibodies develop in some patients after an acute bout of gastroenteritis that is caused by several different, common types of bacteria. The overgrowth of these bacteria in the gut may trigger an immune attack on the patients’ own intestinal tissues (autoimmunity) with the ensuing inflammation and damage to the tissues causing the symptoms of IBS.''The tests may help distinguish between irritable bowel syndrome and ''inflammatory bowel disease'"" or IBD, a different type of intestinal inflammatory disease that includes Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''.''The antibody tests seems to be useful in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea IBS-D, but not IBS with constipation (IBS-C). The tests also appear to be specific, and if the antibodies are present, it is highly likely that IBS is present. However, the tests are insensitive, meaning if the antibodies are not present, the patient still may have IBS. Thus, these irritable bowel syndrome tests may be identifying only a subset of patients with IBS, those with post-infectious IBS. Both IBS blood tests have not undergone rigorous testing, and have not yet been approved by the FDA. It is expected to be an expensive test costing $500 to over $1,000.''A doctor also may send the patient to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the digestive system). Depending on the symptoms, an ''upper endoscopy'' and/or ''colonoscopy'' may be performed.'  "
What is the treatment for IBS?,"'Dietary modifications are the first treatments that should be tried to treat IBS. There are several types of foods in particular that often trigger characteristic symptoms and signs.''If dietary modifications and lifestyle changes do not adequately treat the symptoms and signs, a doctor may recommend medical therapies.'  "
What medications are used in the treat and manage IBS-D and IBS-D?,"   Antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide (Imodium), attapulgite (Kaopectate), and diphenoxylate and atropine (Lomotil) can be helpful if loose stools are one of the main signs. Eluxadoline (Viberzi) is a prescription for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). For females with IBS who experience severe diarrhea, alosetron (Lotronex) has been used. Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and IBS-related bloating. Bile acid binders including cholestyramine ( (Prevalite), colestipol (Colestid), or colesevelam (Welchol) can help some patients with IBS-D, but can also cause bloating. Over-the-counter laxatives such as polyethylene glycol 3350 ( (MiraLax), bisacodyl (Dulcolax), and psyllium seed husks (Metamucil) can help relieve constipation and keep bowel movements regular. Senna laxatives (Senokot, Ex-Lax Gentle Nature) may be taken short-term. Prescription laxatives such as lactulose (Constulose) may also be prescribed. Two drugs specifically used to treat IBS are lubiprostone (Amitiza), a laxative, and linaclotide (Linzess), a constipation medication. SSRI antidepressants fluoxetine (Prozac), citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), and escitalopram (Lexapro) may be helpful for those with constipation (IBS-C), but they can trigger IBS attacks in patients with diarrhea (IBS-D)."
What other drugs are used in the treatment of IBS symptoms and signs?," Antidepressants in low doses, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help relieve symptoms associated with IBS. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) and magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia). Antibiotics may be used when small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is suspected. Antianxiety medications such as diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and clonazepam (Klonopin) are occasionally prescribed short-term for people whose anxiety worsens their irritable bowel syndrome symptoms."
What medications treat IBS pain and cramping?," Antispasmodics, such as metoclopramide (Reglan), dicyclomine (Bentyl), and hyoscyamine (Levsin), decrease symptoms of pain and cramping. Antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil, Paregoric), doxepin ( (Silenor), desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Pamelor), and imipramine (Tofranil) may help with abdominal pain but due to side effects are usually reserved for severe cases."
What natural and home remedies or other lifestyle changes help IBS symptoms?,"'Some lifestyle changes that can also help relieve symptoms are:' Eat smaller, more frequent meals Quit smoking Exercise regularly Take probiotics Avoid caffeine Use stress management and relaxation techniques Mindfulness training Gut-directed hypnosis Biofeedback Pain-management techniques Cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy Regular exercise such as walking or yoga Get an adequate amount of sleep Try ginger or peppermint, which may help digestion Avoid laxatives unless prescribed by your health-care professional"
What are the complications of IBS?,"'In general, there are few complications associated with this functional disease other than the symptoms of the disease itself. If someone has ''hemorrhoids'', the diarrhea and constipation associated with IBS may irritate them. Moreover, a diet that is too strict limits nutrients that could cause problems related to lack of proper ''nutrition''.''The biggest complication of IBS may be on the quality of life. The ''stress'' and ''anxiety'' as well as the impact on daily activities the condition can cause may be troublesome for patients.''Irritable bowel syndrome does not lead to;' colon cancer, rectal bleeding, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis or UC."
Is there a cure for IBS?,"'There is no known cure for IBS, but there are many treatment options to reduce or eliminate symptoms. Good communication with a doctor is important to help manage this condition.' "
What is the prognosis for IBS? ,"""Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic disease with symptoms that tend to come and go. The overall prognosis for patients with IBS depends on the severity and frequency of symptoms, and the patient's ability to control these symptoms, whether by diet, lifestyle changes, or medications."" "
Can IBS be prevented?,"'It may not be possible to prevent developing IBS, but you can take steps to prevent symptoms for occurring or worsening. As discussed earlier, dietary and lifestyle changes can help you manage symptoms. To identify food triggers, your doctor may suggest that you keep a food diary and avoid foods that cause symptoms. Manage ''stress'' and ''anxiety'', and try cognitive therapy or psychotherapy if needed.' "
Which types of doctors treat IBS?,"""A primary-care provider or family-medicine specialist or a child's pediatrician may first diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. You will likely be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in disorders of the digestive system) for further treatment."" "
What is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, meaning it is a problem caused by changes in how the GI tract works. Children with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, but the GI tract does not become damaged. IBS is not a disease; it is a group of symptoms that occur together. The most common symptoms of IBS are ''abdominal pain'' or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'', or both. In the past, IBS was called ''colitis'', mucous colitis, ''spastic colon'"", nervous colon, and spastic bowel. The name was changed to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and is not a product of a person's imagination.""'IBS is diagnosed when a child who is growing as expected has ''abdominal pain'' or discomfort once per week for at least 2 months without other disease or injury that could explain the ''pain''. The ''pain'' or discomfort of IBS may occur with a change in ''stool'' frequency or consistency or may be relieved by a bowel movement.' "
What is the GI tract?,"'The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the ''digestion'' of food. Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, ''esophagus'', stomach, small intestine, ''large intestine'' - which includes the ''appendix'', cecum, colon, and - rectum - and anus. The ''intestines'' are sometimes called the bowel. The last part of the GI tract - called the ''lower GI'' tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.''The large intestine absorbs water and any remaining nutrients from partially digested food passed from the small intestine. The large intestine then changes waste from liquid to a solid matter called stool. Stool passes from the colon to the rectum. The rectum is located between the last part of the colon - called the sigmoid colon - and the anus. The rectum stores stool prior to a bowel movement. During a bowel movement, stool moves from the rectum to the anus, the opening through which stool leaves the body.' "
How common is IBS in children?,"'Limited information is available about the number of children with IBS. Older studies have reported prevalence rates for recurrent ''abdominal pain in children'' of 10 to 20 percent.¹ However, these studies did not differentiate IBS from functional abdominal pain, ''indigestion'', and abdominal ''migraine''. One study of children in North America found that 14 percent of high school students and 6 percent of middle school students have IBS. The study also found that IBS affects boys and girls equally.²' "
What are the symptoms of IBS in children?,"'The symptoms of IBS include abdominal pain or discomfort and changes in bowel habits. To meet the definition of IBS, the pain or discomfort should be associated with two of the following three symptoms:''Other symptoms of IBS may include:''Symptoms may often occur after eating a meal. To meet the definition of IBS, symptoms must occur at least once per week for at least 2 months.'   
	Start with bowel movements that occur more or less often than usual 
	Start with stool that appears looser and more watery or harder and more lumpy than usual 
	Improve with a bowel movement 
Diarrhea - having loose, watery stools three or more times a day and feeling urgency to have a bowel movement 
Constipation - having hard, dry stools; two or fewer bowel movements in a week; or straining to have a bowel movement 
	Feeling that a bowel movement is incomplete Passing mucus, a clear liquid made by the intestines that coats and protects tissues in the GI tract 
	Abdominal bloating"
What causes IBS in children?,"'The causes of IBS are not well understood. Researchers believe a combination of physical and mental health problems can lead to IBS. The possible causes of IBS in children include the following:'  Brain-gut signal problems. Signals between the brain and nerves of the small and large intestines, also called the gut, control how the intestines work. Problems with brain-gut signals may cause IBS symptoms, such as changes in bowel habits and pain or discomfort. GI motor problems. Normal motility, or movement, may not be present in the colon of a child who has IBS. Slow motility can lead to constipation and fast motility can lead to diarrhea. Spasms, or sudden strong muscle contractions that come and go, can cause abdominal pain. Some children with IBS also experience hyperreactivity, which is an excessive increase in contractions of the bowel in response to stress or eating. Hypersensitivity. Children with IBS have greater sensitivity to abdominal pain than children without IBS. Affected children have been found to have different rectal tone and rectal motor response after eating a meal. Mental health problems. IBS has been linked to mental health, or psychological, problems such as anxiety and depression in children. Bacterial gastroenteritis. Some children who have bacterial gastroenteritis - an infection or irritation of the stomach and intestines caused by bacteria - develop IBS. Research has shown a connection between gastroenteritis and IBS in adults but not in children. But researchers believe postinfectious IBS does occur in children. Researchers do not know why gastroenteritis leads to IBS in some people and not others. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine. SIBO is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. Some researchers believe that SIBO may lead to IBS, and some studies have shown antibiotics to be effective in treating IBS. However, the studies were weak and more research is needed to show a link between SIBO and IBS. Genetics. Whether IBS has a genetic cause, meaning it runs in families, is unclear. Studies have shown that IBS is more common in people with family members who have a history of GI problems. However, the cause could be environmental or the result of heightened awareness of GI symptoms."
How is IBS in children diagnosed?,"""To diagnose IBS, a health care provider will conduct a physical exam and take a complete medical history. The medical history will include questions about the child's symptoms, family members with GI disorders, recent infections, medications, and stressful events related to the onset of symptoms. IBS is diagnosed when the physical exam does not show any cause for the child's symptoms and the child meets all of the following criteria:""'Further testing is not usually needed, though the health care provider may do a blood test to screen for other problems. Additional diagnostic tests may be needed based on the results of the screening blood test and for children who also have signs such as:''Further diagnostic tests may also be needed for children with a family history of:''Additional diagnostic tests may include a stool test, ultrasound, and flexible ''sigmoidoscopy'' or colonoscopy.''Stool tests.'"" A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the child's caretaker a container for catching and storing the child's stool. The sample is returned to the health care provider or a commercial facility and sent to a lab for analysis. The health care provider may also do a rectal exam, sometimes during the physical exam, to check for ""'blood in the stool''. Stool tests can show the presence of parasites or blood.''Ultrasound.'"" Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider's office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist - a doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show problems in the GI tract causing pain or other symptoms.""'Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. ''The tests are similar, but a colonoscopy is used to view the rectum and entire colon, while a flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the rectum and lower colon. These tests are performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a ''gastroenterologist'' - a doctor who specializes in ''digestive diseases''. For both tests, a health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. The child may be asked to follow a clear ''liquid diet'' for 1 to 3 days before either test. The night before the test, the child may need to take a ''laxative''. One or more enemas may also be required the night before and about 2 hours before the test.''In most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps the child relax. For either test, the child will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The test can show signs of problems in the lower GI tract.''The gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of intestinal lining for examination with a microscope. The child will not feel the biopsy. A pathologist - a doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases - examines the tissue in a lab.''Cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after the test. Full recovery is expected by the next day.'

How is IBS in children treated?,"'Though there is no cure for IBS, the symptoms can be treated with a combination of the following:'  
	Changes in eating, diet, and nutrition 
	Medications 
Probiotics Therapies for mental health problems"
"Eating, diet, and nutrition","'Large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often, or eating smaller portions, may help IBS symptoms. Eating meals that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables may help.''Certain foods and ''drinks'' may cause IBS symptoms in some children, such as:''Children with IBS may want to limit or avoid these foods. Keeping a food diary is a good way to track which foods cause symptoms so they can be excluded from or reduced in the diet.''Dietary ''fiber'' may lessen constipation in children with IBS, but it may not help with lowering pain. Fiber helps keep stool soft so it moves smoothly through the colon. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends children consume ""age plus 5"" grams of fiber daily. A 7-year-old child, for example, should get ""7 plus 5,"" or 12 grams, of fiber a day.³ Fiber may cause gas and trigger symptoms in some children with IBS. Increasing fiber intake by 2 to 3 grams per day may help reduce the risk of increased gas and bloating.'  
	Foods high in fat Milk products Drinks with caffeine 
	Drinks with large amounts of artificial sweeteners, which are substances used in place of sugar 
	Foods that may cause gas, such as beans and cabbage"
Medications,"""The health care provider will select medications based on the child's symptoms. Caregivers should not give children any medications unless told to do so by a health care provider."" Fiber supplements. Fiber supplements may be recommended to relieve constipation when increasing dietary fiber is ineffective. Laxatives. Constipation can be treated with laxative medications. Laxatives work in different ways, and a health care provider can provide information about which type is best. Caregivers should not give children laxatives unless told to do so by a health care provider. Antidiarrheals. Loperamide has been found to reduce diarrhea in children with IBS, though it does not reduce pain, bloating, or other symptoms. Loperamide reduces stool frequency and improves stool consistency by slowing the movement of stool through the colon. Medications to treat diarrhea in adults can be dangerous for infants and children and should only be given if told to do so by a health care provider. Antispasmodics. Antispasmodics, such as hyoscine, cimetropium, and pinaverium, help to control colon muscle spasms and reduce abdominal pain. Antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in low doses can help relieve IBS symptoms including abdominal pain. These medications are thought to reduce the perception of pain, improve mood and sleep patterns, and adjust the activity of the GI tract."
Probiotics,"'Probiotics are live microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the GI tract. Studies have found that probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain ''probiotic'' combinations, improve symptoms of IBS when taken in large enough amounts. But more research is needed. Probiotics can be found in ''dietary supplements'', such as capsules, tablets, and powders, and in some foods, such as yogurt. A health care provider can give information about the right kind and right amount of probiotics to take to improve IBS symptoms.' "
Therapies for Mental Health Problems,"'The following therapies can help improve IBS symptoms due to mental health problems:'  Talk therapy. Talking with a therapist may reduce stress and improve IBS symptoms. Two types of talk therapy used to treat IBS are cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic, or interpersonal, therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the child's thoughts and actions. Psychodynamic therapy focuses on how emotions affect IBS symptoms. This type of therapy often involves relaxation and stress management techniques. Hypnotherapy. In hypnotherapy, the therapist uses hypnosis to help the child relax into a trancelike state. This type of therapy may help the child relax the muscles in the colon."
IBS vs. IBD: Are they the same bowel disease?," IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) are not the same problems with the digestive tract. IBS usually causes no ulcers or lesions in the bowel, and it involves only the colon. IBD is a term used for a group of bowel diseases that cause inflammation in the digestive tract. The most common forms of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. IBD causes ulcers in the tissue of the digestive tract that may occur almost anywhere from the mouth to the anus. (Crohn's disease can affect any portion of the GI tract, while ulcerative colitis only affects the large and small intestine, rectum, and anus). Researchers don not know the exact cause of IBS or IBD, however, they suspect multiple factors may cause IBS, and an immune system problem may cause IBD. These diseases are often confused because they have some similar symptoms (for example, persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea and/or vomiting), they sound similar, and have almost identical abbreviations. There is no cure for IBS or IBD, (Crohn's disease and UC), but IBD has more serious symptoms than IBS. For example; ulcers in the bowel, rectum, or anus; rectal bleeding, and anemia. Treatment requires medication, and some patients need surgery. IBS is treated and managed with medications and lifestyle changes like diet and stress reduction."
What is IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)?,"'IBS (''irritable bowel syndrome'') is a common disorder of the ''large intestine'' (colon) that causes symptoms of cramping, ''abdominal pain'', ''bloating'', ''gas'', ''diarrhea'', and/or ''constipation''. Researchers and doctors do not know the exact cause of IBS, but they suspect that multiple factors, for example, foods, ''stress'', hormones, or other illnesses combined with gut bacteria trigger abnormal bowel muscle contractions in the gastrointestinal (GI) nervous system.'  "
What is IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)?,"'Inflammatory bowel disease'' (IBD) is a term used to describe a group of inflammatory conditions mainly in the large and small bowels. The two most common types of IBD that occur are Crohn’s disease and ''ulcerative colitis'', or UC. Other types of IBD include ulcerative proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, left-sided ''colitis'', ''pancolitis'', and acute severe ''ulcerative colitis''.'  "
Where does the pain occur in IBS vs. IBD?,"'Abdominal pain'' in IBS may be spread over a wide area of the abdomen, but it can localize in the lower left area of it. The ''pain'' may intensify while eating meals, when ''gas'' is present in the GI tract, and from abdominal ''bloating''. A bowel movement may reduce the ''pain''.''Abdominal pain'' in IBD may occur anywhere in the abdomen, and its location may suggest the type of IBD that you may have (for example, left-sided ''abdominal pain'' is a classic symptom of ''ulcerative colitis'').' "
What are the similarities in signs and symptoms of IBS and IBD?,"'Initially, it is difficult for doctors to \xa0diagnose IBS and IBD\xa0because sometimes some of the symptoms are similar, for example:' Abdominal pain Diarrhea Abdominal cramping Nausea, and/or vomiting An urgent need for a bowel movement"
What are the differences between the signs and symptoms of IBS vs. IBD?,"'Some people with IBS have ''IBS-D'' in which ''diarrhea'' is one of the primary symptoms, or ''IBS-C'' in which ''constipation'' is one of the primary symptoms.''Symptoms unique to IBD'"" (Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis'') are more serious, and include:'   Changes in bowel movement Changes in how the stools look Abdominal bloating Whitish mucus in the stool A feeling of not having finished a bowel movement. Sexual dysfunction Fibromyalgia Urinary frequency and urgency Anemia Eye redness or pain Feeling tired Fever Joint pain or soreness Skin changes Unintended weight loss Loss of appetite Rectal bleeding"
What causes IBS vs. IBD?,"'Although some patients may show microscopic areas of inflammation in IBS, the causes are speculative and may include hyperreactivity to bacterial gut infections, accelerated or delayed transit of contents through the GI tract (''diarrhea'' or ''constipation''), and abnormal bowel contractions caused by triggers such as foods or ''stress''.''The exact cause of IBD is not known. Researchers suggest the IBD types are caused by an immune system malfunction in the bowel tissue, with a genetic predisposition to develop IBD, and the individual’s response to gut microorganisms.' "
Does stress affect IBS or IBD?, 
What are the treatments of IBS vs. IBD?,"'Treatment for IBD includes anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' like aminosalicylates and ''corticosteroids'', immune system suppressors (many types like ''azathioprine'', ''cyclosporine'', and ''methotrexate''), and antibiotics (''metronidazole'' or ''ciprofloxacin''). Some patients may require surgery (removal of the entire colon and rectum or in others, removal of damaged segments of small bowel).''Treatment for IBS is mainly ''diet'', however, several ''drugs'', for example, ''alosetron'' (''Lotronex''), ''rifaximin'' (''Xifaxan''), ''lubiprostone'' (''Amitiza'') are approved to treat IBS.''Other medications may be used to reduce symptoms of either condition, for example, ''Tylenol'', ''antiemetics'', laxatives, and ''antidepressants''.' "
How does diet effect IBS diet vs. IBD?,"'An IBD ''diet'' is designed to reduce any bowel problems aggravated by food. Recommendations include:''If you have ''irritable bowel syndrome'' or ''inflammatory bowel disease'' diet changes may be useful for patients with IBS, and especially IBD, to seek advice from a dietician.'  Limit dairy products. Eat low-fat foods. High-fiber foods may aggravate IBD. Avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeine. Eat small meals. Drink plenty of water. Consider taking a multivitamin. The diet for IBS is far simpler. Drink plenty of water. Avoid any foods that make you bloated or “gassy.” Do not over-eat fiber as this may cause gas and bloating. Probiotics may help reduce symptoms."
Is there a cure for IBS or IBD?,"'There is no cure for IBD, but treatments can reduce symptoms. There are claims that IBS can be cured with treatments. Discuss treatments with your primary care doctor and your ''gastroenterologist''.' "
Facts and definition of IBS-D,"   Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder. Symptoms of IBS include:Abdominal cramping or painBloatingGassinessAltered bowel habits (alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation). Abdominal cramping or pain Bloating Gassiness Altered bowel habits (alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation). The cause of IBS currently is unknown. It is thought to result from a combination of abnormal gastrointestinal (GI) tract movements, increased awareness of bodily functions, and a disruption in the communication between the brain and the GI tract. IBS-D is irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. The most common symptoms of the disorder include:Sudden urges to have bowel movementsAbdominal pain or discomfortGasLoose stoolsFrequent stoolsFeeling of being unable to completely empty bowelsNausea Sudden urges to have bowel movements Abdominal pain or discomfort Gas Loose stools Frequent stools Feeling of being unable to completely empty bowels Nausea IBS is diagnosed by exclusion, which means a doctor considers other alternatives first, performing tests to rule out other medical problems. There are new blood tests that may help diagnose some forms of IBS.Home remedies for include avoiding certain foods that ""trigger"" or worsen diarrhea, bloating, and gas, such as foods high in FODMAPs, such as:Cruciferous vegetables (for example, cauliflower, wasabi, kale, and broccoli)Legumes (for example, black beans, edamame, soy nuts, and fava beans)Dairy productsWheats and grains Home remedies for include avoiding certain foods that ""trigger"" or worsen diarrhea, bloating, and gas, such as foods high in FODMAPs, such as: Cruciferous vegetables (for example, cauliflower, wasabi, kale, and broccoli) Legumes (for example, black beans, edamame, soy nuts, and fava beans) Dairy products Wheats and grains Other home remedies to relieve symptoms of the condition include adding fiber to the diet, drinking plenty of water, avoiding soda, eating smaller meals, and eating more low fat and high carbohydrate foods. There is currently no known cure for IBS. Medical treatment for irritable bowel syndrome includes antispasmodic medicines, antidiarrheal medicines, antidepressants, laxatives, and other drugs. It is a chronic (long-term) disease, and symptoms usually recur. It also has been called spastic colon, functional bowel disease, and mucous colitis, although IBS is not a true ""colitis."" The term colitis refers to a different group of diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, microscopic colitis, and ischemic colitis."
What are the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome including IBS-D?,"'IBS'' affects each person differently. Some people have severe symptoms while others may be able to manage symptoms with only ''diet'' and lifestyle modification. The hallmark of IBS in adults and children is abdominal discomfort or ''pain''. The following signs and symptoms also are common:''Though not a symptom of the condition, ''indigestion'' affects up to 70% of people with IBS.''The following are NOT signs and symptoms or characteristics of IBS (but should still be brought to the attention of a health-care professional since they may be signs and symptoms of other conditions):'   Abdominal cramping and pain that is relieved with bowel movements Alternating periods of diarrhea and constipationThose who mostly have diarrhea as a symptom are considered to have IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), characterized by sudden urges to have bowel movements, along with loose stools, frequent stools, abdominal pain and discomfort, gas, and the feeling of being unable to completely empty the bowels. In severe cases of IBS-D, patients may lose control of their bowels.Those who mostly have constipation as a symptom are considered to have IBS with constipation (IBS-C), characterized by the passage of hard, lumpy stools, straining during bowel movements, and infrequent stools Those who mostly have diarrhea as a symptom are considered to have IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), characterized by sudden urges to have bowel movements, along with loose stools, frequent stools, abdominal pain and discomfort, gas, and the feeling of being unable to completely empty the bowels. In severe cases of IBS-D, patients may lose control of their bowels. Those who mostly have constipation as a symptom are considered to have IBS with constipation (IBS-C), characterized by the passage of hard, lumpy stools, straining during bowel movements, and infrequent stools Change in the stool frequency or consistency Gassiness (flatulence) Passing mucus from the rectum Bloating Abdominal distension Loss of appetite Blood in stools or urine Black or tarry stools Vomiting (rare, though may occasionally accompany nausea) Pain or diarrhea that interrupts sleep Fever Weight loss"
What are the risk factors for IBS-D?,"'Risk factors for IBS include:''Anxiety'' or ''depression'' may accompany the syndrome, though these have not been found to be a direct cause of it.' Abnormal (too fast or slow, or too strong) movements of the colon and small intestines Hypersensitivity to pain caused by gas or full bowels A viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and intestines (gastroenteritis) Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) Reproductive hormones or neurotransmitters may be off-balance in people with IBS."
What causes IBS-D?," IBS is not contagious, inherited, or cancerous. It occurs more often in women than in men, and the onset occurs before the age of 35 in about half of the cases. IBS occurs in 5% to 20% of children. IBS also has developed after episodes of gastroenteritis (""stomach flu""). It has been suggested that the condition is caused by dietary allergies or food sensitivities, but this has not been proven. Genetics also is suggested as a potential cause of IBS, but so far a hereditary link has not been found. Symptoms of the syndrome may worsen during periods of stress or during menstruation, but these factors are unlikely to be the cause that leads to the development of IBS."
When should you seek medical care if you think you have IBS-D?,"'If a person has any of the ''symptoms of IBS'' as discussed previously, or if a person with known IBS has unusual symptoms, a health-care professional should be consulted. Go to a hospital emergency department if problems are severe and/or come on suddenly.' "
Is there a test to diagnose IBS-D?,"'IBS can be difficult to diagnosis. It is called a diagnosis of exclusion, which means a doctor considers many other alternatives first, performing tests to rule out other medical problems. Some of these tests may include laboratory studies, imaging studies (such as a ''CT scan'' or small intestinal ''X-rays''), and ''endoscopy'' and/or ''colonoscopy''). An ''endoscopy'' is a procedure in which a flexible tube with a tiny camera at one end is passed into the GI tract while the patient is under conscious sedation. A combination of history, physical examination, and selected tests are used to help diagnose ''irritable bowel'' syndrome.''There are two relatively new blood tests that may help diagnose ''irritable bowel'' syndrome with diarrhea (''IBS-D'') and ''irritable bowel'' syndrome with diarrhea and ''constipation'' (''irritable bowel'' syndrome mixed IBS-M). These tests are for anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies that are thought to develop in some patients after an acute bout of stomach ''flu'' (gastroenteritis) caused by several different, common types of bacterium. The overgrowth of these bacteria in the gut may trigger an immune attack on an individual’s own intestinal tissues (autoimmunity) with the ensuing inflammation and damage to the tissues, which cause signs and symptoms of IBS.''The IBS tests may help distinguish between ''irritable bowel syndrome'' and a different type of bowel inflammatory disease, which includes ''ulcerative colitis'' and Crohn’s disease, called ''inflammatory bowel disease'' or ''IBD''. ''Irritable bowel syndrome'' and ''inflammatory bowel disease'' are two very different types of problems with the bowel and are not the same disease.''Both tests appear to be useful in the diagnosing patients with ''irritable bowel'' syndrome with diarrhea IBS-D, but not IBS with ''constipation'' (IBS-C). The tests also appear to be specific, and if the antibodies are present, it is highly likely that the patient has IBS-D or IBS-M. But the tests are insensitive, meaning if the antibodies are not present, the patient still may have IBS. Thus, the tests may be identifying only a subset of patients with IBS, those with post-infectious IBS. The tests have not undergone rigorous testing and have not yet been approved by the FDA. Both tests are expected to be expensive test, costing around $500 to over $1,000.' "
What medications treat  IBS-D?,"'Antispasmodic medicines, such as ''dicyclomine'' (Bemote, ''Bentyl'', Di-Spaz) and ''hyoscyamine'' (''Levsin'', Levbid, ''NuLev''), are sometimes used to treat ''symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome''. Antispasmodic medicines help slow the movements of the digestive tract and reduce the chance of spasms.''Antispasmodic drug side effects'' may include''Other treatment plans are available, depending on the symptoms and condition.''Antidiarrheal medicines, such as ''loperamide'' (''Imodium''), a kaolin/pectin preparation (''Kaopectate''), and diphenoxylate/''atropine'' (''Lomotil''), are sometimes used when diarrhea is a major symptom of the syndrome. Do not take these on a long-term basis without first consulting a health-care professional.''Antidiarrheal drug side effects'' may include''Antidepressants'' may be very effective in smaller doses than those typically used to treat ''depression''. ''Imipramine'' (''Tofranil''), ''amitriptyline'' (''Endep''), ''nortriptyline'' (''Pamelor''), and ''desipramine'' (''Norpramin'') are some commonly used medicines that may alleviate ''irritable bowel syndrome symptoms''. Some other antidepressants are more commonly prescribed when ''depression'' and IBS coexist.''Antidepressant'' side effects ''may include'   palpitations, constipation, difficulty urinating, dry mouth, and blurred vision. dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dry mouth, constipation, rash, and weight gain or loss."
Is there a specific diet for IBS-D?,"'Diet'' and lifestyle changes are important in decreasing the frequency and severity of the symptoms of the syndrome.''The first thing your doctor may suggest is to keep a food diary. This will help you figure out foods that trigger your symptoms.'   Limit foods that contain ingredients that can stimulate the intestines and cause diarrhea, such as:CaffeineAlcoholDairy productsFatty foodsFoods high in sugarArtificial sweeteners (sorbitol and xylitol) Caffeine Alcohol Dairy products Fatty foods Foods high in sugar Artificial sweeteners (sorbitol and xylitol) Some vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts) and legumes (beans) may worsen bloating and gassiness and should be avoided. A high fiber diet may lessen symptoms of constipation. Drink plenty of water, and avoid carbonated drinks such as soda, which may cause gas and discomfort. Eat smaller meals and eat slowly to help reduce cramping and diarrhea. Low fat, high carbohydrate meals such as pasta, rice, and whole-grain breads may help (unless you have celiac disease). Probiotic supplements such as lactobacillus acidophilus or prebiotics may help alleviate IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, and bowel movement irregularity. A diet low in FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-saccharides, di-saccharides, mono-saccharides, and polyols), a group of short-chain carbohydrates, may help relieve symptoms. Consult your health-care professional for more information."
What foods should you avoid if you have IBS-D or IBS-C?,"'Whether you have IBS-D or IBS-C, there are foods to avoid that may trigger symptoms.''Certain foods may worsen bloating and gassiness. Foods to avoid include cruciferous vegetables and legumes, such as:''Legumes also may worsen gassiness and bloating, for example:''Some foods may trigger symptoms of abdominal ''cramps'' and diarrhea, including:''Eating large meals also may trigger abdominal cramping and diarrhea.' Cabbage Cauliflower Radishes Horseradish Watercress Wasabi Brussels sprouts Bok choy Arugula Kale Broccoli Chinese cabbage Collard greens Black beans Black-eyed peas Chickpeas (garbanzo beans) Edamame Fava beans Lentils Lima beans Red kidney beans Soy nuts Fatty foods Fried foods Coffee Caffeine Alcohol Sorbitol (a sweetener found in many diet foods, candies, and gums) Fructose (found naturally in honey and some fruits, and also used as a sweetener)"
What home remedies and diet changes treat or soothe IBS-D symptoms?,"'Most people with the syndrome have symptoms only occasionally, and the following measures may treat or soothe symptoms during a flare.''Add fiber to the diet: ''Fiber theoretically expands the inside of the digestive tract, reducing the chance it will spasm as it transmits and digests food. Fiber also promotes regular bowel movements, which helps reduce constipation. Fiber should be added gradually, because it initially may worsen bloating and gassiness. If you have IBS-D, look for foods with more soluble fiber, the type that takes longer to digest (such as that found in oats, beans, barley, peas, apples, carrots, and citrus fruits).''Reduce ''stress'' and ''anxiety'': ''Stress'' and ''anxiety'' may cause ""flares."" Health-care professionals may offer specific advice on reducing ''stress''. These tips may help reduce stress and problems associated with IBS:''Other home remedies to soothe and lessen symptoms include:' Eat regular balanced meals. Reduce caffeine intake. Exercise may help reduce stress. Smoking may worsen symptoms of the syndrome, which is another good reason to quit. Increase fiber in the diet Drink plenty of water Avoid soda, which may cause gas and abdominal discomfort Eat smaller meals to help lessen the incidence of cramping and diarrhea. Low fat and high carbohydrate meals such as pasta, rice, and whole grain breads may help IBS symptoms (unless you have celiac disease)."
What other lifestyle changes help soothe IBS-D symptoms?,"'In addition to dietary changes, there are some healthy habits that may also help reduce IBS symptoms.' Maintain good physical fitness to improve bowel function and help reduce stress. Exercise regularly. Stop smoking for overall good health. Avoid coffee/caffeine and chewing gum. Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption may help. Stress management can help prevent or ease IBS symptoms.Use relaxation techniques: deep breathing, visualization, YogaDo things you find enjoyable: talk to friends, read, listen to musicGut-directed hypnosis can reduce stress and anxietyBiofeedback teaches you to recognize your body's responses to stress and you can learn to slow your heart rate and relax. Use relaxation techniques: deep breathing, visualization, Yoga Do things you find enjoyable: talk to friends, read, listen to music Gut-directed hypnosis can reduce stress and anxiety Biofeedback teaches you to recognize your body's responses to stress and you can learn to slow your heart rate and relax. Pain management techniques can improve tolerance to pain Cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy with trained counselors"
What new medications are being developed or are in clinical trials to treat IBS-D?,"'New medications for IBS-D are also being developed or are in ''clinical trials''. Those that are most promising include:' Serotonin synthesis inhibitors may help reduce pain and improve stool consistency Ramosetron is similar to alosetron (Lotronex), this is reported to relieve symptoms with less constipation Spherical carbon adsorbent offers short-term relief from pain and bloating, but no improvement in stool consistency Benzodiazepine receptor modulator (dextofisopam): this has the potential to reduce colonic motility and gut sensitivity reactions in response to stress Peripheral k-agonist (asimadoline, a kappa-opioid agonist) is in clinical trials and it shows reduced pain, urgency and stool frequency"
What medications are reserved for people that do not improve with standard IBS-D drugs?,"'The following medications are typically reserved for patients with symptoms that do not improve with the previously mentioned treatments:' Alosetron (Lotronex) is a restricted drug approved only for short-term treatment of women with severe, chronic, diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) who have failed to respond to conventional IBS therapy. Fewer than 5% of people with irritable bowel syndrome have the severe form, and only a fraction of people with severe IBS have the diarrhea-predominant type. Alosetron was removed from the United States market but was reintroduced with new restrictions approved by the FDA in 2002. Physicians must be registered with the pharmaceutical manufacturer in order to prescribe the medication. Serious and unpredictable gastrointestinal side effects (including some that resulted in death) were reported in association with its use following its original approval. The safety and efficacy of alosetron has not been sufficiently studied in men; therefore, the FDA has not approved the drug for treatment of IBS in men. Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic medication for IBS-D that works by reducing or altering gut bacteria, and it can improve symptoms of bloating and diarrhea after a 10 to 14 day course of treatment. Some patients require retreatment at higher doses for symptom relief. Eluxadoline (Viberzi) is another newer medication for IBS-D that helps reduce abdominal pain and improves stool consistency in adults. Linaclotide (Linzess) is a kind of drug that relieves constipation and pain for some adults with the syndrome. In drug trials, people with IBS-C had more frequent and better bowel movements and less abdominal pain after taking daily doses of Linzess. The drug often began working within the first few days of treatment. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) is a type of laxative used to treat severe IBS-C in women who are at least 18 years of age. It is a capsule taken orally, twice a day with food. It is used to relieve stomach pain, bloating, and straining; and produce softer and more frequent bowel movements in people who have chronic idiopathic constipation. Tegaserod (Zelnorm) was a medication used to treat IBS but was removed from the market in 2007 due to increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and ischemic colitis."
Which specialties of doctors treats IBS-D?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome may initially be diagnosed by your primary care provider such as your family doctor, internist, or family medicine specialist. A ''gastroenterologist'' (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ''digestive system'') usually will provide further treatment. An ''emergency medicine'' specialist may be seen if you have an acute flare-up of symptoms of the condition.' "
What are the complications of IBS-D?,"'IBS has few associated complications. It does not lead to ''rectal bleeding'', ''colon cancer'', or ''inflammatory bowel diseases'' including ''ulcerative colitis''. Diarrhea and constipation may aggravate ''hemorrhoids'' in people who already have them. If a person eliminates too many foods from their diet, and the diet is too limited in nutrients that could cause health problems.'""The effect on a person's quality of life is the biggest complication of IBS. Stress and ""'anxiety'"" can result from the pain, and can impact a person's daily life."" "
Can IBS-D be prevented?,"'Follow the diet and lifestyle recommendations as outlined in this article, and as discussed with your health-care professional. Avoiding triggers is the best way to prevent symptoms of IBS.' "
What is the outlook for a person with IBS-D?,"'Because ''irritable bowel'' syndrome is a chronic (long-term) disease, symptoms usually return from time to time. This may be influenced by factors such as stress, diet, or other environmental causes. No known treatment cures IBS. Multiple factors may play a role in aggravating the syndrome, so it is difficult to predict what triggers may make it worse in a particular person. Establishing a good relationship with a health-care professional may help alleviate concerns over symptoms and allow rapid recognition of changing or worsening symptoms.' "
Overview of urinary function,"'The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The kidneys, a pair of purplish-brown organs, are located below the ribs toward the middle of the back. The kidneys remove water and waste from the blood in the form of urine, keeping a stable balance of salts and other substances in the blood. The kidneys also produce ''erythropoietin'', a hormone that stimulates the formation of ''red blood cells'"". Narrow tubes called ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder, a triangle-shaped, muscular chamber in the lower abdomen. Like a balloon, the bladder's muscular, elastic walls relax and expand to store urine and contract and flatten when urine empties through the urethra. The typical adult bladder can store about 1 ½ cups of urine.""'Adults urinate about 1½ quarts of urine each day. The amount of urine varies depending on the fluids and foods a person consumes. The volume formed at night is about half that formed during the day.''Normal urine contains fluids, salts (for example, sodium and potassium) and waste products, but it is free of bacteria, ''viruses'', and fungi. The wall of the bladder is isolated from urine and toxic substances by a coating on the inside lining of the bladder that discourages bacteria from attaching and growing on the bladder wall.' "
What is interstitial cystitis (IC)/painful bladder syndrome (PBS)?,"'Interstitial ''cystitis'' (IC), also referred to as painful bladder syndrome (PBS), is a condition that causes bladder ''pain'', bladder pressure, chronic urinary urgency (feeling the need to urinate immediately), and frequency (frequent urination). The symptoms of this condition vary among individuals from mild to severe and may even vary with time in the same individual. The term ''cystitis'' refers to any inflammation of the bladder. In contrast to bacterial cystitis that results from an infection in the bladder, a type of ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'""), medical researchers haven't identified an infectious organism in people with interstitial cystitis.""'Estimates of the number of people affected by IC/PBS vary widely and are dependent upon the criteria used for diagnosis. Many experts believe that about 3.3 million women in the U.S. (over age 18) may have IC/PBS, as well as 1.6 million men.''Despite a lack of consistency about the diagnosis of IC/PBS, studies agree that the majority of those affected are women. While individuals of any age may develop IC/PBS, including children, the average age of onset is around 40. Physicians do not consider IC/PBS a hereditary disorder, but multiple cases have occurred among some families, prompting ongoing investigation of the possible role of hereditary factors in the development of IC/PBS.''Observations from ''cystoscopy'"" (visual examination of the inside of the bladder via a camera) have found that two patterns exist for IC, ulcerative and nonulcerative, depending upon the presence or absence of ulcerations or breaks in the bladder lining. Star-shaped ulcerations in the bladder wall are Hunner's ulcers. These appear in less than 10% of cases of IC/PBS in the U.S.""'Over time, interstitial cystitis can cause physical damage to the bladder wall. Scarring and stiffening of the bladder wall may occur because of the chronic inflammation, leading to a decrease in bladder capacity. Glomerulations (areas of pinpoint bleeding) and small areas of bleeding may appear on the bladder wall.'  "
What is the cause of interstitial cystitis?,"'No one knows what causes IC/PBS, but doctors believe that it is a real physical problem and not a result, symptom, or sign of an emotional problem.''One possible cause of IC/PBS is the disruption of the lining layer of the bladder (known as epithelium) that causes it to become leaky, allowing toxic substances in urine to irritate the bladder wall.''Other possible theories about the cause of IC/PBS include an abnormality of the immune response, such as an autoimmune reaction, the presence of an unidentified infection, or increased nervous system activation in the nerves to the bladder. None of these theories has been conclusively proven to cause IC/PBS.' "
What are risk factors for interstitial cystitis?,"""Because physicians don't understand the cause of IC/PBS, there are no definite risk factors for developing the condition. However, women are more likely than men to develop IC/PBS.""'Some associations with other medical conditions appear with IC/PBS. Women with IC/PBS are more likely to have had frequent ''urinary tract infections'' (''UTIs'') and to have had previous gynecologic surgery than women without IC/PBS. Certain chronic illnesses occur more frequently in people with IC/PBS than in the general population. Examples of these associated illnesses are ''inflammatory bowel disease'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), vulvodynia (chronic discomfort in the vulvar area), ''allergies'', ''endometriosis'', and ''fibromyalgia''. While medical researchers have described each of these conditions in at least some studies to be more common in people with IC/PBS than in the general population, there is no evidence that any of these conditions is the cause of IC/PBS.' "
What are interstitial cystitis symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms of IC/PBS vary greatly from one person to another but have some similarities to those of a ''urinary tract infection''. They include''In most women, symptoms usually worsen around the time of their periods. As with many other illnesses, ''stress'' also may intensify the symptoms, but it does not cause them. The symptoms usually have a slow onset, and urinary frequency is the most common early symptom. As IC/PBS progresses over a few years, cycles of pain (flare-ups or flares) and remissions occur. Pain may be mild or so severe as to be debilitating. Symptoms can vary from day to day.'   decreased bladder capacity resulting in frequent urination of smaller amounts of urine day and night, referred to as urinary frequency; a strong, urgent need to urinate when the need to urinate arises, referred to as urinary urgency; bladder pain, bladder pressure, and feelings of pressure, pain, and tenderness around the bladder, pelvis, and perineum (the area between the anus and vagina or anus and scrotum) which may increase as the bladder fills and decrease as it empties; painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia); and discomfort or pain in the penis and scrotum."
What types of doctors treat interstitial cystitis?,"'Urologists are physicians that specialize in diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the urinary tract, including interstitial cystitis. Some gynecologists also may treat patients with interstitial cystitis.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose interstitial cystitis?,"'Because the symptoms of IC/PBS are similar to those of other disorders of the urinary system and because there is no definitive test to identify IC/PBS, doctors must exclude other conditions before making a diagnosis of IC/PBS. Among the disorders to be excluded are urinary tract or vaginal infections, ''bladder cancer'', bladder inflammation or infection caused by ''radiation'' to the abdomen, eosinophilic and tuberculous cystitis, ''kidney stones'', ''endometriosis'', neurological disorders, ''sexually transmitted diseases'', ''urinary tract infection'' with small numbers of bacteria, and, in men, chronic bacterial and nonbacterial ''prostatitis''.''Medical tests that help identify other conditions include a ''urinalysis'', urine culture, cystoscopy, and biopsy of the bladder wall and, in men, laboratory examination of prostatic secretions.''Physical examination of an individual with IC/PBS may reveal tenderness of the bladder either when pushing on the abdomen over the bladder (just above the pubic bone) or during the pelvic examination in women. No specific physical findings are associated with IC/PBS.''Urinalysis and urine culture'': These tests can detect and identify the most common bacteria in the urine that may be causing symptoms. A health care professional obtains a urine sample either by catheterization or by the ""clean catch"" method. For a clean catch, the patient washes the genital area before collecting a sample of urine ""midstream"" in a sterile container. White and red blood cells and bacteria in the urine suggest an infection of the urinary tract that physicians can treat with antibiotics. If urine is sterile for weeks or months while symptoms persist, a doctor may consider a diagnosis of IC/PBS.''Culture of prostatic secretions'': In men, the doctor can obtain a sample of prostatic fluid. This fluid is examined under the microscope for signs of an infection such as red and white blood cells and can be cultured for bacteria. Antibiotics treat prostatic infections.''Potassium sensitivity test'': Doctors use a test known as the intravesical potassium sensitivity test (PST) in the evaluation of IC/PBS. In the PST test, health care professionals instill two different solutions (sterile water and a solution of potassium) separately into the bladder. The patient rates the severity of pain and/or urgency that occur when a health care professional instills each solution. People with normal bladder linings cannot tell the difference between the two solutions, while those with IBC/PBS and other conditions that affect the leakiness of the bladder wall will experience more pain when a health care provider injects the potassium solution into the bladder.''Cystoscopy under anesthesia with bladder distension'':''\xa0''During cystoscopy, the doctor uses a cystoscope -- an instrument made of a hollow tube about the diameter of a drinking straw with several lenses and a source of light - to look inside the bladder and urethra. The doctor will also distend or stretch the bladder to its capacity by filling it with a liquid or ''gas'"". Because bladder distension is painful in IC/PBS patients, before the doctor inserts the cystoscope through the urethra into the bladder, the patient must be given either regional or general anesthesia. Cystoscopy with distension of the bladder with fluid can detect inflammation (visually or with biopsies), a thick and stiff bladder wall, and Hunner's ulcers. After a health care professional drains fluid from the bladder, small red spots, called glomerulations, that represent enlarged blood vessels and pinpoint areas of bleeding can be seen in the bladder's lining.""""The doctor also may determine a patient's bladder capacity -- the maximum amount of liquid or gas the bladder can hold under anesthesia. (Without anesthesia, either pain or a severe urge to urinate limits capacity.) Most people without IC/PBS have normal or large maximum bladder capacities under anesthesia. A small bladder capacity (due to scarring) under anesthesia helps to support the diagnosis of IC/PBS.""'Cystoscopy has its limitations. Ulcers generally do not appear in mild or early cases of IC/PBS, and glomerulations have been observed in normal individuals without symptoms of IC/PBS. Due to these limitations, physicians recommend cystoscopy only to exclude other possible causes of symptoms and not as the definitive diagnostic test for IC/PBS.''It is important to note that the distension often performed with cystoscopy may lead to relief of symptoms in some patients with IC/PBS, which generally lasts from several weeks to months following the procedure.''Biopsy'': A biopsy is a microscopic examination of a small sample of tissue. A physician may remove samples of the bladder and urethra during cystoscopy and examine them with a microscope later. A biopsy helps to exclude ''bladder cancer''. It also may confirm the presence of mast cells or inflammation of the bladder wall that are consistent with a diagnosis of IC/PBS. Nevertheless, there is nothing on the biopsy that can make an absolute diagnosis of IC/PBS.' "
What is the treatment for interstitial cystitis?,"'Oral medications are one treatment option for IC/PBS. These include low doses of ''antidepressants'' of the tricyclic group such as ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil''). This is not due to a belief that IC/PBS is a psychological condition; rather, ''tricyclic antidepressants'' can help reduce the hyperactivation of nerves within the bladder wall. The antiseizure medication ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin'', Gabarone) also treats nerve-related pain and has sometimes been used to treat the pain of IC/PBS. Physicians may prescribe oral ''antihistamines'' such as ''loratadine'' (''Claritin'') to help reduce ''allergic'"" symptoms that may be worsening the patient's IC/PBS.""'For patients who may not respond well to amitriptyline, another type of oral medication that can be used is the heparinoid (''heparin''-like) drug ''pentosan'' polysulfate sodium (PPS; brand name ''Elmiron''). PPS is chemically similar to the substance that lines the bladder, and physicians believe that PPS assists in the protection of the inner lining cells of the bladder. It may take months before symptoms improve after treatment with this medication.''For those individuals who are unable to ''sleep'' well because of the discomfort of IC/PBS, antihistamines such as ''hydroxyzine'' can facilitate ''sleep''.''People sometimes use ''aspirin'' and ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') as a first line of defense against mild discomfort. However, they may make symptoms worse in some patients. ''Over-the-counter'' forms of ''phenazopyridine'' hydrochloride (Azo-Standard, Prodium, and ''Uristat'') may provide some relief from urinary pain, urgency, frequency, and burning. Higher doses of the drug are available by prescription as Prodium and phenazopyridine (Pyridium).''As mentioned previously, because some patients have noted an improvement in symptoms after bladder distension done to diagnose IC/PBS, sometimes health care professionals use bladder distension (termed hydrodistension) for therapy of IC/PBS. Hydrodistension helps reduce symptoms in many people with interstitial cystitis. (Studies have shown an improvement in 40%-80% of patients.) When it is effective, the relief of symptoms persists for several weeks to months after the procedure. Physicians usually perform it under anesthesia or heavy sedation because of discomfort, and some patients have a temporary worsening of symptoms following the procedure.''This procedure may also be called a bladder wash or bath. During a bladder instillation, the bladder is filled with a solution that is held for varying periods, from a few seconds to 15 minutes, before being drained through a narrow tube called a catheter.''In severe cases of IC/PBS, health care professionals administer intravesical solutions along with oral PPS to provide relief until the oral PPS has had time to take effect.''Drugs used for bladder instillations include dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, RIMSO-50), heparin, ''sodium bicarbonate'', PPS, and hydrocortisone (a steroid).''In severe cases of IC/PBS that do not respond well to oral medications or to bladder distension or instillation, other therapies may be attempted. A procedure known as sacral neuromodulation is effective in controlling symptoms in some people with IC/PBS. The term ""neuromodulation"" refers to an alteration of the nervous system. In sacral neuromodulation, a device is implanted that allows for stimulation of the nerves in the sacral (lower back) area. Sacral neuromodulation works by inhibiting the hyperactive signals from the sensory nerves within the bladder wall.''Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation'' (TENS) is a form of neuromodulation that does not involve surgical placement of wires or an impulse generator. With TENS, mild electric pulses enter the body for minutes to hours two or more times a day through wires placed on the surface of the lower back or the suprapubic region, between the navel and the pubic hair, or through special devices inserted into the vagina in women or into the rectum in men. Physicians believe that the electric pulses may increase blood flow to the bladder, strengthen pelvic muscles that help control the bladder, and trigger the release of hormones that block pain. TENS is generally more effective in reducing pain than in reducing urinary frequency.''Surgical procedures that may rarely be performed to treat severe IC/PBS include peripheral denervation (disrupting the nerves to and from the bladder wall), bladder augmentation to increase bladder capacity, and cystectomy (bladder removal) with diversion, or re-routing, of urine flow into an artificial bladder formed from a loop of intestine.'  "
Are there home remedies for interstitial cystitis?,"'There are a number of home remedies and self-care techniques that many people have found to be of benefit in controlling the ''symptoms of interstitial cystitis''/painful bladder syndrome. These include limiting the consumption of certain foods, ''smoking cessation'', ''exercise'', and bladder training.' "
Are lifestyle modifications of value in the management of interstitial cystitis?,"'There is no scientific evidence linking ''diet'' to IC/PBS, but doctors and patients believe that certain foods, including ''alcohol'', spices, ''chocolate'', and ''caffeinated'' and citrus ''beverages'', may contribute to bladder irritation and inflammation. Foods containing acid, for example, carbonated beverages, tomatoes, ''vitamin C'', citrus fruits and beverages, vinegar, cranberries, strawberries, grapes, guava, mango, and pineapple are believed to aggravate IC/PBS. Other foods that may increase symptoms because they contain the natural chemical tyramine include wine, beer, cheese, nuts, yogurt, bananas, ''soy'"" sauce, chicken livers, raisins, sour cream, avocados, canned figs, corned beef, fava beans, brewers' yeast, and chocolate.""'Some people with IC/PBS also have noticed a worsening of symptoms after eating or drinking products containing ''artificial sweeteners''. They may try eliminating such products from their ''diet'' and, if there is a reduction of symptoms, they can reintroduce them one at a time to determine which product seems to be aggravating their symptoms.''Many people with IC/PBS feel that ''smoking'' worsens their symptoms. (Because ''smoking'' is the major known cause of bladder ''cancer'', one of the best things a smoker can do for the bladder is to ''quit smoking''.)''Many IC/PBS patients feel that regular ''exercise'' helps relieve symptoms and, in some cases, hastens remission.''People who have found some relief from pain may then be able to reduce frequency using bladder training techniques. Methods vary, but the patient decides to urinate at designated times and uses relaxation techniques and distractions to help keep to the schedule. Gradually, the patient lengthens the time between urinations. A diary usually is helpful in keeping track of progress.' "
What is the prognosis (outcome) of interstitial cystitis?,"'IC/PBS is a chronic condition characterized by periods of relapse or flare-ups and remission. Doctors do not fully understand why the symptoms worsen at particular times or disappear and then reappear months or years later. Symptoms may be mild or severe and may vary in intensity even in the same individual over time. There is no cure for IC/PBS, and treatments aim to reduce the severity of symptoms.''There has been no treatment shown to be effective in slowing the progression of the disease or in preventing recurrences.' "
Is it possible to prevent interstitial cystitis?,"'Because doctors do not understand the cause, there are no known strategies for preventing IC/PBS. However, some self-care measures may help reduce the severity of symptoms (see section on home remedies).' "

What are implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs)?,"'An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a small electronic device installed inside the chest to prevent sudden death from cardiac arrest due to life threatening abnormally fast heart rhythms (tachycardias). The ICD is capable of monitoring the heart rhythm. When the heart is beating normally, the device remains inactive. If the heart develops a life-threatening tachycardia, the ICD can attempt pacing to bring the hear rhythm back to normal, or it can deliver an electrical ""''shock''(s)"" to the heart to terminate the abnormal rhythm and return the heart rhythm to normal.' "
How does a normal heart function?,"'The heart is an organ consisting of four chambers that pump blood. The two upper chambers are called the right and left atria, and the two lower chambers called the right and left ventricles. The ''right atrium'' receives venous blood (oxygen-poor blood) from the body and pumps it into the ''right ventricle''. The right ventricle pumps the oxygen-poor blood to the ''lungs'' to receive oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood from the lungs then travels to the ''left atrium'' and is pumped by the left ''atrium'' into the ''left ventricle''. The left ventricle delivers the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. In addition to oxygen, the blood carries other nutrients (glucose, ''electrolytes'', etc.) to the organs.'""In order to keep a body healthy, the heart must deliver a sufficient amount of blood to the body. As a pump, the heart is most efficient in delivering blood when functioning within a certain heart rate range. Normally, the heart's natural ""'pacemaker'' called the SA node (a special tissue located on the right atria wall), keeps the heartbeat (heart rate) in the normal range. Electrical signals generated by the SA node travel along special conduction tissues on the walls of the atria and the ventricles. These electrical signals cause the heart muscles to contract and pump blood in an orderly and efficient manner.' "
How do abnormal heart rhythms decrease blood delivery by the heart?,"'Abnormal heart rhythms'', either too slow or too fast, decrease the delivery of blood by the heart.  Bradycardia is a condition in which the heart rate is too slow. Bradycardias can be due to diseases of the SA node or the conduction tissues of the heart. The slow-beating heart delivers an insufficient amount of blood to the body. ''Tachycardia is a condition in which the heart rate is too rapid. When the heart pumps too fast, the ventricles do not have enough time to fill their chambers with blood before the next contraction. Therefore, tachycardias can decrease the amount of blood delivered to he body. One of the effects of decreased blood delivery to the body is ''low blood pressure''.' "
What is the cause of tachycardias?,'Abnormally fast heart rates are called tachycardias. Tachycardias are caused by rapidly firing electrical signals arising from the walls of the atria or the ventricles. These rapidly firing signals override the signals generated by the SA node and cause the heart to beat too fast.''Tachycardias caused by electrical signals from the atria are called atrial tachycardias. Tachycardias caused by electrical signals from the ventricles are called ventricular tachycardias.' 
What are the symptoms of tachycardias?,'Symptoms of tachycardias include:' Palpitations or fluttering sensations in the heart; Lightheadedness (due to low blood pressure); Fainting spells or loss of consciousness (due to low blood pressure); Fatigue and weakness (due to lack of blood supply); and A flushing sensation.
What are life-threatening tachycardias?,"'Two common life-threatening tachycardias are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular ''fibrillation''. Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid regular rhythm caused by electrical signals originating from an area of the ventricle. Ventricular tachycardia can decrease blood delivery by the heart and cause low ''blood pressure''. Ventricular tachycardia can also progress to a more serious heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation.''Ventricular fibrillation is an irregular rhythm, which is a result of multiple rapid and chaotic electrical signals firing from many different areas in the ventricles. A heart undergoing ventricular fibrillation is in a state of standstill called cardiac arrest. The heart muscles quiver and cease pumping which causes a halt in the delivery of blood to the body. Unless ventricular fibrillation is terminated quickly, irreversible ''brain damage'' occurs within minutes of the onset of ventricular fibrillation, leading to death.''Sudden cardiac arrest'' is the most common cause of death in the United States. The most frequent causes of cardiac arrest in the United States are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.' "
What are the causes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation?,"'Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are most commonly caused by ''heart attacks'' (acute myocardial infarctions) or scarring of the heart muscle from previous ''heart attacks''. Less common causes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation include severe weakening of the heart muscles (''cardiomyopathy''), medication toxicity (such as ''digoxin'' [''Lanoxin''] toxicity), medication side effects, and blood ''electrolyte'' disturbances (such as a ''low potassium'' level). Ironically, some medications used in treating heart rhythm abnormalities can cause ventricular tachycardias.' "
How can ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation be treated and prevented?,"'Medications have traditionally been used in preventing ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Examples of these medications include ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone'', Nextrone, Pacerone) and ''beta-blockers'' such as ''atenolol'' (''Tenormin''), and ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''). Medicines, however, are not very successful in preventing tachycardias or in terminating tachycardias once they occur.''Once a life threatening tachycardia occurs, the most effective treatment is to administer mild electric shock(s) to the heart to terminate the tachycardia and  reset the heart rhythm to normal.''If a patient is in cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, the treatment is the delivery of a strong electrical shock to the fibrillating heart without delay. Irreversible brain and other organ damages can occur within minutes if the normal heart rhythm is not restored. Most patients can potentially be saved if shocks are delivered quickly to convert the fibrillation to normal rhythm before irreversible brain damages occur.''The electrical shocks (mild and strong) that terminate ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation can be delivered by an external defibrillator (a portable unit with pads that deliver electrical shocks to the heart), or by an ''implantable cardiac defibrillator'' (ICD).  External defibrillators, however, may not be readily available, and rescuers may not be able to administer effective CPR for long periods before paramedics arrive. Therefore, in patients known to be at risk of developing life-threatening tachycardias, ICDs can be implanted in their chests as a preventive measure to terminate tachycardias and fibrillation and avert cardiac arrest.' "
Who should receive an implantable cardiac defibrillator?,"'Patients at risk of developing sudden cardiac arrests due to ventricular tachycardias and fibrillations are candidates for ICDs. ICDs do not prevent the occurrence of life-threatening rhythms, but can quickly terminate them when they occur. Recent ''clinical trials'' have identified several groups of patients who should receive ICDs. They are:' Patients who have survived cardiac arrest; Patients with ventricular tachycardias that significantly decrease the amount of blood delivered by the heart, resulting in low blood pressure; Patients with significant heart muscle damage from prior a heart attack, and have ventricular tachycardia episodes that are not suppressed by medications; and Patients deemed at high risk for sudden death from cardiac arrest based on a history of heart disease and findings from an echocardiogram and ECG."
How are implantable cardiac defibrillators designed?,"'An ICD consists of one or more leads (conducting wires insulated with silicone or polyurethane) and a defibrillator unit. The defibrillator unit is a small titanium case containing a microchip computer, a capacitor, and a battery.''The leads carry electrical signals between the heart and the defibrillator unit. One end of a lead is placed on the inner wall of the heart while the other end is attached to the defibrillator unit. The leads help the defibrillator unit monitor the natural heart rhythm. The leads also deliver electrical shock(s) from the defibrillator unit to the heart when tachycardias occur.''The microchip computer runs the defibrillator, monitors the natural heart rhythm, instructs the capacitor to send electrical shock(s) when tachycardias occur, determines the strength of the shock(s) sent, and also keeps a record of the heart rhythms as well as the shock(s) sent by the defibrillator.''ICDs have programmable features that allow the doctor to change the cutoff heart rate for activating the defibrillator. Tachycardias with rates higher than the cutoff heart rate activate the firing of shocks by the defibrillator. The doctor can also adjust the strength (amount of energy delivered) of each shock, and the number of shocks delivered with each tachycardia episode.''Most defibrillators now have built-in pacemakers as well. The newer defibrillators can have very sophisticated pacing devices equipped with the ability to pace both the ''atrium'' and the ventricle (dual chamber pacers). Cardioverter defibrillators have rapid pacing capabilities. Rapid pacing can sometimes convert a tachycardia to normal rhythm without administering electric shock(s).''The electric pulses and shocks delivered by the ICDs are of such low energy that they do not harm the patient or family members in physical contact with the patient.' "
How are implantable cardiac defibrillators implanted?,"'Implantation of an ICD is similar to that of a permanent pacemaker. The procedure, which lasts 1-2 hours, is considered minor in that it does not involve major heart surgery. Patients are typically sedated during the procedure. A local anesthetic is injected under the skin over the area where the ICD will be placed, usually in the right or left upper chest near the collarbone. The lead is then inserted into a vein located in the upper chest near the collarbone. The tip of the lead is placed on the inner wall of the heart with the visual guidance of ''x-rays''. If there is more than one lead, the process is repeated. The other end of the lead (or leads) is connected to the defibrillator unit, which is then inserted under the skin at the incision site. Because there are no nerve endings inside the blood vessels and the heart, the patient usually does not feel the placement of the lead(s).''Heavy sedation is used during the procedure when the defibrillator is tested for proper functioning. Testing an ICD involves inducing a rapid heart rhythm and allowing the defibrillator to detect the abnormal rhythm and then terminate it with a shock (just as the device would be expected to operate in a real-life tachycardia episode).' "
What happens after implantation of an implantable cardiac defibrillator?,"""While in the hospital, the patient's heart rhythms, pulse, and blood pressures are routinely monitored. The doctor may check or adjust the settings on the defibrillator (done from outside the body). The nurses also periodically examine the incision over the implantation site for bleeding, redness, or other signs of infection. It is normal to feel some ""'pain'' over the incision for 1-2 weeks. Medications are usually given to alleviate ''pain''.''Patients are typically discharged from the hospital the day after the procedure. Once home, the patient can usually return to most activities. Instructions are given to avoid raising the arm over the shoulder on the side of the ICD implantation for several weeks. This precaution is to avoid dislodging the leads before they become secure inside the veins and the heart. Patients are also asked to avoid contact sports, vigorous exercises, and heavy lifting for several weeks.''In a week, the ''sutures'"" over the incision are removed in the doctor's office. This is a good opportunity to discuss the following issues with the doctor:""'Call the doctor if there is bleeding from the incision site, increasing pain over the incision site, ''fever'', heat, swelling, or fluid draining from the incision site. Also call if the arm becomes swollen on the side of the implantation or if there is twitching of chest muscles, persistent ''hiccups'', ''dizziness'', ''fainting'', ''chest pain'', or ''shortness of breath''.' Level of physical activity; Return to work; Permission to drive automobiles; How frequently should the ICD and battery level be checked? What are the signs of device failure? When to replace the ICD (most ICD batteries last 3-7 years)? Precautions regarding interference with the device by outside power sources; and What to do when tachycardias occur."
What are the complications of implantable cardiac defibrillator implantation?,"'Common complications include pain, swelling, and minor bleeding at the implantation site. More serious complications are uncommon and typically occur less than 2% of the time. Serious complications include major bleeding requiring blood transfusions, introduction of air into the space between the lung and chest wall (''pneumothorax'') requiring tube drainage, perforation of the heart muscle by the leads, activation of an intractably fast heart rhythm, ''stroke'', heart attack, need for emergency heart surgery, and death. Although there are no official guidelines, ICDs should be implanted by or in conjunction with a cardiologist specially trained in clinical cardiac electrophysiology (electrical diseases of the heart).' "
What happens during a tachycardia episode after implantation of an Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator?,"'When the heart is beating normally, the ICD remains inactive. When tachycardia occurs, the patient typically experiences the symptoms of a fast heart rate. Since tachycardia can lower blood pressure and cause ''dizziness'' or fainting spells, the person should lie down or sit down until the symptoms pass. The ICD will either send a series of pacemaker-like weak electrical signals or one or more low energy shocks to convert the tachycardia to normal rhythm. The patient may not feel the pacemaker-like signals, while the low energy shocks may feel like thumps in the chest. Terminating a tachycardia with low energy shocks is called ''cardioversion''.''If ventricular fibrillation occurs, the patient may suddenly feel faint or lose consciousness due to lack of blood pressure and blood supply to the brain. The ICD, sensing the rapid and irregular rhythm, quickly sends a strong shock to terminate the rhythm. Terminating fibrillation with a strong electric shock is called ''defibrillation''. Successful defibrillation promptly restores consciousness. If unconsciousness lasts longer than 30 seconds, emergency 911 should be called.''The patient, or anyone available to assist, should also call emergency (911) if any of the following occur:' Symptoms of tachycardia persist after feeling the shock(s); Symptoms of tachycardia persist and the patient feels no shocks (possible ICD malfunction); or The patient feels a series of shocks in a row (possible ICD malfunction or recurrent attacks of tachycardias). Both conditions need prompt medical attention."
Living with an implantable cardiac defibrillator,"'After recovering fully from the ICD implantation, most patients can resume normal activities, including ''exercise'' and sex. The doctor should prescribe the type and intensity of the ''exercise''. The doctor also decides when the patient can return to work.'""Every patient is given an ICD identification card. The ID card contains information regarding the ICD and instructions in case of an emergency. The card should be carried in the patient's wallet at all times and shown to other doctors and dentists. Occasionally, it will need to be shown to security officers at the airport.""  "
What outside electrical sources are safe?,"'ICDs are well protected from most household electrical appliances in good condition such as radios, televisions, stereos, microwave ovens, electrical blankets, computers, vacuum cleaners, etc.' "
What outside electrical sources can interfere with the implantable cardiac defibrillator?,"'Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'' scan) is a diagnostic test for studying the brain, the joints, the spine, the ''liver'', and other organs. The strong magnetic field from the MRI scan can interfere with ICDs. Patients with ICDs should not undergo MRI scanning.''Digital cellular phones can interfere with ICDs. Therefore, the cellular phone should be held on the ear opposite from the side of the ICD. Do not carry the cellular phone in the pocket near the chest.''Theft detector gates in certain stores can generate signals that interfere with the ICD. While it is safe for patients with ICDs to quickly walk through these gates, they should not stand at or near the gates.''Similarly, the metal detector gates at airports can send strong signals that interfere with the ICDs. This problem can be avoided by presenting the ICD ID card to the security officers and ''walking'' around the gates. Hand held security wands (such as those used by airport security officers) have magnetic fields that can interfere with the device. Scanning by these wands should be avoided.''Heavy-duty electrical powered equipment, arc welders, a ''running'' car engine, and certain electrically powered surgical tools can also cause disturbances with the ICD. Patients should obtain permission from their doctors prior to driving a car or operating equipment which may fall into the above category.''Although a running car should not interfere with an ICD during driving, a patient should not lean over a running engine. Any other concerns and precautions should be discussed with your doctor.' "
What does the future hold for ICDs?,"'Implantable defibrillator technology continues to improve. The size of ICDs has decreased dramatically which makes the ICD easier to implant, less visible, and more comfortable. Other advances include not only technology improvements, but clinical trials that may expand the indications and uses for this exciting lifesaving device.' "
What is ichthyosis vulgaris?,"'Ichthyosis vulgaris is a rare ''inherited'' skin condition that is characterized by extremely ''dry skin'' (''xerosis'') involving most of the skin surface. Ichthyosis vulgaris produces large scales in the skin that can resemble fish scales, hence the term ''ichthyosis''. ''Vulgaris'' simply means the common form. Other types of ichthyosis are even rarer. Patients with this condition have a defective skin barrier, which permits the evaporation of water at an elevated rate.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for ichthyosis vulgaris?,"""An inherited genetic defect, a mutation, affecting a giant protein called filaggrin causes ichthyosis vulgaris. One inherits the defective gene from one's parents and may be produced by one or more mutations in the profillagrin gene produced early in ""'fetal development''. It is expressed in an autosomal dominant fashion, which means that all that is necessary to have the disease is a single defective copy of the gene that codes for filaggrin. Since this protein plays a major role in the maintenance of the correct level of hydration in the skin, affected patients have difficulty retaining water in the superficial layers of the skin. A significant number of patients with ''atopic dermatitis'', ''asthma'', and ''hay fever'' share mutations in this gene, as well.' "
Is ichthyosis vulgaris contagious?,"'Since this is an inherited condition, it is not ''contagious'' and cannot spread from person to person.' "
What are ichthyosis vulgaris symptoms and signs?,"'The most significant finding, which is ultimately diagnostic, is the presence of very ''dry skin'' over most of the skin surface. The abnormal appearance of the skin is diagnostic of ichthyosis vulgaris. This dryness appears as rather large dry scales that seem to spare moist areas like the armpits and groin, as well as other flexural areas. The characteristic appearance is usually absent at birth but becomes obvious as the child ages.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose ichthyosis vulgaris?,"""Since ichthyosis vulgaris is relatively rare (one in 250-1,000 children), only physicians specializing in the skin (dermatologists) or in genetic defects are equipped best to diagnose and treat this condition. Doctors often suspect a diagnosis purely on the basis of the skin's appearance. Evidence of other blood relatives with ichthyosis would support the diagnosis. Occasionally, it may be necessary to examine affected skin with a biopsy using light microscopy and even electron microscopy. Other types of ichthyosis can be confused with ichthyosis vulgaris."" "
What is the treatment for ichthyosis vulgaris?,"'Since the condition is rare, there are few well-controlled treatment trials. There is no way of replacing the defective filaggrin molecule. Living in a humid environment is very helpful in controlling the disease. Patients usually do well in places like Southeast Asia as opposed to Northern Europe. Using emollients on the skin that tend to suppress the evaporation of water can be very helpful. Effective emollients usually come in jars and are thick and do not flow. Topical medications that contain 10% lactic acid, 10% urea, and/or 10% glycerol (''AmLactin'', ''Lac-Hydrin'', Lactinol, Lactinol-E, LactiCare, Ureacin-10, Aqua Care) can be very helpful, as well.'  "
Are there any home remedies for ichthyosis vulgaris?,"'As most of the topical medications recommended for the control of this condition are available without a prescription, people can treat their mild disease without physician supervision. It is prudent to see a physician specialist to obtain an accurate diagnosis and follow the medical advice.' "
Is there a special diet for those with ichthyosis vulgaris?,'There are no dietary manipulations likely to affect this condition' 
What are complications of ichthyosis vulgaris?,"'The major complications that occur are due to the damage that is produced by the excessive dryness characteristic of this condition. ''Dry skin'' is exceptionally susceptible to irritation. Irritated skin is red and ''itchy''. Scratching skin predisposes to skin infections. In addition, there seems to be a predilection for the development of ''eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis'') and other ''allergic'' conditions, including ''asthma'' and hay ''fever''. Currently, medical professionals do not understand the reason for this relationship.' "
What is the prognosis of ichthyosis vulgaris?,"'Ichthyosis vulgaris may be either mild or severe depending on the precise genetic defect (more than one mutation affecting filaggrin production), as well as ambient environmental factors (average relative humidity and temperature). Mild disease has an excellent prognosis, whereas severe disease may be difficult to control.' "
Is it possible to prevent ichthyosis vulgaris?,"'Once a ''conception'' occurs, it is not possible to prevent the development of ichthyosis at this time.' "
Are there support groups for people with ichthyosis vulgaris?,'The following are ichthyosis support groups on the Internet:''The Foundation for Ichthyosis & Related Skin Types (FIRST)''Ichthyosis Support Group' 
What is ICU psychosis?,"'ICU psychosis is a disorder in which patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) or a similar setting experience a cluster of serious psychiatric symptoms. Another term that may be used interchangeably for ICU psychosis is ICU syndrome. ICU psychosis is also a form of delirium, or acute brain failure.' "
What causes ICU psychosis?," Sensory deprivation: A patient being put in a room that often has no windows, and is away from family, friends, and all that is familiar and comforting. Sleep disturbance and deprivation: The constant disturbance and noise with the hospital staff coming at all hours to check vital signs, give medications, etc. Continuous light levels: Continuous disruption of the normal biorhythms with lights on continually (no reference to day or  night).  Stress: Patients in an ICU frequently feel the almost total loss of control over their life. Lack of orientation: A patient's loss of time and date.  Medical monitoring: The continuous monitoring of the patient's vital signs, and the noise monitoring devices produce can be disturbing and create sensory overload. Pain which may not be adequately controlled in an ICU  Critical illness: The pathophysiology of the disease, illness or traumatic event - the stress on the body during an illness can cause a variety of symptoms. Medication (drug) reaction or side effects: The administration of medications typically given to the patient in the hospital setting that they have not taken before. Infection creating fever and toxins in the body. Metabolic disturbances: electrolyte imbalance, hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels), and elevated liver enzymes. Heart failure (inadequate cardiac output) Cumulative analgesia (the inability to feel pain while still conscious) Dehydration"
What are the symptoms of ICU psychosis?,"'The cluster of psychiatric symptoms of ICU psychosis include:''In short, patients become temporarily psychotic.  The symptoms vary greatly from patient to patient.  The onset of ICU psychosis is usually rapid, and is upsetting and frightening to the patient and family members.  '   extreme excitement,  anxiety,  restlessness, hearing voices, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations, nightmares, paranoia, disorientation, agitation, delusions, abnormal behavior, fluctuating level of consciousness which include aggressive or passive behavior."
How is ICU psychosis diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of ICU psychosis can be made only in the absence of a known underlying medical condition that can mimic the symptoms of ICU psychosis. A medical assessment of the patient is important to search for other causes of mental status abnormality such as:'""The patient's safety must be considered at all times."" stroke, Infection or sepsis Medication side effects or interactions low blood sugar, drug or alcohol withdrawal, and any other medical condition that may require treatment."
How is ICU psychosis treated?,"""The treatment of ICU psychosis clearly depends on the cause(s). Many times the actual cause of the psychosis involves many factors, and many issues will need to be addressed to relieve the symptoms.  A first step is a review of the patient's medications. The physician in charge of the patient along with the pharmacist can review each of the patient's medications to determine if they may be influencing the delirium.  ""'Family members, familiar objects, and calm words may help. ''Sleep'' deprivation may be a major contributing factor. Therefore, providing a quiet restful environment to allow the patient optimal sleep is important.  Controlling the amount of time visitors are allowed to stimulate the patient can also help. ''Dehydration'' is remedied by administering fluids. ''Heart'' failure requires treatment with digitalis. Infections must be diagnosed and treated. Sedation with anti-psychotic agents may help. A common medication used in the hospital setting to treat ICU psychosis is ''haloperidol'' or other medications for psychosis (antipsychotics). '' It should be understood that in saving a life in the critical environment, ICU psychosis sometimes may be a small price to pay for cutting edge, precise medical life-saving measures.  '  "
Can ICU psychosis be prevented?,"""The primary goal is to correct any imbalance, restore the patient's health, and return the patient to normal activities as quickly as possible. To help prevent ICU psychosis, many critical care units are now:"" using more liberal visiting policies,  providing periods for sleep,  protecting the patient from unnecessary excitement,  minimizing shift changes in the nursing staff caring for a patient, orienting the patient to the date and time,  reviewing all medical procedures with an explanation about what to expect,  asking the patient if there are any questions or concerns,  talking with the family to obtain information regarding religious and cultural beliefs, and  even coordinating the lighting with the normal day-night cycle, etc."
How long does ICU psychosis last?,"'ICU psychosis often vanishes magically with the coming of morning or the arrival of some sleep. However, it may last 24 hours or even up to two weeks with fluctuations of the level of consciousness and behavior patterns. Although it may linger through the day, agitation frequently is worst at night. (This phenomenon, called sundowning, is also common in nursing homes).''Fortunately, ICU psychosis usually resolves completely when the patient leaves the ICU.' "
How common is ICU psychosis?,"'Some estimate that one patient in every three who spends more than five days in an ICU experiences some form of psychotic reaction. As the number of intensive care units and the patient population in them grow, the number of individuals affected by this disorder will correspondingly increase.  With patients being transferred out of the ICU more rapidly than in years past; ICU psychosis may be more common in other areas such as the regular medical floor of the hospital or sometimes may even occur after discharge from the hospital.' "
What is an example of a situation of ICU psychosis?,"'Years ago, when we went to visit my father-in-law in a hospital ICU, we found him disoriented and very ''depressed'"". He couldn't hear or see well. It was like being in a medically-induced whiteout. His room was windowless. He was unable to listen to a radio, watch television or talk on the telephone. He had virtually no human contact other than brief visits by medical staff because he was in isolation with an infection. The staff he did see were in mask and gown and all looked alike. He felt cut off from human contact. He was sure he was going to die (which he didn't). He had ICU psychosis.""""It turned out that my father-in-law's customized hearing aid left lying on the nightstand had disappeared.  It had apparently fallen into the waste basket and been thrown out with the trash.  To safeguard his glasses, a well-meaning nurse suggested that his glasses be taken home. Hence, he could not hear or see much. Restoration of his hearing aid and glasses largely relieved his ICU psychosis."" "
Can ICU psychosis be dangerous?,"'Yes. To give another example, a friend fell seriously ill with a pulmonary infection some years ago, was very feverish, in considerable pain (from ''pleurisy'') and felt just terrible. She was put in the hospital ICU and had a large-bore intravenous catheter with fluids ''running'' together with several antibiotics. She was also given some medications to relieve the pain let me catch up on sleep. She fell asleep but awoke in the middle of the night totally disoriented, very agitated, hallucinating, etc. She had pulled out the IV catheter and was spouting blood all over the place. She was experiencing ICU psychosis. While still in the hospital, a repeat dose of the pain medications led to a repeat episode of the ICU psychosis. ICU psychosis can be dangerous, even life-threatening. It is best avoided if possible.' "
What is the facial nerve?,"'The facial nerve is a nerve that controls the muscles on the side of the face. It allows us to show expression, smile, cry, and wink. Injury to the facial nerve can cause a socially and psychologically devastating physical defect; although most cases resolve spontaneously, treatment may ultimately require extensive rehabilitation or multiple procedures.''The facial nerve is the seventh of the twelve cranial nerves. Everyone has two facial nerves, one for each side of the face. The facial nerve travels with the ''hearing'' nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) as it travels in and around the structures of the middle ear. It exits the front of the ear at the stylomastoid foramen (a hole in the skull base), where it then travels through the parotid gland. In the parotid gland it divides into many branches that provide motor function for the various muscles and glands of the head and neck.'  "
What are symptoms of a facial nerve problem?,"'Facial nerve problems may result in facial muscle ''paralysis'', ''weakness'', or twitching of the face. Dryness of the eye or the mouth, alteration of taste on the affected side, or even excessive tearing or salivation can be seen as well. However, the finding of one of these symptoms does not necessarily imply a specific facial nerve problem; the physician needs to make a careful investigation in order to make a precise diagnosis. Symptoms of a facial nerve problem can vary in severity depending upon the extent of the injury to the nerve. Symptoms may range from mild twitching to full paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face.'  "
What conditions affect the facial nerve?,"'There are numerous causes of facial nerve disorder:' Trauma such as birth trauma, skull base fractures, facial injuries, middle ear injuries, or surgical trauma Nervous system disease including stroke involving the brain stem Infection of the ear or face, or herpes zoster of the facial nerve (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) Tumors including acoustic neuroma, schwannoma, cholesteatoma, parotid tumors, and glomus tumors Toxins due to alcoholism or carbon monoxide poisoning Bell's palsy, which is also called idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (see below); this condition is sometimes associated with diabetes mellitus or pregnancy"
How are the causes of facial nerve dysfunction diagnosed?,"'Causes of facial nerve disorder vary from unknown to life threatening. Sometimes, there is a specific treatment for the problem. Accordingly, it is important to investigate why the problem has occurred. The specific tests used for diagnosis will vary from patient to patient, but include:' Hearing tests: Hearing tests are done to assess the status of the auditory nerve. The stapedial reflex test can evaluate the branch of the facial nerve that supplies motor fibers to one of the muscles in the middle ear. Balance tests: Will help find out if part of the auditory nerve is involved. Tear tests: The loss of the ability to form tears may help to locate the site and severity of a facial nerve lesion. Taste tests: The loss of taste in the front of the tongue may help locate the site and severity of a facial nerve lesion. Salivation test: Decreased flow of saliva may help locate the site and severity of a facial nerve lesion. Imaging studies: These tests help determine if there is infection, a tumor, a bone fracture, or any other abnormality. These studies usually include a CT scan and/or a MRI scan. Electrical nerve stimulation tests: Stimulation of the nerve by an electrical current tests whether the nerve can still cause muscles to contract. It can be used to evaluate progression of the disease. For example, if testing indicates equal muscle response on both sides of the face, the patient can be expected to have complete return of facial function in three to six weeks without significant deformity."
What is Bell's palsy?,"'Bell\'s palsy (sometimes referred to as Bell palsy) is paralysis of the facial nerve of unknown cause. The diagnosis is made when no other cause can be identified. Although Bell\'s palsy is thought to be caused by a viral infection of the facial nerve, this hasn\'t been proven. Other names for this condition are ""idiopathic facial palsy"" or Antoni\'s palsy.' "
How does a person get Bell's palsy? ,"""While the actual mechanism of injury of the facial nerve in Bell's palsy is unknown, one proposed mechanism of injury includes:"" Primary viral infection (herpes) sometime in the past. The virus lives in the nerve (geniculate ganglion) from months to years. The virus becomes reactivated at a later date. The virus reproduces and travels along the nerve. The virus infects the cells surrounding the nerve (Schwann cells) resulting in inflammation. The immune system responds to the damaged Schwann cells, which causes inflammation of the nerve and subsequent weakness or paralysis of the face. The course of the paralysis and the recovery will depend upon the degree and amount of damage to the nerve."
Bell's palsy symptoms,"""The typical symptoms of Bell's palsy include:"" Acute unilateral paralysis of facial muscles is present; the paralysis involves all muscles, including the forehead. About half the time, there is numbness or pain in the ear, face, neck or tongue. There is a preceding viral illness in a majority of patients. There is a family history of Bell's palsy in some of patients. Very few patients have bilateral problems. There may be a change in hearing sensitivity (often increased sensitivity)."
Who gets Bell's palsy? How long does it last?,"""Bell's palsy is usually a self-limiting, non-life-threatening condition that resolves spontaneously, usually within six weeks. There is no predominant age or racial predilection; however, it is more common during pregnancy and slightly more common in menstruating females. In general, the incidence increases with advancing age. Children under the age of 13 seem less at risk of developing Bell's palsy than older individuals."" "
How is Bell's palsy treated? How is facial nerve paralysis treated?,"""There are no medications specifically approved to treat Bell's palsy. Underlying medical conditions that lead to facial nerve disorder are treated specifically according to the specific condition that is responsible for the damage to the nerve. Steroid medications (""'corticosteroids'"") are the best treatment for Bell's palsy, and it is recommended that all patients be treated. The usual amount is one milligram per kilogram body weight of ""'prednisone'' (or steroid alternative) per day for 7 to 14 days. Recently, antiviral medications like ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax'') given in conjunction with steroids have been demonstrated to increase recovery. Doses of the antiviral agent will vary with the drug chosen.'""Although physical therapy and electrotherapy probably have no significant benefit, facial exercises can help prevent contractures of affected muscles. Surgical facial nerve decompression is controversial in Bell's palsy. Some physicians recommend surgical decompression during the first two weeks in patients showing the most severe nerve degeneration; however, there can be a substantial risk of ""'hearing loss'' with this surgery.'  "
Treatment options for eye problems,"'Patients with facial nerve paralysis have difficulty keeping their eye closed because the muscles which close the eye cannot work. Serious complications can occur if the ''cornea'' of the eye becomes too dry. Treatment consists of:' protective glasses which can prevent dust from entering the eye; manual closure of the eye with a finger to keep it moist -- patients should use the back of their finger rather than the tip to insure that the eye is not injured; artificial tears or ointments to help keep the eye lubricated; taping or patching the eye closed with paper tape while asleep; and in cases in which recovery is incomplete, a temporary or permanent narrowing of the eye opening (tarsorrhaphy) may be necessary."
Surgical reconstruction options,"'Reconstructive options for patients with facial muscle weakness or paralysis include one or more of the following:' Nerve repair or nerve grafts: Facial nerve regeneration occurs at a rate of one millimeter per day. If a nerve has been cut or removed, direct microscopic repair is the best option. Nerve transposition: Often the tongue nerve (hypoglossal nerve) or the other facial nerve can be connected to the existing facial nerve. For example, the patient can then train themselves to move their face by moving their tongue. Muscle transposition or sling procedures: The temporalis muscle or masseter muscle (some of the only muscles on the face not supplied by the facial nerve), can be moved down and connected to the corner of the mouth to allow movement of the face. Muscle transfers: Free muscles from the leg (gracilis) can be used to provide both muscle bulk and function. Often a cross facial nerve transposition is done to provide similar nerve supply to the donor muscle flap. Ancillary eyelid or oral procedures: In addition to one of the above, often it is necessary to include a brow lift or facelift, partial lip resection, eyelid repositioning, lower eyelid shortening, upper eyelid weights, or eyelid springs in reconstructive surgery following severe facial nerve palsies."
Is there a cure for Bell's palsy? What is the prognosis for other facial nerve problems?,"""The prognosis for facial nerve damage depends on the underlying cause. Many patients who have required surgery to remove tumors may have unavoidable permanent injury to the facial nerve, whereas a majority of persons who experience Bell's palsy will have complete recovery. The best outcomes occur with rapid diagnosis and treatment."" "
Can Bell's palsy and other facial nerve problems be prevented?,"'At one time it was thought that exposure to ''cold'"" air or a strong wind were predisposing factors leading to idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy); we now know that these ideas were incorrect. As the majority of causes for idiopathic facial nerve problems are unknown, it is difficult to predict with any accuracy specific items to avoid. Choosing a healthy lifestyle to decrease the risk of ""'diabetes'', ''cancer'', or infection may help prevent some cases of facial nerve palsy.' "
What is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is defined as a specific form of progressive fibrosis that causes interstitial ''pneumonia'', usually in older adults and is limited to the ''lungs''. Fibrotic (''scar''-like) tissue develops in the airways of the lungs, making it difficult for the body to get the oxygen it needs. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis differs from pulmonary fibrosis in that the cause is unknown whereas there are known causes of pulmonary fibrosis. Though not very common, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is considered to be debilitating, incurable, and terminal, by many health-care professionals and researchers.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'The symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are not specific, and are similar to many other types of pulmonary cardiac diseases. The majority of people with the disease have about a 6-month or more history of ''shortness of breath'' and/or nonproductive ''cough''. About 5% of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis do not have symptoms, and the disease is diagnosed when he or she is being examined for other medical problems.''The signs and symptoms that may occur in some people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are:'   Six months or greater history of shortness of breath and/or cough Fatigue Mild fevers Weight loss Joint discomfort Muscle pain Clubbing or enlargement of fingers Ankle swelling Heart murmur (tricuspid regurgitation)"
What causes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Inclusion of the word ""idiopathic"" means that this type of fibrosis has an unknown cause. Current hypotheses include exposure to some type of agent (for example, environmental dust, viral infection, reflux, aspiration of gastrointestinal contents, and others) that leads to the alveolar damage in the lungs. Researchers further hypothesize that in attempt to repair the alveolar damage, fibrosis and lung scarring occur to produce eventually clinical pulmonary fibrosis.' "
What are the stages of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Staging systems for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may help health-care professionals and researchers to better define the medical condition of their patients. However, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, staging systems are constantly being redefined. For example, the first staging systems traditionally considered the disease as mild, moderate, or severe while others considered stages as early or advanced. The stages are relatively arbitrary and loosely based on pulmonary function tests. Unfortunately, there are no standardized definitions for mild, moderate, and severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Though arbitrary, these staging systems give health-care professionals a framework to diagnose and treat patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.''For example, some doctors consider treatment with ''pirfenidone'' for mild to moderate disease, and lung transplantation for severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. There are researchers that have developed novel idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis staging systems based on other criteria such as age, hospitalization, baseline lung function, and a 24-week change in function, while other researchers choose other parameters such as various physiological lung measurements. The patient and their physician(s) can discuss which staging system they choose to utilize.' "
Is there a test to diagnosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is somewhat difficult. It is a diagnosis of exclusion of other known causes of ''interstitial lung disease'' including environmental and drug exposures. Currently, there are no laboratory studies that can ultimately diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; however, up to 30% of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may have positive tests for antinuclear antibodies and/or ''rheumatoid factor''.''High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is somewhat more specific and sensitive for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnoses although not definitive, the same is true for pulmonary function tests. However, repeated pulmonary function tests that show declines over six months, when taken into account with other non-specific findings, add to the possible diagnosis. However, a pattern of usual interstitial ''pneumonia'' (UIP) on HRCT requires four features for diagnosis of interstitial ''pneumonia'':''Bronchoscopy'' and surgical lung biopsy are also used to help distinguish between UIP and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Consequently, the newest diagnostic criteria of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis requires the following:' Subplural, basal predominance of ground glass opacity Reticular abnormalities Honeycombing with or without traction bronchiectasis Absence of features listed as inconsistent with UIP Exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, and/or drug toxicities) The presence of a UIP pattern, described above, on HRCT in patients not subjected to surgical biopsy Specific combinations of HRCT and surgical lung biopsy patterns in patients subjected to surgical lung biopsy"
Treatment guidelines for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"'The treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis depends upon the stage of the disease, and usually begins with medical treatment, supportive measures, and possibly surgical transplantation of the lungs. Often, during the mild to moderate disease medical care is initiated. However, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis sometimes progresses rapidly, so if idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed, a transplant surgeon should be consulted early as the person with IPF may eventually require lung transplant.''Guidelines on the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have been published by several institutions including the American, European, Japanese, Latin American thoracic societies and/or associations. The following is an abbreviated summary of these guidelines:''Patients should discuss with their doctors on how this progressive disease is best treated on an individual basis.'  They conditionally recommend the use of pirfenidone and nintedanib, both approved by the FDA in 2014. They do not conditionally recommend the use of imatinib (Gleevec), warfarin (Warfarin, Jantoven), combination prednisone with N-acetylcysteine, and several other drugs. They conditionally recommend anti-acid medications even in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients without symptoms of reflux. Encourage the patient to quit any smoking. Encourage vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal infections. They suggest patients with hypoxemia (low oxygen in the blood, for example, pulse oximetry measured less than 88%) use oxygen therapies to maintain a saturation at least 90% during all activities, including sleeping."
Lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"'Lung transplantation is considered when the patient develops severe stage (also termed end stage) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Lung transplantation does show a survival benefit over medical therapy. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has now replaced ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') as the most common reason for lung transplantation in the US.''Any patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis should be referred to a transplant surgeon to determine early on if the patient may meet criteria for a lung transplant. Some people may qualify for a single or a double lung transplant. Reported five-year survival rates for lung transplantation are about 50% to 56%.''Criteria for a transplant vary somewhat so it is important to have the patient and the medical team (primary care physician, ''pulmonologist'', and transplant surgeon) all agree on the potential criteria for the individual patient.' "
"What is the life expectancy and prognosis for a person with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)?","'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has a poor prognosis. The mean survival time or ""life expectancy"" is about 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. Most commonly, the person experiences an acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and then dies because of the disease. Individuals with IPF who undergo lung transplant have a mortality rate of about 50% to 56% after five years so the transplant may increase the life expectancy in some people with the disease.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Although primary care physicians help manage patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, usually a pulmonologist (a lung specialist) is consulted during the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Some doctors suggest a lung transplant surgeon be consulted when the patient is diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis unless there are contraindications (Lung transplant may be more harmful to some people.) for transplantation.''Because of the high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (''GERD'') in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a ''gastroenterologist'' may be consulted.' "
Can idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis be prevented?,"'Because idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is ""idiopathic,"" ''prevention'' is difficult. However, many health-care professionals and researchers theorize that the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may be reduced in some people if they ''quit smoking'', and reduce or eliminate their exposure to toxins or fumes that have the potential to damage the lungs.' "
Support for families and friends,"'There are support groups for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and their families, for example, the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (''www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org'') and the American Lung Association (''www.lung.org'').' "
What is Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding condition in which the blood doesn't clot as it should. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets).""""Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites). They're made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. Platelets stick together (clot) to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.""'You can understand the name of this disease by an explanation of its three parts. ""Idiopathic"" (id-ee-o-PATH-ick) means that the cause of the condition isn\'t known. ""Thrombocytopenic"" (throm-bo-cy-toe-PEE-nick) means there\'s a lower than normal number of platelets in the blood. ""Purpura"" (PURR-purr-ah) refers to purple ''bruises'' caused by bleeding under the skin.''People who have ITP often have purple ''bruises'' that appear on the skin or on the mucous membranes (for example, in the mouth). The bruises mean that bleeding has occurred in small blood vessels under the skin.''A person who has ITP also may have bleeding that results in tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a ''rash''.'""People who have ITP also may have nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums when they have dental work done, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Women who have ITP may have menstrual bleeding that's heavier than usual.""'More extensive bleeding can cause hematomas (he-mah-TO-mas). A ''hematoma'' is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump.''Bleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but can be life threatening if it occurs.'""In most cases, an autoimmune response is believed to cause ITP. Normally your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known.""""ITP can't be passed from one person to another."" "
What Are The Types of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"'There are two types of ITP: acute (temporary or short-term) and chronic (long-lasting).''Acute ITP generally lasts less than 6 months. It mainly occurs in children, both boys and girls, and is the most common type of ITP. Acute ITP often occurs after an infection caused by a virus.''Chronic ITP is long-lasting (6 months or longer) and mostly affects adults. However, some teenagers and children can get this type of ITP. Chronic ITP affects women 2 to 3 times more often than men.' "
What Are The causes of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""In most cases, it's believed that an autoimmune response causes idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).""""Normally, the immune system makes antibodies (proteins) to fight off germs or other harmful things that enter the body. In ITP, however, the immune system attacks and destroys the body's platelets by mistake. Why this happens isn't known.""'Children who get acute (short-term) ITP often have had recent viral infections. It\'s possible that the infection somehow ""triggers"" or sets off the immune reaction that leads to ITP in these children. ITP in adults, on the other hand, doesn\'t seem to be linked to infections.'  "
What Are The Risk Factors for Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"'Both children and adults can develop idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).''Children usually get the acute (short-term) type of ITP. Acute ITP often develops after an infection caused by a virus. Adults tend to get the chronic (long-lasting) type of ITP.

However, the number of cases of ITP is rising because routine blood tests that can detect a ''low platelet count'' are being done more often.'""ITP can't be passed from one person to another."" "
What Are The Symptoms and Signs for Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""Having a low platelet count doesn't cause symptoms. However, the bleeding that a low platelet count can cause may have the following signs and symptoms:""""Any kind of bleeding that's hard to stop could be a sign of ITP. This includes menstrual bleeding in women that's heavier than usual.""'Bleeding in the brain is rare, and the symptoms of bleeding in the brain may vary in severity.'""A low number of platelets doesn't cause ""'pain'', ''fatigue'' (''tiredness''), problems concentrating, or any other symptoms.'

How Is Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Diagnosed (ITP)?,"'Your doctor will diagnose idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.'""Your doctor will want to make sure that your low platelet count isn't due to another condition (such as an infection) or a side effect of medicines you're taking (such as ""'chemotherapy'' medicines or ''aspirin'').''Your doctor may ask about:''Your doctor will give you a physical exam and look for signs of bleeding and infection. For example, your doctor may look for pinpoint red spots on the skin and bruising or purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes. These are signs of bleeding under the skin.'""You'll likely have blood tests to check your platelets. These tests usually include:""'You also may have a blood test to check for the antibodies that attack platelets.''If blood tests show that you have a low number of platelets, your doctor may recommend more tests to confirm a diagnosis of ITP. For example, bone marrow tests may be used to see whether your bone marrow is making platelets.''Some people who have mild ITP have few or no signs of bleeding. These people may be diagnosed only after a blood test done for another reason shows that they have a low platelet count.' Your signs and symptoms of bleeding and any other signs or symptoms you're having Whether you have illnesses that could lower your platelet count or cause bleeding Medicines or any other over-the-counter supplements or remedies you take that could cause bleeding or lower your platelet count A complete blood count. This test shows the numbers of different kinds of blood cells, including platelets, in a small sample of your blood. In ITP, the red and white blood cell counts are normal. A blood smear. During this test, some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is then used to look at your platelets and other blood cells. In ITP, the number of platelets is lower than normal."
What Are The Treatments For Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""Treatment for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is based on how much and how often you're bleeding and your platelet count. In some cases, treatment may not be needed.""'Medicines often are used as the first course of treatment. Treatments used for children and adults are similar.''Adults who have milder cases of ITP may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts. However, adults with ITP who have very low platelet counts or problems with bleeding are treated. ''The acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months and requires no treatment. Children who have milder cases of ITP may not need treatment other than monitoring and followup to make sure platelet counts return to normal. Children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), are treated.''If ITP needs to be treated, medicines often are tried first. ''Corticosteroids'' (cor-ti-co-STEER-roids), such as ''prednisone'', are commonly used to treat ITP.''These medicines, called steroids for short, help increase your platelet count by lowering the activity of your immune system. However, steroids have a number of side effects, and some people relapse (get worse) when treatment ends.'""The steroids used to treat ITP are different from illegal steroids taken by some athletes to enhance performance. Corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them for many years.""'Some medicines used to help raise the platelet count are given through a needle inserted into a vein. These medicines include immune globulin and anti-Rh (D) immunoglobulin. The monoclonal antibody ''rituximab'' is also often used for treatment of ITP.''Medicines also may be used along with a procedure to remove the spleen, called splenectomy (splee-NECK-tuh-mee).'""If steroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy don't help, two newer medicines—eltrombopag and romiplostim—can be used to treat ITP.""'If necessary, the spleen will be removed surgically. This organ is located in the upper left abdomen. The spleen is about the size of a golf ball in children and a baseball in adults.''The spleen makes antibodies (proteins) that help fight infection. In ITP, these antibodies destroy platelets.'""If ITP hasn't responded to steroids, removing the spleen will reduce the destruction of platelets. However, it also may make you more likely to get certain infections. Before you have the surgery, your doctor may give you vaccines to help prevent these infections.""'If your spleen is removed, your doctor will explain what steps you can take to help avoid infections and what symptoms that should be reported to your physician.''Some people with ITP who have severe bleeding may need to have platelet transfusions and be hospitalized. Some people will need a platelet transfusion before having surgery. However, most people with ITPdo not need platelet transfusions.'""For a platelet transfusion, donor platelets from a blood bank are injected into the recipient's bloodstream. This increases the platelet count for a short time.""""Some infections can briefly lower a person's platelet count. If a person who has ITP has an infection that can lower his or her platelet count, treating the infection may help increase the platelet count and reduce bleeding problems.""'If a person who has ITP is taking medicine that can lower his or her platelet count or cause bleeding, stopping the medicine can sometimes help increase the platelet count or prevent bleeding.''For example, aspirin and ''ibuprofen'' are common medicines that increase the chance of bleeding. If you have ITP, your doctor may suggest that you avoid these medicines.' "
How Can Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Be Prevented?,"""You can't prevent idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but you can prevent its complications."" Talk to your doctor about which medicines you can take. Your doctor may advise you to avoid medicines such as aspirin or ibuprofen that can affect your platelets and increase your risk of bleeding. Protect yourself from injuries that can cause bruising or bleeding. Seek treatment right away if you develop any infections. Report any symptoms of infection, such as a fever, to your doctor. This is very important for people with ITP who have had their spleens removed."
Living with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP),"'If you have idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), you can take steps to prevent complications. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition.'""If you have ITP, try to avoid injuries, especially head injuries, that can cause bleeding in the brain. For example, don't participate in contact sports such as boxing, football, or karate. Other sports, such as skiing or horseback riding, also put you at risk for injuries that can cause bleeding.""'Some safe activities are ''swimming'' and ''walking''. Ask your doctor about physical activities that are safe for you.''Take precautions such as regular use of seatbelts and wearing gloves when working with knives and other tools.'""If your child has ITP, ask his or her doctor whether you need to restrict your child's activities.""'Find a doctor, preferably a hematologist, who is familiar with treating people who have ITP. Hematologists are doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and disorders. Discuss with your doctor how to manage ITP and when to seek medical care.''Talk to your doctor before taking prescription and over-the-counter medicines and nutritional ''supplements''. Some medicines and supplements can affect platelets and increase your chance of bleeding. Common examples are aspirin or ibuprofen.''Tell your doctor about all of the over-the-counter medicines you take, including ''vitamins'', supplements, and herbal remedies. These products may contain substances that increase your risk of bleeding.''Watch for symptoms of infection, such as a ''fever'"", and report them to your doctor promptly. If you've had your spleen removed, you may be more likely to become ill from certain types of infection.""'In women who are ''pregnant'"" and have ITP, the ITP usually doesn't affect the baby. However, some ""'babies'' born to mothers who have ITP are born with or develop low numbers of platelets soon after birth.''Their platelet counts almost always return to normal without any treatment. Treatment can speed the recovery in the very few babies whose platelet counts remain very low.''Treatment for ITP during ''pregnancy'"" depends on a woman's platelet count. If treatment is needed, the doctor will take a close look at the possible effects of the treatment on the unborn baby.""'Women who have milder cases of ITP usually can go through pregnancy without treatment. Pregnant women who have very low platelet counts or a lot of bleeding are more likely to have serious heavy bleeding during delivery or afterward. To prevent serious bleeding, these women usually are treated.' "
What Is The Outlook For Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""For most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition.""""Acute ITP in children often goes away on its own within a few weeks or months and doesn't return. In most children who have ITP, the platelet count returns to normal within 6 months. Treatment may not be needed.""""A small number of children, about 5 percent, whose ITP doesn't go away on its own may need to have further medical or surgical treatment.""'Chronic ITP will vary with each individual and can last for many years. Even people who have severe forms of chronic ITP can live for decades. Most people who have chronic ITP are able at some point to stop treatment and keep a safe platelet count.' "

What is a blood clot?,"'Blood clots'' are clumps of blood formed when the blood changes from a fluid to a semisolid form. Whenever you get a cut in your skin, your blood normally clots to prevent further blood loss from your body. However, when the blood clots inside your blood vessels (arteries and veins), it may lead to many medical conditions.''When a ''blood clot'' is formed in one of the large veins in the legs or arms, the condition is called ''deep vein thrombosis'' (''DVT'').' "
What are risk factors for getting a blood clot in the leg?,"'Risk factors for blood clots in the leg include:' Pregnancy Prolonged hospitalization Confinement to the bed or a wheelchair Surgery Cancer Contraceptives or birth-control medications containing estrogen Age, especially 65 years and older Overweight or obese individuals Smoking Inactive or sedentary lifestyle Estrogen-containing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Family history of DVT or blood clots Severe injury, especially if it involves a vein Chronic diseases, such as heart and lung conditions and diabetes"
What happens if you have a deep vein blood clot in your leg?," A blot clot in your leg can hamper the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the affected area. An untreated DVT may cause the clot to grow bigger and break in small pieces that can travel to other organs, such as the heart and lungs, causing serious consequences. The sluggish flow or stasis of blood in the affected area makes it more prone to infection. If the infection and the clot are not treated, they can cause the death of the tissues."
How do you know if you have a blood clot in your leg?,"'If you have a ''blood clot'' in your leg, you may notice:' Swelling of the affected leg Pain Reddish or bluish color of the skin The affected area is warm to touch Cramps Difficulty in walking If there is an associated infection, there may be other symptoms such as fever and shivering If the clot has broken and traveled to other organs, there might be symptoms related to the target organ, such as chest pain, difficulty in breathing, nausea, vomiting, confusion, fainting, and/or headache"
What is the treatment of blood clots in the leg?,"'Treatment options for a ''blood clot in the leg'' include:' Anticoagulation medicines (blood thinners): These slow the process of formation of new clots and prevent the already formed ones from getting bigger. Blood thinners include:Unfractionated heparin (UFH)Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)WarfarinDirect oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications Unfractionated heparin (UFH) Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) Warfarin Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications Thrombolytic therapy to dissolve the existing clots. Compression stockings. Surgery. Vena cava filters to prevent the spread of the clots to other body parts. Implantable devices. Management of risk factors, such as cessation of smoking, weight control and regular exercises."
How can you prevent having a blood clot in your leg?," Adopt an active lifestyle with regular exercises. Maintain a healthy weight. Discuss with your doctor if you have any risk factors for blood clots. Quit smoking. Start a healthy diet. Before any surgery, talk with your doctor about blood clots. Recognize your symptoms and contact your doctor if you develop symptoms. Take a break to stand up and move around every two hours when traveling on a plane, train or car."
Crohn's Disease Fast Facts," Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal (digestive, GI) tract. Symptoms of Crohn’s disease include:Abdominal painDiarrheaVomitingFeverBloody diarrheaAnal fistulaePerirectal abscessesWeight loss Abdominal pain Diarrhea Vomiting Fever Bloody diarrhea Anal fistulae Perirectal abscesses Weight loss The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. Crohn’s disease is not contagious. You cannot “get” it from another person. Diet can affect and trigger Crohn’s disease flare-ups; however, it is doubtful that diet causes the disease. Researchers and doctors do not know the cause of Crohn’s disease; however, some suspect that the cause is due to certain bacteria, for example, mycobacterium. Crohn's disease can cause ulcers in the small intestine, colon, or both. The disease also may cause obstruction of the small intestine. Associated sign and symptoms of Crohn's disease include reddish, tender skin nodules, and inflammation of the joints, spine, eyes, and liver. Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (another chronic inflammatory condition of the colon) are a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The diagnosis of Crohn's disease is made by barium enema, barium X-ray of the small bowel, and colonoscopy. The choice of treatment for Crohn's disease depends on the location and severity of the disease. Treatment of Crohn's disease includes 5-ASA compounds and corticosteroids, topical antibiotics, immunomodulators, and biosimilars drugs for suppressing inflammation or the immune system; antibiotics, and surgery. Complications of Crohn’s disease include megacolon and rupture of the intestine, painful eye conditions, arthritis, inflammation of the low back and spine, hepatitis, cirrhosis, jaundice, and cancer. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are two different problems with the digestive tract (gastrointestinal, GI)."
What is Crohn's disease?,"""Crohn's disease (sometimes called Crohn disease) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the ""'intestines''. It primarily causes ulcerations (breaks in the mucosal lining) of the small and large intestines, but can affect the ''digestive system'' anywhere from the mouth to the anus. It is named after the physician who described the disease in 1932. It also is called granulomatous enteritis or ''colitis'', regional enteritis, ileitis, or terminal ileitis.'""Crohn's disease is related closely to another chronic inflammatory condition that involves only the colon called ""'ulcerative colitis'"". Together, Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis'' are referred to as ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD'""). Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have no medical cure. Once the diseases begin, they tend to fluctuate between periods of inactivity (remission) and activity (relapse).""'Men and women are affected equally by ''inflammatory bowel'"" disease. Americans of Jewish European descent are more likely to develop IBD than the general population. IBD has historically been considered predominately a disease of Caucasians, but there has been an increase in the reported cases in African Americans. The prevalence appears to be lower among Hispanic and Asian populations. IBD most commonly begins during adolescence and early adulthood (usually between the ages of 15 and 35). There is a small second peak of newly diagnosed cases after age 50. The number of new cases (incidence) and number of cases (prevalence) of Crohn's disease in the United States are rising, although the reason for this is not completely understood.""""Crohn's disease tends to be more common in relatives of patients with Crohn's disease. If a person has a relative with the disease, his/her risk of developing the disease is estimated to be at least 10 times that of the general population and 30 times greater if the relative with Crohn's disease is a sibling. It also is more common among relatives of patients with ulcerative colitis."" "
"What are the types, symptoms, and signs of Crohn's disease?","""Common symptoms of Crohn's disease include ""'abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', and ''weight loss''. Less common symptoms include'""The symptoms of Crohn's disease are dependent on the location, the extent, and the severity of the inflammation. The different subtypes of Crohn's disease and their symptoms are:""""Up to one-third of patients with Crohn's disease may have one or more of these\xa0conditions, symptoms, and signs\xa0that involve the anal area affected.""   poor appetite, fever, night sweats, rectal pain, and occasionally rectal bleeding. Crohn's colitis is inflammation that is confined to the colon. Abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea are the common symptoms. Anal fistulae and perirectal abscesses also can occur. Crohn's enteritis refers to inflammation confined to the small intestine (the second part, called the jejunum or the third part, called the ileum). Involvement of the ileum alone is referred to as Crohn's ileitis. Abdominal pain and diarrhea are the common symptoms. Obstruction of the small intestine also can occur. Crohn's terminal ileitis is inflammation that affects only the very end of the small intestine (terminal ileum), the part of the small intestine closest to the colon. Abdominal pain and diarrhea are the common symptoms. Small intestinal obstruction also can occur. Crohn's enterocolitis and ileocolitis are terms to describe inflammation that involve both the small intestine and the colon. Bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain are the common symptoms. Small intestinal obstruction also can occur. Crohn's terminal ileitis and ileocolitis are the most common types of Crohn's disease. (Ulcerative colitis frequently involves only the rectum or rectum and sigmoid colon at the distal end of the colon. These are called ulcerative proctitis and procto-sigmoiditis, respectively.) Swelling of the tissue of the anal sphincter, the muscle at the end of the colon that controls defecation. Development of ulcers and fissures (long ulcers) within the anal sphincter. These ulcers and fissures can cause bleeding and pain with defecation. Development of anal fistulae (abnormal tunnels) between the anus or rectum and the skin surrounding the anus). Mucous and pus may drain from the openings of the fistulae on the skin. Development of perirectal abscesses (collections of pus in the anal and rectal area). Peri-rectal abscesses can cause fever, pain and tenderness around the anus."
What causes Crohn's disease?,"""The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. Some scientists suspect that infection by certain bacteria, such as ""'strains'"" of mycobacterium, may be the cause of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is not contagious. Diet may affect the symptoms of Crohn's disease; however, it is unlikely that diet is responsible for causing the disease.""'Activation of the immune system in the intestines appears to be important in IBD. The immune system is composed of immune cells and the proteins that these immune cells produce. Normally, these cells and proteins defend the body against harmful bacteria, ''viruses'', fungi, and other foreign invaders. Activation of the immune system causes inflammation within the tissues where the activation occurs. (Inflammation is an important mechanism of defense used by the immune system.)''Normally, the immune system is activated only when the body is exposed to harmful invaders. In individuals with IBD the immune system is abnormally and chronically activated in the absence of any known invader. This results in chronic inflammation and ulceration. The susceptibility to abnormal activation of the immune system is genetically ''inherited'"". Thus, first degree relatives (brothers, sisters, children, and parents) of people with IBD are more likely to develop these diseases. Recently a gene called NOD2 has been identified as being associated with Crohn's disease. This gene is important in determining how the body responds to some bacterial products. Individuals with mutations in this gene are more susceptible to developing Crohn's disease.""""Other genes are still being discovered and studied which are important in understanding the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease including autophagy related 16-like 1 gene (ATG 16L1) and IRGM, which both contribute to macrophage defects and have been identified with the Genome-Wide Association study. There also have been studies which show that in the intestines of individuals with Crohn's disease, there are higher levels of a certain type of bacterium, ""'E. coli'', which might play a role in the disease. One postulated mechanism by which this could occur is through a genetically determined'' ''defect in the elimination of the ''E. coli'', by intestinal mucosal macrophages. The exact roles that these various factors play in the development of this disease remain unclear.' "
What are the differences between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis?,"""While ulcerative colitis causes inflammation only in the colon (colitis) and/or the rectum (proctitis), Crohn's disease may cause inflammation in the colon, rectum, small intestine (jejunum and ileum), and, occasionally, even the stomach, mouth, and ""'esophagus''.'""The patterns of inflammation in Crohn's disease are different from ulcerative colitis. Except in the most severe cases, the inflammation of ulcerative colitis tends to involve the superficial layers of the inner lining of the bowel. The inflammation also tends to be diffuse and uniform (all of the lining in the affected segment of the intestine is inflamed).""""Unlike ulcerative colitis, the inflammation of Crohn's disease is concentrated in some areas more than others, and involves layers of the bowel that are deeper than the superficial inner layers. The affected segment(s) of bowel in Crohn's disease often is studded with deeper ulcers with normal lining between these ulcers."" "
How does Crohn's disease affect the intestines?,"""In the early stages, Crohn's disease causes small, scattered, shallow, crater-like ulcerations (erosions) on the inner surface of the bowel. These erosions are called aphthous ulcers. With time, the erosions become deeper and larger, ultimately becoming true ulcers (which are deeper than erosions), and causing scarring and ""'stiffness'' of the bowel. As the disease progresses, the bowel becomes increasingly narrowed, and ultimately can become obstructed. Deep ulcers can cause puncture holes or perforations in the wall of the bowel, and bacteria from within the bowel can spread to infect adjacent organs and the surrounding abdominal ''cavity''.'""When Crohn's disease ""'narrows the small intestine'' to the point of obstruction, the flow of the contents through the intestine ceases. Sometimes, the obstruction can be caused suddenly by poorly digestible fruit or vegetable matter that plug the already-narrowed segment of the intestine. When the intestine is obstructed, food, fluid and ''gas'' from the stomach and the small intestine cannot pass into the colon. The symptoms of small intestinal obstruction then appear, including severe abdominal ''cramps'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and abdominal distention. Obstruction of the small intestine is much more likely since the small intestine is much narrower than the colon.''Deep ulcers'' can cause puncture holes or perforations in the walls of the small intestine and the colon, and create a tunnel between the intestine and adjacent organs. If the ulcer tunnel reaches an adjacent empty space inside the abdominal ''cavity'', a collection of infected pus (an abdominal ''abscess'') is formed. Individuals with abdominal abscesses can develop tender abdominal masses, high ''fevers'', and abdominal pain.' When the ulcer tunnels into an adjacent organ, a channel (fistula) is formed. The formation of a fistula between the intestine and the bladder (enteric-vesicular fistula) can cause frequent urinary tract infections and the passage of gas and feces during urination. When a fistula develops between the intestine and the skin (enteric-cutaneous fistula), pus and mucous emerge from a small painful opening on the skin of the abdomen. The development of a fistula between the colon and the vagina (colonic-vaginal fistula) causes gas and feces to emerge through the vagina. The presence of a fistula from the intestines to the anus (anal fistula) leads to a discharge of mucous and pus from the fistula's opening around the anus."
What procedures and tests diagnose Crohn's disease?,"""There is no specific diagnostic test for Crohn’s disease. The diagnosis of Crohn's disease is suspected in patients with fever, abdominal pain and tenderness, diarrhea with or without bleeding, and anal diseases, such as ulcers or fissures.""'Laboratory blood tests ''may show elevated white blood cell counts and sedimentation rates, both of which suggest infection or inflammation. Other blood tests may show low red blood cell counts (''anemia''), low blood proteins, and low body ''minerals'', reflecting loss of these minerals due to chronic diarrhea.''Barium X-ray studies'' can be used to define the distribution, nature, and severity of the disease. Barium is a chalky material that is visible by X-ray and appears white on X-ray films. When barium is ingested orally (''upper GI series'') it fills the intestine, and pictures (''X-rays'') can be taken of the stomach and the small intestines. When barium is administered through the rectum (barium enema), pictures of the colon and the terminal ileum can be obtained. Barium X-rays can show ulcerations, narrowing, and, sometimes, fistulae of the bowel.''Direct visualization of the rectum'' and the ''large intestine'"" can be accomplished with flexible viewing tubes (colonoscopes). Colonoscopy is more accurate than barium X-rays in detecting small ulcers or small areas of inflammation of the colon and terminal ileum. Colonoscopy also allows for small tissue samples (biopsies) to be taken and sent for examination under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Colonoscopy also is more accurate than barium X-rays in assessing the degree (activity) of inflammation.""'Computerized axial tomography (CAT or CT) s''canning is a computerized X-ray technique that allows imaging of the entire abdomen and pelvis. It can be especially helpful in detecting abscesses. CT and ''MRI'"" enterography are imaging techniques which use oral contrast agents consisting of watery solutions with or without low concentrations of barium to provide more adequate luminal distension, have been reported to be superior in the evaluation of small bowel pathology in patients with Crohn's disease.""'Video ''capsule endoscopy'' (VCE) '""has also been added to the list of tests for diagnosing Crohn's disease. For video capsule ""'endoscopy'"", a capsule containing a miniature video camera is swallowed. As the capsule travels through the small intestine, it sends video images of the lining of the small intestine to a receiver carried on a belt at the waist. The images are downloaded and then reviewed on a computer. The value of video capsule endoscopy is that it can identify the early, mild abnormalities of Crohn's disease. Video capsule endoscopy may be particularly useful when there is a strong suspicion of Crohn's disease but the barium X-rays are normal. (Barium X-rays are not as good at identifying early, mild Crohn's disease.) In a prospective blinded evaluation, video capsule endoscopy was demonstrated to be superior in its ability to detect small bowel pathology missed on small bowel radiographic studies and CT exams.""'Video capsule endoscopy'' should not be performed in patients who have an obstruction of the small intestine. The capsule may become stuck at the site of obstruction and make the obstruction worse. Doctors usually also are reluctant to perform video-capsule endoscopy for the same reason in patients whom they suspect of having small intestinal strictures (narrowed segments of small intestine that can result from prior surgery, prior ''radiation'"", or chronic ulceration, for example, from Crohn's disease). There is also a theoretical concern for electrical interference between the capsule and implanted cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators; however, so far in a small-moderate number of patients with pacemakers or defibrillators who have undergone video capsule endoscopy, there have been no problems."" "
"Is there a Crohn's disease diet plan, and what vaccinations are recommended?","""Other factors that may affect Crohn's disease""'A study found that ''smoking'"" is a risk factor for Crohn's disease, and ""'secondhand smoke'' also can contribute to a worse prognosis. Quitting ''smoking'"" should be advised to patients with Crohn's disease.""'Osteoporosis'' with markedly reduced bone mineral densities has also increasingly been recognized as a significant health problem in patients with ''inflammatory bowel'' disease. Screening with a ''bone density'' study is recommended in ''postmenopausal'' woman, men over age 50, patients with prolonged ''corticosteroid'' use (more than 3 consecutive months or recurrent courses), patients with personal history of traumatic ''fractures'' with minimal ''trauma'', and patients with hypogonadism. Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease should be taking calcium and ''vitamin D'' ''supplements''.'   Since fiber is poorly digestible, it can worsen the symptoms of intestinal obstruction. A low fiber diet for Crohn's diease may be recommended, especially in those patients with small intestinal disease. A liquid diet may be of benefit when symptoms are more severe. Intravenous nutrition or TPN (total parenteral nutrition) may be utilized when it is felt that the intestine needs to ""rest."" Supplementation of calcium, folate and vitamin B12 is helpful when malabsorption of these nutrients is apparent. The use of anti-diarrheal agents (diphenoxylate and atropine [Lomotil], loperamide [Imodium]) and antispasmodics also can help relieve symptoms of cramps and diarrhea. Adults with inflammatory bowel disease generally should follow the same vaccination schedules as the general population. They should receive a single dose of Tdap, then Td booster every 10 years. Women between the ages of 9 and 26 should receive 3 doses of HPV vaccine (and consideration should be given to older patients who are HPV negative on Pap smear). Men in the same age range should also consider being vaccinated given the increased risk of HPV with immunosuppression. The influenza (flu) vaccine should be given annually to all patients (though the live intranasal vaccine is contraindicated in patients on immunosuppressive therapy). One dose of pneumococcal vaccine should be given between age 19-26 and then revaccination after 5 years. If not previously vaccinated, all adults should receive 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine and 3 doses of hepatitis B. Meningococcal vaccine is only recommended for patients with anatomic or functional asplenia, terminal complement deficiencies, or others at higher risk (college students, military recruits, etc.). Mumps/measles/rubella, varicella, and zoster vaccines are contraindicated for patients on biologic therapy, as they are all live vaccines."
"What medications, vitamins, and supplements treat and manage Crohn's disease?","""There is no medication that can cure Crohn's disease.""   Patients with Crohn's disease typically will experience flares, or periods of relapse (worsening of inflammation) followed by periods of remission (lessening of inflammation) lasting months to years. During relapses, symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding worsen. During remissions, these symptoms improve. Remissions usually occur because of treatment with medications or surgery, but occasionally they occur spontaneously without any treatment. Since there is no cure for Crohn's disease, the goals of treatment are to 1) induce remissions, 2) maintain remissions, 3) minimize the side effects of treatment, and 4) improve the quality of life. Treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with medications is similar though not always identical. Anti-inflammatory agents such as 5-ASA compounds and corticosteroids, topical antibiotics, immunomodulators, and biosimilars are medications used to treat Crohn’s disease. Selection of treatment regimens depends on disease severity, disease location, and disease-associated complications. Various treatment guidelines recommend that approaches be sequential -- initially to induce clinical remission, and then to maintain remissions. Initial evidence of improvement should be seen within 2 to 4 weeks, and maximal improvement should be seen in 12 to 16 weeks. The classic approach to therapy in Crohn's disease has been a ""step-up"" approach starting with the least toxic agents for mild disease, and increasingly more aggressive treatment for more severe disease, or patients who have not responded to less toxic agents. Treatment has been moving toward a ""top-down"" approach (early aggressive management) which might decrease exposure to anti-inflammatory agents and increase exposure to agents that enhance mucosal healing that might prevent future complications."
What are anti-inflammatory medications and their side effects?,"'Anti-inflammatory medications that decrease intestinal inflammation are similar to arthritis medications that decrease ''joint inflammation'"". Examples of types of anti-inflammatory medications used in the treatment of Crohn's disease are:""   5 aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, for example, sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) and mesalamine (Pentasa, Asacol, Dipentum, Colazal, Rowasa enema, Canasa suppository). Corticosteroids that act systemically (without the need for direct contact with the inflamed tissue) to decrease inflammation throughout the body. Systemic corticosteroids have important and predictable side effects if used long-term. Topical corticosteroids, for example, budesonide (Entocort EC). This class of corticosteroids has fewer side effects than systemic corticosteroids, which are absorbed into the body. Antibiotics that decrease inflammation, for example, metronidazole (Flagyl) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro)."
What are 5-ASA oral and rectal medications and their side effects?,"'5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), also called mesalamine, is similar chemically to ''aspirin''. Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug that has been used for many years for treating arthritis, ''bursitis'"", and tendonitis (conditions of tissue inflammation). Aspirin, however, is not effective in treating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and may even worsen the inflammation. Recent studies suggest that aspirin might actually decrease future risk of developing ""'colorectal cancer'' in the general population.'""On the other hand, 5-ASA can be effective in treating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis if the drug can be delivered topically onto the inflamed intestinal lining. For example, mesalamine (Rowasa) is an enema containing 5-ASA that is effective in treating inflammation in the rectum. However, the enema solution cannot reach high enough to treat inflammation in the upper colon and the small intestine. Therefore, most patients with Crohn's disease involving both the ileum (distal small intestine) and colon, must take 5-ASA orally.""""If pure 5-ASA is taken orally, however, most of the 5-ASA would be absorbed in the stomach and the upper small intestine, and very little 5-ASA would reach the ileum and colon. To be effective as an oral agent in treating Crohn's disease, 5-ASA has to be modified chemically to escape absorption by the stomach and the upper intestines.""""Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) was the first modified 5-ASA compound used in the treatment of Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis. It has been used successfully for many years to induce remissions among patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine also has been used for prolonged periods for maintaining remissions.""'Most of the side effects of sulfasalazine include ''nausea'', ''heartburn'', ''headache'', ''anemia'', skin ''rashes'', and, in rare instances, ''hepatitis'' and kidney inflammation. In men, sulfasalazine can reduce the sperm count. The reduction in sperm count is reversible, and the count usually becomes normal after the sulfasalazine is discontinued or changed to a different 5- ASA compound.'""Some 5-ASA compounds, for example, mesalamine (Asacol and Pentasa), do not have the sulfapyridine component and have fewer side effects than sulfasalazine, and are used more frequently for treating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.""""Asacol is effective in inducing remissions in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. It also is effective when used in the longer term to maintain remissions. Some studies have shown that Asacol also is effective in treating Crohn's ileitis and ileo-colitis, as well as in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease.""""Pentasa is a capsule consisting of small spheres containing 5-ASA. Pentasa is sulfa-free. As the capsule travels down the intestines, the 5-ASA inside the spheres is released slowly into the intestine. Unlike Asacol, the active drug 5-ASA in Pentasa is released into the small intestine as well as the colon. Pentasa can be effective in treating inflammation in the small intestine and is currently the most commonly used 5-ASA compound for treating mild to moderate Crohn's disease in the small intestine.""""Patients with Crohn's disease occasionally undergo surgery to relieve small intestinal obstruction, drain abscesses, or remove fistulae. Usually, the diseased portions of the intestines are removed during surgery. After successful surgery, patients can be free of disease and symptoms (in remission) for a while. In many patients, however, Crohn's disease eventually returns. Pentasa helps maintain remissions and reduces the chances of the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery.""'Olsalazine'' (Dipentum) is a capsule filled with a drug in which two molecules of 5-ASA are joined together by a chemical bond. In this form, the 5-ASA cannot be absorbed from the stomach and intestine. Intestinal bacteria are able to break apart the two molecules releasing the active individual 5-ASA molecules into the intestine. Since intestinal bacteria are more abundant in the ileum and colon, most of the active 5-ASA is released in these areas. Therefore, olsalazine is most effective for disease that is limited to the ileum or colon. Although clinical studies have shown that olsalazine is effective for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis, some patients experience diarrhea when taking olsalazine. Because of this, olsalazine is not often used.''Balsalazide (Colazal) is a capsule in which the 5-ASA is linked by a chemical bond to another molecule that is inert (without an effect on the intestine) and prevents the 5-ASA from being absorbed. This drug is able to travel through the intestine unchanged until it reaches the end of the small bowel (terminal ileum) and colon. There, intestinal bacteria split the 5-ASA and the inert molecule releasing the 5-ASA. Because intestinal bacteria are most abundant in the terminal ileum and colon, balsalazide is used to treat inflammation predominantly localized to the colon.' The 5-ASA compounds have fewer side effects than Azulfidine and do not reduce sperm counts. They are safe medications for long-term use and are well-tolerated. Patients allergic to aspirin should avoid 5-ASA compounds because they are similar chemically to aspirin. Rarely, kidney and lung inflammation has been reported with the use of 5-ASA compounds. 5-ASA should be used with caution in patients with kidney disease. It also is recommended that blood tests of kidney function be done before starting and periodically during treatment. Rare instances of worsening of diarrhea, cramps, and abdominal pain, at times accompanied by fever, rash, and malaise, may occur. This reaction is believed to represent an allergy to the 5-ASA compound."
"What are 5-ASA rectal medications (Rowasa, Canasa) and their side effects?","""Rowasa is 5-ASA in enema form and is used in treating Crohn's disease in which there is inflammation in and near the rectum. The enema usually is administered at bedtime, and patients are encouraged to retain the enema through the night. The enema contains sulfite and should not be used by patients with sulfite ""'allergy''. Otherwise, Rowasa enemas are safe and well tolerated.''Both enemas and suppositories have been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis limited to the distal colon and rectum.'

What are corticosteroids and their side effects?,"'Corticosteroids (for example, ''prednisone'', ''prednisolone'"", hydrocortisone, etc.) have been used for many years to treat patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and to treat patients who fail to respond to 5-ASA. Unlike 5-ASA, corticosteroids do not require direct contact with the inflamed intestinal tissues to be effective.""""Oral corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory medications. After absorption, corticosteroids exert prompt anti-inflammatory actions throughout the body, including the intestines. Consequently, they are used in treating Crohn's disease anywhere in the small intestine, as well as ulcerative and Crohn's colitis. In critically ill patients, intravenous corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone) can be given in the hospital. For patients with proctitis, hydrocortisone enemas (""'Cortenema'') can be used to deliver the corticosteroid directly to the inflamed tissue. By using the corticosteroid topically, less of it is absorbed into the body and the frequency and severity of side effects are lessened (but not eliminated) as compared with systemic corticosteroids.'""Corticosteroids are faster-acting than 5-ASA, and patients frequently experience improvement in their symptoms within days of beginning them. Corticosteroids, however, do not appear to be useful in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis or in preventing the return of Crohn's disease after surgery.""'The frequency and severity of side effects of corticosteroids depend on the dose and duration of their use. Short courses of corticosteroids usually are well tolerated with few and mild side effects. Examples of side effects of short-course corticosteroids include''Children receiving corticosteroids experience stunted growth.''Long-term use of high doses of corticosteroids usually produces predictable and potentially serious side effects for example, stunted growth in children, ''aseptic necrosis'' of the hip joints, and ''osteoporosis''.'""Budesonide (Entocort EC) is another form of corticosteroid used for treating Crohn's disease. Like the systemic corticosteroids, budesonide is a potent anti-inflammatory medication. Unlike systemic corticosteroids, budesonide acts only via direct contact with the inflamed tissues (topically) and not systemically.""""Budesonide capsules contain granules that allow a slow release of the drug into the ileum and the colon. In a double-blind multicenter study (published in 1998), 182 patients with Crohn's ileitis and/or Crohn's disease of the right colon were treated with either budesonide (9 mg daily) or Pentasa (2 grams twice daily). Budesonide was more effective than Pentasa in inducing remissions while the side effects were similar to Pentasa. In another study comparing the effectiveness of budesonide with corticosteroids, budesonide was not better than systemic corticosteroids in treating Crohn's disease but had fewer side effects.""'Because budesonide is broken down by the liver into inactive chemicals, it has fewer side effects than systemic corticosteroids. It also suppresses the adrenal glands less than systemic corticosteroids. Budesonide also is available as an enema for the treatment of proctitis.'""Budesonide has not been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. If used long-term, budesonide also may cause some of the same side effects as corticosteroids. Because of this, the use of budesonide should be limited to short-term treatment for inducing remission. As most budesonide is released in the terminal ileum, it will have its best results in Crohn's disease limited to the terminal ileum."" rounding of the face (moon face), acne, increased body hair, diabetes, weight gain, high blood pressure, cataracts, glaucoma, increased susceptibility to infections, muscle weakness, depression, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, irritability, and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) with fractures of the spine."
What antibiotics treat Crohn's disease and what are their side effects?,"""Antibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro) have been used for treating Crohn's colitis. Flagyl also has been useful in treating anal fistulae in patients with Crohn's disease. The mechanism of action of these antibiotics in Crohn's disease is not well understood.""'Metronidazole (Flagyl) is an antibiotic that is used for treating several infections caused by parasites (for example, ''giardia'"") and bacteria (for example, infections caused by anaerobic bacteria, and vaginal infections). It might have some activity in the treatment of Crohn's colitis and is particularly useful in treating patients with anal fistulae. Chronic use of metronidazole in doses higher than 1 gram daily can be associated with permanent nerve damage (""'peripheral neuropathy''). The early ''symptoms of peripheral neuropathy'' are numbness and tingling in the fingertips, toes, and other parts of the extremities. Metronidazole should be stopped promptly if these symptoms appear. Metronidazole and ''alcohol'' together can cause severe nausea, vomiting, cramps, flushing, and ''headache''. Patients taking metronidazole should avoid alcohol. Other side effects of metronidazole include nausea, ''headaches'', ''loss of appetite'', a ''metallic taste'', and, rarely, a ''rash''.'""Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) is another antibiotic used in the treatment of Crohn's disease. It can be used in combination with metronidazole."" "
What are immuno-modulator medications and their side effects?,"""Immuno-modulator drugs decrease tissue inflammation by reducing the population of immune cells and/or by interfering with their production of proteins. Decreasing the activity of the immune system with immuno-modulators increases the risk of infections; however, the benefits of controlling moderate to severe Crohn's disease usually outweigh the risks of infection due to weakened immunity. Examples of immuno-modulators are:"" 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine (Imuran), methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall, MTX, Mexate), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab (Cimzia), and natalizumab (Tysabri)."
"How safe is azathioprine and 6-M, what are TPMT genetics?","'Azathioprine is converted into 6-MP in the body and 6-MP then is partially converted in the body into inactive and non-marrow toxic chemicals by an enzyme called thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). These chemicals then are eliminated from the body. The activity of TPMT enzyme (the ability of the enzyme to convert 6-MP into inactive and non-marrow toxic chemicals) is genetically determined, and approximately 10% of the population in the Untied States has a reduced or absent TPMT activity. In this 10% of patients, 6-MP accumulates and is converted into chemicals that are toxic to the bone marrow where blood cells are produced. Thus, when given normal doses of azathioprine or 6-MP, these patients with reduced or absent TPMT activities can develop seriously low white blood cell counts for prolonged periods of time, exposing them to serious life-threatening infections.''The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends doctors check TPMT levels prior to starting treatment with azathioprine or 6-MP. Patients found to have genes associated with reduced or absent TPMT activity are treated with alternative medications or are prescribed substantially lower than normal doses of 6-MP or azathioprine.''Having normal TPMT genes is no guarantee against azathioprine or 6-MP toxicity. Rarely, a patient with normal TPMT genes can develop severe toxicity in the bone marrow and a low white blood cell count even with normal doses of 6-MP or azathioprine. Also, hepatotoxicity in the presence of normal TPMT levels has been reported. All patients taking 6-MP or azathioprine (regardless of TPMT genetics) have to be closely monitored by periodic blood counts and liver enzyme tests for as long as the medication is taken.''Allopurinol'' (Zyloprim), used in treating high blood uric acids levels, can induce bone marrow toxicity when used together with azathioprine or 6-MP. Allopurinol (Zyloprim) used together with azathioprine or 6-MP has similar effect as having reduced TPMT activity, causing increased accumulation of the 6-MP metabolite that is toxic to the bone marrow.' "
What are 6-MP metabolite levels?,"'In addition to monitoring blood cell counts and ''liver tests'"", doctors also may measure blood levels of the chemicals that are formed from 6-MP (6-MP metabolites), which can be helpful in several situations such as if a patient's disease:""'Patients have been maintained on 6-MP or azathioprine for years without significant long-term side effects. Patients on long-term azathioprine or 6-MP, however, should be closely monitored by their doctors. There are data suggesting that patients on long-term maintenance fare better than those who stop these medications. Thus, those who stop azathioprine or 6-MP are more likely to experience recurrence of their disease and are more likely to need corticosteroids or undergo surgery.' is not responding to standard doses of 6-MP or azathioprine and his/her 6-MP blood metabolite levels are low, doctors may increase the 6-MP or azathioprine dose; is not responding to treatment and his/her 6-MP blood metabolite levels are zero, he/she is not taking his/her medication. The lack of response in this case is due to patient non-compliance."
"What is azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan) and its side effects?","'Azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP, ''Purinethol'"") are medications that weaken the body's immune system by reducing the population of a class of immune cells called lymphocytes. Azathioprine and 6-MP are related chemically. In high doses, these two drugs have been useful in preventing rejection of transplanted organs and in treating ""'leukemia'"". In low doses, they have been used for many years to treat patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.""""Azathioprine and 6-MP are increasingly recognized as valuable drugs in treating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A majority of patients with moderate to severe disease will benefit from these drugs. Azathioprine and 6-MP are used primarily in the following situations:""'Side effects of azathioprine and 6-MP include increased vulnerability to infections, inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) and the pancreas (''pancreatitis''), and bone marrow toxicity (interference with the formation of cells that circulate in the blood).''One problem with 6-MP and azathioprine is their slow onset of action. Typically, full benefit of these drugs is not realized for three months or longer. During this time, corticosteroids frequently have to be maintained at high levels to control inflammation.'""Studies have shown that giving higher doses of 6-MP early can hasten the benefit of 6-MP without increasing the toxicity in most patients, but some patients do develop severe bone marrow toxicity. Scientists now believe that an individual's vulnerability to 6-MP toxicity is genetically inherited. Blood tests can be performed to identify those individuals with increased vulnerability to 6-MP toxicity. Blood tests also can be performed to measure the levels of certain by-products of 6-MP. The levels of these by-products in the blood help doctors to more quickly determine whether the dose of 6-MP is right for the patient."" Severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis not responding to corticosteroids. The presence of undesirable corticosteroid-related side effects. Corticosteroid dependency, a condition in which patients are unable to discontinue corticosteroids without developing relapses of their disease. Maintenance of remission."
What is infliximab (Remicade) and its side effects?,"""Infliximab is approved for the short-term treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease patients who respond inadequately to corticosteroids, azathioprine, or 6-MP.""'Infliximab (Remicade) is an antibody that attaches to a protein called ''tumor'"" necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is one of the proteins produced by immune cells during activation of the immune system. TNF-alpha, in turn, stimulates other cells of the immune system to produce and release other proteins that promote inflammation. In Crohn's disease, there is continued production of TNF-alpha as part of the immune activation. Infliximab, by attaching to TNF-alpha, blocks its activity and in so doing decreases the inflammation.""'Infliximab generally is well tolerated. There have been rare reports of side effects during infusions, including ''chest pain'', ''shortness of breath'', and nausea. These effects usually resolve spontaneously within minutes if the infusion is stopped. Other commonly reported side effects include ''headache'' and ''upper respiratory tract infection''.''TNF-alpha is an important protein for defending the body against infections. Infliximab, like immunomodulators, increases the risk for infection. One case of ''salmonella'' colitis and several cases of ''pneumonia'' have been reported with the use of infliximab. There also have been cases of ''tuberculosis'' (''TB'') reported after the use of infliximab.''More recently, a rare form ''lymphoma'"" called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been described associated with azathioprine therapy for Crohn's disease either alone or in combination with infliximab. Although there is not much known about this disease, it appears to be aggressive and poorly responsive to treatment.""'Because infliximab is partly a mouse protein, it may induce an immune reaction when given to humans, especially with repeated infusions. In addition to the side effects that occur while the infusion is being given, patients also may develop a delayed ''allergic reaction'' that occurs 7 to 10 days after receiving the infliximab. This type of reaction may cause ''flu-like symptoms'' with fever, ''joint pain'"" and swelling, and a worsening of Crohn's disease symptoms. It can be serious, and if it occurs, a physician should be contacted. Paradoxically, those patients who have more frequent infusions of infliximab are less likely to develop this type of delayed reaction compared to those patients who receive infusions separated by long intervals (6-12 months).""'Rare cases of nerve inflammation such as ''optic neuritis'' (inflammation of the nerve of the eye) and motor neuropathy also have been reported with the use of infliximab.''Infliximab can aggravate and cause the spread of an existing infection. It should not be given to patients with ''pneumonia'', ''urinary tract infections'', or abscess (localized collection of pus). It is recommended that patients be tested for ''TB'' prior to receiving infliximab. Patients who previously had TB should inform their physician of this before they receive infliximab. Infliximab also can cause the spread of ''cancer'' cells and it should not be given to patients with ''cancer''.''Infliximab can promote intestinal scarring (part of the process of healing) and can worsen strictures (narrowed areas of the intestine caused by inflammation and subsequent scaring) and lead to intestinal obstruction. It also can cause partial healing (partial closure) of anal fistulae. Partial closure of fistulae impedes drainage of fluid through the fistulae, and may result in collections of fluid in which bacteria multiply, which can result in abscesses.''The effects of infliximab on the fetus are not known, although the literature suggests this medication is safe for women to continue until week 32 of ''pregnancy''. At that time, the risk of exposure of the fetus to this medication via placental transfer is increased. Infliximab is listed as a pregnancy category B drug by the FDA (meaning that animal studies show no increased risk, but there are no human studies).''Because infliximab is partly a mouse protein, some patients can develop antibodies against infliximab with repeated infusions. Such antibodies can decrease the effectiveness of the drug. The chance of developing such antibodies can be decreased by the concomitant use of 6-MP and corticosteroids.''There are some reports of worsening ''heart disease'' in patients who have received infliximab (Remicade). The precise mechanism and role of infliximab in the development of this side effect is unclear. As a precaution, individuals with ''heart disease'' should inform their physician of this condition before receiving infliximab.''The long-term safety and effectiveness is not yet known although recent 10 year data from patients who received at least 1 dose of infliximab for CD showed the safety profile similar to what was previously known. In that data set, the treated patients seemed to have an increased risk of developing infections, infusion reactions, autoimmune reactions, and ''malignancy''.' "
"What are adalimumab (Humira), Cimzia, and Tysabri and their side effects?"," Humira (adalimumab) is used to treat adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Adalimumab (Humira) is an anti-TNF agent similar to infliximab and decreases inflammation by blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha). Adalimumab generally is well tolerated. The most common side effect is skin reactions at the site of injection with swelling, itching, or redness. Other common side effects include upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, and nausea. Serious side effects of Humira include infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, nervous system inflammation, lupus symptoms, worsening heart disease such as heart failure, and rarely, severe allergic reactions with rash, difficulty breathing, and severe low blood pressure or shock. Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) is used for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease in patients who do not respond sufficiently or adequately to standard medical therapy. Certolizumab is generally well-tolerated. Common side effects of Cimzia include runny or stuffy nose, injection site pain or other injection site reaction, upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, or a rash. Serious side effects of Cimzia include possible increase in the risk for serious infections including tuberculosis, worsening of heart failure, and hypersensitivity reactions, for example, angioedema, hives allergic dermatitis, dizziness, shortness of breath, hot flushes, low blood pressure, malaise, and fainting (syncope). Patients experiencing symptoms of severe allergic reactions should seek emergency care immediately. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is a humanized monoclonal antibody to alpha-4 integrin and is effective in treatment of patients with moderate to severe CD and evidence of inflammation who have not responded to aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or TNF inhibitors. Doctors who are registered through the CD TOUCH prescribing program may prescribe this medication to patients. Natalizumab has also been used for some forms of multiple sclerosis. The most common side effects reported include headache, fatigue, upper respiratory infections, and nausea. The most serious adverse events reported have been hypersensitivity, immunosuppression/infections and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
"What are vedolizumab (Entyvio), ustekinumab (Stelara), and methotrexate (Rheumatrex,Trexall) and their side effects?","""Vedolizumab (Entyvio) is a type of monoclonal antibody called an integrin receptor antagonist indicated for adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) or moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) when certain other UC or CD medicines have not worked well enough or cannot be tolerated. Entyvio may help to reduce some symptoms, achieve remission, and reduce or stop the use of corticosteroids. Entyvio works to block the movement of certain gut directed white blood cells into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which helps control inflammation and may reduce the symptoms of UC and CD.""'The most common side effects of Entyvio include ''common cold symptoms'' (runny or stuffy nose, sinus pain, ''sneezing'', ''cough''), headache, joint pain, nausea, fever, infections of the nose and throat, ''tiredness'', ''fatigue'', ''upper respiratory tract infection'', ''bronchitis'', ''flu symptoms'', ''back pain'', rash, ''itching'', ''sinus infection'', ''sore throat'', and pain in your arms or legs.''Serious side effects of Entyvio include infusion reactions, serious allergic reactions, infections, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and liver problems.''Ustekinumab'' (''Stelara'') is a human interleukin-12 and -23 antagonist indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD) who have failed or were intolerant to treatment with immunomodulators or corticosteroids, but never failed a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker; or failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more TNF blockers. Stelara is also used to treat plaque ''psoriasis'' and ''psoriatic arthritis''.''The most common side effects of Stelara include injection site reactions (''bruising'', itching, pain, redness, swelling, and hardening of the skin), ''cold'' symptoms (stuffy nose, sneezing, ''sore throat''), headache, tired feeling, diarrhea, or skin rash or itching.''Serious side effects of Stelara include serious allergic reactions including feeling faint; swelling of your face, eyelids, tongue, or throat; ''chest tightness'', or skin rash.''Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall, MTX) is both an immunomodulator and anti-inflammatory medication. Methotrexate has been used for many years in the treatment of severe ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''psoriasis'"". It has been helpful in treating patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who are either not responding to azathioprine and 6-MP or are intolerant of them. Methotrexate also may be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who are not responding to corticosteroids, azathioprine, or 6-MP.""'One major complication of methotrexate is the development of liver ''cirrhosis'' when the medication is given over a prolonged period of time (years). The risk of liver damage is higher in patients who also abuse alcohol or are severely ''obese''. Other serious side effects of methotrexate include low white blood cell counts and inflammation of the ''lungs''.''Methotrexate should not be used in ''pregnant'' women because of toxic effects on the fetus.' "
What are 5-ASA (mesalamine) oral medications and their side effects?,"""5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), also called mesalamine, is similar chemically to aspirin. Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug that has been used for many years for treating arthritis, bursitis, and tendonitis (conditions of tissue inflammation). Aspirin is not effective in treating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and may even worsen the inflammation. Studies suggest that aspirin might actually decrease future risk of developing ""'colorectal cancer'"" in the general population. On the other hand, 5-ASA can be effective in treating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis if the drug can be delivered topically onto the inflamed intestinal lining."" "
What are biosimilar medications and their side effects?,"'A biosimilar medication is a drug product that is made to be similar to another already-approved drug. It is tested to be the same as its reference drug in terms of clinical uses, effectiveness, and product safety. A biosimilar medication must meet specific strict standards to be approved by the FDA. A biosimilar is not a generic form of a drug. A generic drug contains the same compounds as the original drug, while a biosimilar drug is highly similar to the reference drug, but not identical. Examples of biosimilars are Infliximab-abda (Renflexis) and ''Infliximab-dyyb'' (''Inflectra'').''Infliximab-abda (Renflexis) is biosimilar to infliximab (Remicade).

When is surgery necessary to treat Crohn's disease?,"""There is no surgical cure for Crohn's disease. Even when all of the diseased parts of the intestines are removed, inflammation frequently recurs in previously healthy intestines months to years after the surgery. Surgery in Crohn's disease is used primarily for:""""Usually, after the diseased portions of the intestines are removed surgically, patients can be free of disease and symptoms for some time, often years. When successfully performed, surgery can lead to a marked improvement in a patient's quality of life. In many patients, Crohn's disease eventually returns, affecting previously healthy intestines. The recurrent disease usually is located at or near the site of surgery. In fact, half of patients can expect to have a recurrence of symptoms within four years of surgery. Drugs such as Pentasa or 6-MP have been useful in some patients to reduce the chances of relapse of Crohn's disease after surgery.""""There is accumulating evidence in favor of post-operative therapy to delay recurrence in Crohn's disease. There appears to be some benefit of mesalamine in reducing the risk of post-op recurrence for up to 3 years. A study has shown infliximab to be effective in preventing postoperative recurrence after ileocecal resection, though relapse may occur when therapy is stopped.""'Treatment strategies by severity and location of disease ''(Based on the Second European Evidence-Based Consensus on the Diagnosis and Management of '""Crohn's Disease""'.)' Removal of a diseased segment of the small intestine that is causing obstruction. Drainage of pus from abdominal and perirectal abscesses. Treatment of severe anal fistulae that do not respond to drugs. Resection of internal fistulae (such as a fistula between the colon and bladder) that are causing infections. Commonly treated with oral mesalamine 3.2-4 g daily or sulfasalazine for ileocolonic or colonic disease as 3-6 g daily in divided doses (this approach has more recently been reported to be not very effective). Budesonide (9 mg/day) is effective for disease confined to ileum and/or right colon. Proton pump inhibitors might help with symptomatic improvement in patients with upper gastrointestinal Crohn's disease. Prednisone 40-60 mg/day until resolution of symptoms. Appropriate antibiotic therapy for infection or abscess. Azathioprine and 6-MP are effective for maintaining a steroid-induced remission. Methotrexate 25 mg/wk is effective for steroid-dependent and steroid-refractory Crohn's disease. Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol are effective in the treatment of moderate to severely active disease in patients who have not responded to adequate therapy with a steroid or immunosuppressive agent. Natalizumab is effective in the treatment of patients with moderate to severely active CD who have had an inadequate response or are unable to tolerate conventional Crohn's disease therapy and anti-TNF antibody therapy. Surgical drainage for abscess Otherwise, treated medically with antibiotics (metronidazole), immunosuppressives, or infliximab."
"What are the complications of Crohn's disease, is it fatal??","""Complications of Crohn's disease may be related or unrelated to the inflammation within the intestine.""'Intestinal complications'"" of Crohn's disease include:""'Massive distention or dilatation of the colon (megacolon), and rupture (perforation) of the intestine are potentially fatal complications. '""Both generally require surgery, but, fortunately, these two complications are rare. Recent data suggest that there is an increased risk of cancer of the small intestine and colon in patients with long-standing Crohn's disease.""'Extra-intestinal complications'' involve the skin, joints, spine, eyes, liver, and the bile ducts.''Skin involvement'' includes painful red raised spots on the legs (''erythema nodosum'') and an ulcerating skin condition generally found around the ankles called pyoderma gangrenosum.''Painful ''eye conditions'' (''uveitis'', episcleritis) can cause visual difficulties.''Arthritis'' can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints of the extremities.''Inflammation of the low back'' (sacroiliac joint arthritis) and of the spine (ankylosing spondylitis) can cause pain and stiffness of the spine.''Inflammation of the liver'' (hepatitis) or bile ducts (''primary sclerosing cholangitis'') also can occur. ''Sclerosing cholangitis'' causes narrowing and obstruction of the bile ducts draining the liver and can lead to yellow skin (''jaundice''), recurrent ''bacterial infections'"", and liver cirrhosis with liver failure. Sclerosing cholangitis with liver failure is one of the reasons for performing liver transplantation. It also is frequently complicated by the development of cancer of the bile ducts. Patients with Crohn's disease might also suffer from an increased tendency to form ""'blood clots'' (hypercoagulability).' obstruction and perforation of the small intestine, abscesses (collections of pus),, fistulae, and intestinal bleeding."
"Can Crohn's disease be cured, what is the prognosis?"," There is no cure for Crohn's disease, only treatments for pain and other syptoms. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease involving predominantly the small intestine and colon. The symptoms and the activity of the disease can come and go. Even though many effective medications are available to control the activity of the disease, there is as yet no cure for Crohn's disease. Surgery can significantly improve the quality of life in selected individuals, but recurrence of the disease after surgery is common. Crohn's disease can have complications, both within and outside of the intestine. Newer treatments are actively being evaluated. A better understanding of the role of genetics and environmental factors in the cause of Crohn's disease may lead to improved treatments and prevention of the disease."
What Is Bowel Diversion Surgery?,"'Bowel diversion surgery allows ''stool'' to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the ''large intestine'' is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any part of the small or ''large intestine''.''Some bowel diversion surgeries (those called ostomy surgery)divert the bowel to an opening in the abdomen where a ''stoma'"" is created. A surgeon forms a stoma by rolling the bowel's end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. An ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect ""'stool''.''Other bowel diversion surgeries reconfigure the ''intestines'' after damaged portions are removed. For example, after removing the colon, a surgeon can create a colon like pouch out of the last part of the small intestine, avoiding the need for an ostomy pouch.''Cancer'', ''trauma'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''), bowel obstruction, and ''diverticulitis'' are all possible reasons for bowel diversion surgery.''' "
Which Parts of the Gastrointestinal Tract Are Affected by Bowel Diversion Surgeries?,"'Bowel diversion surgeries affect the large intestine and often the small intestine.''Small Intestine''''The small intestine runs from the stomach to the large intestine and has three main sections: the duodenum, which is the first 10 inches; the jejunum, which is the middle 8 ''feet''; and the ileum, which is the final 12 ''feet''. Bowel diversion surgeries only affect the ileum.''''\xa0''Large Intestine''''The large intestine is about 5 feet long and runs from the small intestine to the anus. The colon and rectum are the two main sections of the large intestine. Semisolid digestive waste enters the colon from the small intestine. Gradually, the colon absorbs moisture and forms stool as digestive waste moves toward the rectum. The rectum is about 6 inches long and is located right before the anus. The rectum stores stool, which leaves the body through the anus. The rectum and anus control bowel movements.' "
What are the different types of bowel diversion surgery?,"'Several surgical options exist for bowel diversion.''Some people only need a temporary bowel diversion; others need permanent bowel diversion.' Ileostomy diverts the ileum to a stoma. Semisolid waste flows out of the stoma and collects in an ostomy pouch, which must be emptied several times a day. An ileostomy bypasses the colon, rectum, and anus and has the fewest complications. Colostomy is similar to an ileostomy, but the colon (not the ileum)is diverted to a stoma. As with an ileostomy, stool collects in an ostomy pouch. Ileoanal reservoir surgery is an option when the large intestine is removed but the anus remains intact and disease-free. The surgeon creates a colonlike pouch, called an ileoanal reservoir, from the last several inches of the ileum. The ileoanal reservoir is also called a pelvic pouch or J-pouch. Stool collects in the ileoanal reservoir and then exits the body through the anus during a bowel movement. People who have undergone ileoanal reservoir surgery initially have about six to 10 bowel movements a day. Two or more surgeries are usually required, including a temporary ileostomy, and an adjustment period lasting several months is needed for the newly formed ileoanal reservoir to stretch and adjust to its new function. After the adjustment period, bowel movements decrease to as few as 4 to 6 a day.

What Is Bowel Diversion Surgery?,"'Bowel diversion surgery allows ''stool'' to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the ''large intestine'' is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any part of the small or ''large intestine''.''Some bowel diversion surgeries (those called ostomy surgery)divert the bowel to an opening in the abdomen where a ''stoma'"" is created. A surgeon forms a stoma by rolling the bowel's end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. An ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect ""'stool''.''Other bowel diversion surgeries reconfigure the ''intestines'' after damaged portions are removed. For example, after removing the colon, a surgeon can create a colon like pouch out of the last part of the small intestine, avoiding the need for an ostomy pouch.''Cancer'', ''trauma'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''), bowel obstruction, and ''diverticulitis'' are all possible reasons for bowel diversion surgery.''' "
Which Parts of the Gastrointestinal Tract Are Affected by Bowel Diversion Surgeries?,"'Bowel diversion surgeries affect the large intestine and often the small intestine.''Small Intestine''''The small intestine runs from the stomach to the large intestine and has three main sections: the duodenum, which is the first 10 inches; the jejunum, which is the middle 8 ''feet''; and the ileum, which is the final 12 ''feet''. Bowel diversion surgeries only affect the ileum.''''\xa0''Large Intestine''''The large intestine is about 5 feet long and runs from the small intestine to the anus. The colon and rectum are the two main sections of the large intestine. Semisolid digestive waste enters the colon from the small intestine. Gradually, the colon absorbs moisture and forms stool as digestive waste moves toward the rectum. The rectum is about 6 inches long and is located right before the anus. The rectum stores stool, which leaves the body through the anus. The rectum and anus control bowel movements.' "
What are the different types of bowel diversion surgery?,"'Several surgical options exist for bowel diversion.''Some people only need a temporary bowel diversion; others need permanent bowel diversion.' Ileostomy diverts the ileum to a stoma. Semisolid waste flows out of the stoma and collects in an ostomy pouch, which must be emptied several times a day. An ileostomy bypasses the colon, rectum, and anus and has the fewest complications. Colostomy is similar to an ileostomy, but the colon (not the ileum)is diverted to a stoma. As with an ileostomy, stool collects in an ostomy pouch. Ileoanal reservoir surgery is an option when the large intestine is removed but the anus remains intact and disease-free. The surgeon creates a colonlike pouch, called an ileoanal reservoir, from the last several inches of the ileum. The ileoanal reservoir is also called a pelvic pouch or J-pouch. Stool collects in the ileoanal reservoir and then exits the body through the anus during a bowel movement. People who have undergone ileoanal reservoir surgery initially have about six to 10 bowel movements a day. Two or more surgeries are usually required, including a temporary ileostomy, and an adjustment period lasting several months is needed for the newly formed ileoanal reservoir to stretch and adjust to its new function. After the adjustment period, bowel movements decrease to as few as 4 to 6 a day. Continent ileostomy is an option for people who are not good candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery because of damage to the rectum or anus but do not want to wear an ostomy pouch. As with ileoanal reservoir surgery, the large intestine is removed and a colon-like pouch, called a Kock pouch, is made from the end of the ileum. The surgeon connects the Kock pouch to a stoma.

What Is Ulcerative Colitis?,"'Ulcerative colitis'' is a chronic (long-term) inflammatory disease. It affects the lining of the ''large intestine'', or colon, and rectum. The rectum is the last section of the colon and is located just above the anus. People with ''ulcerative colitis'' have tiny ulcers and abscesses in their colon and rectum. These flare up periodically and cause bloody stools and ''diarrhea''. ''Ulcerative colitis'' may also cause severe ''abdominal pain'' and ''anemia''. ''Anemia'' is marked by low levels of healthy ''red blood cells''.''Ulcerative ''colitis'' has alternating periods of flare-ups and remission. During remission the disease seems to have disappeared. The periods of remission can last from weeks to years.''The inflammation usually begins in the rectum. It then spreads to other segments of the colon. How much of the colon is affected varies from person to person. If the inflammation is limited to the rectum, the disease is called ulcerative proctitis.' "
"How Is Ulcerative Colitis Diagnosed?
","'Ulcerative colitis'' closely resembles '""Crohn's disease"""". Crohn's is another ""'inflammatory bowel disease''. Often the only thing that distinguishes ''ulcerative colitis'"" is that it affects only the colon. Crohn's may affect any part of the ""'digestive system'', including the mouth. '""Crohn's disease""' also is particularly destructive to the small intestine, known as the ileum.''A doctor may order several different types of tests when considering ''ulcerative colitis'' as a diagnosis. These include:' Blood tests Stool sample tests Imaging tests, such as a CT scan Colonoscopy Sigmoidoscopy 
	Pill camera"
"How Common Is Surgery for Ulcerative Colitis?
","'About 25% to 40% of people with ulcerative ''colitis'' will have to have surgery to remove their colons. The reasons that surgery becomes necessary include:''In some cases, surgery to remove the colon is recommended if other treatments do not work or if the side effects of medications are harming the patient.' Medical treatment -- for instance, drug therapy -- fails to provide results. There may be a risk of cancer without surgery. The colon has ruptured. The patient experiences a severe, sudden onset of the disease. There is extensive bleeding. Treatment causes side effects severe enough to compromise the patient's health. Toxic megacolon has set in. In this dangerous condition, the muscles of the large intestine are dilated, and the colon can rupture."
What Types of Surgery Can Treat Ulcerative Colitis?,"'Surgery to remove the entire colon is called a colectomy. Surgery to remove both the colon and rectum is a proctocolectomy. Both can be used to treat ulcerative colitis. These surgeries are also performed to eliminate the threat of ''colon cancer''. Colon ''cancer'' is common in people with ulcerative colitis. Proctocolectomy is considered the standard treatment when surgery for ulcerative colitis is needed.''If the entire colon is removed, the surgeon may create an opening, or ''stoma'', in the abdominal wall. The tip of the lower small intestine is brought through the stoma. An external bag, or pouch, is attached to the stoma. This is called a permanent ileostomy. Stools pass through this opening and collect in the pouch. The pouch must be worn at all times.''Another procedure is the pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). This is a procedure that does not require a permanent stoma. This surgery is also called a restorative proctocolectomy. The patient is still able to eliminate ''stool'' through the anus. In this procedure, the colon and rectum are removed. Then the small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir -- called a J-pouch -- that will serve as a new rectum. This pouch is connected to the anus. This procedure is frequently done in two operations. In between the operations the patient needs a temporary ileostomy.''The ''continent ileostomy'"", or Kock pouch, is an option for people who would like their ileostomy converted to an internal pouch. It's also an option for people who do not qualify for the IPAA procedure. In this procedure, there is a stoma but no bag. The colon and rectum are removed, and an internal reservoir is created from the small intestine. An opening is made in the abdominal wall, and the reservoir is then joined to the skin with a ""'nipple'"" valve. To drain the pouch, the patient inserts a catheter through the valve into the internal reservoir. This procedure, however, is not the preferred surgical treatment for ulcerative patients. That's because of its uncertain results and the potential need for additional surgery."" "
What Are the Benefits of Ulcerative Colitis Surgeries?,"'If the entire colon is removed, ulcerative colitis is cured. This should put an end to the ''diarrhea'', ''abdominal pains'', ''anemia'', and other symptoms.''In addition, the surgical procedures prevent colon ''cancer''. Overall, an estimated 5% of ulcerative colitis patients will develop ''cancer''. The elimination of the ''colon cancer'' threat is especially significant for people who have ulcerative colitis that affects the entire colon. In these cases, as opposed to cases of ulcerative colitis that affects only the lower colon and the rectum, the ''cancer'' risk without surgery could be up to 32 times the normal rate.' "
"What Are the Complications of Ulcerative Colitis Surgeries?
","'Complications from ileoanal anastomosis may include:''WebMD Medical Reference' More frequent and more watery bowel movements Inflammation of the pouch (pouchitis) Blockage of the intestine (bowel obstruction) from internal scar tissue, called 
	adhesions, caused by surgery Pouch failure, which happens in about 8% to 10% of patients with IPAA If the pouch fails, the patient will need to have a permanent ileostomy."
What is iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"'Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS or ''IT band'' syndrome) is an overuse injury of the connective tissues that are located on the lateral or outer part of thigh and knee. It causes ''pain'' and tenderness in those areas, especially just above the ''knee joint''. Iliotibial band syndrome is the most common cause of lateral ''knee pain'' in runners and bicyclists.''The iliotibial band is a thick band of fascia (tissue) that begins at the iliac crest in the pelvis, runs down the lateral or outside part of the thigh, and crosses the knee to attach into the top part of the tibia or shinbone. It forms from the tensor fascia lata and two of the gluteal muscles (gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) in the buttock and then stretches across the knee. The iliotibial (IT) band helps stabilize the outside part of the knee through its range of motion.''The iliotibial band is one of the hip abductor muscles, moving the hip away from the midline. The iliotibial band also helps with both knee flexion and extension.''When the knee is flexed, the IT band is located behind the femoral epicondyle, a bony outcropping of the femur or thighbone at the ''knee joint''. The IT band moves forward across the condyle when the knee is extended. There is a sac or bursa that allows the band to glide smoothly across the condyle, but should inflammation occur in this area, the increased friction from repeatedly rubbing the iliotibial band across the bony condyle can cause ''pain'', especially along the outer (lateral) aspect of the knee joint.''If the symptoms are ignored, the inflammation can continue and scarring develop in the bursa, decreasing knee range of motion and causing increasing ''pain'' with decreasing activity.' "
What causes iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"'Iliotibial band inflammation is an overuse syndrome that occurs most often in long-distance runners, bicyclists, and other athletes who repeatedly squat. The iliotibial band syndrome may be the result of a combination of issues, including''There can be a predisposition to develop IT band syndrome. Anatomy issues may include differences in the lengths of the legs (a leg-length discrepancy), an abnormal tilt to the pelvis, or bowed legs (genu varum). These situations can cause the iliotibial band to become excessively tight, leading to increased friction and irritation when the band crosses back and forth across the femoral epicondyle during activity.''Training errors may cause runners to develop iliotibial band syndrome symptoms. Roads are canted or banked with the center of the road higher than the outside edge to allow for water runoff. If a runner always runs on the same side of the road, it produces the same effect on the body as having a leg-length discrepancy. One leg is always downhill compared to the other, and the pelvis has to tilt to accommodate the activity. ''Running'' too many hills can also cause inflammation of the IT band. Running downhill is especially stressful on the IT band as it works to stabilize the knee.''Bicyclists may develop IT band inflammation should they have improper posture on their bike and ""toe in"" when they pedal. The issue may be how the toe clips are aligned, forcing the foot to be internally rotated, toed in. This can cause the same effect as bowed legs, increasing the angle of the IT band as it crosses the knee and increasing the risk of inflammation.''Other activities with increased knee flexion can cause symptoms and include rowing and ''weight lifting'', especially with excessive squatting.' poor training habits, poor flexibility of muscle, and other mechanical imbalances in the body, especially involving the low back, pelvis, hips, and knees."
What are iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome symptoms and signs?,"   Pain on the lateral side of the knee is the most common symptom of iliotibial band syndrome and is due to inflammation of the area where the band crosses back and forth at the femoral epicondyle. Initially, there may be a sensation of stinging or needle-like pricks that are often ignored. This can gradually progress to pain every time the heel strikes the ground and finally can become disabling with pain when walking or when climbing up or down steps. Some patients may feel a snapping or popping sound at the knee, and there may be some swelling either where the band crosses the femoral epicondyle or below the knee where it attaches to the tibia. Occasionally, the pain may radiate along the course of the IT band all the way up to the outer side of the thigh to the hip."
How do health care professionals diagnose iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"""Often, the diagnosis of iliotibial band syndrome can be made by the patient's story of symptoms. The patient describes the progression of lateral ""'knee pain'' that is made worse when the heel strikes the ground. Physical examination is helpful because the area of pain can often be palpated with tenderness and swelling felt over the femoral epicondyle, where the bursa or sac is located.''The health care professional may also look for leg-length discrepancy, muscle imbalance, and tightness in the legs and back. There is tenderness of the outer thigh just above the knee joint, while the knee and hip joints themselves are normal to examination.''Usually, a full physical examination of the low back and legs, including the hips, knees, and ankles, is performed to detect other potential causes of lateral ''knee pain''.''Plain ''X-rays'' are not usually required to help with the diagnosis, but ''MRI'' may be used to look for inflammation surrounding and beneath the iliotibial band. The ''MRI'' can also exclude other causes of outer ''knee pain''. These include torn cartilage (lateral ''meniscus tear''), sprained lateral collateral ligament, muscle tendon inflammation, and problems between the kneecap and the femur (patellofemoral pain). Most often, ''X-rays'' and MRI images are not needed.'  "

IT\xa0band syndrome treatment includes the following:''Research continues with other injection therapy options to find non-surgical cures.''It is unusual that the conservative nonsurgical treatment fails to help. However, orthopedic surgery may be an option for patients who fail conservative (nonoperative) treatment.''Before surgery is considered, other potential causes of lateral knee pain are usually considered. These include lateral ''meniscus'' tear and chondromalacia.'   Rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). Anti-inflammatory medications, like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve), may be helpful. Note that any over-the-counter medications can have potential side effects, as well as interactions with prescription medications. If questions or concerns exist, it is wise to ask a health care professional or pharmacist about their safe use. Home treatment can involve stretching, massage, and use of foam rollers at the site of pain and inflammation. Should these first-line treatments not work, physical therapy may be needed to decrease the inflammation at the IT band. Some treatments focus on flexibility and stretching. Friction rubbing may occur over the IT band at the femoral epicondyle may help to break down inflammation and scarring. Therapeutic ultrasound techniques may be used, including phonopheresis (ultrasound propels anti-inflammatory medications through the skin into the inflamed tissue) and iontophoresis (electricity is used instead of ultrasound) to help decrease irritation in the soft tissues surrounding the knee. The physical therapist may also help evaluate the underlying cause of the problem and look at muscle strength and balance and/or flexibility and gait analysis (watching a person walk, run, or cycle). Shoe orthotics may be useful if there is a gait problem, pelvic tilt, or leg-length discrepancy as a potential cause of IT band syndrome. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone) injected at the site of inflammation may be of benefit. Arthroscopy can be used to find the inflammation surrounding the iliotibial band and cut it away. This inflammation and scarring is often found in the lateral recess of the knee between the IT band and the femoral epicondyle. Other surgical options may be available, including cutting out a small triangular part of the IT band to lengthen the band and allow more room for it to slide across bone."
What stretches and exercises are beneficial for iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,  
What exercises should be avoided with iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"'Most patients recover from iliotibial band syndrome, but it can take from weeks to months to return to full activity without pain. Patience in allowing the body to heal is required for optimal results.''Understanding the importance of symmetry in the body is helpful in preventing iliotibial band syndrome. When activities alter that symmetry, symptoms may occur.''Symptoms may occur in runners who always run in the same direction on an indoor track or who always run on the same side of a banked road. This causes an artificial tilt to the pelvis and increases the risk of developing inflammation and pain. When running indoors, it is wise to change directions when running longer distances. Some tracks have the runners change directions every few minutes while others change direction on alternate days. While running toward traffic is an important safety strategy, finding a way to run on the opposite side of the street safely may minimize the risk of developing iliotibial band syndrome.''Bicyclists are at risk for iliotibial band syndrome if they tend to pedal with their toes turned in (internally rotated), which can cause abnormal stretching of the iliotibial band at the knee.

What is colonoscopy?,"'Colonoscopy'' is a procedure that enables an examiner (usually a ''gastroenterologist'') to evaluate the appearance of the inside of the colon (large bowel). This is accomplished by inserting a long flexible tube (the ''colonoscope'') that is about the thickness of a finger into the anus and then advancing the colonoscope slowly into the rectum and through the colon. The tip of the colonoscope has a light and a video camera. The inner colon lining can be directly visualized in images transmitted from the camera to a television monitor. This traditional method of examination of the colon is called optical colonoscopy or, more commonly, just colonoscopy.''In preparation for colonoscopy, the day before the examination the colon is emptied using laxatives. Immediately prior to colonoscopy, an intravenous infusion (IV) is started, and the patient is placed on a monitor for continuously monitoring the rhythm of the ''heart'', ''blood pressure'', and the amount of oxygen in the blood. Medication usually is given by IV to make the patient sleepy and relaxed. If needed, the patient can receive additional doses of medication during the procedure. Colonoscopy often gives a feeling of pressure, cramping, and ''bloating''; however, with the aid of the medication, colonoscopy generally is well tolerated and infrequently results in significant ''pain''. The type of anesthesia caused by the intravenous medications is classified as conscious sedation and is safer than general anesthesia. With conscious sedation, patients are sleepy but still arousable, and able to breathe on their own. After the colonoscopy, patients are asked not to drive for the rest of the day if medications for conscious sedation were given.''Should there be polyps (benign growths that can lead to ''cancer'') in the colon, the polyps, almost always can be removed through the colonoscope. Removal of these polyps is an important method of preventing ''colorectal cancer''.' "
What is virtual colonoscopy?,"'Virtual colonoscopy is a technique that uses a computerized tomographic (CT) scan (a type of three-dimensional x-ray) to construct virtual images of the colon that are similar to the views of the colon obtained by direct observation by optical colonoscopy.''In preparation for virtual colonoscopy, the day before the examination the colon is emptied using laxatives in a manner similar to traditional colonoscopy. During the examination, a small tube is inserted into the anus to inject and fill the colon with air. Unlike with traditional colonoscopy, this tube is not advanced into the colon. The ''CT scan'' then is performed, and the scans are manipulated by computer software to form virtual images of the colon. When properly performed, virtual colonoscopy can be as effective as routine colonoscopy. It can even find polyps ""hiding"" behind folds that occasionally are missed by traditional colonoscopy. The scanning takes only 10 minutes, and usually no conscious sedation is necessary.''In October, 2007, researchers from University of Wisconsin published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' a study comparing traditional colonoscopy to virtual colonoscopy. More than six thousand patients over age 50 were evenly divided to undergo either optical or virtual colonoscopy. The researchers found that virtual colonoscopy was as effective as optical colonoscopy in detecting polyps larger than 5mm.'  "
Comparing virtual colonoscopy and traditional colonoscopy ," Virtual colonoscopy is less invasive and faster to perform than traditional colonoscopy and does not require conscious sedation. Even though virtual colonoscopy is less invasive than traditional colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy still involves injecting air into the colon, which can be uncomfortable for some patients. On the other hand, with adequate conscious sedation, patients usually experience little or no discomfort with traditional colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy is not as reliable as routine colonoscopy in detecting small polyps (less than 5mm in size). Even though most experts believe that polyps smaller than 5mm are usually benign, some small polyps can be cancerous or become cancerous if not removed. Virtual colonoscopy is not as accurate as traditional colonoscopy in finding flat cancers or polyps that are not protruding, that is, are not polyp-like. Virtual colonoscopy cannot remove polyps. If polyps are found by virtual colonoscopy, then traditional colonoscopy must be performed to remove the polyps. Therefore, many individuals having virtual colonoscopy will have to undergo a second procedure,. Even though the amount of radiation exposure with virtual colonoscopy is considered safe, the long term radiation effects of mass screening with CT is not known."
My personal approach to recommending virtual versus optical colonoscopies,"'New England Journal of Medicine'', October 2007'  In healthy patients who want all the polyps (including ones smaller than 5mm) to be removed, I recommend traditional colonoscopy In patients who do not want to undergo routine colonoscopy and are willing to accept the possibility of leaving small polyps untreated, virtual colonoscopy is an alternative. In unhealthy patients with advanced heart, lung, liver, or kidney diseases, virtual colonoscopy may be a safer and less invasive alternative to traditional colonoscopy."
What is Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding condition in which the blood doesn't clot as it should. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets).""""Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites). They're made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. Platelets stick together (clot) to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.""'You can understand the name of this disease by an explanation of its three parts. ""Idiopathic"" (id-ee-o-PATH-ick) means that the cause of the condition isn\'t known. ""Thrombocytopenic"" (throm-bo-cy-toe-PEE-nick) means there\'s a lower than normal number of platelets in the blood. ""Purpura"" (PURR-purr-ah) refers to purple ''bruises'' caused by bleeding under the skin.''People who have ITP often have purple ''bruises'' that appear on the skin or on the mucous membranes (for example, in the mouth). The bruises mean that bleeding has occurred in small blood vessels under the skin.''A person who has ITP also may have bleeding that results in tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a ''rash''.'""People who have ITP also may have nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums when they have dental work done, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Women who have ITP may have menstrual bleeding that's heavier than usual.""'More extensive bleeding can cause hematomas (he-mah-TO-mas). A ''hematoma'' is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump.''Bleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but can be life threatening if it occurs.'""In most cases, an autoimmune response is believed to cause ITP. Normally your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known.""""ITP can't be passed from one person to another."" "
What Are The Types of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"'There are two types of ITP: acute (temporary or short-term) and chronic (long-lasting).''Acute ITP generally lasts less than 6 months. It mainly occurs in children, both boys and girls, and is the most common type of ITP. Acute ITP often occurs after an infection caused by a virus.''Chronic ITP is long-lasting (6 months or longer) and mostly affects adults. However, some teenagers and children can get this type of ITP. Chronic ITP affects women 2 to 3 times more often than men.' "
What Are The causes of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""In most cases, it's believed that an autoimmune response causes idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).""""Normally, the immune system makes antibodies (proteins) to fight off germs or other harmful things that enter the body. In ITP, however, the immune system attacks and destroys the body's platelets by mistake. Why this happens isn't known.""'Children who get acute (short-term) ITP often have had recent viral infections. It\'s possible that the infection somehow ""triggers"" or sets off the immune reaction that leads to ITP in these children. ITP in adults, on the other hand, doesn\'t seem to be linked to infections.'  "
What Are The Risk Factors for Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"'Both children and adults can develop idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).''Children usually get the acute (short-term) type of ITP. Acute ITP often develops after an infection caused by a virus. Adults tend to get the chronic (long-lasting) type of ITP. Women are 2 to 3 times more likely than men to get chronic ITP.''ITP is a fairly common blood disorder, with 50 to 150 new cases per every 1 million people each year; about half of these cases are children. However, the number of cases of ITP is rising because routine blood tests that can detect a ''low platelet count'' are being done more often.'""ITP can't be passed from one person to another."" "
What Are The Symptoms and Signs for Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""Having a low platelet count doesn't cause symptoms. However, the bleeding that a low platelet count can cause may have the following signs and symptoms:""""Any kind of bleeding that's hard to stop could be a sign of ITP. This includes menstrual bleeding in women that's heavier than usual.""'Bleeding in the brain is rare, and the symptoms of bleeding in the brain may vary in severity.'""A low number of platelets doesn't cause ""'pain'', ''fatigue'' (''tiredness''), problems concentrating, or any other symptoms.' Pinpoint red spots on the skin that often are found in groups and may look like a rash. The spots, called petechiae, are due to bleeding under the skin. Bruising or purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes (such as in the mouth) due to bleeding under the skin. The bruises may occur for no known reason. This type of bruising is called purpura. More extensive bleeding can cause hematomas. A hematoma is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump. Nosebleeds or bleeding from the gums (for example, when dental work is done). Blood in the urine or 
stool (bowel movement)."
How Is Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Diagnosed (ITP)?,"'Your doctor will diagnose idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.'""Your doctor will want to make sure that your low platelet count isn't due to another condition (such as an infection) or a side effect of medicines you're taking (such as ""'chemotherapy'' medicines or ''aspirin'').''Your doctor may ask about:''Your doctor will give you a physical exam and look for signs of bleeding and infection. For example, your doctor may look for pinpoint red spots on the skin and bruising or purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes. These are signs of bleeding under the skin.'""You'll likely have blood tests to check your platelets. These tests usually include:""'You also may have a blood test to check for the antibodies that attack platelets.''If blood tests show that you have a low number of platelets, your doctor may recommend more tests to confirm a diagnosis of ITP. For example, bone marrow tests may be used to see whether your bone marrow is making platelets.''Some people who have mild ITP have few or no signs of bleeding. These people may be diagnosed only after a blood test done for another reason shows that they have a low platelet count.' Your signs and symptoms of bleeding and any other signs or symptoms you're having Whether you have illnesses that could lower your platelet count or cause bleeding Medicines or any other over-the-counter supplements or remedies you take that could cause bleeding or lower your platelet count A complete blood count. This test shows the numbers of different kinds of blood cells, including platelets, in a small sample of your blood. In ITP, the red and white blood cell counts are normal. A blood smear. During this test, some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is then used to look at your platelets and other blood cells. In ITP, the number of platelets is lower than normal."
What Are The Treatments For Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""Treatment for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is based on how much and how often you're bleeding and your platelet count. In some cases, treatment may not be needed.""'Medicines often are used as the first course of treatment. Treatments used for children and adults are similar.''Adults who have milder cases of ITP may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts. However, adults with ITP who have very low platelet counts or problems with bleeding are treated. ''The acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months and requires no treatment. Children who have milder cases of ITP may not need treatment other than monitoring and followup to make sure platelet counts return to normal. Children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), are treated.''If ITP needs to be treated, medicines often are tried first. ''Corticosteroids'' (cor-ti-co-STEER-roids), such as ''prednisone'', are commonly used to treat ITP.''These medicines, called steroids for short, help increase your platelet count by lowering the activity of your immune system. However, steroids have a number of side effects, and some people relapse (get worse) when treatment ends.'""The steroids used to treat ITP are different from illegal steroids taken by some athletes to enhance performance. Corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them for many years.""'Some medicines used to help raise the platelet count are given through a needle inserted into a vein. These medicines include immune globulin and anti-Rh (D) immunoglobulin. The monoclonal antibody ''rituximab'' is also often used for treatment of ITP.''Medicines also may be used along with a procedure to remove the spleen, called splenectomy (splee-NECK-tuh-mee).'""If steroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy don't help, two newer medicines—eltrombopag and romiplostim—can be used to treat ITP.""'If necessary, the spleen will be removed surgically. This organ is located in the upper left abdomen. The spleen is about the size of a golf ball in children and a baseball in adults.''The spleen makes antibodies (proteins) that help fight infection. In ITP, these antibodies destroy platelets.'""If ITP hasn't responded to steroids, removing the spleen will reduce the destruction of platelets. However, it also may make you more likely to get certain infections. Before you have the surgery, your doctor may give you vaccines to help prevent these infections.""'If your spleen is removed, your doctor will explain what steps you can take to help avoid infections and what symptoms that should be reported to your physician.''Some people with ITP who have severe bleeding may need to have platelet transfusions and be hospitalized. Some people will need a platelet transfusion before having surgery. However, most people with ITPdo not need platelet transfusions.'""For a platelet transfusion, donor platelets from a blood bank are injected into the recipient's bloodstream. This increases the platelet count for a short time.""""Some infections can briefly lower a person's platelet count. If a person who has ITP has an infection that can lower his or her platelet count, treating the infection may help increase the platelet count and reduce bleeding problems.""'If a person who has ITP is taking medicine that can lower his or her platelet count or cause bleeding, stopping the medicine can sometimes help increase the platelet count or prevent bleeding.''For example, aspirin and ''ibuprofen'' are common medicines that increase the chance of bleeding. If you have ITP, your doctor may suggest that you avoid these medicines.' "
How Can Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Be Prevented?,"""You can't prevent idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but you can prevent its complications."" Talk to your doctor about which medicines you can take. Your doctor may advise you to avoid medicines such as aspirin or ibuprofen that can affect your platelets and increase your risk of bleeding. Protect yourself from injuries that can cause bruising or bleeding. Seek treatment right away if you develop any infections. Report any symptoms of infection, such as a fever, to your doctor. This is very important for people with ITP who have had their spleens removed."
Living with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP),"'If you have idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), you can take steps to prevent complications. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition.'""If you have ITP, try to avoid injuries, especially head injuries, that can cause bleeding in the brain. For example, don't participate in contact sports such as boxing, football, or karate. Other sports, such as skiing or horseback riding, also put you at risk for injuries that can cause bleeding.""'Some safe activities are ''swimming'' and ''walking''. Ask your doctor about physical activities that are safe for you.''Take precautions such as regular use of seatbelts and wearing gloves when working with knives and other tools.'""If your child has ITP, ask his or her doctor whether you need to restrict your child's activities.""'Find a doctor, preferably a hematologist, who is familiar with treating people who have ITP. Hematologists are doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and disorders. Discuss with your doctor how to manage ITP and when to seek medical care.''Talk to your doctor before taking prescription and over-the-counter medicines and nutritional ''supplements''. Some medicines and supplements can affect platelets and increase your chance of bleeding. Common examples are aspirin or ibuprofen.''Tell your doctor about all of the over-the-counter medicines you take, including ''vitamins'', supplements, and herbal remedies. These products may contain substances that increase your risk of bleeding.''Watch for symptoms of infection, such as a ''fever'"", and report them to your doctor promptly. If you've had your spleen removed, you may be more likely to become ill from certain types of infection.""'In women who are ''pregnant'"" and have ITP, the ITP usually doesn't affect the baby. However, some ""'babies'' born to mothers who have ITP are born with or develop low numbers of platelets soon after birth.''Their platelet counts almost always return to normal without any treatment. Treatment can speed the recovery in the very few babies whose platelet counts remain very low.''Treatment for ITP during ''pregnancy'"" depends on a woman's platelet count. If treatment is needed, the doctor will take a close look at the possible effects of the treatment on the unborn baby.""'Women who have milder cases of ITP usually can go through pregnancy without treatment. Pregnant women who have very low platelet counts or a lot of bleeding are more likely to have serious heavy bleeding during delivery or afterward. To prevent serious bleeding, these women usually are treated.' "
What Is The Outlook For Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""For most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition.""""Acute ITP in children often goes away on its own within a few weeks or months and doesn't return. In most children who have ITP, the platelet count returns to normal within 6 months. Treatment may not be needed.""""A small number of children, about 5 percent, whose ITP doesn't go away on its own may need to have further medical or surgical treatment.""'Chronic ITP will vary with each individual and can last for many years. Even people who have severe forms of chronic ITP can live for decades. Most people who have chronic ITP are able at some point to stop treatment and keep a safe platelet count.' "
What Are Other Names For Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)?, Immune thrombocytopenic purpura Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura
Facts you should know about the influenza vaccine (flu shot)," Types of influenza (flu) vaccines include the injection (killed virus), recombinant (made without flu virus), and nasal spray vaccines (containing live virus). Each year, influenza viruses change slightly, making the seasonal vaccine used in previous years ineffective. The vaccine is generally effective against the influenza virus within two weeks of administration. The vaccine is only effective against the strains of the virus that match the vaccine. The seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness is dependent upon the extent of the match between the virus strains used to prepare the vaccine and those viruses in actual circulation in the community. The age and health status of the individual also play a role in determining the vaccine effectiveness."
What is influenza (flu)?,"'The flu (or common flu) is a viral infection that spreads from person to person in secretions of the nose and ''lungs'', for example when ''sneezing''. Medically, the common flu is another name for influenza. Flu is a ''respiratory infection'', that is, an infection that develops primarily in the lungs. People often call respiratory infections caused by other viruses the flu, but this is incorrect. These other infections are usually categorized as URIs (upper respiratory infections) and have multiple causes. Influenza usually causes higher ''fever'', more malaise, and severe body aches than other respiratory infections. Although other viruses may cause these ''flu-like symptoms'', they do so less frequently.''Influenza viruses are divided scientifically into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter. Influenza type C usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact of influenza types A and B. ''Type A'' viruses are divided into subtypes and are named based on differences in two viral surface proteins called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 16 known H subtypes and nine known N subtypes.''The flu is a common illness. The CDC reports for the 2018/2019 influenza season show that in the United States''The so-called ''swine flu'' pandemic of 2009 was caused by a novel influenza A virus designated ''H1N1'' based upon its surface protein types. This virus was originally referred to as swine flu because many of the genes in this new virus were very similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. However, this virus was actually quite different from the typical swine flu viruses found in pigs.' 5%-20% of the population gets the flu, nearly 500,000 people are hospitalized from flu-related complications, about 34,000 people die from the flu or its complications."
Why vaccinate for the flu?,"'The flu is highly infectious and is a potentially serious viral ''respiratory infection'' that can even be life threatening. Whereas with other viral respiratory infections the symptoms usually are mild and most people can continue working or going to school while ill, with the flu, the symptoms are severe and prolonged and cause individuals to miss days of work or school. The infection stresses the body. In addition, superinfections may occur as a complication of the flu. Superinfections are ''bacterial infections'' that occur on top of a respiratory infection. Bacterial respiratory infections also are a serious type of infection, and the simultaneous viral and bacterial infection can overwhelm the function of the lungs and the body. Among the elderly and the very young, it can cause death. Because of its infectiousness, morbidity (severity of symptoms and time lost from work or school), and the potential for death, it is important to prevent the flu by influenza vaccination. Although there are medications to treat the flu, they are expensive, not as effective as influenza vaccination, and need to be started within 24-48 hours of the start of symptoms.'  "
What are the different types of flu vaccines?,"'Flu ''vaccines'' are routinely available for seasonal influenza. Pandemic vaccines may also be developed for specific strains of the flu virus that cause widespread disease, such as occurred with the H1N1 virus in 2009.''Each year, composition of the influenza viruses changes, making the vaccine used in previous years ineffective. Each year, a new vaccine must be prepared that will be effective against the types of influenza virus that are expected to circulate in the upcoming influenza season. These are known as seasonal flu vaccines. The reason for the differences in circulating strains of the flu virus is that the virus can mutate (or change its structure) rapidly, leading to new subtypes of the virus. The key is to be able to predict which influenza viruses are going to cause infection and to prepare a vaccine against those viruses. Usually, scientists can predict accurately which types of influenza virus will cause infections and prepare an appropriate vaccine. Typically, the viruses used to prepare flu vaccine are grown in eggs, but a newer, egg-free version of the vaccine has been developed. In 2017, updated guidelines from the Influenza Vaccine and Egg ''Allergy'' Practice Parameter Workgroup commissioned by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) stated that the risk is so small that even asking patients about egg ''allergy'' is no longer necessary. Health care professionals can now safely administer flu vaccines to people who are ''allergic'' to eggs. Flu viruses may also be made using recombinant technology that does not involve growing the actual flu virus in eggs.''The vaccine is generally effective against the influenza virus within two weeks of administration. The vaccine is only effective against the strains of the virus that match the vaccine. These strains vary from flu season to flu season each year. This is the reason that revaccination is required annually with the vaccine that matches the strains of influenza that are currently prevalent.''Flu vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, meaning that it contains killed influenza virus, or a recombinant vaccine, meaning that it was made without using virus particles at all. Health care providers inject the vaccine into muscles or skin, stimulating the immune system to produce an immune response (antibodies) to the influenza virus.''Medical professionals administer the ""flu shot"" vaccine as a single dose of liquid injected through the skin into muscle (intramuscular or IM). Typically, health care professionals inject the flu vaccine into the deltoid muscle at the side of the arm, using ''alcohol'' rubbed over the skin for sterilization. Health care professionals administer the vaccine annually, each fall. Side effects of the flu vaccine are uncommon.''Two types of vaccines are available: a trivalent vaccine that targets three strains of flu virus, as well as a quadrivalent vaccine that targets four strains. Both the trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are available as an intramuscular injection. Special vaccines preparations are available for people over 65 years of age that produce a stronger immune response.''The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends the use of injectable influenza vaccines (either trivalent or quadrivalent, including inactivated influenza vaccines and recombinant influenza vaccines) or the nasal spray vaccine for the influenza season of 2019-20.''The nasal-spray flu vaccine (sometimes called LAIV for live attenuated influenza vaccine, brand name ''FluMist'') was first licensed in 2003. It is directed against the same strains of virus as the flu shot but differs in that it contains weakened live influenza viruses instead of killed viruses and is administered by nasal spray instead of injection. The vaccine is termed an attenuated vaccine because the vaccine viruses are weakened so that they themselves do not cause severe ''flu symptoms''. The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for use in non-''pregnant'' individuals 2-49 years old. It should not be used for people with certain underlying medical conditions. All LAIV are quadrivalent (four-component).''The live viruses in the nasal-spray vaccine are weakened so that they do not cause severe symptoms. However, mild symptoms can occur as a side effect of the vaccination. Side effects of the nasal-spray flu vaccine can includedrunny nose, ''headache'', ''sore throat'', and ''cough''. Children who receive the vaccine may also develop mild ''fever'' and muscle aches.' "
What flu viruses does the flu vaccine protect against?,"'Flu vaccines are developed each year and are designed to protect against the influenza viruses that are predicted to be the most common during the upcoming season. Some vaccines contain three viral strains (trivalent), while others contain four virus types (quadrivalent).' "
How does the flu vaccine work to prevent the flu?,"'The flu vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce of antibodies in the body that fight the particular flu virus in the vaccination. When the virus enters a vaccinated person, the antibodies attack and kill the virus and prevent infection. Antibodies are produced against the specific strains of the virus contained in the yearly vaccine.''Flu vaccination does not protect against infection caused by microbes other than the influenza virus.' "
Will the flu vaccine help fight the coronavirus?,"'The coronavirus (''SARS''-CoV-2) and influenza are two different illnesses caused by different viruses. The flu shot will not help fight coronavirus infection, but getting a flu shot remains an important step in protecting your health and in reducing the overall burden of respiratory illness in the community. Having enough people vaccinated against the flu ensures that hospitals and clinics keep adequate space to treat patients with coronavirus infections. It is expected that both the coronavirus and the flu may be present at the same time in the 2020-21 flu season, and being vaccinated against the flu helps protect yourself and vulnerable populations against an illness that might happen at the same time as a coronavirus infection.' "
Can you get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time?,"'According to the CDC, ""While it\'s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the fall and winter (of 2020-21), CDC believes it\'s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes ''COVID-19'' will both be spreading. In this context, getting a flu vaccine will be more important than ever."" There is no evidence to suggest that it is not possible to have both diseases at the same time.' "
Is it safe to have a coronavirus vaccine if you already had a flu vaccine?,"'There is no coronavirus vaccine currently available, but vaccine developers are working to ensure development of a vaccine that is safe for everyone, including those who have had flu shots. Currently in the absence of a coronavirus vaccine, it is especially important for the 2020-21 flu season to receive a flu shot for its overall health benefits.' "
When should one receive the flu vaccine?,'Health care professionals recommend getting the influenza vaccination before flu season begins in your community. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to produce a sufficient antibody response against the flu. Flu season can begin in October and last as late as May.' 
Who should receive the flu vaccine?,"'The CDC recommends that every individual over 6 months of age receive the seasonal flu vaccine. While everyone should get a vaccination, it is particularly important for some groups. Vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications if they get the flu, such as those with ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', and chronic lung disease as well as pregnant women and those over 65 years of age. It is also important for caregivers to get ''vaccinations'', in addition to those who live with people in these risk groups.' "
Who should not receive the flu vaccine?,"'Those who should avoid the flu vaccine include the following:' People who have ever had a severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine People with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS) that occurred after receiving influenza vaccine and who are not at risk for severe illness from influenza should generally not receive vaccine. People under 65 years of age should not receive the high-dose flu shot. If you are sick with a fever when you go to get your flu shot, you should talk to your doctor or nurse about whether or not you should get your shot later. However, you can get a flu shot at the same time you have a respiratory illness without fever or if you have another mild illness."
What are flu vaccine risks and side effects? Can the flu vaccine give me the flu?,"'Serious side effects of the flu vaccine are uncommon. Side effects of the injection vaccine include soreness at the site of the injection, muscle aching, fever, and feeling unwell. Very rarely, people have reported serious allergic reactions. The viruses in the nasal spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms; they cannot cause you to get the flu. Side effects from the nasal spray may include ''runny nose'', mild fever, ''sore throat'', ''cough'', muscle aches, ''headache'', and ''vomiting''.''Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an illness characterized by fever, nerve damage, and muscle ''weakness''. In 1976, vaccination with the swine flu vaccine was associated with development of GBS. Studies have evaluated if other flu vaccines were associated with GBS, with only one of the studies showing an association. That single study suggested that one person out of 1 million vaccinated people may be at risk of GBS associated with the vaccine.'

What should I do about adverse reactions to the flu vaccine?,'You should contact your health care professional in the case of any serious side effects. Mild side effects such as soreness at the injection site typically resolve on their own without treatment.' 
How effective is the flu vaccine (flu shot)?,"'The effectiveness of the flu vaccine is dependent upon the extent of the match between the virus strains used to prepare the vaccine and those viruses in actual circulation. The age and health status of the individual also play a role in determining the effectiveness of the vaccine. While vaccine effectiveness can vary, recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40%-60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are similar to those used in the vaccines. Similar reductions in the number of people hospitalized with the flu have also been observed. Rates of flu prevention may be even higher in healthy adults under 65 years of age.' "
What was the novel H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine?,"'The H1N1 vaccine was a pandemic vaccine designed to provide immunity against the novel H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, initially referred to as swine flu. Initially, health care providers gave the H1N1 vaccine to those at highest risk for complications of this illness (children, pregnant women, caregivers of children). Even though the virus proved not to be as deadly as expected, researchers suggest the H1N1 vaccine was effective in reducing the effects of this flu virus.' "
What is the best way to locate a flu vaccine clinic?,"""People can obtain flu shots through a health care professional's office, at community health departments, and at many pharmacies. Additionally, many employers and schools host flu shot clinics. Some employers may offer the vaccine free of charge. A health care professional's office should be able to provide information about flu shot clinics available in the community."" "
What are vaccine-preventable diseases?,"'Vaccine''-preventable diseases are those diseases for which there is a shot that helps the immune system prepare for an infection. A person develops immunity after he or she has received a vaccine and responded to it. When a vaccinated person is exposed to a virus (for example, ''hepatitis B'') or bacteria (for example, ''diphtheria''), his or her body is able to destroy the virus or bacteria and prevent the disease. No vaccine is perfect, and some people who receive a vaccine can still get the disease. This is why it is important for everyone to get the vaccine. This gives the community what experts call ""herd"" immunity and means that, basically, there are very few people who could serve as a reservoir for the disease. Herd immunity prevents severe outbreaks of diseases.''The following table lists vaccine-preventable diseases:' "

What vaccines should a pregnant woman get?,"'The concerns surrounding the dangers of ''vaccines'' during ''pregnancy'' is mostly theoretical. The concern is related to the risk of transfer to the fetus. There is no evidence of any risk associated with the use of inactivated (killed) ''vaccines'' in ''pregnant'' women. The biggest concern is related to the use of live vaccines. While the risk is extremely low, the concern is that the live virus will be transferred from the mother to the fetus. There must be a discussion between the physician and the mother whenever a live vaccine is considered during pregnancy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) has issued a guide to help expectant mothers and physicians make good decisions related to the risk and benefits of using a vaccine during pregnancy (''https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelines.html''). ''Tetanus''-''diphtheria'' with acellular ''pertussis'' (Tdap) vaccine, ''hepatitis A'', ''hepatitis B vaccine'', ''meningococcal vaccine'', and ''rabies'' vaccine are generally considered safe during pregnancy. It is currently recommended that pregnant women ''not'' receive the following vaccines: ''human papillomavirus'', live nasal ''influenza'' vaccine (no longer recommended for anyone due to lack of efficacy), ''measles'', ''mumps'', ''rubella'', ''varicella'', and zoster.'

Do health care workers need any different vaccines?,"'It is very important that health care workers are up to date on all of their required vaccines. Additionally, the CDC recommends that health care workers receive varicella (''chickenpox'') vaccine unless there is proof of immunity, prior vaccination, or documented history of the disease. Also, health care workers with direct patient contact, who have not previously received a ''pertussis''-containing ''tetanus'' shot (Tdap), are required to receive one dose. For the complete recommendations, please consult the CDC web site at ''https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec-vac/hcw.html''. Health care workers are required by most employers to have ''hepatitis B'' vaccination and annual influenza vaccinations.' "
What types of specialists administer vaccinations to adolescents and adults?,"'Any licensed physician can order all approved vaccines. Many public-health departments also offer vaccination services at a reduced price. Vaccines are commonly administered by primary care providers, including pediatricians, family practitioners, and internists.' "
"What is the Td/Tdap vaccine, and who should receive it?","'The Td and Tdap vaccines both contain vaccines against tetanus (''lockjaw'') and diphtheria. The Tdap also contains a vaccine against pertussis (''whooping cough''). Most adults are used to getting a tetanus shot when they get a cut. Up until 2005, adolescents and adults were not recommended to receive the pertussis vaccine due to an unacceptable rate of negative reactions. In 2005, a new acellular pertussis vaccine became available for both children and adults (although there are different ones for each group using different amounts of each vaccine). ''Whooping cough'' has become a serious problem again due to the lack of vaccination in adolescents and adults. It is therefore recommended that all adolescents and adults receive at least one dose of Tdap when they are due for their next tetanus shot. Health care workers should get one Tdap vaccination as soon as possible but at least two years since the last tetanus shot (Td).' "
"What is the HPV vaccine, and who should get 
it?","'Human papillomavirus (''HPV'') infection is the cause of ''cervical cancer'' and ''vaginal cancer'' in women, ''penile cancer'' in men, and throat and ''anal cancer'' in both men and women. There are over 100 different types of ''HPV'', and two ''strains'', HPV 16 and 18, are the types that cause about 66% of cervical ''cancers'' and the majority of other HPV-attributable cancers in the United States. The ''Gardasil''-9 vaccine available in the U.S. protects against nine types of HPV -- the four contained in the original Gardasil vaccine (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), plus five additional strains (HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).''Studies have shown that use of the vaccine will decrease the chance that a woman will get ''cervical cancer''. As such, the vaccine must be given before the first sexual contact. The CDC recommends that all girls and boys receive the three-shot series beginning at 11 years of age. Boys need vaccination in order to prevent spread to girls and to protect against cancers of the anus, mouth/throat (oropharynx), and penis. Adult women who have not received the vaccine should do so up to 26 years of age. After 26 years of age, it is believed that most women would have been exposed to the virus and the vaccine would be of no use.''If a person receives the vaccine before age 15 and is going to receive the Gardasil 9, it is a two-shot series; however, if the vaccine is not received until after the 15th birthday or if the series was begun using an earlier version of the Gardasil vaccine or the discontinued Cervarix vaccine, it is recommended that they receive a three-shot series.' "
"What is the meningococcal vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Meningococcal disease is a serious acute illness caused by a bacterium. Those infected can develop meningitis and ''sepsis'', and these are often fatal diseases. There are two different quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines that provide protection against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY, MPSV4). A newer vaccine (Bexsero or Trumenba) against meningococcal serogroup B is also now available and should be given to high-risk individuals, with the injection given at the same time as the quadrivalent vaccine but at a different body site. The disease is more common in adolescents and college students. Therefore, meningococcal vaccine is recommended for all children between 11-12 years of age, with a booster dose at 16 years of age. If the child has not received the vaccine by 11-12 years of age, they should receive it up to age 18. College freshmen who have not received the vaccine should be vaccinated. The vaccines are also recommended for adults with special medical conditions.''In 2017, the CDC changed their recommendation for people age 16 to 23 to now receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccines (MenB) (Bexsero or Trumenba). It has not been mandated, but doctors are recommended to consider the serogroup B vaccine in this age group. Additionally, if there are any outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease on a college campus, the CDC recommends the use of serogroup B meningococcal vaccines (Bexsero or Trumenba).' "
"What is the MMR vaccine, and who should receive it?","'The MMR vaccine contains vaccines against the diseases ''measles'', mumps, and ''rubella'' (''German measles''). These are all dangerous and potentially fatal diseases that have been successfully limited in the United States through aggressive vaccine programs. Adolescents and adults who have not received the MMR or MMRV (MMR, plus the varicella vaccine) should receive two doses of the vaccine at least one month apart. People who do not have medical documentation of having had the diseases or cannot prove previous vaccination should have titers (blood tests to check levels of immunity) drawn to make sure they are immune to these agents. If they do not have laboratory evidence of immunity, they should receive a two-dose series of vaccine.' "
"What is the varicella vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Varicella is the virus that causes ''chickenpox''. While the disease is usually self-limited, it can cause death and permanent injury. The groups at greatest risk are infants, people over 15 years of age, and immunocompromised people. The vaccine came out in the mid-1990s and unfortunately does not offer complete protection, but even those who get the disease after vaccination have a milder form of the condition. Prior to use of the vaccine, hundreds of children died every year from chickenpox. It is recommended that all adolescents and adults without documented evidence of chickenpox or previous vaccination receive the two-dose series.' "
"What is 
the pneumococcal vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Streptococcus'' pneumoniae'' (also called pneumococcus) is a bacterium that can cause severe illness, including meningitis and ''pneumonia''. The vaccine is routinely given to children; however, it is only given to adolescents and adults who are at higher risk (patients with chronic diseases like ''heart disease'' and ''diabetes'', immunocompromised individuals, ''smokers'', and asthmatics). Elderly adults are one group that is considered at higher risk, and it is recommended that all adults aged 65 or older receive both available vaccines, PCV13 followed by PPSV23 (PCV13–PPSV23 sequence). The new recommendation for 2016 is that the vaccines be spaced over one year apart for immunocompetent adults aged 65 or older.' "
"What is the influenza vaccine, and who 
should receive it?","'Influenza (''flu'') is an acute viral illness that can kill even healthy people. Unfortunately, the influenza virus changes a little each year, and scientists have to make educated guesses about which forms of the virus will be infecting people and circulating each year. Based on the best available evidence, they create a vaccine each year containing three of the likely influenza virus types.''The annual ''flu vaccine'' is an inactivated vaccine (shot). You cannot get the flu from getting the ''flu shot'' because it has inactivated virus (virus killed with heat or chemicals). The immunity from the vaccines is limited, and vaccinations must be repeated yearly. It is recommended that all people older than 6 months of age receive an annual vaccination. In 2017, the American College of ''Allergy'', ''Asthma'', and Immunology changed their guidance for patients with egg ''allergy''. They no longer recommend that doctors screen for egg ''allergy'' prior to administering the flu shot, and they recommend that patients with egg allergy receive the currently available flu shot even though it has been created in eggs. There is only minimal egg protein in the shot, and there is no increased risk of reaction for patients with egg allergy. There is also a vaccine recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV) that contains no egg protein because it is not manufactured with eggs. Although the CDC encourages that any adult who wants to decrease the chance of getting the flu get the influenza vaccine, certain high-risk groups are recommended to always get the annual flu vaccine. Adults over 50 years of age are considered to be at high risk and should receive the yearly influenza vaccination.' "
Can people with severe egg allergies still get an annual influenza vaccination?,"'In December 2017, the American College of Allergy, ''Asthma'', and Immunology published an updated guideline and recommended that patients with egg allergy receive the influenza vaccine. Even though the vaccine is currently manufactured in eggs, there is only minimal egg protein in the vaccine. There is no increased risk of reaction in patients with egg allergy.''With this new recommendation to utilize the routine influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy, there is no need to utilize the egg-free vaccine that was released in 2013. Therefore, although the recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV) is not made using eggs, it is no longer needed.' "
"What is 
the hepatitis A vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Hepatitis A'' is an acute viral illness that is spread through contaminated water and food. It is less common in the United States but is still a common cause of ''hepatitis'' worldwide. The disease is very common in many other parts of the world, including Central and South America, Africa, the Middle East, the Western Pacific, and Asia. It is primarily prevented by using good hygiene and through vaccination. ''Hepatitis A vaccine'' is routinely given to children; however, it is only recommended for certain high-risk adolescents and adults. Foreign travel is the most common reason for adults and adolescents to receive ''hepatitis'' A vaccination.' "
"What is the hepatitis B vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Hepatitis B'' is an acute viral illness that is primarily spread through the exposure to body fluids of an infected individual. It is highly ''contagious'' and can be transmitted through sexual intercourse as well as by sharing needles (drug abusers). Approximately 50% of infected individuals will be asymptomatic (have no symptoms of the disease). Most cases resolve without long-term complications. However, 1%-2% will develop chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis B vaccine is given routinely to children. Adolescents who did not receive their three-shot series as a child should be given the vaccine. Adults are not routinely given the hepatitis B vaccine unless they belong to certain high-risk groups. One high-risk group is health care workers.' "
"What is the polio vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Polio'' is an acute viral illness that can cause severe ''paralysis'' and even death. Prior to the use of vaccine, tens of thousands of children developed paralytic polio (the worst form) in the U.S. every year. Since instituting an aggressive vaccine campaign, polio has been almost completely eradicated in the U.S. Most cases now in the U.S. are seen in people traveling from other countries or unvaccinated people from the U.S. traveling to other countries.''There are two forms of the polio vaccine: an oral form made from a live attenuated virus and an injection form made from an inactivated virus. The oral form of the vaccine (oral polio vaccine or OPV) is no longer used in the U.S. because it has been shown to cause polio in a small number of people. Only the shot form of the vaccine (intramuscular polio vaccine or IPV) is now used in the U.S. All children receive four doses of IPV. Adolescents who did not receive all four doses should be given an additional vaccine. Adults are not recommended to receive the polio vaccine unless they will be traveling to areas where polio still exists.' "
"What is the zoster 
vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Herpes zoster'' is a reactivation of an old infection with the varicella virus (chickenpox). This ''rash'' can occur shortly after the infection with chickenpox or many years later. It causes a severely painful skin ''rash'', and it can lead to ''chronic pain'' even after the rash is gone. In order to prevent the severe rash and the ''chronic pain'', a vaccine (''Zostavax'') was developed and is recommended for all adults over 60 years of age.' "
"What is the typhoid vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Typhoid fever'' is an acute febrile illness caused by the bacterium ''Salmonella typhi''. It is spread by contaminated food and water. Although quite common at one time in the U.S., it is very rare today. Most cases are in people who have traveled outside the U.S. Worldwide, the disease affects 13 million people. People who are traveling to areas with high rates of ''typhoid fever'' should receive the vaccine prior to leaving the U.S. ''Travelers'' should consult the CDC web site for specific recommendations depending on the countries they plan to visit (''https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/'').' "
"What is the yellow fever vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Yellow fever'' is an acute illness caused by a virus. The disease is extremely rare in the U.S., and it is usually found in people who have traveled outside the country. The disease is mild in many people, but it can cause ''liver'' failure and death. Approximately 20% of those who get the disease will die. ''Travelers'' to going to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America are required by international health regulations to have a ''yellow fever'' vaccination. Travelers should consult the CDC web site for specific recommendations depending on the countries they plan to visit (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/).' "
"What is the rabies vaccine, and who should 
receive it?","'Rabies'' is an acute viral infection that is considered universally fatal even with excellent treatment (there has been one reported survival with extremely aggressive treatment). Rabies is extremely rare in the U.S. because all states require ''dogs'' and cats to be vaccinated. Most cases in the U.S. are from bites from wild animals (raccoons, bats, foxes, and skunks). However, rabies is common in dogs and cats as well as wild animals in other parts of the world. Travelers who are visiting areas where rabies is prevalent should receive the vaccine. The vaccine can also be given after an animal bite, but it must be given quickly. Travelers should consult the CDC web site for specific recommendations depending on the countries they plan to visit (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/).' "
"What is the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Japanese ''encephalitis'' is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is a leading cause of ''encephalitis'' in Asia. It is uncommon in the U.S. and, therefore, is not recommended as a routine vaccination. People traveling to certain countries in Asia are recommended to receive the vaccine. Travelers should consult the CDC web site for specific recommendations depending on the countries they plan to visit (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/).' "
Are any side effects associated with immunizations administered to teens and adults?,"'Any vaccine can cause side effects, but for the most part, the side effects are minor. Common side effects are ''pain'', swelling, and redness at the injection site, low-grade ''fever'', shivering, ''fatigue'', ''headache'', muscle aches, and joint aches. The side effects for all of the different vaccines can be found on the CDC web site (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm). Vaccines do not cause ''autism''; however, there are rare serious side effects that can be serious or even fatal. Many more people died of vaccine-preventable diseases prior to vaccines than ever suffer serious complications of vaccines.' "
"What is the BCG vaccine, and why don't we use it here in the United States?","'Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is a vaccine used worldwide against ''tuberculosis'' (''TB''). The vaccine is not recommended in the United States because of our low rate of ''TB'', questions about the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent pulmonary (in the ''lungs'') TB, and concerns over interference with the test used to detect TB infection, the PPD. The vaccine is used extensively worldwide, with an estimated 100 million doses given. It is only used in areas where TB is common, and it is only given to children or immunocompromised adults (for example, a patient with ''HIV''). The vaccine has only marginal to no effect on preventing pulmonary TB; however, it does decrease the chances of getting tuberculous meningitis and miliary (all over the body) TB.' "

What is biological therapy?,"""Biological or biologic therapy is treatment designed to stimulate or restore the ability of the body's immune (natural internal defense) system to fight infection and disease. Biological therapy is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy and is commonly used to treat different kinds of ""'cancers'', as well as other conditions.' "
How does biological therapy work?,"""Biological therapy is a form of treatment that uses portions of the body's natural immune system to treat a disease. Biological therapy is also used to protect the body from some of the side effects of certain treatments.""'Biological therapy often involves the use of substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces these substances in small amounts in response to infection and disease. Using modern laboratory techniques, scientists can produce BRMs in large amounts for use in the treatment of ''cancer'' and other diseases, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease.""'Biological therapy may also target specific molecules on ''cancer'' cells to destroy the cells, or it may target proteins that facilitate the growth of ''cancer'' cells.''Depending on the agent, biological therapies can be given by mouth, intravenously, or as an injection.'  "
What are examples of biological therapies?,"'Monoclonal antibodies, ''interferon'', interleukin-2 (IL-2), and several types of colony-stimulating factors (CSF, GM- CSF, G-CSF) are forms of biological therapy. For example, interleukin-2 and interferon are two examples of BRMs being tested for the treatment of advanced ''malignant melanoma''.''Monoclonal antibodies are a common type of biological therapy for many different cancers and other conditions. These are laboratory-produced antibodies that are designed to attack specific proteins expressed by abnormal cells. Examples of monoclonal antibody ''drugs'' include ''rituximab'"", which is used to treat non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'', alemtuzumab (''Campath'') to treat ''chronic lymphocytic leukemia'' (CLL), and ipilimumab (Yervoy) for metastatic ''melanoma''.''Other kinds of monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancers target proteins that are responsible for cell growth. Examples of these drugs include bevacizumab (''Avastin''), which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix) to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and ''trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') and pertuzumab (Perjeta) to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER-2).''Modes of biologic therapy that involve blocking the action of specific proteins of inflammation, called ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF), are being used for the treatment of a number of diseases, including ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease. ""'Etanercept'' (''Enbrel'') and ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') are examples of commercially available injectable TNF-blocking treatments for patients with severe ''rheumatoid arthritis''.''Biological therapy is a very active and exciting area of cancer research.' "
What type of specialists administer biological therapy?,"'Biological therapies are prescribed by specialists who treat cancers (oncologists or hematologist-oncologists), as well as other specialists, including ''rheumatologists'' and gastroenterologists.' "
What are the side effects of biological therapy?,"'The side effects of biological therapy depend on the type of treatment. Side effects include ''flu-like symptoms'' such as ''chills'', ''fever'', muscle aches, ''weakness'', ''loss of appetite'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. Some patients develop a ''rash'', and some bleed or bruise easily. In addition, interleukin therapy can cause swelling.''Depending on how severe these problems are, hospitalization during treatment may be required for some patients. Side effects are usually short-term and gradually subside after treatment ends.''The long-term side effects of the various currently available biological therapies will be better defined with future research from which will also surely emerge new and valuable forms of these treatments.'  "
What is impetigo? Who gets it and how (causes) it?,"   Impetigo (pronounced im-puh-TIE-go) is a contagious, superficial infection of the skin caused by Staphylococcus (staph) and Streptococcus (strep) bacteria. Impetigo is more common in children (especially 2- to 5-year-olds) than in adults. Impetigo is most likely to occur in warm and humid environments and is most commonly spread by close contact (such as between family members). Many years ago the formal name for this disease was ""impetigo contageosum."" A rarely used ecthyma is the term for a rash similar to impetigo, but the infection penetrates the skin more deeply. (Its therapy is similar to impetigo.)"
Is impetigo contagious?,"'A bandage covering the infected area should be applied during this time.''The incubation period (the time between exposure to the bacteria and the first development of symptoms) depends on the infective bacteria. Strep-caused impetigo has a shorter incubation period (one to three days) than staph-caused impetigo (four to 10 days).'   Impetigo is generally thought to be contagious during the first 24 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy. If impetigo is caused by streptococci bacteria it iscontagious for about one to three days.  If impetigo is caused by staphylococci bacteria it is contagious for about four to 10 days. Impetigo is spread rimarily from direct contact with someone who has it, but sometimes from towels, toys, clothing, or household items. After starting in one location, impetigo often spreads to other parts of the body. This is particularly common with impetigo in children. There may be mini epidemics of impetigo in day care centers. Bacteria that cause impetigo may enter through a break in the skin, such as that which comes from cuts and scrapes. Heat, humidity, and the presence of eczema predispose a person to developing impetigo. Recurrent impetigo infections may be associated with staph or strep bacteria residing in the nose and spreading from to other parts of the skin. Impetigo is common in children 2-5 years old. The child will develop impetigo lesions at the nasal openings inflamed by the prominent nasal drainage associated with a cold. In this situation, skin integrity is often disrupted by the continuous covering of purulent nasal discharge. Adults often develop impetigo from close contact with infected children. "
"What are the symptoms, signs, and types types of impetigo? ","'There are two types of impetigo.'   Nonbullous impetigo: This is the more common form, caused by both staph and strep bacteria.This form of impetigo initially manifest as small red papules similar to insect bites.These contagious lesions rapidly evolve to small blisters and then to pustules that finally scab over with a characteristic honey-colored crust.This entire process usually takes about one week.These lesions often start around the nose and on the face, but less frequently they may also affect the arms and legs.At times, there may be non-tender but swollen lymph nodes (glands) nearby.

These contagious lesions rapidly evolve to small blisters and then to pustules that finally scab over with a characteristic honey-colored crust. This entire process usually takes about one week. These lesions often start around the nose and on the face, but less frequently they may also affect the arms and legs. At times, there may be non-tender but swollen lymph nodes (glands) nearby. Bullous impetigo: This form of impetigo is caused only by staph bacteria.These staph bacteria produce a toxin that reduces cell-to-cell stickiness (adhesion), causing separation between the top skin layer (epidermis) and the lower layer (dermis).This leads to the formation of a blister. (The medical term for blister is bulla.)Bullae can appear in various skin areas, especially the buttocks and trunk.These blisters are fragile and contain a clear yellow-colored fluid.The bullae are delicate and often break with the overlying ""roof"" of skin lost, leaving red, raw skin with a ragged edge.A dark crust will commonly develop during the final stages of development.With healing, this crust from impetigo resolves.

Impetigo is most likely to occur in warm and humid environments and is most commonly spread by close contact (such as between family members). Many years ago the formal name for this disease was ""impetigo contageosum."" A rarely used ecthyma is the term for a rash similar to impetigo, but the infection penetrates the skin more deeply. (Its therapy is similar to impetigo.)"
What tests and procedures diagnose impetigo?,"'Diagnosing an impetigo infection is generally straightforward and based on the clinical appearance. Occasionally, other conditions may look something like impetigo. Skin infections such as tinea (""''ringworm''"") or ''scabies'' (mites) may be confused with impetigo. It is important to note that not every sore or blister means an impetigo infection. At times, other infected and noninfected skin diseases produce blister-like ''skin inflammation''. Such conditions include ''herpes'' ''cold sores'', ''chickenpox'', ''poison ivy'', skin ''allergies'', ''eczema'', and ''insect bites''.''Secondary skin infections may sometimes occur. Medical evaluation and occasionally culture tests are used to decide whether topical antibacterial creams will suffice or whether oral antibiotics will be necessary.' "
What antibiotics treat impetigo?,"   An impetigo infection is not serious and is very treatable. Mild impetigo can be handled by gentle cleansing of the sores, removing crusts from the infected person, and applying the prescription-strength antibiotic ointment mupirocin (Bactroban). Nonprescription topical antibiotic ointments (such as Neosporin) generally are not effective. More severe or widespread impetigo, especially of bullous impetigo, may require oral antibiotic medication. I n recent years, more staph germs have developed resistance to standard antibiotics. Bacterial culture tests can help a doctor to guide the use of proper oral therapy if needed. Antibiotics which can be helpful include penicillin derivatives (such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [Augmentin]) and cephalosporins such as cephalexin (Keflex). If clinical suspicion is supported by culture results show other bacteria, such as drug-resistant staph (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA), other antibiotics such as clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim or Septra) may be necessary.  Treatment is guided by laboratory results (culture and sensitivity tests)."
What are the complications and prognosis of impetigo?,"'An excellent prognosis of complete cure and recovery of the infected area is anticipated when impetigo is treated. In fact, many specialists in infectious diseases would propose that a poor response to appropriate antibiotic therapy should raise concerns regarding the accuracy of the diagnosis.''A potentially serious but rare complication of impetigo caused by strep bacteria is glomerulonephritis, a condition producing kidney inflammation. Many specialists are not convinced that treating impetigo will prevent glomerulonephritis from occurring.' "
Will impetigo leave scars?,"'Because the crusts and blisters of impetigo are superficial, impetigo generally does not leave ''scars''. Affected skin looks red for a while after the crusts go away, but this redness fades in a matter of days to weeks. Once the skin has healed, ''sunscreen'' application is indicated.' "
Can you prevent impetigo?,'Routine hand washing with soap and warm water is an important and effective mechanism to prevent the spread of impetigo.' 
What types of specialists treat impetigo?,"'A primary care doctor -- pediatrician, family practice doctor, or internist -- can routinely manage evaluation and treatment of impetigo. If there are unusual health issues or no response to appropriate antibiotic therapy, a specialist in infectious diseases could be consulted.' "
What is impetigo?,"'Impetigo'' (''impetigo'' contagiosa) is a superficial bacterial infection most frequently observed in children 2-5 years of age, although adults may become infected. Lesions begin as ''papules'' (small ''bumps'') and then progress to small vesicles (''blisters'') surrounded by redness of the skin (usually on the face near the mouth and on extremities). Vesicles become larger and leak fluid, producing a characteristic golden crust on the lesions.'""There are two major types of impetigo: nonbullous (the most common type described above) and bullous impetigo, which is characterized by enlarged vesicles filled with a clear yellow fluid that becomes darkened and, when ruptured, forms a brownish crust. The patient's body (trunk) is often infected in contrast to nonbullous impetigo.""'Unlike impetigo, ecthyma is a more serious infection that penetrates deeply into the skin; it produces fluid or pus-filled sores that are painful. These sores can produce ulcers in the skin. This subtype is not often seen.' "
Is impetigo contagious?,"'Impetigo is a highly ''contagious'' disease. Impetigo is easily spread from person to person by direct contact with the lesions and/or indirectly by touching items (clothing, sheets, or toys) that have been used by individuals with this skin disease. Indirect transmission is less frequent than direct person-to-person transmission. Bacteria cause impetigo; group A streptococci and staphylococci are the organisms that most frequently cause impetigo.' "
What does impetigo look like? What is the incubation period for impetigo?,"'A person infected with impetigo usually starts out with irritating, itchy ''blisters'' that can develop pus. The incubation period is about one to three days for streptococci and about four to 10 days for staphylococci. The individual may also develop local ''lymph node'"" enlargement. Diagnosis of impetigo is often made clinically without special testing by the patient's history and physical examination and the appearance of the characteristic crusting lesions. However, the diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation and identification of the bacteria from the skin lesions."" "
How does impetigo spread?,"'Impetigo is spread mainly by person-to-person contact; it is rapidly spread through direct transmission in day-care centers and schools. Less frequently, the disease may be spread indirectly by contact with sheets, clothing, or toys contaminated by infected individuals. Impetigo is mainly confined to humans. Contact sports may spread impetigo; wrestling is considered to be the most likely sport to spread it, followed by football and rugby.' "
How will I know when someone is cured of impetigo? How long is the contagious period for impetigo?,"'Some individuals can self-cure impetigo over about a two-week period. An infected individual becomes cured or noncontagious after the sores go away. However, this time span may be reduced with appropriate topical antibiotics. Some individuals may require more aggressive treatment with oral antibiotics or, in severe infections (rare), IV antibiotics. With effective antibiotics, the person is usually considered noncontagious after about 24-48 hours of treatment.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about impetigo?,"""Some individuals benefit from topical antibiotic treatment; if you or your child is involved in an outbreak of impetigo, you should contact your physician or your child's pediatrician. If ""'fever'' develops or if the condition persists after about two to three days of treatment with no improvement, you should contact a physician. If the ''rash'' and lesions develop rapidly and become red, warm, and tender and/or red streaks develop, contact a physician urgently or go to an emergency department.'  "
What are the symptoms of impetigo?,"'Impetigo'' is a mild infection and can affect any part of the body. Mostly, it affects the nose and mouth or arms or legs.''Symptoms include''There are three types of ''impetigo''Call the doctor immediately, if you observe these' Red, itchy sores Leaks pus for a few days A yellow-colored scab formed over the sores Nonbullous impetigo: This is the most common form of impetigo caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria. It begins as small red papules that are similar to those of insect bites. These papules enlarge to small blisters and then to pustules that tend to break and form a golden crust. It takes about one week to develop. Sores are painless but itchy. Bullous impetigo: This type of impetigo is primarily seen in children and is caused due to S. aureus bacteria. It mainly affects the trunk and is characterized by the formation of blisters (bullae) with a clear yellow liquid, which later turns darker and turbid. Symptoms of fever and swollen glands may be observed with this type of impetigo. Ecthyma: This is characterized by a yellow, punched-out rash that extends deep through the skin. The rash is similar to impetigo and is a severe form of impetigo. Sores or rash that becomes more uncomfortable In case of ecthyma"
What is impetigo?,"'Impetigo is a ''contagious'' superficial bacterial infection of the skin. The two types of bacteria that cause impetigo are Staphylococcus and ''Streptococcus'', and they primarily infect children aged two to five years old. The bacteria infect the skin causing contagious sores. In earlier days, impetigo was known as “impetigo contageosum.”' "
Who is at risk for getting impetigo?,"'Individuals associated with the following factors may be at high risk of contracting impetigo' Age between two to five years Hot and humid climate or wet and dry seasons Scabies infection Close contact with the infected person Sharing an infected person’s clothes, towel, bedding or other objects Engaged in sports such as wrestling Skin problems such as eczema, insect bites or fungal infections Suppressed immunity"
How is impetigo diagnosed?,'The physician diagnoses impetigo based on the clinical appearance of the sores. Lab tests are usually not needed. A gram stain and culture of pus may be done to identify the strain of bacteria. Serologic testing may be recommended to identify the complications of impetigo.' 
How do you get rid of impetigo? ,"'It is recommended to get rid of impetigo as early as possible to prevent the spread of the infection.''Impetigo is a mild infection and it is treatable. Mostly, topical and oral antibiotics are used for treatment. The physician may recommend Bactroban (''mupirocin'') and Altabax (retapamulin) for topical use.\xa0''Physicians may recommend ''Bactrim'' (''trimethoprim''-''sulfamethoxazole'') to treat ''streptococcal infections'' and ''clindamycin'' or ''doxycycline'' to treat staphylococcus infections.' "
How do you prevent impetigo from spreading?,'Preventing impetigo is easy if you takes care of the following things:' Avoid scratching or touching the sores Do not share personal items with anyone and avoid using other’s items Avoid contact with newborn babies Cover the sores to avoid spreading Clean all wounds and cuts with soap and water Avoid spending time in hot pools and swimming pools in case of open wounds and infections Wash the clothes of an infected person daily Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds Use an alcohol-based sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable Dispose of used tissues in a waste bin Cough or sneeze into the upper sleeve or elbow
Introduction,"'Impingement syndrome'' is a common condition affecting the shoulder often seen in ''aging'' adults. This condition is closely related to ''shoulder bursitis'' and ''rotator cuff'' tendonitis. These conditions may occur alone or in combination.''In virtually all parts of your body, bones are the innermost structures and are surrounded by muscles. When an injury occurs to the ''rotator cuff'' muscles, they respond by swelling. However, because the rotator cuff muscles are surrounded by bone, when they swell, a series of other events occur.''The pressure within the muscles increases, which results in compression and loss of blood flow in the small blood vessels. When the blood flow decreases, the muscle tissue begins to fray like a rope. Motions such as reaching up behind the back and reaching up overhead to put on a coat or blouse, for example, may cause ''pain''.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Shoulder Impingement Syndrome?,"'The typical symptoms of impingement syndrome include difficulty reaching up behind the back, ''pain'' with overhead use of the arm and ''weakness'' of shoulder muscles.''If these muscles are injured for a long period of time, the muscle can actually tear in two, resulting in a ''rotator cuff tear''. This causes significant weakness and may make it difficult for the person to elevate his or her arm. Some people will have rupture of their biceps muscle as part of this continuing impingement process.'  "
How Is Impingement Syndrome Diagnosed?,'Diagnosis begins with a medical history and physical examination by your doctor. ''X-rays'' will be taken to rule out ''arthritis'' and may show changes in the bone that indicate injury of the muscle. ''Bone spurs'' or changes in the normal contour of the bone may be present. Impingement syndrome may be confirmed when an injection of a small amount of an anesthetic into the space under one of the shoulder bones relieves pain.' 
How Is Shoulder Impingement Syndrome Treated?,"'It is important to understand that the condition and not just the symptoms require treatment. Oral anti-inflammatory medications ?such as ''aspirin'', ''naproxen'' or ''ibuprofen'', remain the most common treatment for this condition.''You must consistently take the medication for nearly eight weeks for it to be effective. Taking anti-inflammatory medications for a short period of time may treat the symptom of pain, but it will not treat the underlying problem and symptoms will come back. There is no specific medication for this condition and response to any given medication differs from person to person. If one anti-inflammatory medication does not help within 10 to 14 days, then another one will be given until one that provides relief is found.''In addition to taking medications, daily stretching in a warm shower will help. Work to reach your thumb up and behind your back. Avoid repetitive activities with your injured arm, particularly where the elbow would move above shoulder level. Avoid vacuuming, painting, raking leaves and washing the car.''If you have persistent symptoms, despite the use of oral anti-inflammatory medications, your doctor may consider a cortisone-type injection. Cortisone is a potent anti-inflammatory medication, which should be used only when necessary because it can result in weakening of muscles and tendons.''If symptoms persist or if significant weakness is present, then your doctor may perform an ''MRI'' or arthrogram to rule out a rotator cuff tear. If the cuff is torn, surgery may be necessary to repair it.''The vast majority of people who have impingement syndrome are successfully treated with medication, stretching exercises and temporary avoidance of repetitive overhead activity until the condition settles down.'  "
What Side Effects are Associated With Treatment?,"'Upset stomach'', ''indigestion'' and ''headaches'' are the most common side effects of oral anti-inflammatory medications. However, taking these medications after meals or with food can help reduce stomach upset. Anti-inflammatory medicines also can cause ''vomiting'', ''constipation'' and bleeding in the stomach (ulcers), although these side effects are not common.''Side effects of cortisone shots depend on the dose and frequency of the injections. Unlike cortisone pills, occasional cortisone injections rarely cause serious side effects. However, possible side effects of cortisone include elevated blood ''sugar'"", a decrease in the body's resistance to infection, ""'weight gain'', ''osteoporosis'' (thinning of the bones), thinning of the skin and raised ''blood pressure''.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Rheumatic and Immunologic Diseases.''Edited by Michael W. Smith, MD, Sept. 2003.''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic'' 2000-2003.' "
What are implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs)?,"'An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a small electronic device installed inside the chest to prevent sudden death from cardiac arrest due to life threatening abnormally fast heart rhythms (tachycardias). The ICD is capable of monitoring the heart rhythm. When the heart is beating normally, the device remains inactive. If the heart develops a life-threatening tachycardia, the ICD can attempt pacing to bring the hear rhythm back to normal, or it can deliver an electrical ""''shock''(s)"" to the heart to terminate the abnormal rhythm and return the heart rhythm to normal.' "
How does a normal heart function?,"'The heart is an organ consisting of four chambers that pump blood. The two upper chambers are called the right and left atria, and the two lower chambers called the right and left ventricles. The ''right atrium'' receives venous blood (oxygen-poor blood) from the body and pumps it into the ''right ventricle''. The right ventricle pumps the oxygen-poor blood to the ''lungs'' to receive oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood from the lungs then travels to the ''left atrium'' and is pumped by the left ''atrium'' into the ''left ventricle''. The left ventricle delivers the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. In addition to oxygen, the blood carries other nutrients (glucose, ''electrolytes'', etc.) to the organs.'""In order to keep a body healthy, the heart must deliver a sufficient amount of blood to the body. As a pump, the heart is most efficient in delivering blood when functioning within a certain heart rate range. Normally, the heart's natural ""'pacemaker'' called the SA node (a special tissue located on the right atria wall), keeps the heartbeat (heart rate) in the normal range. Electrical signals generated by the SA node travel along special conduction tissues on the walls of the atria and the ventricles. These electrical signals cause the heart muscles to contract and pump blood in an orderly and efficient manner.' "
How do abnormal heart rhythms decrease blood delivery by the heart?,"'Abnormal heart rhythms'', either too slow or too fast, decrease the delivery of blood by the heart.  Bradycardia is a condition in which the heart rate is too slow. Bradycardias can be due to diseases of the SA node or the conduction tissues of the heart. The slow-beating heart delivers an insufficient amount of blood to the body. ''Tachycardia is a condition in which the heart rate is too rapid. When the heart pumps too fast, the ventricles do not have enough time to fill their chambers with blood before the next contraction. Therefore, tachycardias can decrease the amount of blood delivered to he body. One of the effects of decreased blood delivery to the body is ''low blood pressure''.' "
What is the cause of tachycardias?,'Abnormally fast heart rates are called tachycardias. Tachycardias are caused by rapidly firing electrical signals arising from the walls of the atria or the ventricles. These rapidly firing signals override the signals generated by the SA node and cause the heart to beat too fast.''Tachycardias caused by electrical signals from the atria are called atrial tachycardias. Tachycardias caused by electrical signals from the ventricles are called ventricular tachycardias.' 
What are the symptoms of tachycardias?,'Symptoms of tachycardias include:' Palpitations or fluttering sensations in the heart; Lightheadedness (due to low blood pressure); Fainting spells or loss of consciousness (due to low blood pressure); Fatigue and weakness (due to lack of blood supply); and A flushing sensation.
What are life-threatening tachycardias?,"'Two common life-threatening tachycardias are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular ''fibrillation''. Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid regular rhythm caused by electrical signals originating from an area of the ventricle. Ventricular tachycardia can decrease blood delivery by the heart and cause low ''blood pressure''. Ventricular tachycardia can also progress to a more serious heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation.''Ventricular fibrillation is an irregular rhythm, which is a result of multiple rapid and chaotic electrical signals firing from many different areas in the ventricles. A heart undergoing ventricular fibrillation is in a state of standstill called cardiac arrest. The heart muscles quiver and cease pumping which causes a halt in the delivery of blood to the body. Unless ventricular fibrillation is terminated quickly, irreversible ''brain damage'' occurs within minutes of the onset of ventricular fibrillation, leading to death.''Sudden cardiac arrest'' is the most common cause of death in the United States. The most frequent causes of cardiac arrest in the United States are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.' "
What are the causes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation?,"'Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are most commonly caused by ''heart attacks'' (acute myocardial infarctions) or scarring of the heart muscle from previous ''heart attacks''. Less common causes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation include severe weakening of the heart muscles (''cardiomyopathy''), medication toxicity (such as ''digoxin'' [''Lanoxin''] toxicity), medication side effects, and blood ''electrolyte'' disturbances (such as a ''low potassium'' level). Ironically, some medications used in treating heart rhythm abnormalities can cause ventricular tachycardias.' "
How can ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation be treated and prevented?,"'Medications have traditionally been used in preventing ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Examples of these medications include ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone'', Nextrone, Pacerone) and ''beta-blockers'' such as ''atenolol'' (''Tenormin''), and ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''). Medicines, however, are not very successful in preventing tachycardias or in terminating tachycardias once they occur.''Once a life threatening tachycardia occurs, the most effective treatment is to administer mild electric shock(s) to the heart to terminate the tachycardia and  reset the heart rhythm to normal.''If a patient is in cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, the treatment is the delivery of a strong electrical shock to the fibrillating heart without delay. Irreversible brain and other organ damages can occur within minutes if the normal heart rhythm is not restored. Most patients can potentially be saved if shocks are delivered quickly to convert the fibrillation to normal rhythm before irreversible brain damages occur.''The electrical shocks (mild and strong) that terminate ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation can be delivered by an external defibrillator (a portable unit with pads that deliver electrical shocks to the heart), or by an ''implantable cardiac defibrillator'' (ICD).  External defibrillators, however, may not be readily available, and rescuers may not be able to administer effective CPR for long periods before paramedics arrive. Therefore, in patients known to be at risk of developing life-threatening tachycardias, ICDs can be implanted in their chests as a preventive measure to terminate tachycardias and fibrillation and avert cardiac arrest.' "
Who should receive an implantable cardiac defibrillator?,"'Patients at risk of developing sudden cardiac arrests due to ventricular tachycardias and fibrillations are candidates for ICDs. ICDs do not prevent the occurrence of life-threatening rhythms, but can quickly terminate them when they occur. Recent ''clinical trials'' have identified several groups of patients who should receive ICDs. They are:' Patients who have survived cardiac arrest; Patients with ventricular tachycardias that significantly decrease the amount of blood delivered by the heart, resulting in low blood pressure; Patients with significant heart muscle damage from prior a heart attack, and have ventricular tachycardia episodes that are not suppressed by medications; and Patients deemed at high risk for sudden death from cardiac arrest based on a history of heart disease and findings from an echocardiogram and ECG."
How are implantable cardiac defibrillators designed?,"'An ICD consists of one or more leads (conducting wires insulated with silicone or polyurethane) and a defibrillator unit. The defibrillator unit is a small titanium case containing a microchip computer, a capacitor, and a battery.''The leads carry electrical signals between the heart and the defibrillator unit. One end of a lead is placed on the inner wall of the heart while the other end is attached to the defibrillator unit. The leads help the defibrillator unit monitor the natural heart rhythm. The leads also deliver electrical shock(s) from the defibrillator unit to the heart when tachycardias occur.''The microchip computer runs the defibrillator, monitors the natural heart rhythm, instructs the capacitor to send electrical shock(s) when tachycardias occur, determines the strength of the shock(s) sent, and also keeps a record of the heart rhythms as well as the shock(s) sent by the defibrillator.''ICDs have programmable features that allow the doctor to change the cutoff heart rate for activating the defibrillator. Tachycardias with rates higher than the cutoff heart rate activate the firing of shocks by the defibrillator. The doctor can also adjust the strength (amount of energy delivered) of each shock, and the number of shocks delivered with each tachycardia episode.''Most defibrillators now have built-in pacemakers as well. The newer defibrillators can have very sophisticated pacing devices equipped with the ability to pace both the ''atrium'' and the ventricle (dual chamber pacers). Cardioverter defibrillators have rapid pacing capabilities. Rapid pacing can sometimes convert a tachycardia to normal rhythm without administering electric shock(s).''The electric pulses and shocks delivered by the ICDs are of such low energy that they do not harm the patient or family members in physical contact with the patient.' "
How are implantable cardiac defibrillators implanted?,"'Implantation of an ICD is similar to that of a permanent pacemaker. The procedure, which lasts 1-2 hours, is considered minor in that it does not involve major heart surgery. Patients are typically sedated during the procedure. A local anesthetic is injected under the skin over the area where the ICD will be placed, usually in the right or left upper chest near the collarbone. The lead is then inserted into a vein located in the upper chest near the collarbone. The tip of the lead is placed on the inner wall of the heart with the visual guidance of ''x-rays''. If there is more than one lead, the process is repeated. The other end of the lead (or leads) is connected to the defibrillator unit, which is then inserted under the skin at the incision site. Because there are no nerve endings inside the blood vessels and the heart, the patient usually does not feel the placement of the lead(s).''Heavy sedation is used during the procedure when the defibrillator is tested for proper functioning. Testing an ICD involves inducing a rapid heart rhythm and allowing the defibrillator to detect the abnormal rhythm and then terminate it with a shock (just as the device would be expected to operate in a real-life tachycardia episode).' "
What happens after implantation of an implantable cardiac defibrillator?,"""While in the hospital, the patient's heart rhythms, pulse, and blood pressures are routinely monitored. The doctor may check or adjust the settings on the defibrillator (done from outside the body). The nurses also periodically examine the incision over the implantation site for bleeding, redness, or other signs of infection. It is normal to feel some ""'pain'' over the incision for 1-2 weeks. Medications are usually given to alleviate ''pain''.''Patients are typically discharged from the hospital the day after the procedure. Once home, the patient can usually return to most activities. Instructions are given to avoid raising the arm over the shoulder on the side of the ICD implantation for several weeks. This precaution is to avoid dislodging the leads before they become secure inside the veins and the heart. Patients are also asked to avoid contact sports, vigorous exercises, and heavy lifting for several weeks.''In a week, the ''sutures'"" over the incision are removed in the doctor's office. This is a good opportunity to discuss the following issues with the doctor:""'Call the doctor if there is bleeding from the incision site, increasing pain over the incision site, ''fever'', heat, swelling, or fluid draining from the incision site. Also call if the arm becomes swollen on the side of the implantation or if there is twitching of chest muscles, persistent ''hiccups'', ''dizziness'', ''fainting'', ''chest pain'', or ''shortness of breath''.' Level of physical activity; Return to work; Permission to drive automobiles; How frequently should the ICD and battery level be checked? What are the signs of device failure? When to replace the ICD (most ICD batteries last 3-7 years)? Precautions regarding interference with the device by outside power sources; and What to do when tachycardias occur."
What are the complications of implantable cardiac defibrillator implantation?,"'Common complications include pain, swelling, and minor bleeding at the implantation site. More serious complications are uncommon and typically occur less than 2% of the time. Serious complications include major bleeding requiring blood transfusions, introduction of air into the space between the lung and chest wall (''pneumothorax'') requiring tube drainage, perforation of the heart muscle by the leads, activation of an intractably fast heart rhythm, ''stroke'', heart attack, need for emergency heart surgery, and death. Although there are no official guidelines, ICDs should be implanted by or in conjunction with a cardiologist specially trained in clinical cardiac electrophysiology (electrical diseases of the heart).' "
What happens during a tachycardia episode after implantation of an Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator?,"'When the heart is beating normally, the ICD remains inactive. When tachycardia occurs, the patient typically experiences the symptoms of a fast heart rate. Since tachycardia can lower blood pressure and cause ''dizziness'' or fainting spells, the person should lie down or sit down until the symptoms pass. The ICD will either send a series of pacemaker-like weak electrical signals or one or more low energy shocks to convert the tachycardia to normal rhythm. The patient may not feel the pacemaker-like signals, while the low energy shocks may feel like thumps in the chest. Terminating a tachycardia with low energy shocks is called ''cardioversion''.''If ventricular fibrillation occurs, the patient may suddenly feel faint or lose consciousness due to lack of blood pressure and blood supply to the brain. The ICD, sensing the rapid and irregular rhythm, quickly sends a strong shock to terminate the rhythm. Terminating fibrillation with a strong electric shock is called ''defibrillation''. Successful defibrillation promptly restores consciousness. If unconsciousness lasts longer than 30 seconds, emergency 911 should be called.''The patient, or anyone available to assist, should also call emergency (911) if any of the following occur:' Symptoms of tachycardia persist after feeling the shock(s); Symptoms of tachycardia persist and the patient feels no shocks (possible ICD malfunction); or The patient feels a series of shocks in a row (possible ICD malfunction or recurrent attacks of tachycardias). Both conditions need prompt medical attention."
Living with an implantable cardiac defibrillator,"'After recovering fully from the ICD implantation, most patients can resume normal activities, including ''exercise'' and sex. The doctor should prescribe the type and intensity of the ''exercise''. The doctor also decides when the patient can return to work.'""Every patient is given an ICD identification card. The ID card contains information regarding the ICD and instructions in case of an emergency. The card should be carried in the patient's wallet at all times and shown to other doctors and dentists. Occasionally, it will need to be shown to security officers at the airport.""  "
What outside electrical sources are safe?,"'ICDs are well protected from most household electrical appliances in good condition such as radios, televisions, stereos, microwave ovens, electrical blankets, computers, vacuum cleaners, etc.' "
What outside electrical sources can interfere with the implantable cardiac defibrillator?,"'Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'' scan) is a diagnostic test for studying the brain, the joints, the spine, the ''liver'', and other organs. The strong magnetic field from the MRI scan can interfere with ICDs. Patients with ICDs should not undergo MRI scanning.''Digital cellular phones can interfere with ICDs. Therefore, the cellular phone should be held on the ear opposite from the side of the ICD. Do not carry the cellular phone in the pocket near the chest.''Theft detector gates in certain stores can generate signals that interfere with the ICD. While it is safe for patients with ICDs to quickly walk through these gates, they should not stand at or near the gates.''Similarly, the metal detector gates at airports can send strong signals that interfere with the ICDs. This problem can be avoided by presenting the ICD ID card to the security officers and ''walking'' around the gates. Hand held security wands (such as those used by airport security officers) have magnetic fields that can interfere with the device. Scanning by these wands should be avoided.''Heavy-duty electrical powered equipment, arc welders, a ''running'' car engine, and certain electrically powered surgical tools can also cause disturbances with the ICD. Patients should obtain permission from their doctors prior to driving a car or operating equipment which may fall into the above category.''Although a running car should not interfere with an ICD during driving, a patient should not lean over a running engine. Any other concerns and precautions should be discussed with your doctor.' "
What does the future hold for ICDs?,"'Implantable defibrillator technology continues to improve. The size of ICDs has decreased dramatically which makes the ICD easier to implant, less visible, and more comfortable. Other advances include not only technology improvements, but clinical trials that may expand the indications and uses for this exciting lifesaving device.' "
What is endometriosis?,"'Endometriosis is the abnormal growth of endometrial tissue similar to that which lines the interior of the uterus, but in a location outside of the uterus. Endometrial tissue is shed each month during menstruation. Areas of endometrial tissue found in ectopic locations are called endometrial implants. These lesions are most commonly found on the ovaries, the Fallopian tubes, the surface of the uterus, the bowel, and on the membrane lining of the pelvic ''cavity'' (i.e. the peritoneum). They are less commonly found to involve the vagina, cervix, and bladder. Rarely, endometriosis can occur outside the pelvis. Endometriosis has been reported in the ''liver'', brain, lung, and old surgical ''scars''. Endometrial implants, while they may become problematic, are usually benign (i.e. non-cancerous).' "
What are the stages of endometriosis?,"'Endometriosis is classified into one of four stages (I-minimal, II-mild, III-moderate, and IV-severe) based upon the exact location, extent, and depth of the endometriosis implants as well as the presence and severity of ''scar tissue'' and the presence and size of endometrial implants in the ovaries. Most cases of endometriosis are classified as minimal or mild, which means there are superficial implants and mild scarring. Moderate and severe endometriosis typically result in ''cysts'' and more severe scarring. The stage of endometriosis is not related to the degree of symptoms a woman experiences, but infertility is common with stage IV endometriosis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of endometriosis?,"'Most women who have endometriosis, in fact, do not have symptoms. Of those whom do, the most common symptoms include:''The intensity of the pain can vary from month to month, and can vary greatly among affected individuals. Some women experience progressive worsening of symptoms, while others can have resolution of pain without treatment.''Pelvic pain'' in women with endometriosis depends partly on where endometrial implants of endometriosis are located.''Endometriosis can be one of the reasons for infertility for otherwise healthy couples. When laparoscopic examinations are performed during evaluations for infertility, implants are often found in individuals who are totally asymptomatic. The reasons diminished ''fertility'' in many patients with endometriosis are not understood. Endometriosis may incite ''scar'' tissue formation within the pelvis. If the ovaries and Fallopian tubes are involved, the mechanical processes involved in the transfer of fertilized eggs into the tubes may be altered. Alternatively, the endometriotic lesions may produce inflammatory substances, which adversely affect ovulation, ''fertilization'', and implantation.''Other symptoms that can be related to endometriosis include''Rare symptoms of endometriosis include ''chest pain'' or ''coughing'' blood due to endometriosis in the ''lungs'' and ''headache'' and/or ''seizures'' due to endometriosis in the brain.'   Pain (usually pelvic) that usually occurs just before menstruation and lessens after menstruation Painful sexual intercourse Cramping during intercourse Cramping or pain during bowel movements or urination Infertility Pain with pelvic examinations Deeper implants and implants in areas of high nerve density are more apt to produce pain. The implants may also release substances into the bloodstream, which are capable of eliciting pain. Pain can result when endometriotic implants incite scarring of surrounding tissues. There appears to be no relationship between severity of pain and the amount of anatomical disease which is present. lower abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or constipation, low back pain, chronic fatigue irregular or heavy menstruation, painful urination, or bloody urine (particularly during menstruation)."
Does endometriosis increase a woman's risk of getting cancer?,"'Some studies have postulated that women with endometriosis have an increased risk for development of certain types of ''ovarian cancer'', known as epithelial ''ovarian cancer'' (EOC). This risk is highest in women with both endometriosis and primary infertility (those who have never conceived a pregnancy). The use of combination oral ''contraceptive'' pills (OCPs), which are sometimes used in the treatment of endometriosis, appears to significantly reduce this risk.''The reasons for the association between endometriosis and ovarian epithelial ''cancer'' are not clearly understood. One theory is that the endometriosis implants themselves undergo ''malignant'' transformation to ''cancer'"". Another possibility is that the presence of endometriosis may be related to other genetic or environmental factors that serve to increase a women's risk of developing ""'ovarian cancer''.' "
What causes endometriosis?,"'The cause of endometriosis is unknown. One theory is that the endometrial tissue is deposited in unusual locations by the retrograde flow of menstrual debris through the Fallopian tubes into the pelvic and abdominal ''cavities''. The cause of this retrograde menstruation is not clearly understood. It is clear that retrograde menstruation is not the only cause of endometriosis, as many women who have retrograde menstruation do not develop the condition.''Another possibility is that areas lining the pelvic organs possess primitive cells that are able to develop into other forms of tissue, such as ''endometrium''. (This process is termed coelomic metaplasia.)''It is also likely the direct transfer of endometrial tissues at the time of surgery may be responsible for the endometriosis implants occasionally found in surgical scars (for example, ''episiotomy'' or Cesarean section scars). Transfer of endometrial cells via the bloodstream or lymphatic system is the most plausible explanation for the rare cases of endometriosis that are found in the brain and other organs remote from the pelvis.'""Finally, there is evidence that some women with endometriosis have an altered immune response in women with endometriosis, which may affect the body's natural ability to recognize ectopic endometrial tissue."" "
Does endometriosis cause infertility?,"'Endometriosis is more common in ''infertile'' women, as opposed to those who have conceived a pregnancy. However, many women with confirmed endometriosis are able to conceive without difficulty, particularly if the disease is mild or moderate. It is estimated that up to 70% of women with mild or moderate endometriosis will conceive within three years without any specific treatment.''The reasons for a decrease in fertility when endometriosis is present are not completely understood. It is likely that both anatomical and hormonal factors are contributory to diminished fertility. The presence of endometriosis may incite significant scar (adhesion) formation within the pelvis, which can distort normal anatomical structures. Alternatively, endometriosis may affect fertility through the production of inflammatory substances that have a negative effect on ovulation, fertilization of the egg, and/or implantation of the embryo. Infertility associated with endometriosis is more common in women with anatomically severe forms of the disease.''Treatment options for infertility associated with endometriosis are varied, but most doctors believe that surgery is superior to medical treatment for endometriosis. When appropriate, assisted reproductive technology may also be used as an adjunct or an alternative to surgical therapy.'  "
Does diet affect endometriosis?,"'There is no data that is well-established that show that dietary modifications can either prevent or reduce the symptoms of endometriosis. One study showed that a high consumption of green vegetables and fruit was associated with a lower risk of developing endometriosis, while a higher intake of red meats was associated with a higher risk. No association was seen with ''alcohol'', milk, or coffee consumption. Further studies are needed to determine whether ''diet'' plays a role in the development of endometriosis.'  "
Is there a test to diagnose endometriosis?,"'Obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) are the type of doctors that commonly treat endometriosis .''Endometriosis can be suspected based on symptoms of pelvic pain and findings during physical examinations. Occasionally, during a rectovaginal exam (one finger in the vagina and one finger in the rectum), the doctor can feel nodules (endometrial implants) behind the uterus and along the ligaments that attach to the pelvic wall. At other times, no nodules are felt, but the examination itself causes unusual pain or discomfort.''Unfortunately, neither the symptoms nor the physical examinations can be relied upon to conclusively establish the diagnosis of endometriosis. Imaging studies, such as ''ultrasound'', can be helpful in ruling out other pelvic diseases and may suggest the presence of endometriosis in the vaginal and bladder areas, but they cannot reliably diagnose endometriosis. For an accurate diagnosis, a direct visual inspection inside of the pelvis and abdomen, as well as tissue biopsy of the implants are necessary.''As a result, the only definitive method for diagnosing endometriosis is surgical. This requires either laparoscopy or laparotomy (opening the abdomen using a large incision).''Laparoscopy is the most common surgical procedure most commonly employees used for the diagnosis of endometriosis. This is a minor surgical procedure performed under general anesthesia, or in some cases under local anesthesia. It is usually performed as an outpatient procedure (the patient does not stay in the facility overnight). Laparoscopy is performed by first inflating the abdominal ''cavity'' with carbon dioxide through a small incision in the navel. A thin, tubular viewing instrument (laparoscope) is then inserted into the inflated abdominal cavity to inspect the abdomen and pelvis. Endometrial implants can then be directly seen.''During laparoscopy, biopsies (removal of tiny tissue samples for examination under a microscope) can also be performed in order to obtain a tissue diagnosis. Sometimes random biopsies obtained during laparoscopy will show microscopic endometriosis, even though no implants are visualized.''Pelvic ultrasound and laparoscopy are also important in excluding malignancies (such as ovarian ''cancer'') which can cause many of the same symptoms that mimic endometriosis symptoms.'  "
What is the treatment for endometriosis?,'Endometriosis can be treated with medications and/or surgery. The goals of endometriosis treatment may include symptom relief and/or enhancement of fertility.'  
NSAIDs and GnRH analogs,"'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' or ''NSAIDs'' (such as ''ibuprofen'' or ''naproxen'' sodium) are commonly prescribed to help relieve pelvic pain and menstrual cramping. These pain-relieving medications have no effect on the endometrial implants or the progression of endometriosis. However, they do decrease prostaglandin production, and prostaglandins are well known to have a role in the causation of pain. As the diagnosis of endometriosis can only be definitively confirmed with a biopsy, many women with complaints suspected to arise from endometriosis are treated for pain first without a firm diagnosis being established. Under such circumstances, NSAIDs are commonly used as a first line empirical treatment. If they are effective in controlling the pain, no other procedures or medical treatments are needed. If they are ineffective, additional evaluation and treatment will be necessary.''Since endometriosis occurs during the reproductive years, many of the available medical treatments for endometriosis rely on interruption of the normal cyclical hormone production by the ovaries. These medications include GnRH analogs, oral contraceptive pills, and progestins.''Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRH analogs) have been effectively used to relieve pain and reduce the size of endometriosis implants. These drugs suppress estrogen production by the ovaries by inhibiting the secretion of regulatory hormones from the ''pituitary gland''. As a result, menstrual periods stop, mimicking ''menopause''. Nasal and injection forms of GnRH agonists are available.''The side effects are a result of the lack of estrogen, and include:''Fortunately, by adding back small amounts of ''progesterone'' in pill form (similar to treatments sometimes used for symptom relief in ''menopause''), many of the annoying side effects due to estrogen deficiency can be avoided. ""Add back therapy"" is a term that refers to this modern way of administering GnRH agonists along with progesterone in a way to ensure compliance by eliminating most of the unwanted side effects of GnRH therapy.' hot flashes, vaginal dryness, irregular vaginal bleeding, mood alterations, fatigue, and loss of bone density (osteoporosis)."
Progestins,"'Progestins, for example, ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate (''Provera'', Cycrin, Amen), ''norethindrone'' acetate, and norgestrel acetate (''Ovrette''), are more potent than ''birth control pills'' and are recommended for women who do not obtain pain relief from or cannot take a ''birth control pill''. They may be helpful in women who do not respond, or cannot take (for medical reasons) ''oral contraceptives''.' Breast tenderness Bloating Weight gain Irregular uterine bleeding Depression"
Birth control pills (oral contraceptives),"'Oral contraceptive pills (estrogen and progesterone in combination) are also sometimes used to treat endometriosis. The most common combination used is in the form of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP). Sometimes women who have severe menstrual pain are asked to take the OCP continuously, meaning skipping the placebo (hormonally inert) portion of the cycle. Continuous use in this manner will generally stop menstruation altogether. Occasionally, weight gain, breast tenderness, ''nausea'', and irregular bleeding may occur. Oral contraceptive pills are usually well tolerated in women with endometriosis.' "
Aromatase inhibitors and other drugs,"'A more current approach to the treatment of endometriosis has involved the administration of drugs known as aromatase inhibitors (for example, ''anastrozole'' [''Arimidex''] and ''letrozole'' [''Femara'']). These drugs act by interrupting local estrogen formation within the endometriosis implants themselves. They also inhibit estrogen production within the ovary and adipose tissue. Research is ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors in the management of endometriosis. Aromatase inhibitors can cause significant bone loss with prolonged usage. In premenopausal women, these drugs must be taken in combination with other drugs because of the drug’s effect on the ovaries.''Danazol'' (''Danocrine'') is a synthetic drug that creates a high ''androgen'' (male type hormone) and low estrogen hormonal environment by interfering with ovulation and ovarian production of estrogen. Eighty percent of women who take this drug will have pain relief and shrinkage of endometriosis implants, but up to 75% of women develop significant side effects from the drug. These include:' Weight gain Edema (swelling) Breast shrinkage Acne Oily skin Male pattern hair growth (Hirsutism) Deepening of the voice Headache Hot flashes Changes in libido Mood alterations"
Can surgery cure endometriosis?,"'Surgical treatment for endometriosis can be useful when the symptoms are severe or there has been an inadequate response to medical therapy. Surgery is the preferred treatment when there is anatomic distortion of the pelvic organs or obstruction of the bowel or urinary tract. It may be classified either as conservative, in which the uterus and ovarian tissue are preserved, or definitive, which involves ''hysterectomy'' (removal of the uterus), with or without removal of the ovaries.''Conservative surgery is typically performed laparoscopically. Endometrial implants may be excised or destroyed by different sources of energy (e.g. laser, electrical current). If the disease is extensive and anatomy is distorted, laparotomy may be required.''While surgical treatments can be very effective in the reduction of pain, the recurrence rate of endometriosis following conservative surgical treatment has been estimated to be as high as 40%. Many doctors recommend ongoing medical therapy following surgery in an attempt to prevent symptomatic disease recurrence.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat endometriosis?,'Endometriosis is most commonly treated by obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs).' 
Who gets endometriosis?,"'Endometriosis affects women during their reproductive years. The exact prevalence of endometriosis is not known, since many women who are later identified as having the condition are asymptomatic. Endometriosis is estimated to affect over one million women (estimates range from 3% to 18% of women) in the United States. It is one of the leading causes of pelvic pain and it is responsible for many of the laparoscopic procedures and hysterectomies performed by gynecologists. Estimates suggest that 20% to 50% of women being treated for infertility have endometriosis, and up to 80% of women with chronic pelvic pain may be affected.''While most cases of endometriosis are diagnosed in women aged 25 to 35 years, endometriosis has been reported in girls as young as 11 years of age. Endometriosis is rare in ''postmenopausal'' women. Studies further suggest that endometriosis is most common in taller, thin women with a low body mass index (''BMI''). Delaying pregnancy until an older age, never giving birth, early onset of menses, and late ''menopause'' all have been shown to be risk factors for endometriosis. It also is likely that there are genetic factors which predispose a woman to developing endometriosis, since having a first-degree relative with the condition increases the chance that a woman will develop the condition.' "
What is the prognosis for a woman with endometriosis?,"""Endometriosis is most commonly a disease of the reproductive years, and symptoms usually go away after a woman reaches menopause. For women experiencing symptoms, a number of therapies are available to provide relief. For infertility associated with endometriosis, treatments are also available to help increase a woman's chances of ""'conception''.' "
Can endometriosis be prevented?,"'Because the cause of endometriosis is poorly understood, there are no known ways to prevent its development.' "
What is erectile dysfunction (ED)?,"'Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as ''impotence'"", is the inability to achieve or sustain a hard enough erection for satisfactory completion of sexual activity. Erectile dysfunction is different from other health conditions that interfere with male sexual function, such as lack of sexual desire (decreased libido) and problems with ejaculation release of the fluid from the penis (ejaculatory dysfunction) and orgasm/climax (orgasmic dysfunction), and penile curvature (Peyronie's disease), although these problems may also be present. ED affects about 50% of men age 40 and over. This article focuses on the evaluation and treatment of erectile dysfunction."" "
What is normal penis anatomy?,"'The penis contains three cylinders, the two ''corpora cavernosa'', which are on the top of the penis (see figure 1 below). These two cylinders are involved in erections. The third cylinder contains the urethra, the tube that the urine and ejaculate passes through, runs along the underside of the penis. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra. Spongy tissue that has muscles, fibrous tissues, veins, and arteries within it makes up the corpora cavernosa. The inside of the corpora cavernosa is like a sponge, with potential spaces that can fill with blood and distend (known as sinusoids). A layer of tissue that is like Saran Wrap, called the tunica albuginea, surrounds the corpora. Veins located just under the tunica albuginea drain blood out of the penis.' "
How common is erectile dysfunction?,"'Erectile dysfunction (ED, impotence) varies in severity; some cannot have an erection at all, whereas other men sometimes have troubles getting a hard erection, and others get a hard erection but it only lasts for a short period of time. Approximately 50% of men over the age of 40 have troubles with erectile dysfunction.''While erectile dysfunction can occur at any age, the risk of developing erectile dysfunction increases with age. According to the Massachusetts Male ''Aging'' Study, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 52% in men 40-70 years of age. The prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction increases from 5% at 40 years of age to 15% among men 70 years of age and older.'  "
How does erection occur?,"'Erections are neurovascular events, meaning that nerves and blood vessels (arteries and veins) are involved in the process of an erection and all must work properly to develop a hard erection that lasts long enough. Erection begins with sexual stimulation. Sexual stimulation can be tactile (for example, by a partner touching the penis or by ''masturbation'') or mental (for example, by having sexual fantasies, viewing porn). Sexual stimulation or sexual arousal causes the nerves going to the penis to release a chemical, nitric oxide. Nitric oxide increases the production of another chemical, cyclic GMP (cGMP), in the muscle of the corpora cavernosa. The cGMP causes the muscles of the corpora cavernosa to relax, and this allows more blood to flow into the penis. The incoming blood fills the corpora cavernosa, making the penis expand.' "
How does a man sustain an erection?,"'As blood flows into the penis, the corpora cavernosa swell, and this swelling compresses the veins (blood vessels that drain the blood out of the penis) against the tunica albuginea. Compression of the veins prevents blood from leaving the penis. This creates a hard erection. When the amount of cGMP decreases by the action of a chemical called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the muscles in the penis tighten, and the blood flow into the penis decreases. With less blood coming into the penis, the veins are not compressed, allowing blood to drain out of the penis, and the erection goes down.' "
What causes erectile dysfunction?,"'The ability to achieve and sustain erections requires the following:'""Erectile dysfunction can occur if a man doesn't meet one or more of these requirements. The following are 13 common causes of erectile dysfunction, and many men have more than one potential cause:"" 

Read Doctor's View
   A healthy nervous system that conducts nerve impulses in the brain, spinal column, and penis Healthy arteries in and near the corpora cavernosa that when stimulated can bring increased blood flow into the penis Healthy muscles and fibrous tissues within the corpora cavernosa, which can distend to allow the penis to fill with blood Adequate levels of nitric oxide in the penis Normal-functioning tunica albuginea that allows for compression of the veins Appropriate psychosocial interactions Aging: There are two reasons why older men are more likely to experience erectile dysfunction than younger men. First, older men are more likely to develop diseases (such as heart attacks, angina, cardiovascular disease, strokes, diabetes mellitus, and high blood pressure) that are associated with erectile dysfunction. Second, the aging process alone can cause erectile dysfunction in some men by causing changes in the muscle and tissue within the penis. Diabetes mellitus: Erectile dysfunction tends to develop 10 to 15 years earlier in diabetic men than among nondiabetic men. The increased risk of erectile dysfunction among men with diabetes mellitus may be due to the earlier onset and greater severity of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) that narrows the arteries and thereby reduces the delivery of blood to the penis. Atherosclerosis can affect the arteries in the penis, as well as the arteries in the pelvis that supply the penile arteries. Diabetes mellitus also causes erectile dysfunction by damaging nerves that go to the penis, much like the effect of diabetes on nerves in other areas of the body (diabetic neuropathy). Diabetes can also affect the muscles in the penis, leading to troubles with erections. Smoking cigarettes, obesity, poor control of blood glucose levels, and having diabetes mellitus for a long time further increase the risk of erectile dysfunction in people with diabetes. Hypertension (high blood pressure): Men with high blood pressure have an increased risk of developing erectile dysfunction. Hypertension can cause trouble with erections related to atherosclerosis or from low levels of nitric oxide production from the arteries in the penis. Medications to treat hypertension may cause erectile dysfunction. Cardiovascular diseases: The most common cause of cardiovascular diseases in the United States is atherosclerosis, the narrowing, and hardening of arteries that reduces blood flow. Atherosclerosis (a type of vascular disease) typically affects arteries throughout the body; hypertension, high blood cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus aggravate atherosclerosis. Hardening of the arteries to the penis and pelvic organs, atherosclerosis, causes insufficient blood flow into the penis. There is a close correlation between the severity of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries and erectile dysfunction. For example, men with more severe coronary artery atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries in the heart) also tend to have more erectile dysfunction than men with mild or no coronary artery atherosclerosis. Some doctors suggest that men with new onset erectile dysfunction undergo evaluation for silent coronary artery diseases (advanced coronary artery atherosclerosis that has not yet caused angina or heart attacks). Metabolic syndrome is associated with multiple risk factors for erectile dysfunction including diabetes, abnormal lipid profile, hypertension, and obesity. Cigarette smoking: Cigarette smoking aggravates atherosclerosis and can cause vasospasm (spasms of the arteries) and thereby increases the risk for erectile dysfunction. Nerve or spinal cord damage: Damage to the spinal cord and nerves in the pelvis can cause erectile dysfunction. Nerve damage can be due to disease, trauma, or surgical procedures. Examples include injury to the spinal cord from automobile accidents, injury to the pelvic nerves from prostate surgery for cancer (prostatectomy), and some surgeries for colorectal cancer, radiation to the prostate, surgery for benign prostatic enlargement, multiple sclerosis (a neurological disease with the potential to cause widespread damage to nerves), and long-term diabetes mellitus. BPH: Benign enlargement of the prostate is associated with erectile dysfunction. Trauma: Trauma to the pelvis, including pelvic fracture, may cause erectile dysfunction, and an untreated penile fracture may result in erectile dysfunction. Substance abuse: Marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines, crystal meth, and narcotic and alcohol abuse contribute to erectile dysfunction. Alcoholism, in addition to causing nerve damage, can lead to atrophy (shrinking) of the testicles and lower testosterone levels. Low testosterone levels: Testosterone (the primary sex hormone in men) is not only necessary for sex drive (libido) but also is necessary to maintain nitric oxide levels in the penis. Therefore, men with hypogonadism (low testosterone with symptoms) can have a low sex drive and erectile dysfunction. Medications: Many common medicines produce erectile dysfunction as a side effect. Medicines that can cause erectile dysfunction include many used to treat high blood pressure, antihistamines, antidepressants, tranquilizers, and appetite suppressants. Examples of common medicines that can cause erectile dysfunction include propranolol (Inderal) or other beta-blockers, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin (Lanoxin), amitriptyline (Elavil), famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), metoclopramide (Reglan), naproxen, indomethacin (Indocin), lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Isoptin), phenytoin (Dilantin), gemfibrozil (Lopid), amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (Adderall), and phentermine. Prostate cancer medications that lower testosterone levels such as leuprolide (Lupron) may affect erectile function. Some chemotherapies such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) may affect erectile function. Recreational drugs: Recreational drugs, including alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, marijuana, nicotine, heroin, and cocaine, are associated with erectile dysfunction. Depression and anxiety: Psychological factors may be responsible for erectile dysfunction. These factors include stress, anxiety, guilt, depression, widower syndrome, low self-esteem, posttraumatic stress disorder, and fear of sexual failure (performance anxiety). It is also worth noting that many medications used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders may cause erectile dysfunction or ejaculatory problems."
What are erectile dysfunction risk factors?,"'The common risk factors for ED include the following:'   Advanced age Cardiovascular disease Hypertension Diabetes mellitus High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Recreational drug use Depression or other psychiatric disorders Pelvic surgery, including radical prostatectomy and colorectal surgery Pelvic radiation, such as for prostate cancer and some colorectal cancers Trauma to the pelvis (pelvic fracture), penis (penile fracture), and perineum"
What are erectile dysfunction symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of erectile dysfunction may include the following:' Penile erection occurs, but the penis does not remain hard enough for completion of sex. Penile erections are not hard enough for penetration. There is an inability to obtain a penile erection. One can still achieve an orgasm and ejaculate with erectile dysfunction."
How do health care professionals diagnose erectile dysfunction?,"'Physicians make a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction in men who complain of troubles having a hard enough erection or a hard erection that does not last long enough. It is important as you talk with your doctor that you be candid in terms of when your troubles started, how bothersome your erectile dysfunction is, how severe it is, and discuss all your medical conditions along with all prescribed and nonprescribed medications that you are taking. Your doctor will ask several questions to determine if your symptoms are suggestive of erectile dysfunction and to assess its severity and possible causes. Your doctor will try to get information to answer the following questions:''The physical examination can reveal clues for physical causes of erectile dysfunction. A doctor will perform an assessment of ''BMI'' and waist circumference to evaluate for abdominal obesity. A genital examination is part of the evaluation of erectile dysfunction. The examination will focus on the penis and testes. The doctor will ask you about penile curvature and will examine the penis to see if there are any plaques (hard areas) palpable. The doctor will examine the testes to make sure they are in the proper location in the scrotum and are normal in size. Small testicles, lack of facial hair, and enlarged breasts (''gynecomastia'') can point to hormonal problems such as hypogonadism with low testosterone levels. A health care provider may check pulses in your groin and ''feet'' to determine if there is a suggestion of hardening of the arteries that could also affect the arteries to the penis.'""The lab testing obtained for the evaluation of erectile dysfunction may vary with the information obtained on the health history, physical examination, and recent lab testing. A testosterone level is not necessary in all men; however, a physician will order labs to determine a patient's testosterone level if other signs and symptoms of hypogonadism (low testosterone) such as decreased libido, loss of body hair, muscle loss, breast enlargement, ""'osteoporosis'', ''infertility'', and decreased penile/testicular size are present.''A doctor may ask for the following laboratory tests in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction:''Health care professionals do not routinely obtain imaging tests in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction.''Ultrasound'' with Doppler imaging (ultrasound plus evaluation of blood flow in the arteries and veins) can provide additional information about blood flow of the penis and may help in the evaluation of patients prior to surgical intervention. This study is typically performed after the injection of a chemical that causes the arteries to open up, a vasodilator (prostaglandin E1), into the corpora cavernosa in order to cause dilation of blood vessels and promote blood flow into the penis. The rate of blood flow into the penis can be measured along with an evaluation of problems with compression of the veins.''Rarely, a doctor may perform an ''angiogram'' (injecting a dye into the arteries that supply the penis and taking ''X-rays'' to look for areas of narrowing of the arteries) in cases in which possible vascular surgery could be beneficial.''Monitoring erections that occur during sleep (''nocturnal'' penile tumescence) can help you and your doctor to understand if the erectile dysfunction is due to psychological or physical causes. The nocturnal penile tumescence test is a study to evaluate erections at night. Normally men have three to five erections per eight hours of sleep. The test can be performed at home or in a sleep lab. The most accurate way to perform the test involves a special device that is connected to two rings. The rings are placed around the penis, one at the tip of the penis and the other at the bottom (base) of the penis. The device records how many erections occur, how long they last, and how rigid they are. The test is limited in that it does not assess the ability to penetrate.''If there seems to be a psychological cause contributing to your erectile dysfunction, the doctor may ask the patient questions to help determine stressor, events, and relationship issues that may be causing your erectile troubles. It may be helpful to have your sexual partner involved in this assessment.' Is the patient suffering from erectile dysfunction or from some other form of sexual dysfunction such as loss of libido or a disorder of ejaculation (for example, premature ejaculation) or orgasm, or problems with penile curvature/pain (Peyronie's disease)? Is your erectile dysfunction due to psychological (stress, relationship problems, etc.) or physical factors? Your doctor may ask if you note erections at night or in the early morning. Men have involuntary erections in the early morning and during REM sleep (a stage in the sleep cycle with rapid eye movements). Men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction (erectile dysfunction due to psychological factors such as stress and anxiety rather than physical factors) usually maintain these involuntary erections. Men with physical causes of erectile dysfunction (for example, atherosclerosis, smoking, and diabetes) usually do not have these involuntary erections. Men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction may relate the onset of problems to a ""stressor,"" such as failed relationship. Your doctor may suggest a test to determine if you have erections during sleep, which may suggest that there may be a psychological cause of the erectile dysfunction. 3. Are there physical causes of erectile dysfunction? Erectile dysfunction may be a symptom of underlying medical conditions, which if not detected may cause further medical problems. A prior history of cigarette smoking, heart attacks, strokes, and poor circulation in the extremities (for example, intermittent claudication or cramping in your leg[s] when you walk) suggest atherosclerosis as the cause of the erectile dysfunction. Loss of sexual desire and drive, lack of sexual fantasies, gynecomastia (enlargement of breasts), and diminished facial hair suggest low testosterone levels. A prior history of pelvic surgery or radiation and trauma to the penis/pelvis/perineum can cause problems with the nerves and blood vessels. Symptoms of intermittent claudication of the lower extremities with exercise may suggest a vascular problem as a cause of the erectile dysfunction. Is the patient taking medications that can contribute to erectile dysfunction (see causes above), including prescribed, over-the-counter, or recreational drugs? It is important to discuss your prescribed medications, as well as over-the-counter medications and drugs of abuse such as opiates, alcohol, etc. Complete blood counts Urinalysis: A high level of sugar (glucose) in the urine may be a sign of diabetes mellitus, and high protein in the urine may suggest kidney damage, which can cause erectile troubles. Lipid profile: High levels of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in the blood can cause atherosclerosis. Blood glucose levels: Abnormally high blood glucose (sugar) levels may be a sign of diabetes mellitus. Blood hemoglobin A1C: Abnormally high levels of blood hemoglobin A1C in patients with diabetes mellitus indicate that there is poor control of blood glucose levels. Serum creatinine: An abnormal serum creatinine, a chemical that reflects kidney function, may be the result of kidney damage. Liver enzymes and liver function tests: Liver disease (cirrhosis) can cause low testosterone. Thus, a physician may need to test some men for liver disease. Total testosterone levels: Health care professionals should obtain a patient's blood samples for total testosterone levels in the early morning (before 8 a.m.) because the testosterone levels go up and down throughout the day. If you have a low testosterone level, a health care professional should check it again to confirm that it is truly low. In some men, a specialized test measuring the active form of testosterone (free or bioavailable testosterone) may be recommended. Other hormone levels: Measurement of other hormones beside testosterone (luteinizing hormone [LH], prolactin level, and cortisol level) may provide clues to other underlying causes of testosterone deficiency and erectile problems, such as pituitary disease or adrenal gland abnormalities. Doctors may check thyroid levels in some individuals as both hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid function) can contribute to erectile dysfunction. PSA levels: PSA (prostate specific antigen) blood levels and prostate examination to exclude prostate cancer is important before starting testosterone treatment since testosterone can aggravate prostate cancer. Other blood tests: Evaluation for hemochromatosis, lupus, scleroderma, zinc deficiency, sickle cell anemia, and cancers (leukemia, colon cancer) are some of the other potential tests that a physician may perform based on each individual's health history and symptoms."
What drugs treat erectile dysfunction?,"'A number of medical treatment options exist for erectile dysfunction include the following:''A doctor can help decide what medication(s) may be the best for the patient. This is an important step to do so the doctor can help choose the best and safest drug(s) and other treatments so that men with other medical problems can get individualized care appropriate for their medical conditions.' Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil [Viagra], vardenafil [Levitra and the generic formulation Staxyn], tadalafil [Cialis]), and avanafil [Stendra]) Intracavernosal injections (papaverine, phentolamine, and PGE1 [Trimix], Bimix, and alprostadil injection [Caverject, Edex]) Intraurethral suppositories (MUSE) Testosterone in individuals with ED and other signs/symptoms of hypogonadism and an unequivocally low serum testosterone"
What is the treatment for erectile dysfunction?,"'The following are treatment options for erectile dysfunction:''Many common medications for treating hypertension, depression, and high blood ''lipids'' (''high cholesterol'') can contribute to erectile dysfunction (see above). Treatment of hypertension is an example. There are many different types (classes) of ''medications for high blood pressure''; these include beta-blockers, ''calcium channel blockers'', diuretics (medications that increase urine volume), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (''ACE inhibitors''), and angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs''). Patients may use these medications alone or in combination to control blood pressure. Some of these medications can cause troubles with erections. For example, Inderal (a ''beta-blocker'') and hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) cause erectile dysfunction, while calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors do not seem to affect erectile function. On the other hand, other medications (such as angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB] including ''losartan'' [''Cozaar''] and ''valsartan'' [''Diovan'']) may actually help with erections. Therefore, if possible, you may benefit from changing your medications, but this requires approval by your prescribing health care provider.''Quitting smoking, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, curtailing excessive alcohol consumption, controlling hypertension, and optimizing blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes are not only important for maintaining good health but also may improve or even prevent progression of erectile dysfunction. It is unclear if such lifestyle changes can reverse erectile dysfunction. However, lifestyle improvements may prevent progression of the erectile dysfunction. Some studies suggest that men who have made lifestyle improvements experience increased rates of success with oral medications.'

What are erectile dysfunction treatments for men with cardiovascular disease?,"'ED is often the result of atherosclerosis, and as a result, men with ED frequently have cardiovascular disease. Sexual activity is associated with increased physical exertion, which in some men may increase the risk of having a ''heart attack'' (''myocardial infarction'' or MI). The major risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease are age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, abnormal lipid/cholesterol levels in the blood, and lack of ''exercise''. Individuals with three or more of these risk factors are at increased risk for a heart attack during sexual activity. The Princeton Consensus Panel developed guidelines for treating ED in men with cardiovascular disease. Thus, if you have ED and cardiovascular disease (for example, angina or prior heart attack), you should discuss whether or not treatment of ED and sexual activity are appropriate for you.' "
Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors,"'The common PDE5 inhibitor drugs approved in the United States are sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra and Staxyn, the generic form), tadalafil (Cialis), or avanafil (Stendra). All of the currently approved PDE5 inhibitors work in the same way. They differ in the number of available doses, how quickly they work and last in your system, the dosing, and to some extent in the side effects. However, they generally share the same indications and contraindications. Currently, tadalafil is the only medication that patients can take on a daily basis and is approved for the treatment of both ED and ''BPH'' (benign enlargement of the prostate).''When sexually stimulated there is a release of a chemical, nitric oxide (NO) in the blood vessels of the corpus cavernosum. The NO stimulates the production of a compound called cGMP, which causes relaxation of the smooth muscle in the blood vessels supplying the corpus cavernosum. PDE 5 is an enzyme that breaks down cGMP. By inhibiting the breakdown of cGMP by PDE5, these medications allow cGMP to build up in the penis. cGMP causes muscles in the corpora cavernosa of the penis to relax. When the muscle is relaxed, more blood can flow into the penis and fill the spaces in the penis. As the penis fills with blood, the veins in the penis are compressed, and this results a hard erection. When the effect on PDE5 decreases, the cGMP levels go down and the muscle in the penis contracts, causing less blood to flow into the penis and allowing the veins to open up and drain blood out of the penis.''Some men should not take PDE5 inhibitors. They can cause ''hypotension'' (abnormally ''low blood pressure'' that can lead to ''fainting'' and even ''shock'') when given to patients who are taking ''nitrates'' (medications taken for ''heart disease''). Therefore, patients taking nitrates daily should not take any of the PDE5 inhibitors. Nitrates relieve angina (''chest pain'' due to insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle because of narrowing of the coronary arteries); these include nitroglycerine tablets, patches, ointments, sprays, and pastes, as well as ''isosorbide dinitrate'' and ''isosorbide mononitrate''. Other nitrates such as amyl nitrate and butyl nitrate also are in some recreational drugs called ""poppers.""''If you are taking medications (alpha-blockers) for problems with an ''enlarged prostate'', you should discuss your prostate medications with your doctor. Alpha-blockers also can cause lowering of the blood pressure. Thus your doctor will need to carefully watch your blood pressure when you start the PDE5 inhibitor. Common alpha-blockers include doxazosin (''Cardura''), ''terazosin'' (''Hytrin''), and ''tamsulosin'' (''Flomax'').''PDE 5 inhibitors are broken down primarily by enzyme, cytochrome P450enzyme CYP3A4. Medications that decrease or increase the activity of CYP3A4 may affect levels and effectiveness of PDE 5 inhibitors. Such drugs include medications for the treatment of ''HIV'' (''protease inhibitors'') and the antifungal medications ''ketoconazole'' and ''itraconazole''. Thus caution is recommended.''The various PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of ED share several common side effects, including ''headache'', flushing, ''nasal congestion'', ''nausea'', ''dyspepsia'' (stomach discomfort), and ''diarrhea''. Differences exist in side effects of the different PDE5 inhibitors, and thus it is important to be familiar with the prescribing information of the PDE5 inhibitor you are prescribed.''There have been rare reports of ''priapism'' (prolonged and painful erections lasting more than six hours) with the use of PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil. Patients with blood cell diseases such as ''sickle cell anemia'', ''leukemia'', and ''multiple myeloma'' have higher than normal risks of developing ''priapism''. Untreated priapism can cause injury to the penis and lead to permanent impotence. Therefore, if your erection lasts four hours, you should seek emergency medical care.''Rare side effects of all PDE5 inhibitors include a sudden ''loss of vision'' in one or both eyes (nonarteritic anterior ischemic ''optic neuropathy'' [NAION]) and sudden loss of ''hearing''. Patients have reported these rare side effects with all of the PDE5 inhibitors. Seek immediate medical care if you develop loss of vision or hearing.''Doctors have not tested the PDE5 inhibitors in patients with ''retinitis pigmentosa'', an eye condition that affects the retina and can cause ''blindness'', and so caution is recommended if you have this health condition.' "
Sildenafil (Viagra),"'Sildenafil (Viagra) was the first oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor approved by the FDA in the United States for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (it is not approved for women). Sildenafil inhibits PDE5, which is an enzyme that destroys cGMP. By inhibiting the destruction of cGMP by PDE5, sildenafil allows cGMP to accumulate. The cGMP in turn prolongs relaxation of the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa. Relaxation of the corpora cavernosa smooth muscle allows blood to flow into the penis resulting in increased engorgement of the penis. In short, sildenafil increases blood flow into the penis and decreases blood flow out of the penis.''Sildenafil treats erectile dysfunction of either physical or psychological cause. It is effective in treating erectile dysfunction in men with ''coronary artery disease'', diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, ''coronary artery bypass'' grafting (''CABG''), and men who are taking antidepressants and several classes of antihypertensives.''In randomized placebo-controlled trials, an estimated 60% of men with diabetes, and 80% of men without diabetes experienced improved erections with sildenafil.'""Sildenafil is available as oral tablets at doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. Patients should take sildenafil approximately one hour before sexual activity. In some men, the onset of action of the drug may be as early as 11-20 minutes. It's best for men to take sildenafil on an empty stomach for best results since absorption and effectiveness of sildenafil can be diminished if it is taken shortly after a meal, particularly a meal that is high in fat. Sildenafil and the other PDE5 inhibitors don't cause an immediate erection. Sexual stimulation is necessary for these medications to work.""'In prescribing sildenafil, a doctor considers the age, general health status, and other medication(s) the patient is taking. The usual starting dose for most men is 50 mg, however, the doctor may increase or decrease the dose depending on side effects and effectiveness. The maximum recommended dose is 100 mg every 24 hours. However, many men will need 100 mg of sildenafil for optimal effectiveness, and some doctors are recommending 100 mg as the starting dose.''Aging, ''liver'' and kidney problems, and concurrent use of certain medications (such as ''erythromycin'' [an antibiotic] and protease inhibitors for ''HIV'') slows the metabolism (breakdown) of sildenafil. Slowed breakdown allows sildenafil to accumulate in the body and potentially may increase the risk of side effects. Therefore, in men over 65 years of age, in men with significant kidney and liver disease, and in men who also are taking medications called protease inhibitors, the doctor will initiate sildenafil at a lower dose (25 mg) to avoid accumulation of sildenafil in the body. A ''protease inhibitor'' ''ritonavir'' (''Norvir'') is especially potent in increasing the accumulation of sildenafil, thus men who are taking Norvir should not take sildenafil doses higher than 25 mg and at a frequency of no greater than once in 48 hours. Other medications that may affect the level of sildenafil include erythromycin and ketoconazole.''Sildenafil (Viagra) may affect another phosphodiesterase enzyme in the eye causing transient abnormal vision (seeing a bluish hue or brightness).' "
Vardenafil (Levitra and the generic formulation Staxyn),"'Vardenafil (Levitra) was the second oral medicine approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Like sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) inhibits PDE5, which destroys cGMP (as discussed earlier). It is the only PDE 5 inhibitor that has a generic form available.''Vardenafil is effective in men of all ages, different nationalities, and in men with such medical conditions as diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction after prostate surgery.''The recommended starting dose of vardenafil is 10 mg taken orally approximately one hour before sexual activity. A doctor may adjust the dose higher or lower depending on efficacy and side effects. The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg, and the maximum recommended dosing frequency is no more than once per day. Patients can take vardenafil with or without food. As with sildenafil, for vardenafil to be effective, sexual stimulation must occur.''Vardenafil shares the same side effects as sildenafil but is not associated with the abnormal vision that may occur with sildenafil.''The same concerns regarding the use of sildenafil with nitrates and alpha-blockers apply to vardenafil.''Men with a rare heart condition known as long QT syndrome should not take vardenafil since this may lead to ''abnormal heart rhythms'"". The QT interval is the time it takes for the heart's muscle to recover after it has contracted. An ""'electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') measures the QT interval. Some people have longer than normal QT intervals, and they may develop potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms, especially when given certain medications. Men with a family history of long QT syndrome should not take vardenafil, as it is possible to inherit long QT syndrome. Furthermore, vardenafil is not recommended for men who are taking medications that can affect the QT interval such as ''quinidine'' (Quinaglute, Quinidex), ''procainamide'' (Pronestyl, Procan-SR, Procanbid), ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), and ''sotalol'' (''Betapace'').''There is insufficient information on the safety of vardenafil in men with the following health disorders:''Therefore, men with these health conditions should not use vardenafil without having these conditions evaluated and stabilized first. For example, men with uncontrolled high blood pressure should have their blood pressure controlled; and men with potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms should have these rhythms controlled.''When there is angina or heart failure, the doctor may need to determine whether the heart has enough reserve to carry out the work necessary for sexual activity by performing cardiac treadmill stress testing.''Metabolism (breakdown) of vardenafil can be slowed by aging, liver disease, and concurrent use of certain medications (such as erythromycin [an antibiotic], ketoconazole [''Nizoral'', a medication for fungal/yeast infections], and protease inhibitors [medications used to treat ''AIDS'']). Slowed breakdown allows vardenafil to accumulate in the body and potentially increase the risk for side effects. Therefore, in men over 65 years of age with liver disease, or who are also taking medication(s) that can slow the breakdown of vardenafil, the doctor will initiate vardenafil at low doses to avoid its accumulation. For example,' Unstable angina (chest pain due to coronary artery disease that occurs at rest or with minimal physical exertion) Low blood pressure (a resting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) Uncontrolled high blood pressure (greater than 170/110 mm Hg) Recent stroke or heart attack (within six months) Uncontrolled, potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms Severe liver disease Severe kidney failure requiring dialysis Severe heart failure or disease of the heart's valves, for example, aortic stenosis (hardening of the main artery in the body) Retinitis pigmentosa (a condition that affects the retina of the eye and can cause blindness) men taking erythromycin or ketoconazole should not take more than 5 mg of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; men taking high doses of ketoconazole (Nizoral) should not take more than 2.5 mg of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; men with moderately severe liver disease also should not take more than a 5 mg dose of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; men taking the protease inhibitor (for the treatment of HIV/AIDS) indinavir (Crixivan) should not take more than 2.5 mg of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; and men taking another protease inhibitor ritonavir (Norvir), erythromycin, or ketoconazole, should not take more than 2.5 mg of vardenafil every 72 hours."
Tadalafil (Cialis),"'Tadalafil (Cialis) is the third oral medicine approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Like sildenafil (Viagra) and vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil inhibits PDE5 (as described earlier). Unlike the other PDE 5 inhibitors, patients should take tadalafil once daily and is approved for the treatment of BPH (benign enlargement of the prostate).''Tadalafil is effective in treating erectile dysfunction in men of all ages and has been shown to be effective in men with diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction after prostate cancer surgery. Studies demonstrated that tadalafil improved the ability to get a hard erection and to have the hard erection last long enough.''Patients may take tadalafil as needed as with sildenafil, vardenafil, and avanafil or once a day. It is the only ED oral medication that patients can take on a daily basis.''The recommended starting dose of tadalafil for use as needed for most patients is 10 mg taken orally approximately one hour before sexual activity. A doctor may adjust the dose higher to 20 mg or lower to 5 mg depending on efficacy and side effects. Doctors recommended that patients take tadalafil no more frequently than once per day. Some patients can take tadalafil less frequently since the improvement in erectile function may last 36 hours. Patients may take tadalafil with or without food. Tadalafil is currently the only PDE5 inhibitor that is FDA-approved for daily use for erectile dysfunction and is available in 2.5 mg or 5 mg dosages for daily use.''Tadalafil shares the common side effects of the PDE5 inhibitors, however, due to its effect on PDE11, another phosphodiesterase located in muscle, tadalafil has been associated with muscle aches. ''Back pain'' and muscle aches occur in less than 7% of men taking tadalafil and in most patients will go away without treatment within 48 hours. When treatment was necessary, ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil'') or naproxen (''Aleve'') were effective. Rarely do the muscle aches and ''back pain'' cause men to stop using tadalafil.''Men taking nitrates should not use tadalafil as with the other PDE5 inhibitors.''Tadalafil should not be used with alpha-blockers (except ''Flomax''), medicines used to treat high blood pressure, and benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) because the combination of tadalafil and an alpha-blocker may lower the blood pressure greatly and lead to ''dizziness'' and ''fainting''. Examples of alpha-blockers include ''tamsulosin'' (Flomax), terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), ''alfuzosin'' (''Uroxatral''), and ''prazosin'' (''Minipress''). Tamsulosin (Flomax) is the only alpha-blocker that patients can use safely with tadalafil. When tadalafil (20 mg) was given to healthy men taking 0.4 mg of Flomax daily, there was no significant decrease in blood pressure and so patients on this dose of tamsulosin (Flomax) can be prescribed tadalafil. The only alpha-blocker not tested with tadalafil is alfuzosin (Uroxatral), and no recommendations can be made regarding the interaction between the two.''As with vardenafil, doctors do not recommend tadalafil for men with the following conditions:''Therefore, men with these health conditions should not use tadalafil without having these conditions evaluated and stabilized first. For example, men with uncontrolled high blood pressure should have their blood pressure controlled; and men with potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms should have these rhythms controlled.''When there is angina or heart failure, the doctor may need to determine whether the heart has enough reserve to carry out the work necessary for sexual activity by performing cardiac treadmill stress testing.''In most healthy men, some of the drug will remain in the body for more than two days after a single dose of tadalafil. Metabolism (clearing of the drug from the body) of tadalafil can be slowed by liver disease, ''kidney disease'', and concurrent use of certain medications (such as erythromycin, ketoconazole, and protease inhibitors). Slowed breakdown allows tadalafil to stay in the body longer and potentially increase the risk for side effects. Therefore, doctors have to lower the dose and frequency of tadalafil in the following examples:' Unstable angina (chest pain due to coronary artery disease that occurs at rest or with minimal physical exertion) Low blood pressure (a resting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) Uncontrolled high blood pressure (greater than 170/110 mm Hg) Recent stroke or heart attack (within six months) Uncontrolled, potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms Severe liver disease Severe heart failure or disease of the heart valves (for example, aortic stenosis) Retinitis pigmentosa Medications such as erythromycin, ketoconazole (Nizoral), itraconazole (Sporanox), ritonavir (Norvir), and indinavir (Crixivan) can slow the breakdown of tadalafil. Therefore, men taking these medications should not take more than 10 mg of tadalafil and should not take tadalafil more frequently than every 72 hours. If you have kidney troubles, your doctor may recommend that you try a lower dose of tadalafil or change how often you use the tadalafil depending on your kidney function. Men with severe liver disease should not take tadalafil. Men with mild to moderate liver disease should not exceed tadalafil dose of 10 mg once daily."
Avanafil (Stendra),"'Avanafil is the most recently FDA-approved PDE5 inhibitor to treat erectile dysfunction.''Avanafil has been demonstrated to be effective in treating ED in men of various ages and has been shown to be effective in men with ED related to diabetes mellitus.''The recommended starting dose is 100 mg taken as early as 15 minutes prior to sexual activity, no more than once a day. The maximum dose is 200 mg. Avanafil may be taken with or without food. As with the other PDE5 inhibitors, sexual stimulation is necessary for avanafil to work.''If an individual is taking ketoconazole, erythromycin, or ritonavir, it is recommended that the maximum dose of avanafil not exceed 50 mg in 24 hours.''Similarly, if you are taking an alpha-blocker for prostate symptoms, the recommended starting dose of avanafil is 50 mg.''Avanafil shares the common PDE5 inhibitor side effects, contraindications, and cautions. No changes in dose are need for men with mild or moderate kidney disease. Individuals with severe kidney disease, severe liver disease, or those on ''kidney dialysis'' should not use avanafil.' "
What are intracavernosal injections?,"'Patient can inject medications directly into the corpora cavernosa to help attain and maintain erections. Medications such as papaverine hydrochloride, phentolamine, and prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) can be used alone or in combinations to attain erections. All of these medications are ''vasodilators'' and work by increasing blood flow into the penis. Prostaglandin E1 (Caverject, Edex) is easier to obtain; however, it is associated with ''penile pain'' in some individuals. The use of combinations of two or three of these medications can decrease the risk of having penile pain.''Risks associated with injection therapy including bleeding, pain with injection, penile pain, priapism, and corporal fibrosis (scarring inside of the corpora cavernosa). There is also concern that repetitive injections in the same area could cause ''scar tissue'' to build up in the tunica albuginea that could create penile curvature. Thus, doctors recommended that one alternate sides with injection and perform injections no more frequent than every other day.''If you are on a blood thinner, you must be careful. After injection, patients should pressure to the site to minimize bleeding.''Patients should start with a low dose and increase in small doses until the dose that results in a rigid enough erection for completion of sexual activity is achieved. If one injects and there is an inadequate response, one should not reinject another dose of the medication at that time, due to the risk of priapism.' "
What are intraurethral suppositories?,"'Prostaglandin E1 (intraurethral alprostadil or MUSE) can be inserted in a pellet (suppository) form into the urethra to attain erections. It is available in four dosage strengths: 125 mcg, 250 mcg, 500 mcg, and 1,000 mcg. Most individuals need 500 mcg to 1,000 mcg for a satisfactory response.''The prostaglandin E1 is contained in a small suppository located at the tip of an applicator. You should urinate first as this lubricates the urethra and makes it easier to insert the applicator into the tip of the urethra (urethral meatus, the opening at the tip of the penis that urine passes through). A patient can release the suppository into urethra by gently wiggling the applicator and pressing the button at the end. Rubbing the penis allows the suppository to dissolve, and the prostaglandin is absorbed through the tissue of the urethra into the penis. It takes 15 to 30 minutes for this occur. Once into the penis, the prostaglandin causes increased blood flow into the penis. The prostaglandin can be present in the ejaculate, and thus doctors recommend that men use a ''condom'' when having intercourse with a ''pregnant'' partner. Men may need to use a condom if vaginal irritation occurs in female partner.'""It is recommend that the first trial of intraurethral prostaglandin be performed in the doctor's office due to the risk of ""'hypotension'' with this medication.''Men with a known hypersensitivity to alprostadil should not use intraurethral prostaglandin E1.''Alprostadil should not be used in men with ''urethral stricture'' (scarring and narrowing of the tube that urine and the ejaculate pass through), ''balanitis'' (inflammation/infection of the glans [tip] of the penis, severe hypospadias (a condition where the opening of the urethra is not at the tip of the penis, rather on the underside of the penis), penile curvature (abnormal bend to the penis), and ''urethritis'' (inflammation/infection of the urethra).''Alprostadil should not be used in men at higher risk for priapism (erection lasting longer than six hours) including men with sickle cell ''anemia'', ''thrombocytopenia'' (''low platelet count''), ''polycythemia'' (increased red blood cell count), multiple ''myeloma'' (a cancer of the white blood cells), and is contraindicated in men prone to venous thrombosis (''blood clots'' in the veins) or hyperviscosity syndrome who are at increased risk for priapism.''Patients report success rates up to 65% with intraurethral alprostadil.''Side effects of intraurethral alprostadil include pain in the penis and sometimes in the testicles, mild urethral bleeding, ''dizziness'', and ''vaginal itching'"" in the sex partner. Patients rarely report syncopal (fainting) episodes with initial use, and thus the first trial of this medication should be performed in the physician's office."" "
What is the role of testosterone therapy in the treatment of erectile dysfunction?,"'In patients with low testosterone, testosterone treatment can improve libido and erectile dysfunction, but many men still may need additional oral medications such as sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil. Some studies suggest that men with ED and low testosterone may respond better to PDE5 inhibitors when given testosterone therapy; however, this is controversial.''Men with ED without hypogonadism (a low testosterone level and symptoms related to this) should not use testosterone therapy.''Prior to starting testosterone therapy, it is important for a doctor to perform a thorough evaluation on the patient.''Evaluation should include a breast examination, rectal examination of the prostate, and a PSA level (prostate specific antigen) blood test. Patients who have breast and ''prostate cancers'' should not use testosterone.''Patients should continue testosterone therapy only if there is improvement in the symptoms of hypogonadism and should be monitored regularly. You will need periodic blood tests for testosterone levels and blood tests to monitor your blood count and PSA. Testosterone therapy has health risks, and thus doctors should closely monitor its use. Testosterone therapy can worsen ''sleep apnea'' and ''congestive heart failure''.''A variety of testosterone therapies are available, including oral, topical (gel, spray, patch), intramuscular, and pellets. Patient should review the advantages and disadvantages of each of these with a physician, as well as the health risks and benefits of testosterone therapy.''Certain medications can alter testicular function, including some diuretics (water pills), some ''seizure'' medications, long-acting oral opiate pain medications, antipsychotic medications, and oral steroids.' "
Can a penis pump (vacuum device) help erectile dysfunction?,"'Mechanical vacuum devices cause an erection by creating a vacuum around the penis that draws blood into the penis, engorging it, and expanding it. The devices have three components:''The vacuum device creates a vacuum to pull blood into the penis. Unlike a normal erection, the inflow of blood does not continue once the individual removes the vacuum device. The rubber band placed at the base of the penis constricts the penis to prevent the blood from leaving the penis. As there is no inflow or outflow of blood when the rubber band is in place, it is uncommon for the tip of the penis (the glans) to appear a little blue and the penis to be cooler. Once intercourse is completed, the individual removes the rubber band and the blood drains out of the penis.''Yes, the vacuum device is effective. In fact, with use of the vacuum device, 88% of men will have an erection that is satisfactory for completion of sexual activity. The vacuum device may be the only therapy that is effective after the removal of a penile prosthesis. Patients also use vacuum devices as part of penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy to help preserve the tissue of the penis and prevent scarring within the penis and loss of penile length. Its use, however, is limited by the mechanical nature of it and the time taken to pump the device and apply the band. Sex partners may complain of the penis being cool to touch.''Individuals must remove the rubber band immediately after completing intercourse. Leaving the band on too long can harm the penis. Rarely, ''bruising'' of the penis or blood in the ejaculate/urine may occur.' A plastic cylinder, in which the individual places his penis A pump, which draws air out of the cylinder An elastic band, which is placed around the base of the penis, to maintain the erection after the cylinder is removed and during intercourse by preventing blood from flowing back into the body (see figure 2). The vacuum device may be operated by hand or be battery operated."
What about psychological therapy for erectile dysfunction?,"""Experts often treat psychologically based impotence using techniques that decrease anxiety associated with intercourse. The patient's partner can help apply the techniques, which include gradual development of intimacy and stimulation. Such techniques also can help relieve anxiety during treatment of physical impotence. If these simple behavioral methods at home are ineffective, a doctor may refer an individual to a sex counselor."" "
Surgery for erectile dysfunction,"'Surgery for erectile dysfunction may have the following as its goal:''Currently, there are several different types of penile prostheses. The simplest is the malleable penile prosthesis and the most complex, the three-piece inflatable penile prosthesis.''Malleable implants usually consist of paired rods, inserted surgically into each of the corpora cavernosa. The rods are stiff, and to have an erection, one bends them up and then when finished with intercourse one bends them down. They do not change in length or width. The malleable implants are the least mechanical and thus have the lowest risk of malfunction. However, also have the least ""normal appearance.""''The most common inflatable prosthesis is the three-piece penile prosthesis. It is composed of paired cylinders, which doctors surgically insert inside the penis. Patients can expand the cylinders using pressurized fluid (see figure 3). Tubes connect the cylinders to a fluid reservoir and pump, which doctors also surgically implant. The reservoir is usually in the pelvis. A doctor places the pump in the scrotum. By pressing on the pump, sterile fluid transfers from the reservoir into the cylinders in the penis. An erection is produced primarily by expansion of the width of the penis, however, one model can increase in length a small amount also. Lock-out valves in the tubing prevent the fluid from leaving the cylinder until a release valve is pressed. By pressing the relief valve and gently squeezing the penis, the fluid within the cylinders transfers back into the reservoir.''The surgery for placement of a penile prosthesis is typically an outpatient surgery. Doctors often perform a penile prosthesis through a single incision, and all of the components are hidden under the skin. Health care professionals often give patients antibiotics at the time of surgery and often after the surgery to decrease the risk of developing an infection. Depending on your health history, a health care provider may leave a catheter in your penis to drain your bladder overnight.''Penile prostheses are very effective, and most patients who have a prosthesis placed are satisfied with the prosthesis. However, placement of a prosthesis causes scarring of the tissue within the corpora cavernosa, and if the prosthesis requires removal, other forms of therapy, except for the vacuum device, are often not effective. Thus, most physicians reserve placement of a prosthesis for men who have tried and failed or have contraindications to other therapies.'""Infection is a concern after placement of a prosthesis and is a reported complication in 8%-20% of men undergoing placement of a penile prosthesis. If a prosthesis becomes infected (redness, pain, and swelling of the penis and sometimes purulent drainage are signs of infection), the prosthesis must be removed. Depending on the timing and severity of the infection and your surgeon's preference, the area can be irrigated extensively with antibiotic solutions and a new prosthesis placed at the same time or removal of the infected prosthesis and an attempt to place a new prosthesis made at a later time when the infection is totally cleared.""'Mechanical malfunction is another risk of the prosthesis. However, advancements including lock-out valves and special covering over areas of the tubing have decreased the risk of mechanical malfunction.''Erosion of the prosthesis, whereby it presses through the corporal tissue into the urethra, may occur. Symptoms and signs may include pain, ''blood in the urine'', discharge, abnormal urine stream, and malfunction. If the prosthesis erodes into the urethra, a physician must remove it. If the other cylinder remains intact, it can be left in place. A physician leaves a catheter in place to allow the urethra to heal.''Other risks of penile prosthesis include over- or undersizing of the prosthesis, which can cause an abnormal appearance to the erect penis or reservoir or pump migration into abnormal locations.''Surgery to repair arteries (penile arterial reconstructive surgery) can reduce impotence caused by obstructions that block the flow of blood to the penis. The best candidates for such surgery are young men with discrete blockage of an artery because of a physical injury to the pubic area or a fracture of the pelvis. The procedure is less successful in older men with widespread blockage of arteries.''Physicians do not recommend surgery on the penile veins.'   to reconstruct arteries in order to increase the flow of blood to the penis; and to block veins that drain blood from the penis (currently not recommended). Currently, placement of a penile prosthesis is the most common surgical procedure performed for erectile dysfunction. Penile prosthesis placement is typically reserved for men who have tried and failed (either from efficacy or tolerability) or have contraindications to other forms of therapy including PDE5 inhibitors, intraurethral alprostadil, and injection therapy."
Can over-the-counter (OTC) and/or natural or home remedies treat erectile dysfunction?,"'The U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has a list of 29 OTC products that claim to treat erectile dysfunction. Patients should avoid these because many contain harmful ingredients. Other natural or herbal remedies such as DHEA, L-arginine, ''ginseng'', and ''yohimbe'' are ''supplements'' that have been used but have not been proven safe and effective according to some researchers. Before using such compounds, individuals should consult their doctor. According to some experts, ''acupuncture'' does not effectively treat erectile dysfunction. Other home remedies for reducing ED symptoms include ''diet'' changes such as eating blueberries and citrus fruits and drinking red wine.' "
Is it possible to prevent erectile dysfunction?,"'Prevention'' of some of the causes that contribute to the development of erectile dysfunction can decrease the chances of developing the problem. For example, if a person decreases their chances of developing diabetes, ''heart disease'', and hypertension, they will decrease their chances of developing erectile dysfunction. Other things like stopping smoking, eating a healthy ''diet'"" (heart healthy with adequate vitamin intake), and exercising daily may reduce a person's risk."" "
What is the prognosis for erectile dysfunction?,"'Currently, there are no therapies that cure erectile dysfunction. However, a number of effective therapies are available that allow an individual to have an erection when desired. Depending on the cause of the erectile dysfunction, certain therapies may be more effective than others. Although there is limited data on lifestyle modification, intuitively, decreasing risk factors for erectile dysfunction may help prevent progression of disease.' "
What erectile dysfunction studies are under way? What are future treatment options?,"'Combination therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction has been under investigation. Most of these studies have been small trials, and long-term data regarding their effectiveness and safety are lacking. However, with thorough evaluation and counseling, there may be a use for combination therapy for certain individuals with ED.''An alprostadil cream that patients apply into the tip of the penis (the urethral meatus, the opening that urine passes through) is currently available in the UK and Europe. It is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After application of the cream, an erection occurs within five to 30 minutes, and the erection lasts one to two hours in men who respond to the cream. Doctors recommend that one use the cream for a maximum frequency of two to three times per week and no more frequent than once every 24 hours. It has essentially the same contraindications and side effects as the other formulations of alprostadil. The cream may cause vaginal burning in roughly 4% of partners. Men should not use alprostadil cream for sexual intercourse with women of childbearing potential unless a condom is used. Researchers have performed controlled trial studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this drug. Overall, 52% of men reported improvement in their erections compared to 20% of men receiving placebo. A later analysis demonstrated that 36% of men using the alprostadil cream had a clinically relevant improvement in vaginal penetration ability and 31% clinically relevant improvement in ability to have successful intercourse to ejaculation.''Other medical therapies under evaluation include ROCK inhibitors and soluble guanyl cyclase activators. Melanocortin receptor agonists are a new set of medications being developed in the field of erectile dysfunction. Their action is on the nervous system rather than the vascular system. PT-141 is a nasal preparation that appears to be effective alone or in combination with PDE5 inhibitors. The main side effects include flushing and ''nausea''. These drugs are currently not approved for commercial use.''Research in stem cell therapy and gene therapy for erectile dysfunction is also ongoing.' "
Summary,"'Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a progressive muscle disorder characterized by muscle inflammation, weakness, and atrophy (wasting). It is a type of inflammatory myopathy. IBM develops in adulthood, usually after age 50. The symptoms and rate of progression vary from person to person. The most common symptoms include progressive weakness of the legs, arms, fingers, and wrists. Some people also have weakness of the facial muscles (especially muscles controlling eye closure), or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Muscle cramping and pain are uncommon, but have been reported in some people.''Most people with IBM progress to disability over a period of years. In general, the older a person is when IBM begins, the more rapid the progression of the condition. Most people need assistance with basic daily activities within 15 years, and some people will need to use a wheelchair. Lifespan is thought to be normal, but severe complications (e.g. aspiration pneumonia) can lead to loss of life.''The underlying cause of IBM is poorly understood and likely involves the interaction of genetic, immune-related, and environmental factors. Some people may have a genetic predisposition to developing IBM, but the condition itself typically is not inherited.''There is currently no cure for IBM. The primary goal of management is to optimize muscle strength and function. Management may include exercise, fall prevention, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy (for dysphagia). There is limited evidence that a small proportion of patients may benefit from drugs that suppress the immune system (particularly those with underlying autoimmune disorders), but this therapy is otherwise typically not recommended.'

"Urinary incontinence products for men 
introduction","'Lots of men hate the idea of using ''incontinence'' products ''--'' the so-called adult diapers, urine collection ''bags'"", and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male ""'incontinence'"", these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options."" "
What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.""""Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start.

What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. ' 
What are urinals and other toilet substitutes?,"'Urinals and other toilet substitutes. '""When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, ""'plastic'' urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinency, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom.' "
What are urinary incontinence penile clamps?,"'Penile clamps.'' They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps ''--'' also called ""external compression devices"" ''--'"" can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."" "

What is transcutaneous cardiac pacing?,'Transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP) is noninvasive and temporary means of pacing a patient’s ''heart'' during an emergency and stabilizing them until a better intervention is achieved.''TCP works as an ''artificial pacemaker'' by delivering repetitive electric currents to the heart and thus by increasing the heart rate and ''heart function''.\xa0\xa0' 
What are the indications for transcutaneous cardiac pacing?,"'Transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP) (the fastest method of cardiac pacing) can be used until permanent pacing becomes available. Indications include the following:' TCP is appropriate when a permanent pacing device is not working or needs to be repaired or changed. Patients with a low heart rate Patients with a low body temperature Patients who undergo cardiac surgery require TCP to determine the functional capacity of the heart. Patients who have severe injury to the heart Patients who have electrolyte imbalance Metabolic and electrolyte derangements Patients who are on cardiac-related drugs require TCP as few drugs have side effects of a low heart rate (e.g., digitalis toxicity) Diseases such as Lyme disease or bacterial endocarditis TCP is also part of advanced cardiac life support during emergency TCP is occasionally used to determine whether a patient requires permanent pacing Patients with hypotension"
What is transcutaneous cardiac pacing used for?,'Transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP) increases a person’s heart rate artificially. Below are the uses of TCP:' The main use of TCP is when a patient doesn’t require a long-term pacemaker or if a permanent pacemaker is not available. It is also used in patients who are not fit to undergo pacemaker surgery. TCP is a temporary method of pacing that is used in patients with symptomatic bradycardia (symptomatic low heart rate). It is particularly helpful in patients with reversible or transient conditions (digoxin toxicity and inferior wall myocardial infarction).
What happens during a transcutaneous cardiac pacing procedure?,"'Transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP) is usually done under local anesthesia or intravenous (IV) sedation. The procedure is completed within an hour depending on the patient’s condition and heart response.' Patient’s vitals are monitored throughout the procedure. The patient would be placed on adequate oxygenation and intravenous saline. The patient’s skin on the chest and back may be cleaned. TCP equipment consists of a pacing unit, cardiac electrodes (pads), and a cardiac monitor. The electrode with negative polarity is usually placed over the cardiac apex (a place where the heartbeat is felt on the chest).  The electrode with positive polarity may be placed between the right or left scapula and spine (back of the chest).  After skin preparation and application of the pads, the pacemaker is turned on, and the pacing mode may be selected.  If the patient has a low heart rate or cardiac rest, pacing may be initiated at the maximum current output to ensure that capture is achieved as soon as possible. Then, the current can be gradually reduced.  Cardiac capture should be confirmed by assessing the pulse, blood pressure and clinical status of the patient.  In healthy individuals, the pacing threshold is usually less than 80?milliamps."
What are the risks of transcutaneous cardiac pacing?,'The risks of transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP) include the following:' Pain Anxiety Stigma Discomfort Heart rate may sometimes not respond to TCP
What is the outcome of transcutaneous cardiac pacing?,"'Patients should remember that transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP) is a temporary solution for an underlying medical condition.\xa0''TCP is primarily used for the treatment of a low heart rate and various types of cardiac diseases. The goal is to provide relief to the patients without major surgery.' Patients who require a lifelong pacemaker should shift to a regular pacemaker as soon as possible.  TCP for expected bradycardia during carotid stenting appeared to be safe and effective in preventing a low heart rate and hypotension during operation, with a decrease in additional medication support during the procedures. "
Facts you should know about direct vs. indirect hernias,"   Approximately 800,000 hernia surgeries are performed every year in the U.S. Inguinal hernias are diagnosed by physical examination. Surgery (laparoscopic or open technique) is the standard treatment for a hernia. Hernia compilations can range from minor pain to a need for emergency surgery."
What are inguinal hernias?,"'Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernias. They occur when tissues protrude through a spot in the abdominal muscles. Frequently, this tissue will be part of the intestine.''Inguinal hernias are not dangerous itself but can lead to significant complications especially if the intestinal tissue loses its blood supply. Usually, the hernia can be pushed back in or even slides back when the patient lays down. If the hernia cannot be pushed back in, it is considered incarcerated (the contents of the hernia are trapped). This will usually lead to severe ''pain'', as well as ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. If the blood supply is cut off, the hernia is considered strangulated. A strangulated hernia is life-threatening and requires immediate surgery.''Inguinal hernias are divided into direct and indirect hernias.' "
What is a direct hernia?,"'These inguinal hernias are usually caused by ''weakness'' in the muscle of the abdominal wall. The ''weakness'' can be due to an acute event (heavy lifting) or slowly develop over time.''Most commonly, this hernia is found in adult males.' "
What is an indirect hernia?,'An indirect hernia is caused by a birth defect in the abdominal wall.' 
What are causes and risk factors of direct and indirect hernias?,"'The hernias usually appear after increased abdominal pressure, such as straining or lifting a heavy object. Often they are linked to a weak spot in the abdominal wall that can be present since birth or secondary to abdominal surgery, injuries, or develop over time.''In men, the weakness usually is found in the inguinal canal that leads down into the scrotum.''Risk factors for inguinal hernias are older age, ''obesity'', being male, and having a family history of a hernia. ''Chronic cough'' and ''pregnancy'' are also risk factors.' "
What are signs and symptoms of direct and indirect hernias?,"'A bulge is usually visible in your inguinal area (groin). This bulge might become more obvious on standing or when lifting or ''coughing'' (straining). There might be ''pain'' or discomfort in the groin. If the hernia pushed into your scrotum, ''pain'' and swelling around the testicle will be present.''In newborns, the hernia might be visible when the child cries or ''coughs''.' "
"How do health care professionals diagnose hernias, and what is the treatment for direct and indirect 
hernias?","'Your doctor can usually diagnose an ''inguinal hernia'' by physical examination alone. A bulge will be apparent in your groin while standing. ''Coughing'' will help show the bulge.''Should the hernia not be readily visible, your doctor might order a ''CT scan'' or ''MRI''.''If the hernia is not painful and not too large, you can choose to watch it without any specific therapy. Depending on your lifestyle and the discomfort level, you might choose surgery to fix the hernia.''An enlarging hernia, or significant pain, will usually require surgery to alleviate the symptoms.''Any hernia that cannot be reduced (pushed back in) will require surgery.''Hernia repair can take place in two different ways: open hernia repair and laparoscopic repair.''The open procedure requires an incision, pushing the hernia back in, and then repairing the weak area.''During the laparoscopic procedure, the surgeon will repair the hernia via several small incisions and guidance by a small camera inserted through one of the incisions.' "
What is the prognosis for direct and indirect hernias?,'The repairs of inguinal hernias are usually successful with minimal complications and reoccurrences.' 
Is it possible to prevent direct and indirect hernias?,"'In many cases, it is impossible to prevent inguinal hernias as the weakness in the abdominal wall is present since birth. Avoiding straining, heavy lifting, and treating chronic ''cough'' can be helpful preventive measures.' "
What are allergens?,"'Allergens are substances that are foreign to the body and can cause an ''allergic reaction'' in certain people. Allergens are everywhere in the world around us. Examples of common allergens are ''pollen'', foods, and mold.''Your living environment may contain a variety of animal and plant life, most of which can become a source for allergens, the triggers of allergic reactions. Pollens are the main cause of seasonal allergic ''rhinitis''. However, if your nasal stuffiness, ''sneezing'', ''watery eyes'', and constant ''postnasal drip'' bother you year-round, then you most likely have nonseasonal hay ''fever'', sometimes referred to as perennial allergic rhinitis. This condition is typically caused by indoor allergens such as dust mites, cockroach parts, mold, and animal dander.''Understanding the nature and location of common and indoor sources of ''allergy'' is fundamental. The key to managing ''allergies'' that are caused by indoor allergens involves reducing your level of exposure to them or avoiding them entirely, if possible.''This article describes some of the most common sources of allergens found inside the home environment.' "
What are symptoms and signs of reactions to indoor allergens?,"'Indoor allergens can cause symptoms in susceptible people. Seasonal allergic rhinitis can be caused by indoor allergens and manifests as ''nasal congestion'', ''runny nose'', watering of the eyes, sneezing, and postnasal drip. ''Symptoms of asthma'', including ''wheezing'' or difficulty ''breathing'', can also occur in susceptible individuals.''Allergic reaction to indoor allergens can also cause ''conjunctivitis'', an inflammation of the lining membranes of the eyes. Symptoms of this condition include red, watery, and ''itching'' eyes.''Allergic symptoms involving the skin include ''eczema'', or allergic ''dermatitis'', characterized by a skin ''rash'' associated with ''itching''. This usually results from direct contact with the ''allergen''.' "
Indoor allergens list,"'A number of different substances, ranging from contaminants to pets, can provoke allergic reactions in susceptible people. The following is a list of some of the most common indoor allergens:' House dust Mold spores Pollen Fabrics Dust mites Cockroaches Cat dander Dog dander Pet rodents Horsehair Houseplants"
What actually is house dust?,"'House dust is a mixture of diverse substances that can cause allergies. House dust is composed of a number of natural substances, including dried food particles, mold spores, pollen, fabric fibers, animal dander, and insect parts, especially those of dust mites and cockroaches. However, particles and debris from dust mites are the major source of allergens in dust. As is the case with other allergens, these particles contain proteins that are small enough to become airborne and inhaled.' "
What are dust mites?,"'Dust mites, which were discovered in 1964, are microscopic arachnids (resembling tiny spiders). They are about 1/3 mm in length and are not visible to the naked eye. They have eight legs, are blind, and naturally live indoors. Their presence does not indicate that the house is dirty. This is because usual cleaning procedures, such as vacuuming and dusting, do not eliminate them.''Dust mites have ""sticky"" pads at the ends of their legs that help them to firmly attach to fibers, which allow them to live deep within carpeting, upholstery, and mattresses. Most of the mites found in houses are from the ''Dermatophagoides'' family, with pteronyssinus and farinae being the most common species. (''Dermatophagoides'' comes from Latin and means skin-eating. ''Pteronyssinus'' comes from Latin and means feather-loving. ''Farinae'' is Latin for flour.) Fortunately, dust mites do not bite, spread disease, or actually live on humans.'  "
What conditions are most favorable to dust mites?,"""Dust mites thrive in warm, humid places. The ideal temperature for dust mites ranges from 65 F-80 F, a common range for indoor room temperatures. Since dust mites have no means of drinking, they are totally dependent on the humidity surrounding them for water. They live best at a relative humidity above 55%. However, it is important to be aware that monitoring the humidity really isn&'t sufficient to control dust mites. As the humidity falls, dust mites will retreat from the surface. However, even in very dry conditions, it can take quite a few months to eliminate the dust-""'mite'' population.''Dust mites derive their food supply from human secretions and the skin cells we shed. (The average human sheds up to 1.5 grams of skin particles per day. A gram is about the weight of a paper clip.) The mites thrive in articles such as feather pillows, upholstered furniture, and stuffed animals that collect sloughed skin cells and secretions. The most favorable conditions for ''dust mite'' growth are found in the bedroom. Their favorite breeding grounds are mattresses, pillows, and box springs, as well as blankets, curtains, carpeting, and other fabric items in the room.''The perfect climatic conditions for dust mites occur in North America in the mid- and southern Atlantic coast, Gulf Coast, central Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia. Dust mites are rarely found in dry climates where the elevation is over 5,000 ''feet'' above sea level.' "
How do dust mites cause allergic symptoms?,"'The ''digestive enzymes'"" that are discharged into the mite feces are the most bothersome of the dust-mite allergens. Less potent allergens are found in the mite bodies. The mite's tiny fecal pellets disintegrate to form a very fine powder that can easily float into the air when disturbed. This commonly occurs during vacuuming, making the bed, turning in bed while sleeping, or ""'walking'' on the carpet. When an allergic person inhales these particles, ''asthma'' or nasal ''allergy symptoms'' may occur. There is also evidence that allergic ''eczema'' can be aggravated by this exposure.' Each dust mite lives for approximately 30 days and produces about 20 fecal pellets per day. During that time, females may have added 30 new dust mites to the population. About 10% of the population is allergic to dust mites. About 80% of asthmatic children are allergic to dust mites."
Can cockroaches cause allergic symptoms?,"'Over the past decades, cockroaches have become recognized as a powerful indoor allergen. Cockroach ''allergy'' can be a major factor in serious asthma and nasal allergy. Cockroaches tend to be very troublesome in inner-city areas, multifamily dwellings, and around areas of food preparation.''Cockroaches are among the oldest of all living species (about 350 million years old). The three species of cockroaches that are commonly found in the United States are ''Blatella germania'' (German), ''Periploneta americana'' (American), and ''Blatella orientalis'' (Oriental). (The genus name for the American cockroach, ''periploneta'', is derived from the Greek word, ''planetes'', which means wanderer.)'""Cockroaches are hardy, adaptable creatures that thrive in areas where food and water supplies are plentiful. They may be found around dripping faucets and kitchen areas. They do stray, however, to other areas and can commonly be found in children's bedrooms where food is often eaten. The major cockroach allergens are found in their digestive enzymes, saliva, and body parts. As is the case with dust-mite allergens, these microscopic particles become airborne when disturbed by motion in the room."" "
What about allergies to molds?,"'Symptoms of hay ''fever'' (allergic rhinitis) and asthma can be caused by the inhalation of the spores of molds. Molds, or fungi, tend to grow on wet surfaces, either indoors or outdoors. The body of the mold produces spores or seeds, which are smaller than pollen and less potent as allergens. Large amounts of mold spores can be found in the air, especially in the spring and fall. They are usually most abundant at night, especially when it is damp, foggy, or during the rainy season.''Outdoor molds thrive in the soil, grass, dead leaves, haystacks, barns, and stables. They are often found in greater concentration when a hedge is located against a house, especially in shady areas. Spores from outdoor fungi typically enter the house through opened windows and doors.''Indoor molds can proliferate in bathrooms, especially in the shower stalls, damp cellars, drains, potted plants, closets, attics, house foundations, crawl spaces, and sealed-off rooms. A ""musty"" smell often radiates from these areas. On indoor plants, it is often the mold overgrowth and not the flowers that cause allergy.' "
What about allergies to pets?,"'The ""dander,"" or skin shedding, of an animal is more potent in causing allergic reactions than the animal\'s fur or hair. In addition to the skin sheddings and fur, allergic reactions can occur to the saliva and/or urine of cats, ''dogs'', horses, and rodents.''The scope of the animal allergy problem is enormous. These allergies are believed to affect up to 20% of North Americans and are directly related to the increasing popularity of pets, particularly cats and dogs. Studies have shown that dog allergens were found in all examined homes in the U.S., even those without family dogs. Likewise, almost all homes were shown to contain cat allergens.''The most well-known indoor allergy is probably due to ''Felis domesticus'', the domesticated cat. The main allergen is a protein that is produced by the sweat glands (sebaceous glands) in the skin and appears in the skin flakes or dander that are shed from cats. The allergen is also found to a lesser degree in the fur, saliva, and urine of cats. Even with a past history of tolerance to cats, it is possible for a person with an allergic tendency to develop a sensitivity to cats after constant exposure.'""The cat dander allergen is not only confined to the cat but also clings stubbornly to carpets, walls, and furniture. The protein can linger there for months and can serve as a reservoir from which allergens can become airborne when disturbed. The allergen is also lightweight and can float in the air for hours. People can also carry the cat allergen around on clothes, thereby spreading it to work, school, or a friend's house. Accordingly, for those who are allergic to cats, it does not reduce the risk of allergic reaction to simply isolate the cat in another room of the house. The cat dander is present wherever the cat generally exists, and it is this dander that is the problem.""'Domesticated dogs (''Canis familiaris'') are found in over 40% of homes in North America. About 33% of allergic individuals are sensitive to dog dander (as compared with almost 50% of allergic individuals who are cat-allergic). Since the allergic reaction is prompted by skin shedding and not fur, it makes little difference whether the dog has long or short hair; you can be as allergic to a Chihuahua as you can to a sheepdog. Small dogs can also cause as many allergy symptoms as large dogs. There is certainly no evidence that one species is less allergy-provoking than another one. Clearly, no breed is non-allergenic. Even poodles and wheaten terriers (often thought to be hypoallergenic) will likely induce allergy symptoms in sensitive individuals upon continuous exposure.''If your child has asthma and a known allergy, be especially careful not to allow the child to spend the night at the home of a friend or relative with a pet. Severe allergic reactions and even fatalities have been reported. Do not let this happen to your family or your friends.''Only 10% of allergic individuals have sensitivity to horses. The reason is probably due to less exposure since there is little horsehair in furniture or bedding anymore. Sensitive people, however, must avoid not only horses and stables, but also objects directly related to them, such as bridles, saddles, and riding clothes. Also be aware that horsehair may still be found in antique furniture and old toys. People who have problems with horses may also react to donkeys, mules, and zebras.''Remember that a trip to the barn not only exposes you to animal dander, but also to mold, pollen, and lots of other irritants as well. If you suffer from asthma, be careful and be prepared.''Allergy to birds is more common among bird breeders where the exposure is highest. People who are sensitive to the feathers of chickens, geese, turkeys, and ducks can still eat the meat or eggs from these animals. They may well react, however, to the feathers in down comforters, pillows, and duvets. You should also remember that dust mites, another common allergen, hide in these bedding accessories.''This family includes hamsters, rabbits, guinea pigs, gerbils, ferrets, mice, and rats. Most allergic reactions are caused by exposures in laboratories, but these animals are also common pets. Mouse urine is an especially potent allergen for personnel that handle laboratory animals. The urine of rats and guinea pigs also contains allergens as do the saliva and fur of rabbits. Rabbit hair can be found in fur coats, glove linings, slippers, foot muffs, pillows, and quilts. The fur of the Angora rabbit is said to be 10 times warmer than that of sheep wool. The soft yarn spun from Angora rabbit fur can be found in hand-knitted trimming, crochet work, gloves, hosiery, and knee pads. Alone or mixed with silk, it is also used in sportswear. And, of course, rabbits often appear in schools as the classroom pet.''Frequently, parents will report that their child has ""won the privilege"" of caring for the classroom pet over the weekend or the holiday vacation. This often leads to the onset of a particular animal sensitivity. If you or your child already has allergies or asthma, do not volunteer for the job.'   An estimated 30% of households in North America have at least one cat. About 6% of the U.S. population is allergic to cats."
What about allergies to indoor pollens and houseplants?,"'It is surprising, considering how frequently outdoor pollens cause allergies, that few indoor plants are troublesome. Indoor plants are more leafy than flowering and do not pollinate as much as outdoor plants. Some offending indoor plants are the weeping fig (''Ficus benjamina''), which can cause ''eye allergies'', and the flowering maple (''Alutilon hybridum''), which can cause asthma.''Indoor plants, especially those that are kept in damp wicker baskets, are a source of molds. Plant terrariums and large indoor plants are culprits as well. Dried flowers and live Christmas trees should also be avoided, as they are common carriers of molds.' "
What is the treatment for allergic reactions to indoor allergens?,"'Avoidance of identified indoor allergens can be very effective in controlling allergy symptoms. If such avoidance is not possible or incomplete, ''antihistamines'' are a common treatment for reactions to indoor allergens. These are medications that fight the effects of the histamine released during an allergic reaction by blocking the action of the histamine on the tissue.''The so-called first-generation antihistamines include ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), chlorpheniramine (Chlortrimaton), dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), brompheniramine (Dimetapp and others), ''clemastine'' fumarate (''Tavist'', Allerhist), and dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral). Dryness of the mouth and sleepiness are well-known side effects of first-generation antihistamines. Newer second-generation antihistamines, sometimes referred to as non-sedating antihistamines, include ''loratadine'' (''Claritin''), ''fexofenadine'' (''Allegra''), ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec''), fexofenadine (Allegra), and ''azelastine'' (''Astelin'' Nasal Spray). These second-generation antihistamines typically have a slower onset of action, are longer acting, and do not have the sedating effects of the first-generation antihistamines.''Decongestants are ''drugs'' that reduce swelling in the nasal passages. These drugs can be helpful in reducing allergy symptoms, but they do not treat allergic reactions. Decongestants are available as pills or tablets or can be taken by nasal spray. ''Decongestant'' nasal sprays often cause a so-called ""rebound effect"" or worsening of symptoms if taken for too long, so they should not be used for more than five days without a doctor\'s recommendation. They should be used with caution in people with ''heart disease''.''Prescription medications, including ''corticosteroids'', ''cromolyn'', and ipratropium (''Atropine''-like) nasal sprays, are used to manage some allergy symptoms. ''Montelukast'' (''Singulair'') is an inhibitor of a chemical involved in allergic reactions known as leukotriene. Montelukast is used to treat asthma and has also been approved for treatment of hay fever (allergic rhinitis).''Allergy immunotherapy'' (''allergy shots'') is a process of stimulation of the immune system with gradually increasing doses of the substances to which a person is allergic. Immunotherapy is very effective for management of allergies to pollen, mites, cats, and especially stinging insects (for example, bees). This treatment usually requires a series of injections and takes up to one year to become effective. The required length of treatment varies, but a typical course of treatment lasts about three years.' "
Is it possible to prevent reactions to indoor allergens?,"'Symptoms and signs of allergic reactions to indoor allergens can only be prevented to the extent that the allergens can be avoided or removed from the environment. Sometimes immunotherapy, as described above, can help prevent or decrease the severity of allergic reactions.' "
Indoor allergens testing,"'Diagnostic testing is possible to establish whether someone is allergic to common indoor allergens. Both skin tests and antibody tests may be used. Skin testing using the scratch or skin prick method involves placing a small amount of the test substance onto the skin, then pricking or scratching the skin so that the allergen enters the skin. An allergic reaction typically takes place within 15 to 20 minutes. Another type of skin test that generally shows an immediate reaction is the intradermal skin test, in which a small amount of the substance to be tested is injected beneath the skin surface, as with a ''TB'' (tuberculin) skin test.''With patch skin testing, test substances are taped to the skin for 48 hours, and the area is then observed for signs of an allergic reaction.''Skin testing for allergies is the most common way to determine if someone is allergic, but in some cases, allergy blood tests are used. These tests look for specific antibodies. Both the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (''ELISA'', or EIA) and the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) are tests to identify allergen-specific antibodies in a blood sample. Since the introduction of the ELISA test, RAST testing is less common.' "
Indoor allergens and mold test kit,'A number of manufacturers offer indoor allergen and mold test kits that can be used to obtain samples of air or other substances in the home that are sent for analysis to a professional laboratory. A number of providers also offer air quality and allergen testing services.' 
"Which is better, breastfeeding or formula-feeding?","'Human milk'' is the preferred feeding for all infants. With rare exceptions, this includes premature and sick newborns, as well. Pediatricians generally advise that full-term, healthy infants exclusively breastfeed when possible for the first 12 months of life and, thereafter, for as long as mutually desired. Advantages of ''breastfeeding'' include''Some parents choose ''formula-feeding'' either because of personal preference or because medical conditions of either the mother or the infant make breastfeeding ill-advised. Parents need not feel guilty for choosing formula-feeding. Infant formulas are a time-tested, perfectly acceptable alternative to breastfeeding. Even though ''formula-fed'' ''babies'' do not receive infection-fighting antibodies from the breast milk, they still will have received a four- to six-month supply of these antibodies via placental blood flow prior to delivery. Remember also that the majority of breastfeeding infants end up on a combination of breast- and formula-feedings before their first birthday.''Some common reasons for choosing formula-feeding include:'  breast milk is nutritionally sound and easy to digest; breastfeeding is believed to enhance a close mother-child relationship; breast milk contains infection-fighting antibodies (immunoglobulins) that may reduce the frequency of diarrhea, gastroenteritis, otitis media (ear infections), and other respiratory infections in the infant; and breast milk leads to cost savings and is convenient. There is an inadequate supply of maternal breast milk. The baby is sucking inefficiently. Parents are unable to quantify the amount of breast milk received by the baby. Some parents want to know exactly how much their baby is receiving at each feeding, and formula/bottle-feeding allows exact measurement. A significant reason for not breastfeeding is concern about transferring certain drugs the mother is taking through the breast milk to the infant. Examples of medications that are considered unsafe for the baby include cimetidine (Tagamet), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), lithium (Lithobid), gold salts, methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), metronidazole (Flagyl), cyclosporine, and bromocriptine (Parlodel). Cancer chemotherapy agents are generally also contraindicated. Numerous other medications have not yet been adequately studied in the context of breastfeeding and the possible effects on the baby. Mothers taking medications may choose bottle-feeding rather than risk any potential effect on the baby. An increasing number of mothers must return to work shortly after their baby's delivery. Formula-feeding offers a practical alternative for mothers who may not be able to breastfeed due to work schedules. Formula-fed babies often need to eat less frequently than do breastfed babies because breast milk moves through the digestive system more quickly. Thus, breastfed babies may become hungry more frequently. A benefit of bottle-feeding is that the entire family can immediately become intimately involved in all aspects of the baby's care, including feedings. The mother can therefore get more rest, which can be critically important, especially if the pregnancy and/or delivery were especially difficult."
"What is in an infant formula, and how do I choose the right one?","'This article is designed to review the various types of infant formulas and the nutritional basis for choosing one formula type over another. This information can help ""demystify"" the numerous choices available to a parent when considering options at the pharmacy or grocery store. A small percentage of ''newborn'"" infants will require a specialized formula (for example, premature infants, infants with metabolic diseases, or infants with intestinal malformations). These children's unique dietary requirements should be an item of individual discussion between the parents and the infant's pediatrician and will not be addressed here.""'In order to achieve appropriate growth and maintain good health, infant formulas must include proper amounts of water, carbohydrate, protein, fat, ''vitamins'', and ''minerals''. Each of these components is discussed below. The three major classes of infant formulas are as follows:'""Water is an important part of a baby's ""'diet'"" because water makes up a large proportion of the baby's body. When properly prepared, all infant formulas are approximately 85% water.""'Infant formulas are available in three forms: liquid ready-to-use, liquid concentrate, and powder concentrate. Liquid ready-to-use formulas do not require the addition of water, while the liquid and powder concentrates require the addition of water.'""It is of prime importance for parents to read, understand, and follow the manufacturer's directions when adding water to liquid and powder concentrates. Adding too much water to these concentrates or adding water to ready-to-use formulas can lead to water intoxication in the baby. In severe cases, water intoxication can cause ""'low blood sodium'' levels, irritability, ''coma'', and even permanent ''brain damage''. Conversely, failing to adequately dilute the concentrates with water causes formulas to be too concentrated, or ""hypertonic."" Hypertonic formulas can induce ''diarrhea'' and ''dehydration''. In extreme cases, ingestion of overly hypertonic formulas can lead to ''kidney failure'', ''gangrene'' of the legs, and ''coma''. Therefore, parents should not adjust the amount of water that is added to concentrates to either ""fatten the baby up"" or ""put the baby on a diet."" Instead, parents should discuss their concerns regarding the baby\'s calorie intake with his/her pediatrician.''Carbohydrates (glucose, lactose, sucrose, galactose, etc.) are sugars or several sugars linked together. Carbohydrates provide energy (calories) for the brain, muscles, and other organs. Lactose is a carbohydrate consisting of glucose linked to galactose. Lactose is the major carbohydrate in human breast milk, cow milk, and in most milk-based infant formulas.''While most infants will thrive on a formula that contains lactose, some infants are lactose intolerant. ''Lactose intolerance'' is due to a lactase enzyme deficiency (low levels of enzyme activity) in the small intestine. Lactase enzymes are necessary for ""digesting"" lactose by breaking the link between glucose and galactose. The ''intestines'' can then absorb the smaller glucose and galactose molecules. In infants who are lactase deficient, the undigested lactose cannot be absorbed. This, in turn, can cause ''diarrhea'', ''cramps'', ''bloating'', ''vomiting'', and ''gas''. ''Lactase deficiency'' is more common in premature infants than in full-term babies. Lactase deficiency can also develop temporarily during recovery from viral gastroenteritis (commonly referred to as the ""''stomach flu''""). Finally, lactase deficiency can be ''inherited'' (rarely).''For infants with lactose intolerance, formulas that contain no lactose can be used. Lactofree is an example of a milk-based formula that contains ''corn''-syrup solids rather than lactose as its carbohydrate calorie source. Many soy-protein formulas also do not contain lactose and are suitable for lactose-intolerant infants. In addition to ''corn''-syrup solids, other examples of carbohydrates contained in lactose-free formulas include sucrose (table ''sugar''), tapioca starch, modified cornstarch, and glucose polymers (short chains of glucose molecules).'""Proteins contain different amino acids that are linked together. Proteins provide both calories and the amino-acid building blocks that are necessary for proper growth. The protein in human milk provides between 10%-15% of an infant's daily caloric need. Casein and whey are the two major proteins of human milk and most milk-based formulas. (Immunoglobulins, a type of protein unique to breast milk, provide infection-fighting immunity and are not considered as a nutritional source and are not efficiently metabolized.) While formulas from different manufacturers may vary slightly in the relative proportion of these two proteins, healthy babies generally thrive on any milk-based formula brand.""'Some infants have a true ''allergy'' to the cow proteins that are in milk-based formulas. Infants with true ''cow milk allergy'' can develop ''abdominal pain'', diarrhea, ''rectal bleeding'', skin ''rash'', and ''wheezing'' when given milk-based formulas. These symptoms will disappear as soon milk-based formula is removed from the diet. ''Allergy'' to cow-milk protein is different from lactose intolerance. Treatment of cow-milk-protein ''allergy'' involves using formulas that contain no cow milk or using formulas that contain ""predigested"" casein and whey proteins. The predigesting process breaks the whole proteins into smaller pieces or into amino acids. The amino acids and smaller protein pieces are hypoallergenic (do not cause allergy).''Soy-protein formulas contain no cow milk and are reasonable alternatives for infants with true cow-''milk allergy''. Since most soy-protein formulas also contain no lactose, they are also suitable for infants with lactose intolerance. The carbohydrates in soy-protein formulas are sucrose, corn-syrup solids, and cornstarch or glucose polymers.''Certain infants have allergy to both cow-milk proteins and soy proteins. These infants require a formula in which the cow-milk protein (casein) has been ""predigested"" and specific amino acids added to provide a formula that can provide proper ''nutrition'"". The decision to utilize one of these specialized formulas should be made in consultation with the infant's pediatrician.""'Fat in human milk and formula provides a significant percentage of the total daily caloric needs for a growing infant. Formula manufacturers utilize many different vegetable oils for fat, including corn, soy, safflower, and coconut oils. Some formulas contain ""predigested"" ''fats'' known as medium chain ''triglycerides'' (MCT). These are analogous to the ""predigested proteins"" discussed above. Because of their unique application, formulas containing MCT are not routinely recommended for healthy infants and children.''There is a significant amount of research into determining the ideal concentration and ratios of fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) for infant ''nutrition'"". Some studies have suggested that these may have a positive effect on short-term cognitive function and possibly early visual acuity. More research is needed to clarify this issue, and you should discuss this with your infant's pediatrician before supplementing.""'Vitamins are organic substances that are essential in minute quantities for the proper growth, maintenance, and functioning of the baby. Vitamins must be obtained from food because the body cannot produce them. The exception is ''vitamin D'', which can be produced by the skin when it is exposed to the sun. All exclusively breastfed babies and infants consuming less than 32 oz/day of formula will not receive enough ''vitamin D'' precursor and thus should receive a daily ''vitamin D'' supplement. There are four fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and several water-soluble vitamins. These include the B vitamins, B1 (''thiamine''), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (''niacin''), B6 (''pyridoxine''), and B12 (cobalamin), as well as folate and ''vitamin C'' and pantothenic acid, and biotin. These vitamins have been added to infant formulas to ensure proper nutrition. Unless otherwise directed by their pediatricians, routine vitamin supplementation is not necessary for healthy full-term infants taking formulas.''High doses of certain vitamins can have adverse effects. For example, high doses of ''vitamin A'' can cause ''headaches'', ''vomiting'', ''liver'' damage, brain swelling, and bone abnormalities. High doses of vitamin D can lead to high levels of calcium in the blood and kidney and ''heart'' damage. Therefore, high doses of vitamins should not be given to infants and young children without supervision by their pediatricians.''Minerals (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, ''iodine'', copper, and zinc) and trace elements (manganese, chromium, selenium, and molybdenum) are included in most formulas. Therefore, there is no evidence that mineral supplementation is necessary for healthy formula-fed, full-term infants.''All parents desire to provide the best possible nutrition for their infant. As such, some parents prefer organic and non-GMO formulas. This is an individual decision, but there is little science to support these types in lieu of traditional formula choices. Similarly, some parents believe incorrectly that goat milk is an appropriate source of human (infant, children, and adult) nutrition. Unfortunately, goat milk is deficient in iron, folate, vitamins C and D, thiamine (vitamin B-1), niacin (vitamin B-3), ''vitamin B-6'', and pantothenic acid. Goat milk may also ''stress'"" a newborn's kidneys, resulting in metabolic acidosis.""   Milk-based formulas are prepared from cow milk with added vegetable oils, vitamins, minerals, and iron. These formulas are suitable for most healthy full-term infants and should be the feeding of choice when breastfeeding is not used, or is stopped before 1 year of age. Soy-based formulas are made from soy protein with added vegetable oils (for fat calories) and corn syrup and/or sucrose (for carbohydrate). These formulas are suitable for infants who cannot tolerate the lactose (lactose intolerant, see below) in most milk-based formulas or who are allergic to the whole protein in cow milk and milk-based formulas. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of soy formulas for the above infants as well as for infants of parents seeking a vegetarian-based diet for a term infant. These formulas are not recommended for low-birth-weight or preterm infants or for the prevention of colic or allergies. There are special formulas for low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, low-sodium formulas for infants that need to restrict salt intake, and ""predigested"" protein formulas for infants who cannot tolerate or are allergic to the whole proteins (casein and whey) in cow milk and milk-based formulas."
"So, what types of formula should parents give to their babies?"," Most infants and children will thrive on a cow-milk-based, lactose-containing formula such as Similac (Abbott Nutrition), Enfamil (Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals), or Good Start (Nestle). There are a number of smaller companies that produce routine application formulas that may be sold at larger stores as well as a number of big box stores (for example, Costco) that market their own proprietary formulas. Some infants may be lactose intolerant (not allergic) and will better tolerate a lactose-free milk-based formula such as Enfamil Lactofree (Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals) or Similac Lactose-Free (Abbott Nutrition). For children who are recovering from infectious diarrhea and gastroenteritis, the short-term use of lactose-free formulas may help decrease cramps and diarrhea. This should only be a temporary change, and reintroduction to standard formulas is recommended. Some parents of lactose-intolerant infants may prefer to use soy-protein-based formulas such as Isomil (Abbott Nutrition), Prosobee (Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals), and Allsoy (Nestle). Infants who are allergic to cow-milk protein can also use soy-based formulas. For infants who are allergic to cow-milk protein and soy protein, the ""predigested"" protein formulas including Pregestimil (Mead Johnson), Nutramigen (Mead Johnson), and Alimentum (Abbott Nutrition) can be used. Unique medical conditions may require a specific formula recommendation by the pediatrician. This applies to children with some common genetic deficiencies such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and for premature and low-birth-weight infants. Generic infant formulas are also available and are often made by the same manufacturers that produce the brand name products. Whether you are considering brand name or generic products, check the expiration dates on the packages, and compare ingredient lists to be sure you are purchasing products with the same ingredients. Homemade infant formulas are not recommended."
Can I make my own infant formula?,"""The U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend against homemade infant formulas. This is due to the fact that these formulas do not meet all of an infant's nutritional needs. In addition, cow-milk protein that has not been cooked or processed appropriately is difficult for an infant to digest and may damage an infant's immature kidneys and/or intestines, causing ""'anemia'"" from bleeding into the bowel movements. Today's ""'infant formula'' is a very controlled, state-of-the-art product that cannot be duplicated at home.' "
How much sleep do children need?,"'Just as with adults, the amount of ''sleep'' children need varies with both age and unique needs of the individual. Below are general guidelines for children of various ages. If your child is happy and thriving, but needs more or fewer hours of ''sleep'"" than indicated below - rest assured they will remain healthy. The National Sleep Foundation's 2015 Guidelines recommend the following for sleep in children and ""'teens''.'  1 to 4 weeks old: Neonates spend approximately 65% to 75% of their daily activity in a sleep state. Waking time is of short duration and it is rare for a child of this age to have a ""day-night"" cycle. Their day-night ""clock"" is not functional until 6 to 8 weeks of age. Mothers of newborns should use their infant's sleep pattern to sleep also. 1 to 4 months old: Infants at this early age require sleep 14 to 17 hours 
of sleep per day. Many begin to develop a day-night cycle during the early weeks of this period. 
At this age, many infants have the ability to sleep evening blocks of 5 to 6 hours without interruption; however most will wake for feedings or diaper changes during the night. 4 to 12 months old: Infants in this age range require 12 to 15 hours of sleep daily. Good news for parents 
- they begin to sleep for longer continuous periods at night. Also, early in this time period, many children benefit from multiple daytime naps, though there is significant variability between different infants.  1 to 3 years old: While specialists point out that most toddlers need about 12 to 14 hours of daily sleep, many may be forced to survive on less. Daycare and erratically spaced car trips necessary for the needs of older siblings often deny or disrupt continuous sleep patterns, most often naps. 3 to 6 years old: This age range commonly needs approximately 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day with younger individuals taking a nap after lunch. Any need for napping is generally absent by the time a child enters 1st grade. 7 to 12 years old: Younger children in this age range commonly require 
9 to 11 hours of sleep each night; pre-teens often receive 9 to 10 hours (though some may require more). 12 to 18 years old: Middle and high school student lifestyle requirements (school, after school activities, dinner and finally homework) often reduce the sleep duration from the recommended 8 to 
10 hours to 6 to 8 hours. The various social network computer websites coupled with cell phone text communication 
and television viewing also may cut into a teenager's sleep time."
Can a lack of sleep impact a child's behavior?,"'The symptoms of a lack of sleep are often obvious to watchful parents. Some of these tell-tale signs include: ' recurrently falling asleep in the car (excluding young infants); requiring extreme stimulation and repetitive reminders to get up in the morning;  behavioral abnormalities such as excessive emotionalism, aggression, and crankiness; and  an older child's (over 8 years of age) recurrent need for an afternoon nap."
What is sleep hygiene?,"'A common definition of sleep hygiene is'' '' ""all behavioral and environmental factors that precede sleep and may interfere with sleep."" Daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping may be a reflection of poor sleep hygiene. Detailed specifics are listed below. General areas to consider include: ' Personal habits: Establish consistent routines around bedtimes and awakening times  Sleep environment: The bedroom should be a slightly cooler temperature 
(between 60 F to 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C), and eliminate any distracting noise in the bedroom Getting ready for bed: Establish a calming pre-sleep ritual (for example, reading, not watching TV) and  Miscellaneous: Examples include limiting intake of foods/liquids/medications which may disrupt a restful sleep"
What are some common sleep disorders in children?,"""The University of Michigan's ""'Sleep Disorders'' program includes five issues that may be disruptive of good sleep practices. These include: ' Sleep deprivation: As noted in the previously, the amount of sleep generally required varies with age and genetic predisposition. Unfortunately many older children, especially teens, do not receive an appropriate amount of sound sleep. Night waking: All children after the first 7 to 8 months of life start to be more sensitive to internal and external stimuli. If an infant has not yet learned to calm himself and resettle back to sleep, the parents commonly are summoned to help the child return to sleep. This pattern may repeat itself several times each night. Separation anxiety: Children experience this emotion commonly at 5 months of age as well as during the toddler years. Such children become anxious and are unable to enter a comfortable sleep pattern unless parents are present.  Resistance to sleep/settling problems: This occurs when your child does not want to go to bed at a reasonable time. Stalling, temper tantrums, and other resistance patterns are common. Parental persistence generally will resolve this common issue. Parasomnias: Parasomnias are problems that disrupt sleep. Examples include night terrors, grinding of teeth, sleepwalking, etc."
Sleep Apnea symptoms in children,"'Sleep apnea'' is an extremely serious sleep pathology in which the child will struggle to breath and possibly stop ''breathing'"". This process most commonly is a consequence of an enlarged tonsil and adenoid tissues that obstruct the child's upper ""'airway'"". Parents of such children will report that it sounds as if their child is being choked during sleep. Complications of sleep apnea include reduced oxygen to the brain and strain of the right side of the heart. If you believe your child may have sleep apnea, you should discuss your concerns with your child's pediatrician. An evaluation by and ENT (ears-nose-throat) specialist is often indicated. It is helpful to either audio/video record such an episode prior to such an evaluation."" "
Parasomnia symptoms in children,"'Parasomnias are disruptive sleep related events. They include several infrequent events (''periodic limb movement disorder'', ''restless leg syndrome'') and more common events (''teeth grinding'', night terrors, and ''nightmares'', sleepwalking, and ''bedwetting''). Periodic limb movement disorder occurs while asleep and is characterized by repetitive leg and (occasionally) arm movement that persist throughout the night. The child or teenager does not complain of any discomfort or abnormal sensations. In contrast, ''restless leg syndrome'' occurs while awake and affected individuals often describe a sensation of their legs ""falling asleep.""''Nightmares occur during REM (dreaming period) sleep and thus are more common later in the night. The child acts scared but may be comforted by their parents. Such children will often be able to remember their dream. Simple parental reassurance and comforting is effective. In contrast, night terrors occur in non-''REM sleep'' and thus generally within the first 4 hours of sleep. The child may become very violent with crying out in a confused manner as well as thrashing of arms and legs. Routine comforting of the child is not helpful and the child will be confused and bewildered if awakened. Generally, the child will rapidly return to a ""normal"" sleep with no memory of the events in the morning.' "
Confusional arousal symptoms in children,"'Confusional arousals are a variant of night terrors in older infants and toddlers that occur during the first half of the nighttime sleep sequence. It is felt that the child is so deeply asleep and the normal waking pattern at the end of the sleep cycle is suppressed. ''The major distinguishing point of confusional arousals versus night terrors is that the former gradually build from moaning, to crying out, and may culminate in the child standing and yelling out apparent random words or phrases. ''Conversely, night terrors tend to have an acute onset with the very rapid development of thrashing and yelling (commonly for the parents or caregivers). Confusional arousal and night terrors share several key points important for the child:' Don't try to awaken the child. They are asleep and if awakened, will have difficult time falling back to sleep. Anything that upsets the normal sleep rhythms (illness, not sleeping in their own home, and disrupted naps) may trigger either pattern."
Night terror symptoms in children,"'Night terrors are somewhat rare events that have their highest frequency in children 4 to 12 years of age. They are commonly outgrown by adulthood, though some adults manifest the same brain ''EEG'' (""brain wave"") changes during sleepwalking. ''Night terrors differ from nightmares (see previously). Night terrors manifest themselves with the person bolting upright in bed, screaming and thrashing about and stare blankly at the concerned adult who has come to investigate. They tend to occur during the first third of the child\'s sleep cycle. Children characteristically do not ""calm down"" when their parent attempts to soothe what appears to be a fearful experience. EEG studies demonstrate that the child is not awake (i.e. he/she is asleep), and if awakened, has no knowledge or memory of the immediately preceding events. The duration of night terror episodes is short lived. Some authorities believe that night terrors may be a response to sleep deprivation, ''stress'', ''fever'', or ''fatigue''.' "
Narcolepsy symptoms in children,"'Narcolepsy'' is more common in adults than children. It has been defined as ""a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Narcolepsy is a chronic condition for which there is no cure."" Research has shown that narcolepsy is not a type of ''seizure'', ''fainting'' episode, or psychological illness. Symptoms of narcolepsy include:' Excessive daytime sleepiness: affected individuals have an uncontrollable need to sleep during the day; Sudden loss of muscle tone (Cataplexy): this may range from slurred speech to total collapse of all voluntary muscles. Emotional stimulation (often positive by nature, for example, laughter) may trigger such an attack; Sleep paralysis: Characterized by a temporary (1-2 minutes) period of the inability to speak or move when falling asleep or waking; Vivid or frightening hallucinations which occur most commonly during REM (dreaming) sleep."
Sleepwalking symptoms in children,"'The onset of sleepwalking (somnambulism) typically presents in prepubertal children most frequently at age 11 to 12, and occurs more often in boys than girls. The overall incidence of sleepwalking is approximately 18%. Like night terrors, the individual is difficult to arouse during the event and does not remember the experience. Sleepwalking most commonly occurs during the first third of the sleep cycle. Some sleepwalkers may also mumble during sleepwalking episodes and occasionally obscene words may be uttered. Medications are rarely necessary to manage sleepwalking episodes. Ensuring a safe environment (protection against falls or ''walking'' out of the house) and maintenance of good sleep habits (avoiding sleep deprivation) are important considerations to prevent sleepwalking.' "
Do teenagers have the same sleep requirements as younger children?,"'Most teens need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day. Some studies have indicated that they have a different internal ""sleep clock"" than those younger or older than them. Researchers have demonstrated that teens are truly ""night owls,"" and if left to their own devices, would spontaneously wake from a good night\'s sleep anywhere from 9:00 am to 10:00 am. High school teachers who have classes before this time period have empiric experience to second this observation. Younger children may need anywhere from 12-15 hours (infant: 2 naps plus nighttime long block) to 9-11 hours (middle school child). ' "
How can I teach my child or teenager healthy sleep habits and good sleep hygiene?,"'Primary to establishing good sleep habits is a realization that sleep is a normal and necessary function. However, just as with other normal and necessary functions (for example, eating, toilet training, etc.), a battle may develop between parents and their child in this area. ''All children older than 5 to 6 months of age need to master the ability to self-soothe and relax in order to successfully fall asleep. Depriving them of this skill by either feeding or rocking them to sleep, reading until the child falls asleep, or lying down with the child in order to facilitate falling asleep, is a recipe for frustration - both for the child and the parent. ''Tired children (of any age) intuitively know when they are tired and, if provided the proper environment, will easily and quickly fall asleep. ''When they awaken during the middle of the night they are capable of falling back to sleep without parental intervention. In this circumstance, both child and parents awake refreshed the next morning.' "
What are some ways I can help my child or teenager get a better night's sleep?,"'These ""do\'s"" are adapted from ""''Sleep Problems'': Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System and ""Healthy Sleep Tips"" from the National Sleep Foundation.'  Make bedtime a special time. Create special soothing and calming experiences with the opportunity for special ""talks"" or sharing experiences that foster comfort for both child and parent. Study your child so you can determine when he is ready to sleep. Once this is determined you can start the ""get ready for bed"" routine with enough time in advance so the child doesn't get a ""second wind"". Keep the bedtime routine consistent and simple. Mental and physical stimulation is counter productive. Dim lights starting about 10 – 15 minutes before going to sleep.  Bright lights act as a stimulant to the child's brain.   Keep the bedtime routine portable. For example, it can occur whether at home or outside of the home (for example, in a motel during vacation). Make sure your child is both mentally and physically tired at the end of the day. Children need between 30 to 60 minutes per day of vigorous playtime (depending on the age). Besides fostering good sleep habits, such a program will help maintain optimum weight gain. Establish a restful atmosphere. Keep the lights dim, limit noise and electronic devices. Teens should turn off computers/TV's and cell phones when retiring to bed. 
The bedroom temperature should be between 60 F and 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C. Avoid afternoon naps in children over 6 years of age."
"What are some ""don'ts"" for getting my child or teen to sleep?","'These ""don\'ts"" are adapted from ""Sleep Problems: Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System.' Don't put your child to bed with a bottle of juice, milk or formula. Sugar in such drinks promotes tooth decay. Water is acceptable. Don't fill up the bed with toys. Limit the crib/bed to one to two ""special"" items. Too many items are over stimulating and the child will have a hard time not playing with them. Eliminate any object that might be a safety hazard. Don't threaten to send your child to bed as a punishment. Bedtime should be an enjoyable experience that will promote falling asleep in a timely fashion. Avoid caffeine before bed: Caffeinated drinks such as cola, chocolate, iced tea, 
energy drinks, etc. Limit TV in the afternoon and at night. TV stimulation may carry on longer than you suspect. Having a TV in a child's room may be counterproductive to getting your child or teen to sleep. A 2014 National Sleep Foundation study indicates that 72% of children 6 years old to 17 years old have at least one electronic device in their bedroom.  These children may get up to one hour less sleep per night as their peers without such devices in the bedroom."
What is Chikungunya virus?,'The infection caused by Chikungunya virus is was first described in East Africa in 1952. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and belongs to the family ''Togaviridae'' in the genus ''Alphavirus''.'  
Where is Chikungunya virus most prevalent?,"'Although Chikungunya virus has been mainly reported in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans, it has spread to the Americas recently. However, you no longer have to travel to a faraway place such as French Polynesia like Lindsay Lohan did in December 2014 to become infected. In 2013 the virus had spread to the Caribbean islands. As of December 2014, 41 countries or territories in the Caribbean, Central America, South America and North America have had laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya infections.'  "
How does Chikungunya virus spread?," Humans are infected when Aedes aegypti and albopictus mosquitoes, containing Chikungunya virus, bite humans. The viruses are transmitted during the mosquito bite (blood meal). The viruses then multiply in humans and can then be picked up by other uninfected mosquitoes when they bite infected humans to complete the viral replication cycle."
Is Chikungunya virus infection contagious?,"'Chikungunya virus infection is not considered to be ''contagious'' because there is no direct human to human transfer of Chikungunya viruses, so infected individuals cannot directly transfer the virus to another human because the virus has to pass through a mosquito first. However, outbreaks can occur in populations where a number of both mosquitoes and humans are infected with the virus. Rarely, the virus may be transmitted from the mother to her ''newborn''; also, researchers suggest the virus may possibly be transferred by blood transfusions from an infected individual.' "
What are Chikungunya virus infection symptoms and signs?,"'Most people that become infected with the virus will develop some symptoms usually within three to seven days after a bite by an infected mosquito.''The most common symptoms are''The affected individual also may develop''Most patients feel better in about seven days, but in some individuals the joint ''pain'' may last for months. The symptoms are similar to those of another disease, ''dengue fever'', which is also spread by the same mosquitoes.''Rare complications include''Neonates and the elderly (>65 years), especially those with other medical problems, are at highest risk for severe disease and complications''Death is rare and occurs mainly in the elderly.'  fever, joint pain, and swelling. headache, muscle pain, and/or rash. eye problems and inflammation of the heart, liver, brain, skin, kidneys and nerves."
How do health care professionals diagnose Chikungunya virus infections?,"'The Chikungunya disease may be diagnosed by blood antibody tests that distinguish between this infection and dengue ''fever'', a similar viral disease, and other diseases.''There is no medicine or ''vaccine'' available to specifically treat or prevent Chikungunya virus infections.' "
What is the treatment for Chikungunya virus infection?,"'Medical treatments and home remedies to relive symptoms of Chikungunya virus infections include''Once a person recovers from Chikungunya infection, researchers suggest the person develops life-long immunity to the virus type.'  rest, fluids, and any medicines that might reduce the fever and pain."
Is it possible to prevent a Chikungunya virus infection?,"'The best way to prevent Chikungunya infections is to avoid getting mosquito bites.''If you do become infected, you should protect yourself from any further mosquito bites because you can transfer the virus from you to a mosquito and possibly into another person if that mosquito bites another uninfected individual.' Eliminate areas where mosquitoes breed (emptying containers where water is left standing, for example). Wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Use insect repellents appropriately."
What is Cryptococcus?,"'Cryptococcus'' is a type of fungus that is found in the soil worldwide, usually in association with bird droppings. The major species of ''Cryptococcus'' that causes illness in human is ''Cryptococcus neoformans''. Another less common species that can also cause disease in humans, ''Cryptococcus gattii'', has been isolated from eucalyptus trees in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Since 1999, ''C. gattii'' has also been found in regions of the Pacific Northwest, particularly Victoria Island in British Columbia, and Oregon and Washington in the United States. ' "
Who gets cryptococcosis?,"'Cryptococcosis is disease due to a species of the fungus ''Cryptococcus''. ''C. neoformans'' typically infects immunocompromised persons. Most people in the United States who develop cryptococcal infections are ''HIV''-positive. However, occasionally persons with no apparent immune system problems develop cryptococcosis. Infections with ''C. gattii'' have also occurred in healthy persons without compromised immune systems. '  "
How is Cryptococcus spread?,'Inhalation'' of airborne fungi. Cryptococcosis is not known to be spread from person to person. ' 
What are the symptoms of a cryptococcal infection?,"'Cryptococcal infection may cause a ''pneumonia''-like illness, with shortness of breath, ''coughing'' and ''fever''. Skin lesions may also occur. Another common form of cryptococcosis is central nervous system infection, such as ''meningoencephalitis''. People with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis are usually immunocompromised. Symptoms may include ''fever'', ''headache'', or change in mental status. '  "
How soon do symptoms appear?,'Incubation times vary for infection due to ''Cryptococcus'' species. Symptoms from ''C. gattii'' infection are estimated to begin anywhere from 2-11 months after exposure. The incubation time for ''C. neoformans'' is not known. ' 
"If I have symptoms, should I see my doctor?","'Yes, it is very important to seek immediate medical evaluation. ' "
How is a cryptococcal infection diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis can be made by microscopic examination and/or culture of tissue or body fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid and sputum. The cryptococcal antigen test is a rapid test that can be performed on blood and/or on cerebrospinal fluid to make the diagnosis. ' "
How are cryptococcal infections treated?,"'Treatment of meningoencephalitis and other severe infections is usually initiated with an amphotericin B formulation, with or without ''flucytosine''.  ''Fluconazole'' is used for maintenance therapy in ''HIV''-infected patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, and may be used for patients with milder forms of infection not involving the central nervous system. ' "
How can cryptococcal infections be prevented?,"'C. neoformans'' is commonly spread by bird droppings, especially pigeon droppings. People who have weakened immune systems should avoid areas contaminated by bird droppings, and should avoid contact with birds. There are no formal recommendations for the ''prevention'' of ''C. gattii'' infection. ' "
What is a Cyclospora infection?,'Cyclosporiasis is a diarrheal illness that occurs when humans accidentally ingest the ''Cyclospora cayetanensis'' parasite. This happens by drinking or eating uncooked items contaminated with soil or water.' 
What causes a Cyclospora infection?,"'Cyclospora cayetanensis'' was originally described as coccidian or ''Cyanobacterium''-like because it resembled certain algae. In fact, it is a parasite that cycles between the environment (soil) and humans during its life cycle. It survives for long periods of time in nature as an oocyst. ''Cyclospora'' oocysts can resist extreme temperatures and the usual levels of chlorine in treated water. When temperatures warm, the oocyst matures and releases the infectious forms, called sporocysts. When sporocysts are ingested by a human, they invade the epithelial cells of the small intestine. They multiply in the cells and produce new oocysts. These are excreted in feces, starting the cycle all over again.'  "
What are the risk factors for a Cyclospora infection?,"'Cyclospora cayetanensis'"" causes disease throughout the world, but it is commonest in tropical and subtropical climates. Outbreaks in cooler areas are often caused by food imported from warmer climates. Food is at risk if exposed to soil or water that is contaminated with human feces. Fresh produce like lettuce, raspberries, basil, and snow peas have caused past outbreaks. In 2013, an outbreak involved many states, including Texas, Iowa, and Nebraska. It affected hundreds of people and was at least partially caused by bagged lettuce grown in Mexico. There have been small outbreaks in 31 states with a total of 546 people diagnosed with the infection in 2015. Two large outbreaks occurred in 2018, one due to vegetables (packaged) by Del Monte and another by salads by McDonald's, resulting in their recall from about 3,000 locations.\xa0In 2018, the CDC documented over 300 cases of ""'Cyclospora'' infection associated with bagged lettuce in 15 states.''Although travel to a tropical or subtropical country is a risk factor for ''Cyclospora'' infection, the risk is relatively low. ''Cyclospora'' is not a major cause of ''travelers'""' ""'diarrhea''.' "
Is Cyclospora contagious? What is the contagious period for Cyclospora?,"'Cyclospora'' is not ''contagious'' directly from person to person. Even though the oocysts are shed in ''stool'', they take days to weeks to mature in the environment before becoming infectious. People can only be infected by eating or drinking something contaminated with mature oocysts. This is called fecal-oral transmission.' "
What are the symptoms of a Cyclospora infection?,"'Cyclospora'' causes watery diarrhea that lasts more than a week, up to four weeks or more. This is called cyclosporiasis. Abdominal cramping or belly ''pain'' and ''fatigue'' are common. The infected person may have five to 15 bowel movements per day. Also common are ''heartburn'', ''nausea'', increased ''gas'', ''decreased appetite'', and ''weight loss''. ''Flu-like symptoms'' with low-grade ''fever'' and muscle aches is less common. Symptoms are worse in those with weak immune systems, such as people with ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS'').'  "
What is the incubation period for a Cyclospora infection?,"'The incubation period (the time between swallowing the oocysts and the start of symptoms) is two to 14 days, or an average of 10 days.' "
What types of specialists treat Cyclospora infections?,"'Most people with persistent diarrhea will probably be evaluated first by a primary care provider, such as an internist, pediatrician, family medicine doctor, or nurse practitioner. As diarrhea continues beyond a couple of weeks, referrals may be made to a gastroenterologist or an infectious disease doctor for further evaluation and treatment.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a Cyclospora infection?,"'Most cases of diarrhea are caused by ''viruses'' or bacteria that produce an illness only for a few days and resolve without specific treatment. Most people are not sick long enough to go to the doctor and have tests performed. If a person has diarrhea that is persisting beyond a week or so, there are a number of possible causes including intestinal parasites. Food, travel, and antibiotic exposures should be discussed with a health care provider, who may order ''stool'' studies. Doctors diagnose ''Cyclospora'' infections by examining the stool under a microscope and finding oocysts. Even with a lot of diarrhea, oocysts may be hard to find, because oocysts are not shed continuously. At least three stool samples should be collected 24-48 hours apart. To increase the ability to diagnose ''Cyclospora'', special staining methods such as acid-fast stain (results are variable), ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') tests, and stool specimen concentration techniques are used. Physicians must alert the laboratory to look for ''Cyclospora'' if ordering stool studies, because these tests are not routine. There is no blood test that can detect ''Cyclospora''.' "
What is the treatment for Cyclospora infections?,"'Cyclospora'"" infection often goes away by itself, and mild or asymptomatic cases require no treatment. For those who require treatment, the best option is oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, also called co-trimoxazole) (Bactrim, Septra) twice daily for seven to 10 days. For those who continue to have symptoms or have persistent oocysts on stool examination, another seven-day course is usually effective. Sometimes anti-diarrheal medication is recommended, but only under the doctor's approval. For people with a sulfa ""'allergy'', there are few good options. There are reported cases where ''nitazoxanide'' (''Alinia'') twice daily was successful as an alternate therapy. One small study suggested that ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'', ''Cipro XR'', ProQuin XR) twice daily for seven days is an option in adults. However, it has a higher failure rate compared to TMP-SMX. These medications are not approved for routine use in ''pregnancy''. ''Pregnant'' women should check with their obstetrician (ob-gyn doctor) before taking any new prescription.'  "
What are complications of cyclosporiasis?,"'Profuse, watery diarrhea may cause ''dehydration''. Thus, keeping up with fluids is important. Diarrhea also contains salts and potassium, so drinking fluids that contain ''electrolytes'' (such as sports ''drinks'') may be beneficial. Some people feel loss of energy for some time after the diarrhea goes away.' "
What is the prognosis of a Cyclospora infection?,"'The prognosis of cyclosporiasis is excellent and complete recovery is anticipated. As discussed above, recovery can be hastened by the use of antibiotics in symptomatic people.''Patients who are infected with the ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), however, may relapse after treatment is stopped and should be referred to an infectious disease doctor.' "
Is it possible to prevent Cyclospora infections?,"'General ''food safety'' practices are important to prevent many infections and ''food poisoning'', especially while traveling in areas where sanitation is uncertain. Wash hands in disinfected or fizzy water or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer before eating. Cooked food that is served steaming hot is generally safe, but various types of undercooked or raw fruits and vegetables pose a risk of ''Cyclospora'' and other infections. A good rule of thumb for travelers is to avoid raw fruits and vegetables, or to wash and peel them personally with cleaned hands with disinfected or factory-sealed bottled water. Bottled or canned fizzy drinks are safe to drink and wash with; bubbles mean the bottle has not been refilled with tap water and sealed with glue. If a water filter is used, it must be labeled as effective against ''cysts'' or particles up to 1 micron (a measure of length equal to one millionth of a meter). Fresh produce or foods that have been handled raw, such as salsas, salad greens, or cut-up fruit on a platter, are best avoided.''Since many foods are grown or prepared outside the U.S., it is important to consider food safety at home, as well. Pre-packaged raw vegetables and fruits, especially with extra handling (for example, chopped bagged salad mix), should be thoroughly rinsed even if labeled as triple washed.''Cyclospora'' may cause infection more than once if contaminated food or water is ingested. Currently, there is no available ''vaccine'' to prevent infection with ''Cyclospora cayetanensis''.' "
What is an enterovirus?,"'Human enteroviruses are a genus in the family ''Picornaviridae'' (small positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses) that were originally classified or named as polioviruses, Coxsackie A viruses, Coxsackie B viruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Rhinoviruses are included as enteroviruses by many researchers but not all. There are well over 100 types of known enteroviruses (genus ''Enterovirus''). The virus that causes ''hand, foot, and mouth disease'' belongs to the group of so-called ''non-polio enteroviruses''.''These enteroviruses usually spread from person to person by direct contact with the viruses that shed from the gastrointestinal tract or upper respiratory tract. In general, health care providers categorize these viruses as either polio or non-polioviruses. Polioviruses (only three types, P1-3) and non-polioviruses may have similar initial symptoms. In the majority of infections caused by both polio and non-polioviruses, an infected person may be asymptomatic (not show any symptoms) or only have mild symptoms, including ''fever'', ''headache'', ''sore throat'', ''loss of appetite'', and abdominal discomfort that resolves with no sequelae (complications). However, in some patients, especially children, these infections may cause serious disease that may produce lifelong problems and, infrequently, may cause death.''Recently, non-enterovirus species names were revised to remove host names (human, bovine, simian, and porcine) and replaced with the group designation (A through J) and serotype number. The group is based on the similarity within the RNA region that codes for the outer protein of the virus, and serotype number corresponds to a specific neutralizing serum (antibody). Consequently, human enterovirus 68, for example (also called HEV-68 and ED68) is now termed EV-D68. There will be ''confusion'' and overlap of enterovirus names for the next few years as researchers and clinicians adjust to this extensive name change. In this article, both new and currently accepted names of these viruses and the disease(s) they may cause will be used. For example, Coxsackie viruses could be labeled CV-A4 or CV-B5, depending on their group and/or serotype; similarly, echovirus=E-14 or rhinovirus=RV-A25, RV-B79, or RV-C41.' "
What types of illnesses do enteroviruses cause?,"'As stated previously, enteroviruses cause two main types of human disease, polio, and non-polio disease. In this article, the focus will be on the non-polio disease-causing enteroviruses. Non-polio enteroviruses may cause a wide range of infections that overlap; for example...' enterovirus: aseptic meningitis with rash, conjunctivitis, hand, foot, and mouth disease (EV-71), paralysis (EV-71), myopericarditis group A Coxsackie virus: flaccid paralysis, hand, foot, and mouth disease, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, herpangina, aseptic meningitis (with or without rash) group B Coxsackie virus: spastic paralysis, herpangina, pleurodynia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and meningoencephalitis echovirus: common cold, rash, aseptic meningitis, myopericarditis, paralysis, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis rhinovirus: the common cold (over 100 different serotypes), mild respiratory illness"
What are causes and risk factors for an enterovirus infection?,"'The causes for enterovirus infections are simply the passage of one of the many enteroviruses from one person directly to another, usually by contact with respiratory secretions and/or ''stool'' from infected individuals. Occasionally, enteroviruses may contaminate environmental sources such as water. The most common risk factor for getting an enterovirus infection is direct contact with any bodily secretions (especially respiratory and/or fecal) from an infected individual. Individuals with immature (neonates and infants) or compromised immune systems (for example, children with ''type 1 diabetes'') also are at higher risk for enterovirus infections than normal children or adults. ''Pregnant'' females and individuals with respiratory problems like ''asthma'' are at higher risk. Individuals are at highest risk during the fall and summer months.' "
Are enteroviruses contagious?,"'Yes, enteroviruses are contagious often by direct contact from person to person with respiratory secretions or by contact with fecal material. Some enteroviruses spread indirectly when uninfected people come in contact with food or fluids contaminated by secretions (feces, oral secretions, or droplets) from infected individuals. The viruses are capable of surviving on surfaces like tables and door handles for several days.' "
What is the incubation period for an enterovirus infection?,"'The average incubation period (time from exposure to first symptoms) ranges from about three to 10 days. Symptoms, when present in uncomplicated infections, last about a week.' "
What is the contagious period for an enterovirus infection?,"'In general, individuals are contagious about three days after exposure to the virus and remain contagious until about 10 days after they develop symptoms. Individuals can shed infectious viruses even if they have no symptoms or during the incubation period and/or after symptoms stop.' "
What are symptoms and signs of an enterovirus infection in children and adults?,"'Stated previously, many individuals who become infected with enteroviruses have no or only mild symptoms (fever, ''headache'', ''sore throat'', loss of appetite, and abdominal discomfort, often without ''diarrhea'') of infection that may last about a week and resolve with no further problems. However, those people at higher risk may develop one or more of the following symptoms:''As noted above, some strains of enteroviruses produce different symptoms, some of which are much more severe than others. In addition, some strains occasionally appear to be more transmissible and cause more intense or severe symptoms. Two recent examples are enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and EV-D68.'   Common cold: nasal discharge, cough, mild fever, mild malaise Hypoxia (low oxygen in the blood): shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, rapid breathing, skin coloration change (bluish to cherry red), rapid heart rate Aseptic meningitis: most common among infants and children; may also occur with a rash (on face, neck, and extremities), fever, painful headache, stiff neck, body aches, sensitivity to light, nausea and vomiting, irritability Conjunctivitis (hemorrhagic): eye pain, bleeding seen in the whites of the eyes, photophobia (avoidance of light due to discomfort) Myopericarditis: shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, weakness Herpangina: small flat sores on the oral mucosa (tonsils and soft palate) that may produce blisters and ulcerate Pleurodynia: intermittent chest pain usually over the lower part of the rib cage; some individuals may have a plural friction rub that can be heard when the doctor examines the chest with a stethoscope Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD): small nodules and blisters that are tender and appear gray that occur on the hands, feet, and in the oral cavity Encephalitis: Symptoms range from lethargy and drowsiness to personality changes, seizures, and coma. Paralysis (infrequent in both polio and non-polio intro viral infections): flaccid paralysis that is often asymmetric with proximal extremity muscles affected; lower extremities affected more commonly than upper extremities (poliovirus, enterovirus 71, and coxsackievirus A7); other non-polio enteroviruses usually have less severe symptoms (for example, muscle weakness and oculomotor palsy) if paralysis develops"
"How 
do physicians diagnose an enterovirus infection?","'In general, physicians diagnose enterovirus infections by clinical symptoms. Health care professionals infrequently perform blood tests. The best test is ''polymerase chain reaction'' (PCR) that is available from specialized laboratories and used most often during outbreaks of viral infections. In addition, it is useful to distinguish between enterovirus infections and other viral infections like ''rotavirus'' and ''influenza'' viruses. Infrequently, health care professionals isolate the infecting enterovirus by cell cultures taken from the blood, feces, or cerebrospinal fluid and then identified by further immunologic tests. Other tests such as chest ''X-rays'', ''echocardiography'', ''lumbar puncture'', and ECGs may help determine the extent of infection.' "
What is the treatment for an enterovirus infection?,"'Briefly, the best treatment for an enterovirus infection is prevention. For poliovirus, an effective vaccine is available. Unfortunately, for non-polio enteroviruses, the treatment is supportive and designed to reduce the symptoms because there are no antiviral medications currently approved for the treatment of these types of enterovirus infections. Many doctors recommend using ''over-the-counter'' medications to reduce symptoms.''Doctors may use immunoglobulins in infected neonates and immunocompromised hosts to both treat and prevent non-polio enterovirus central nervous system infections, but these immunoglobulin treatments are not always very effective. Consequently, supportive measures such as fever control, assisted-breathing methods (ranging from inhaled steroids to ''intubation''), ''pain''-control medications, and topical skin and oral mucosal medications to reduce symptoms are given.''Since March 2018, Pleconaril, a 3C ''protease inhibitor'' drug, has been awaiting FDA approval as an intranasal spray to treat rhinoviral infections. In the past, doctors have used the drug for compassionate treatment only in life-threatening enteroviral infections.'  "
What types of doctors treat enterovirus infections?,"'Many individuals are treated with supportive measures only; primary physicians (usually a pediatrician but possibly a specialist in family practice or internal medicine) treat some. In other instances, especially with individuals with complications, infectious-disease specialists, critical care specialists, cardiologists, and/or lung specialists may treat patients. Rarely, a neurology specialist may be consulted.' "
"Non-polio enterovirus outbreaks, including enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) and 71","'The recent outbreaks of various non-polio enteroviruses are listed below; (the data is modified from reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).'  Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in the United States. However, in 2011 and 2012, coxsackievirus A6 was a common cause of HFMD in this country; some of the infected people became severely ill. Coxsackievirus A24 and enterovirus 70 have been associated with outbreaks of conjunctivitis. Echoviruses 13, 18, and 30 have caused outbreaks of viral meningitis in the United States. Enterovirus 71 has caused large outbreaks of HFMD worldwide, especially in children in Asia, especially China. Some infections from this virus have been associated with severe neurologic disease, such as brainstem encephalitis. Enterovirus D 68 had a nationwide outbreak in the U.S. from August 2014 to January 2015. A total of 1,153 people in 49 states and the District of Columbia had confirmed D68 infection. Almost all the individuals infected were children who also had a history of asthma or wheezing. Health officials detected D68 enteroviruses in 14 patients who died. However, the CDC indicated that there were likely millions of enterovirus D68-infected individuals (infants, toddlers, and children) with mild illness who did not seek medical treatment or get tested for the infection in the United States. Thailand, in 2017, reported an outbreak of enterovirus A71 with 163 infected patients."
What are complications of an enterovirus infection?,"'The majority of enterovirus infections last about a week to 10 days and have no complications. However, complications can occur in some patients and range from mild (rash, mild conjunctivitis, skin lesions) to more severe (shortness of breath, encephalitis, myopericarditis, chest pains, weakness with paralysis, coma and rarely, death).' "
What is the prognosis of an enterovirus infection?,"""The prognosis of most enterovirus infections is good; most individuals will spontaneously resolve their infection in about seven to 10 days and have no complications. Some patients, especially those who are immunocompromised in any way, may develop more severe infections. The more severe infections can have a prognosis that can range from good to poor, depending upon the severity of the viral strain causing the infection and the strength (or weakness) of the individual's immune response. Consultation with an appropriate specialist (cardiologist, pulmonologist or others, depending on the particular complications) is recommended."" "
Is it possible to prevent an enterovirus infection? Is there a vaccine for enteroviruses?,"'Individuals can reduce the chance of getting an enterovirus infection simply by avoiding direct contact with people who are infected with enteroviruses and by using such techniques as good hand washing and cleaning or disinfecting items that come in contact with infected individuals. Health care professionals routinely vaccinate people against certain enteroviruses (polioviruses); as a result, polio is rarely seen in developing countries. Unfortunately, no ''vaccines'' are available for non-polio enteroviruses, although Chinese investigators have indicated they have two ''vaccines'' against enterovirus 71 in successful phase 3 trials. Part of the reason there are no vaccines for these viruses is that there is a very large number of subtypes of non-polio enteroviruses and a vaccine developed against one subtype is usually not effective against another subtype.'

Facts and definition of HPV,"  Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect human skin and mucous membranes. Certain HPV types, known as high-risk HPV types, are known to cause cervical cancer and other cancers including cancers of the penis, anus, vagina, vulva, and oral cavity. Other HPV types cause genital warts or warts elsewhere on the body. HPV is highly contagious and is spread through close contact, including sexual contact. It is estimated that most sexually active people will become infected with HPV at some point. HPV infection typically does not cause signs or symptoms. In most cases, HPV infection goes away on its own, without long-term problems. Vaccines are available (for example, Gardasil and Gardasil 9) to prevent infection with the most common cancer-causing HPV types and the types that are most likely to cause genital warts. There is no specific treatment that can cure HPV infection, although treatments are available for warts and cancers caused by HPV. Condoms also help prevent the HPV spread."
What is HPV (human papillomavirus)?,"'The human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of over 100 virus types that infect human skin and ''mucus'' membranes.' Most people with HPV never know they are infected and never develop any problems, signs, or symptoms related to the infection, which usually goes away on its own. In fact, HPV infection is so common, it is estimated that most sexually active men and women get the infection at some point in their lives. However, certain types of HPVs may cause health problems in some people. For example, some HPV types cause genital warts and cervical cancers, while others cause typical skin warts. Not every infection with HPV results in health problems, or even produces signs and symptoms. Cancers caused by HPV typically take many years, even decades, to develop."
Is HPV an STD?," Because HPV infection is spread through sexual intercourse, it is classified as a sexually-transmitted disease (STD) or sexually-transmitted infection (STI). HPV is the most common STD and is thought to affect most people at some point in life."
Who gets infected with HPV?,'HPV infection is extremely common. It is estimated that all sexually active men and women acquire an HPV infection at some point in life.' 
Is HPV contagious? How do you get HPV?,"'Yes, HPV is highly ''contagious''. This means that ''common warts'' on the skin or soles of the ''feet'' are contagious, because contact with ''warts'' may spread the HPV infection.'  Genital warts are also contagious. HPV can be spread from person-to-person even when the infected person does not have any signs of symptoms."
How is HPV transmitted or spread?," As mentioned previously, genital HPV infection is spread by sexual contact with an infected person, including vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can be spread when the infected person has no signs or symptoms. It also take many years for health problems associated with HPV to appear, making it very difficult for some people to know exactly when they became infected. In addition to sexual contact, HPV infection can be spread by any skin-to-skin contact. Spread of HPV infection also is likely to be possible from touching surfaces (such as public shower floors) that have been in contact with an HPV-infected person."
What are the signs and symptoms of HPV in men and women?," HPV infection typically does not produce any signs and symptoms in men, although infection with some HPV types can lead to genital warts, which appear as raised lumps or bumps on the genital areas. Genital warts vary in size from large to small and can be flat or raised. The edges can appear serrated or rough (like a cauliflower). Less commonly, certain types of HPV infection are known to cause cancers of the penis or anus in men. Other cancers that can be caused by HPV infection include oropharyngeal cancers, which are cancers of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils. Typical skin warts are other signs of HPV infection, although the types of HPVs that cause skin warts are not the same as those that cause cancers or genital warts. As with men, HPV in women usually does not produce signs or symptoms. However, in some cases, the HPV infection persists and leads to genital warts (as described previously), skin warts, or cancerous or precancerous changes in the cells that line the uterine cervix. The types of HPVs that cause cancers, genital warts, and skin warts are all different. Papanicolau (Pap) testing of the cervix allows for early detection of HPV-related changes in the cervix and has been used for decades as a tool for screening for cervical cancer. HPV types that cause cervical and other cancer are often referred to as ""high-risk"" HPV types."
What about HPV infection and pregnancy?,"'It is possible to acquire HPV infection ''during pregnancy''. If a woman has an active HPV infection while giving birth, there is a small chance the infection will be spread to the baby. But even if the baby does get the infection, usually it goes away without problems.' HPV infection has not been linked to pregnancy complications such as miscarriage or premature delivery. In very rare cases, babies born to women with active HPV infection and genital warts have developed warts in the back of the throat, a condition known as respiratory papillomatosis. Genital warts can typically be treated safely while a woman is pregnant."
Is there a vaccine against HPV infection in men and women?,"'Vaccines'' are available against the most common types of HPV that cause genital cancers and genital warts. The ''vaccines'' are given as a 3-shot series. HPV vaccination is recommended for preteen boys and girls at age 11 or 12 so they are protected before ever being sexually exposed to the virus. The ''vaccine'' does not contain live virus, so it is impossible to get HPV from the vaccine. Examples of the available vaccines in the US and include' Gardasil, and Gardasil 9."
What are the risks and side effects of the HPV vaccine?,"'The HPV vaccines have been shown to be safe. The most common side effects are ''bruising'', ''itching'', redness, tenderness, or swelling around the injection site.''Women have also uncommonly reported experiencing''These side effects are typically short-lived and go away on their own without treatment. There is a very small risk of an ''allergic reaction'', which can happen with any vaccination.' fainting, dizziness, mild fever, nausea, and vomiting."
Who is at risk for contracting HPV infection?,"'Although HPV is very common and anyone can become infected, there are certain risk factors that increase your chances of getting an HPV infection. Since there are many types of HPV, it also is possible to become infected more than once. Factors that increase the risk of getting an HPV infection include:' Having a number of different sex partners or having sex with someone who has had numerous sex partners. The higher the number of partners, the greater the risk. But HPV infection is still possible even in people who have had only one lifetime sex partner. Having a weakened immune system, such as having HIV/AIDS Cuts, abrasions, or breaks in the skin at the site of contact with an infected person or contaminated surface"
Is there a test for HPV infection?," There is an HPV test available to detect the presence of HPV in the cervix. This test typically is done at the time a woman receives a Pap test (Pap smear) or pelvic examination. However, there is no HPV test that can determine which HPV infections will go away and which will cause problems."
Is there a treatment or cure for HPV?,"'There is no specific treatment that can clear HPV infection, although in most cases, the infection goes away on its own. There are treatments available for the cancers and warts caused by HPV:' Genital warts and skin warts can be removed or treated with medications. Drugs that can be applied to genital warts to destroy the wart include podofilox (Condylox) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Imiquimod (Aldara) is a cream that stimulates the immune system to fight the HPV infection. Other treatments include freezing the warts with liquid nitrogen, cauterizing them with heat or a laser, or surgical removal. Skin warts may be removed surgically, with medications, by freezing, or cautery. Abnormal cervical cells can typically be treated to prevent cervical cancer from developing. Cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers are also most treatable when detected and treated early."
Which specialties of doctors treat HPV infection in men and women?," HPV infection in men and women may be treated by primary care specialists, including internists, pediatricians, and family practitioners. Urologists (for men) and gynecologist-obstetricians (or OB/GYNs, for women) also treat HPV infections. Dermatologists may treat HPV infections that result in skin warts."
Are oral and genital HPV infections the same?," The same types of HPV that infect the genital areas can also cause infection of the oral cavity (throat and mouth). Some types of oral HPV cause cancers of the throat and lining of the mouth, while other HPV types can cause warts in the mouth or throat. Like genital HPV infections, in most cases, HPV infections of the oral cavity go away without problems."
How long is someone with HPV contagious?," As mentioned previously, there are treatments for the conditions and cancers that are caused by HPV infection, but there is no known treatment to rid the body of the virus. Most cases of HPV infection resolve on their own without treatment and do not cause cancers or long-term problems."
Does HPV infection cause cancer?," Most cases of HPV infection do not even cause signs or symptoms and resolve on their own without treatment. However, in some cases, infections with certain HPV types can cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, or vulva in women; cancers of the anus or cancers of the oral cavity in women or men; and cancer of the penis in men."
What is the prognosis for a person with HPV infection?," Most people who develop HPV infection never have any signs or symptoms from the infection. As discussed in this article, in rare cases, the HPV infection persists and ultimately leads to certain cancers. In the U.S., the American Cancer Society estimates about 12,900 women will develop cervical cancer, yet it is estimated that all sexually active people will have been infected with HPV at some point. The reason for vaccination against HPV types that are linked to cancer is that it is currently impossible tell which people will have persistent HPV infection or infection that leads to cancer."

There is a very small risk of an ''allergic reaction'', which can happen with any vaccination.' fainting, dizziness, mild fever, nausea, and vomiting."
Who is at risk for contracting HPV infection?,"'Although HPV is very common and anyone can become infected, there are certain risk factors that increase your chances of getting an HPV infection. Since there are many types of HPV, it also is possible to become infected more than once. Factors that increase the risk of getting an HPV infection include:' Having a number of different sex partners or having sex with someone who has had numerous sex partners. The higher the number of partners, the greater the risk. But HPV infection is still possible even in people who have had only one lifetime sex partner. Having a weakened immune system, such as having HIV/AIDS Cuts, abrasions, or breaks in the skin at the site of contact with an infected person or contaminated surface"
Is there a test for HPV infection?," There is an HPV test available to detect the presence of HPV in the cervix. This test typically is done at the time a woman receives a Pap test (Pap smear) or pelvic examination. However, there is no HPV test that can determine which HPV infections will go away and which will cause problems."
Is there a treatment or cure for HPV?,"'There is no specific treatment that can clear HPV infection, although in most cases, the infection goes away on its own. There are treatments available for the cancers and warts caused by HPV:' Genital warts and skin warts can be removed or treated with medications. Drugs that can be applied to genital warts to destroy the wart include podofilox (Condylox) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Imiquimod (Aldara) is a cream that stimulates the immune system to fight the HPV infection. Other treatments include freezing the warts with liquid nitrogen, cauterizing them with heat or a laser, or surgical removal. Skin warts may be removed surgically, with medications, by freezing, or cautery. Abnormal cervical cells can typically be treated to prevent cervical cancer from developing. Cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers are also most treatable when detected and treated early."
Which specialties of doctors treat HPV infection in men and women?," HPV infection in men and women may be treated by primary care specialists, including internists, pediatricians, and family practitioners. Urologists (for men) and gynecologist-obstetricians (or OB/GYNs, for women) also treat HPV infections. Dermatologists may treat HPV infections that result in skin warts."
Are oral and genital HPV infections the same?," The same types of HPV that infect the genital areas can also cause infection of the oral cavity (throat and mouth). Some types of oral HPV cause cancers of the throat and lining of the mouth, while other HPV types can cause warts in the mouth or throat. Like genital HPV infections, in most cases, HPV infections of the oral cavity go away without problems."
How long is someone with HPV contagious?," As mentioned previously, there are treatments for the conditions and cancers that are caused by HPV infection, but there is no known treatment to rid the body of the virus. Most cases of HPV infection resolve on their own without treatment and do not cause cancers or long-term problems."
Does HPV infection cause cancer?," Most cases of HPV infection do not even cause signs or symptoms and resolve on their own without treatment. However, in some cases, infections with certain HPV types can cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, or vulva in women; cancers of the anus or cancers of the oral cavity in women or men; and cancer of the penis in men."
What is the prognosis for a person with HPV infection?," Most people who develop HPV infection never have any signs or symptoms from the infection. As discussed in this article, in rare cases, the HPV infection persists and ultimately leads to certain cancers. In the U.S., the American Cancer Society estimates about 12,900 women will develop cervical cancer, yet it is estimated that all sexually active people will have been infected with HPV at some point. The reason for vaccination against HPV types that are linked to cancer is that it is currently impossible tell which people will have persistent HPV infection or infection that leads to cancer."
What is listeriosis? What causes listeriosis?,"'Listeriosis is an infection caused by a rod-shaped gram stain-positive motile bacterium named ''Listeria monocytogenes''. The foodborne illness produces ''fever'', muscle aches, and, in many people, ''diarrhea''. Severe infections can cause ''headaches'', ''meningitis'', convulsions, and death. Most healthy people exposed to the bacteria have minor or no symptoms, but a few people, especially the elderly, pregnant females and their fetus, newborns, and anyone with a compromised immune system are especially susceptible to these organisms. ''Listeria'' bacteria are widespread throughout the world and are often associated with farm animals that may show no signs of infection. Research shows that many animals are uninfected carriers, and they suggest that some humans carry these organisms as part of their bowel flora. Except for pregnant women, fetuses, or newborns, there is no direct transfer of ''Listeria'' from human to human.''The organisms (''Listeria monocytogenes'') that cause listeriosis have probably been infecting humans for centuries. ''Listeria'' was first isolated from an infected WWI soldier in 1918 and had many different names until 1940, when the genus and species names were firmly established. However, people first recognized the bacteria as a food-borne (''food poisoning'') pathogen in 1979. The bacteria can penetrate human cells and can multiply inside them. People with altered or impaired immune systems have cells that are less able to control the spread of these organisms into the blood or into other cells. In 2010, health researchers discovered that a known species, ''Listeria ivanovii'', thought only to infect cattle, also infects humans -- so there are two ''Listeria'' species that can infect humans.''Outbreaks of listeriosis can occur with some frequency. For example, in 2017, soft raw milk cheese was a source of an outbreak (Vulto Creamery). In this outbreak, eight people were infected and two died. Other recalls of products in 2017 include 3 tons of cheese for possible ''Listeria'"" contamination (La Nica Products INC.), macadamia nuts (Simple Truth brand), Ava's Organic Cashews, and Queso Fresco cheese, for the same problem. In 2018, at least nine people have died from ""'Listeria''-contaminated frozen sweet corn. British authorities have recalled 43 products with possible ''Listeria'' contamination to halt this significant outbreak.'

What are the risk factors for listeriosis?,"'The major risk factor for getting listeriosis is eating or drinking foods and liquids contaminated with ''Listeria'' bacteria. Foods and liquids contaminated with animal feces or soil are the most frequently identified sources for these organisms. Drinking inadequately treated or unpasteurized liquids, especially milk products, is another source of infection.''Some individuals have an increased risk for getting listeriosis. In general, people with an altered or damaged immune system have a higher risk of getting listeriosis and its more severe complications. Specifically, people at much higher risk include pregnant females, newborns, the elderly, diabetics, ''cancer'' patients, ''AIDS'' patients, patients with kidney diseases, ''alcoholics'', and those patients undergoing any immune-suppression therapy. Most individuals who get severe infections and/or die from listeriosis have one or more of the medical problems listed above.' "
Is Listeria contagious?,'The bacteria are not contagious from person to person in most instances. The one exception is that a pregnant woman can transfer the bacteria to the fetus or the newborn.' 
"How 
does listeriosis spread?","'Listeriosis is mainly a food-borne disease; except in the situation in which a pregnant woman can transfer the bacteria to the fetus or newborn, the disease is not contagious from person to person.''Foods that have been associated with ''Listeria'' outbreaks are many (for example, soft cheeses, yogurt, apples, smoked seafood, deli meats, hot dogs, fruits, and vegetables). There have been many outbreaks of the disease over the world. The year 2015 had at least three outbreaks of listeriosis. Bidart Brothers of Bakersfield, Calif., produced apples contaminated with the bacteria. People first noticed the organisms in caramel-coated apples. Hummus produced by the Sabra Dipping Company was recalled (30,000 cases of hummus) due to ''Listeria'' contamination. Also in 2015, the very popular brand of ice cream, Blue Bell, caused a serious outbreak of listeriosis. The company shut down its facilities in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas to rid them of ''Listeria''. During the outbreak, health care professionals hospitalized 10 individuals and three people died. In 2016, CRF Frozen Foods of Pasco, Washington, recalled 11 frozen vegetable products because of ''Listeria'' contamination. Health care providers admitted nine people to the hospital and three died during this outbreak to date. Unfortunately, this outbreak is complicated by the fact that some of the vegetable products in the recall date back as far as 2014. Individuals who have stored frozen CRF products that date back as far as 2014 need to get rid of the potentially contaminated frozen products, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).' "
What are listeriosis symptoms and signs?,"'However, in some people, the organisms can spread to the brain.' 

Read Doctor's View
   Fever, muscle aches, and occasionally, gastroenteritis (nausea and/or diarrhea) are the usual symptoms associated with listeriosis. Some individuals may also experience fatigue and a decrease or loss of appetite. These flu-like symptoms usually last up to one week and may spontaneously resolve. The symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis (stiff neck, headache, and fever) may appear, including altered mental status (confusion and reduced mental activity), Loss of balance problems and seizures (convulsions) may develop in brain infections. Brain abscesses may also occur and cause similar symptoms."
What is the incubation period for Listeria?,"'Pregnant women who are otherwise healthy usually have only minor symptoms. However, ''Listeria'' infection during pregnancy often cause problems for the fetus:''Breastfeeding'' in humans does not transmit the bacteria to newborns; however, animal studies show the organisms are transferred in ''breast milk'' of other mammalian species. Researchers consider it theoretically possible for organism transmission in human breast milk.''Occasionally, localized skin infections may occur, especially in people who handle animals infected with ''Listeria''. These skin infections rarely lead to further complications such as brain infection.' miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, or cause infection and, potentially, death of newborns."
How long does a Listeria infection last?,"'Normal healthy people infected with ''Listeria'' usually recover from the infection. However, more serious infections that require antibiotic treatment may last longer. For example, if abscesses develop in the brain, the antibiotic therapy will be required for about six weeks.' "
What types of doctors treat listeriosis?,"'Although primary care physicians can treat listeriosis, other specialists may be involved, especially if the illness is serious. Other specialists such as infectious disease, critical care, and ob-gyn physicians, especially if a woman is pregnant, are likely to be consulted. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians who are treating the cause of the immunosuppression should also be consulted.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose listeriosis?,"""Physicians base their preliminary diagnosis on the patient's clinical history and physical exam, especially after the patient gives a history of likely exposure to a contaminated food source during a ""'Listeria'' outbreak. Without this information, the diagnosis is difficult to sort out from many other diseases; this situation may result in a delay of treatment as the physician may do other tests to rule out other diseases such as salmonellosis, ''shigellosis'', ''botulism'' and ''E. coli'' infections. Definitive diagnosis of listeriosis is by culturing ''Listeria monocytogenes'"" bacteria from the patient's blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or ""'amniotic fluid'', usually on a medium that is selective for ''Listeria'"" (for example, RAPID'L mono agar). Currently, no reliable tests are available to detect the bacteria in the ""'stool''; also, there are no reliable serological tests available (blood tests that can identify specific proteins associated with the bacteria or antibodies to the bacteria) according to the CDC.' "
What is the treatment for listeriosis?,"'The majority of people with ''Listeria'' infections spontaneously clear the infection in about seven days. However, those patients at increased risk, especially pregnant women, usually require immediate IV antibiotic treatment to prevent, halt, or slow the development of more severe disease. For example, early effective antibiotic treatment of pregnant females may be lifesaving for the fetus.''In general, the length of antibiotic treatment increases with the severity of the infection. The treatment for meningitis lasts three weeks while brain ''abscess'' treatment lasts six weeks. The initial choice of antibiotics is usually IV ''ampicillin''. Doctors have used ''Bactrim'' (''trimethoprim''-''sulfamethoxazole''seizures'

  "
Are there home remedies for listeriosis?,"'There are no ''over-the-counter'' diagnostic tests for listeriosis, so it will be difficult or impossible to know if you have a ''Listeria'' infection; that makes it difficult to decide if you can treat the problem at home. Because listeriosis can be fatal in about 20%-30% of those who develop the disease, home remedies may be a dangerous option without consulting a physician. However, there are suggestions to try, like activated charcoal, syrup of ipecac, ''garlic'', and/or alcohol-free ''goldenseal'' to treat ''food poisoning'' in general. However, before trying any of these options, you should discuss them first with your doctor.' "
How does a person get listeriosis?,"'The majority of people who get listeriosis have consumed ''Listeria''-contaminated foods. Because the bacteria exist in both soil and water, cultivated foods like vegetables can easily become contaminated, especially from fertilizer or animal waste. ''Listeria'' has been found in many types of raw food (even seafood) but especially in meats, vegetables, and cheeses. It has even been found in processed foods because of contamination during or after processing. After someone ingests the contaminated food or fluid, it may take up to three weeks for the organisms to cause symptoms.''The fetus may become infected after the mother ingests the organisms; the bacteria apparently reach the fetus via the bloodstream. Newborn infants can acquire the bacteria during a cesarean procedure or be exposed to them while traversing the vagina.' "
What are the complications of listeriosis?,"'The major complications of listeriosis include' blood infection (septicemia/bacteremia), meningitis and/or encephalitis, brain abscesses, seizures, miscarriage, premature birth, neonatal sepsis (potentially fatal), stillbirth, and death."
Is it possible to prevent listeriosis?,"""Yes, it's possible to prevent listeriosis. The CDC recommends the following ""'food safety'' measures:''General recommendations:''Here are food safety recommendations for people at high risk, such as pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, in addition to the recommendations listed above:''There is no commercially available ''vaccine'' to protect against infection by ''Listeria''.' Thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources, such as beef, pork, or poultry. Wash raw vegetables thoroughly (scrub with a clean produce brush in uncontaminated running water) before eating. Keep uncooked meats separate from vegetables and from cooked foods and ready-to-eat foods. Avoid unpasteurized (raw) milk or foods made from unpasteurized milk. Wash hands, knives, and cutting boards after handling uncooked foods. Consume perishable and ready-to-eat foods as soon as possible. Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, or deli meats, unless heated until steaming hot. Avoid getting fluid from hot-dog packages on other foods, utensils, and food preparation surfaces, and wash hands after handling hot dogs, luncheon meats, and deli meats. Do not eat refrigerated pâtés or meat spreads. It's OK to eat canned or shelf-stable pâtés and meat spreads. Do not eat refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is contained in a cooked dish, such as a casserole. Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod, tuna or mackerel, is most often labeled as ""nova-style,"" ""lox,"" ""kippered,"" ""smoked,"" or ""jerky."" The fish is found in the refrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and delicatessens. Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood may be eaten. Avoid cross-contaminating other foods, utensils, and food-preparation surfaces with fluid from hot-dog packages, and wash hands after handling hot dogs. Do not eat soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, and Camembert, blue-veined cheeses, or Mexican-style cheeses such as queso blanco, queso fresco, and Panela, unless they have labels that clearly state they are made from pasteurized milk. Cheeses that are OK to eat include hard cheeses, semi-soft cheeses such as mozzarella, pasteurized processed cheeses such as slices and spreads, cream cheese, and cottage cheese. Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain unpasteurized milk."
What is the prognosis for Listeria infections?,"'Since most infections go unnoticed or only produce minor symptoms, the prognosis is excellent. However, the prognosis for people with altered or impaired immune systems range from good (with early appropriate therapy) to poor, depending on how debilitated the patient is when first infected.''The pregnant woman usually has a good prognosis. However, her fetus or newborn has a good to guarded prognosis, again depending how quickly the mother or newborn is effectively treated.' "
"If a person has eaten recalled food potentially contaminated with 
Listeria, what should he or she do?","""The CDC recommends the following to all people. If the person has no symptoms, they recommend no tests or treatment be done. However, if the person is in a high-risk group (see risk factor section above), they recommend contacting the person's physician only if the person develops fever or signs of serious illness within two months of eating the food. The CDC makes these conservative suggestions because the chance of developing ""'Listeria'' infection, even after ingestion of a contaminated product, is very small.''However, people in the high-risk groups should have no delays in contacting their doctor if they suspect symptoms of listeriosis are developing.'  "
What is the government doing about listeriosis?,"'The following is information modified from the CDC web site in response to the above question.''Government agencies and the food industry have taken steps to reduce contamination of food by the ''Listeria'' bacterium. The Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture monitor food regularly. When health officials discover contaminated processed food, food monitoring and plant inspection are intensified, and if necessary, the implicated food is recalled.''The Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID) is studying listeriosis in several states to help measure the impact of prevention activities and recognize trends in disease occurrence. CCID also assists local health departments in investigating outbreaks. Early detection and reporting of outbreaks of listeriosis to local and state health departments can help identify sources of infection and prevent more cases of the disease.''In addition, the FDA publishes its list of product recalls on the Internet with frequent updates. The following web site will allow individuals to check on specific products and describe how to identify them: ''http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/''.' "
What is an enterovirus?,"'Human enteroviruses are a genus in the family ''Picornaviridae'' (small positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses) that were originally classified or named as polioviruses, Coxsackie A viruses, Coxsackie B viruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Rhinoviruses are included as enteroviruses by many researchers but not all. There are well over 100 types of known enteroviruses (genus ''Enterovirus''). The virus that causes ''hand, foot, and mouth disease'' belongs to the group of so-called ''non-polio enteroviruses''.''These enteroviruses usually spread from person to person by direct contact with the viruses that shed from the gastrointestinal tract or upper respiratory tract. In general, health care providers categorize these viruses as either polio or non-polioviruses. Polioviruses (only three types, P1-3) and non-polioviruses may have similar initial symptoms. In the majority of infections caused by both polio and non-polioviruses, an infected person may be asymptomatic (not show any symptoms) or only have mild symptoms, including ''fever'', ''headache'', ''sore throat'', ''loss of appetite'', and abdominal discomfort that resolves with no sequelae (complications). However, in some patients, especially children, these infections may cause serious disease that may produce lifelong problems and, infrequently, may cause death.''Recently, non-enterovirus species names were revised to remove host names (human, bovine, simian, and porcine) and replaced with the group designation (A through J) and serotype number. The group is based on the similarity within the RNA region that codes for the outer protein of the virus, and serotype number corresponds to a specific neutralizing serum (antibody). Consequently, human enterovirus 68, for example (also called HEV-68 and ED68) is now termed EV-D68. There will be ''confusion'' and overlap of enterovirus names for the next few years as researchers and clinicians adjust to this extensive name change. In this article, both new and currently accepted names of these viruses and the disease(s) they may cause will be used. For example, Coxsackie viruses could be labeled CV-A4 or CV-B5, depending on their group and/or serotype; similarly, echovirus=E-14 or rhinovirus=RV-A25, RV-B79, or RV-C41.' "
What types of illnesses do enteroviruses cause?,"'As stated previously, enteroviruses cause two main types of human disease, polio, and non-polio disease. In this article, the focus will be on the non-polio disease-causing enteroviruses. Non-polio enteroviruses may cause a wide range of infections that overlap; for example...' enterovirus: aseptic meningitis with rash, conjunctivitis, hand, foot, and mouth disease (EV-71), paralysis (EV-71), myopericarditis group A Coxsackie virus: flaccid paralysis, hand, foot, and mouth disease, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, herpangina, aseptic meningitis (with or without rash) group B Coxsackie virus: spastic paralysis, herpangina, pleurodynia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and meningoencephalitis echovirus: common cold, rash, aseptic meningitis, myopericarditis, paralysis, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis rhinovirus: the common cold (over 100 different serotypes), mild respiratory illness"
What are causes and risk factors for an enterovirus infection?,"'The causes for enterovirus infections are simply the passage of one of the many enteroviruses from one person directly to another, usually by contact with respiratory secretions and/or ''stool'' from infected individuals. Occasionally, enteroviruses may contaminate environmental sources such as water. The most common risk factor for getting an enterovirus infection is direct contact with any bodily secretions (especially respiratory and/or fecal) from an infected individual. Individuals with immature (neonates and infants) or compromised immune systems (for example, children with ''type 1 diabetes'') also are at higher risk for enterovirus infections than normal children or adults. ''Pregnant'' females and individuals with respiratory problems like ''asthma'' are at higher risk. Individuals are at highest risk during the fall and summer months.' "
Are enteroviruses contagious?,"'Yes, enteroviruses are contagious often by direct contact from person to person with respiratory secretions or by contact with fecal material. Some enteroviruses spread indirectly when uninfected people come in contact with food or fluids contaminated by secretions (feces, oral secretions, or droplets) from infected individuals. The viruses are capable of surviving on surfaces like tables and door handles for several days.' "
What is the incubation period for an enterovirus infection?,"'The average incubation period (time from exposure to first symptoms) ranges from about three to 10 days. Symptoms, when present in uncomplicated infections, last about a week.' "
What is the contagious period for an enterovirus infection?,"'In general, individuals are contagious about three days after exposure to the virus and remain contagious until about 10 days after they develop symptoms. Individuals can shed infectious viruses even if they have no symptoms or during the incubation period and/or after symptoms stop.' "
What are symptoms and signs of an enterovirus infection in children and adults?,"'Stated previously, many individuals who become infected with enteroviruses have no or only mild symptoms (fever, ''headache'', ''sore throat'', loss of appetite, and abdominal discomfort, often without ''diarrhea'') of infection that may last about a week and resolve with no further problems. However, those people at higher risk may develop one or more of the following symptoms:''As noted above, some strains of enteroviruses produce different symptoms, some of which are much more severe than others. In addition, some strains occasionally appear to be more transmissible and cause more intense or severe symptoms. Two recent examples are enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and EV-D68.'   Common cold: nasal discharge, cough, mild fever, mild malaise Hypoxia (low oxygen in the blood): shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, rapid breathing, skin coloration change (bluish to cherry red), rapid heart rate Aseptic meningitis: most common among infants and children; may also occur with a rash (on face, neck, and extremities), fever, painful headache, stiff neck, body aches, sensitivity to light, nausea and vomiting, irritability Conjunctivitis (hemorrhagic): eye pain, bleeding seen in the whites of the eyes, photophobia (avoidance of light due to discomfort) Myopericarditis: shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, weakness Herpangina: small flat sores on the oral mucosa (tonsils and soft palate) that may produce blisters and ulcerate Pleurodynia: intermittent chest pain usually over the lower part of the rib cage; some individuals may have a plural friction rub that can be heard when the doctor examines the chest with a stethoscope Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD): small nodules and blisters that are tender and appear gray that occur on the hands, feet, and in the oral cavity Encephalitis: Symptoms range from lethargy and drowsiness to personality changes, seizures, and coma. Paralysis (infrequent in both polio and non-polio intro viral infections): flaccid paralysis that is often asymmetric with proximal extremity muscles affected; lower extremities affected more commonly than upper extremities (poliovirus, enterovirus 71, and coxsackievirus A7); other non-polio enteroviruses usually have less severe symptoms (for example, muscle weakness and oculomotor palsy) if paralysis develops"
"How 
do physicians diagnose an enterovirus infection?","'In general, physicians diagnose enterovirus infections by clinical symptoms. Health care professionals infrequently perform blood tests. The best test is ''polymerase chain reaction'' (PCR) that is available from specialized laboratories and used most often during outbreaks of viral infections. In addition, it is useful to distinguish between enterovirus infections and other viral infections like ''rotavirus'' and ''influenza'' viruses. Infrequently, health care professionals isolate the infecting enterovirus by cell cultures taken from the blood, feces, or cerebrospinal fluid and then identified by further immunologic tests. Other tests such as chest ''X-rays'', ''echocardiography'', ''lumbar puncture'', and ECGs may help determine the extent of infection.' "
What is the treatment for an enterovirus infection?,"'Briefly, the best treatment for an enterovirus infection is prevention. For poliovirus, an effective vaccine is available. Unfortunately, for non-polio enteroviruses, the treatment is supportive and designed to reduce the symptoms because there are no antiviral medications currently approved for the treatment of these types of enterovirus infections. Many doctors recommend using ''over-the-counter'' medications to reduce symptoms.''Doctors may use immunoglobulins in infected neonates and immunocompromised hosts to both treat and prevent non-polio enterovirus central nervous system infections, but these immunoglobulin treatments are not always very effective. Consequently, supportive measures such as fever control, assisted-breathing methods (ranging from inhaled steroids to ''intubation''), ''pain''-control medications, and topical skin and oral mucosal medications to reduce symptoms are given.''Since March 2018, Pleconaril, a 3C ''protease inhibitor'' drug, has been awaiting FDA approval as an intranasal spray to treat rhinoviral infections. In the past, doctors have used the drug for compassionate treatment only in life-threatening enteroviral infections.'  "
What types of doctors treat enterovirus infections?,"'Many individuals are treated with supportive measures only; primary physicians (usually a pediatrician but possibly a specialist in family practice or internal medicine) treat some. In other instances, especially with individuals with complications, infectious-disease specialists, critical care specialists, cardiologists, and/or lung specialists may treat patients. Rarely, a neurology specialist may be consulted.' "
"Non-polio enterovirus outbreaks, including enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) and 71","'The recent outbreaks of various non-polio enteroviruses are listed below; (the data is modified from reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).'  Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in the United States. However, in 2011 and 2012, coxsackievirus A6 was a common cause of HFMD in this country; some of the infected people became severely ill. Coxsackievirus A24 and enterovirus 70 have been associated with outbreaks of conjunctivitis. Echoviruses 13, 18, and 30 have caused outbreaks of viral meningitis in the United States. Enterovirus 71 has caused large outbreaks of HFMD worldwide, especially in children in Asia, especially China. Some infections from this virus have been associated with severe neurologic disease, such as brainstem encephalitis. Enterovirus D 68 had a nationwide outbreak in the U.S. from August 2014 to January 2015. A total of 1,153 people in 49 states and the District of Columbia had confirmed D68 infection. Almost all the individuals infected were children who also had a history of asthma or wheezing. Health officials detected D68 enteroviruses in 14 patients who died. However, the CDC indicated that there were likely millions of enterovirus D68-infected individuals (infants, toddlers, and children) with mild illness who did not seek medical treatment or get tested for the infection in the United States. Thailand, in 2017, reported an outbreak of enterovirus A71 with 163 infected patients."
What are complications of an enterovirus infection?,"'The majority of enterovirus infections last about a week to 10 days and have no complications. However, complications can occur in some patients and range from mild (rash, mild conjunctivitis, skin lesions) to more severe (shortness of breath, encephalitis, myopericarditis, chest pains, weakness with paralysis, coma and rarely, death).' "
What is the prognosis of an enterovirus infection?,"""The prognosis of most enterovirus infections is good; most individuals will spontaneously resolve their infection in about seven to 10 days and have no complications. Some patients, especially those who are immunocompromised in any way, may develop more severe infections. The more severe infections can have a prognosis that can range from good to poor, depending upon the severity of the viral strain causing the infection and the strength (or weakness) of the individual's immune response. Consultation with an appropriate specialist (cardiologist, pulmonologist or others, depending on the particular complications) is recommended."" "
Is it possible to prevent an enterovirus infection? Is there a vaccine for enteroviruses?,"'Individuals can reduce the chance of getting an enterovirus infection simply by avoiding direct contact with people who are infected with enteroviruses and by using such techniques as good hand washing and cleaning or disinfecting items that come in contact with infected individuals. Health care professionals routinely vaccinate people against certain enteroviruses (polioviruses); as a result, polio is rarely seen in developing countries. Unfortunately, no ''vaccines'' are available for non-polio enteroviruses, although Chinese investigators have indicated they have two ''vaccines'' against enterovirus 71 in successful phase 3 trials. Part of the reason there are no vaccines for these viruses is that there is a very large number of subtypes of non-polio enteroviruses and a vaccine developed against one subtype is usually not effective against another subtype.'

What are pinworms?,"'Pinworm infection is an infection of the large intestine and anal area by a small, white parasite that resembles a ""worm."" The medical name for the parasite is ''Enterobius vermicularis'', but it is commonly termed a pinworm in both the lay and medical literature. These parasites are also termed seatworms or threadworms, and the infections is medically termed enterobiasis, oxyuriasis, or helminthiasis. Pinworms and other helminthic parasitic worms (which, as a group, are termed helminths) feed off of the host animal by adsorbing nutrients from the host animal. Pinworm infections are the most common helminth infection that occurs in the US. Pinworms only infect humans. ''Dogs'', cats, or other animals cannot become infected.'  "
Who gets pinworms?,"'Pinworm is the most common parasitic worm infection in the United States, and the majority of pinworm infections worldwide occur in children, in temperate climates.''The highest rates of pinworm infection occur in school-age children. They are followed by preschoolers. Institutional settings including day care facilities often harbor multiple individuals (adults and children) with pinworm infections. Sometimes, nearly half of the children may be infected in a day care facility.''Pinworm infection often occurs in more than one family member. Adults are less likely to have pinworm infection, except for mothers of infected children. However, adult sexual partners can transfer the eggs to each other. Pinworms also may infect the vagina and urethra.' "
What are the symptoms of pinworms in children and adults?,"'If symptoms are present, they are similar in both children and adults. The signs and symptoms may include one or more of the following:''Less common symptoms include:''Many infected children and adults have few or no symptoms but, if the infection is heavy, the symptoms can be correspondingly more severe.'   Intense (pruritus) around the anus and/or vagina Discomfort in the anal and/or vaginal area Rash or skin irritation around the anus or vagina Insomnia or difficulty sleeping and/or restlessness due to irritation of skin Pinworms often can be seen on the anal skin or in the stools, sometimes detected in the vagina and may produce some vaginal discharge Abdominal pain Secondary bacterial infections from intense skin scratching Infrequent infection of the ureters and/or bladder may cause dysuria or bladder discomfort"
What do pinworms and their eggs look like (pinworm pictures)?,"'The pinworms are white, can be seen with the naked eye (no magnification) and are about the length of a staple (about 8-13 mm for female and 2-5mm for male worms). The eggs that are laid by the female worms are not visible as they are about 55 micrometers in diameter and are translucent (see Figure 1).''The male and female worms live for the most part within the rectum of humans but have a life cycle in humans that involves rectal/oral transmission (see Figure 2).''While an infected person is asleep, female pinworms leave the intestines through the anus and deposit eggs on the skin around the anus. This causes ''itching'' and irritation of the surrounding area; children especially will scratch the rectal/anal area, get eggs on their fingers or underneath their fingernails and transport the infective eggs to bedding, toys, other humans, or back to themselves. The eggs hatch into larval forms in the small intestines and then progress to the large intestine where they mature, mate, and progress to the rectal/anal area where females deposit about 10,000-15,000 eggs.' "
How do you get pinworms?,"'Pinworm infection is spread person to person. The symptoms of pinworm infection are caused by the female pinworm moving and laying her eggs, and this usually occurs at night. Within a few hours of being deposited on the skin around the anus, pinworm eggs become infective (capable of infecting another person). They can survive up to two weeks on nightclothes, bed linen, or other objects. Infection is acquired when these eggs are accidentally swallowed, usually due to inadequate hand washing by the parents and children. However, eggs on bedding or other objects that are touched while the eggs are still viable can cause infection or reinfection of people.' "
Can you get pinworms in the vagina?,"'Yes, pinworms can infect the vagina (about 20% of infected girls). Infrequently, the pinworms can go on to infect the Fallopian tubes and other structures.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat pinworms?,"""The majority of pinworm infected patients can be treated by the patient's primary care or pediatric physician. Rarely, an infectious disease specialist, parasitologist, OB/GYN, ""'gastroenterologist'' or dermatologist is consulted.' "
How is the tape test used in diagnosing pinworms?,"'If pinworms are suspected, transparent adhesive tape or a pinworm paddle (supplied by your health care professional) are applied to the anal region. The eggs (and sometimes the parasites themselves) adhere to the sticky tape or paddle and are identified by examination under a microscope. The test is sometimes referred to as ""the Tape Test.""''The test should be done as soon the affected individual wakes up in the morning (because bathing or having a bowel movement may remove most eggs and parasites). The exam may require several samples for diagnosis. Samples taken from under the fingernails may also contain eggs (since scratching of the anal area is common by affected individuals).''At night, the adult worms can sometimes be seen directly in bedclothes or around the anal area: this is another good time to detect the parasites with the transparent adhesive tape method.' "
Are there natural or home remedies that treat pinworms?,'There are many natural and/or home remedies for pinworms although there is a lack of data to support claims. Some of the many suggested remedies include the following:''The above are just a few of the remedies. Check with your doctors before using these remedies.'   Garlic Coconut (grated) Grapefruit seed extract and paste Grated carrots daily Onion juice three times per day for two days Pumpkin seeds Wormwood extract
What are treatment options and medications for pinworms?,"'Most pinworm infections are treated at home with the above medications. However, reinfection is fairly common. To both reduce the chances for reinfection and to help prevent others from getting pinworms, see the ''prevention'' section.''Pinworm infections can be cured; usually by three doses of medication, each three weeks apart. Individuals are encouraged to follow-up with their doctor to be sure treatment has been effective.'   Usually, a single tablet of mebendazole (Vermox) is used as pinworm medicine. This can sometimes be repeated a week later or, if infection persists, the medication is given again three weeks later. Some clinicians recommend a treatment protocol of a drug dose every three weeks, three times, so that the person has effective drug treatment for about nine weeks total. Vermox has been discontinued in the U.S., but stocks are still available in some pharmacies. Another effective medication is albendazole (Albenza) but it may require other medications to reduce the inflammation of the central nervous system, a side effect of the drug. Albendazole is well tolerated with minimal side effects due to minimal systemic absorption. Pyrantel pamoate (Pin-Rid, Pin-X) is available over the counter for pinworm after confirmation of the diagnosis by a licensed health care practitioner. Drugs available over the counter vary from country to country. Pyrantel is the treatment of choice for pregnant women. To treat pinworms affecting urinary and genital organs, combination therapy with oral mebendazole (Vermox) and ivermectin (Stromectol) for the worms as well as topical therapy for the eggs may be required."
What happens if pinworms aren't treated?,"'Untreated pinworms may cause or have a role in causing:''Complications may include ''endometriosis'', salpingitis, ''urethritis'', ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''), vulvovaginitis, and possibly ''appendicitis''.' Diarrhea Significant malabsorption of food Weight loss Genital itching Bedwetting (enuresis) Main during urination (dysuria) Vaginal discharge which can be associated with genital skin irritation and rash"
Is it possible to prevent pinworms?,"'Good hygiene will help reduce the spread of the parasites.' Hand washing after handling bedding, diapers, underwear, and other items like child toilet seats, toys, changing tables, and other surfaces that may contain the infective pinworm eggs will also help prevent spread of the parasite. Cleaning under the fingernails and not biting the fingernails will also help reduce the chance of contacting the parasites. Change and wash clothes in hot water daily, especially underwear, to help prevent spreading the disease. Treating everyone infected in a household at the same time may help prevent recurrence and spread to others. Because the eggs remain infective for up to three weeks in a moist environment, prevention of spread and reinfection is difficult but possible."
Facts you should know about a sinus infection (sinusitis)," The majority of sinus infections are not considered contagious Symptoms of sinus infections may include:A yellowish-greenish nasal discharge that may have an odorbad breathPuffiness around the eyesHeadachesPressure in the sinusesCoughingFatigueEarachesSore throat A yellowish-greenish nasal discharge that may have an odor bad breath Puffiness around the eyes Headaches Pressure in the sinuses Coughing Fatigue Earaches Sore throat Acute sinusitis lasts about 3 weeks. Chronic sinusitis lasts about 8 weeks or longer. Usually, sinus infections are caused by viruses or bacterium that inhabit a person’s body. Acute sinusitis goes away after about 3 weeks. Chronic sinusitis usually lasts 8 weeks or more and can be recurrent. Usually, acute sinusitis is self-limiting. Chronic sinusitis may require more complex treatments. Treatments to help relieve signs and symptoms and cure of a sinus infection include:DecongestantsSaline water nasal spraysHumidified air and less frequentlyAntibiotics for bacterial sinus infectionsSurgery (for example, nasal polyp removal)Natural home remedies Decongestants Saline water nasal sprays Humidified air and less frequently Antibiotics for bacterial sinus infections Surgery (for example, nasal polyp removal) Natural home remedies Contact your doctor if you have signs and symptoms of: Severe headaches A swollen face and/or eyes Short of breath Stiff neck Confusion"
Is a sinus infection contagious?,"'Experts disagree about the contagiousness of ''sinus infections'' (also termed sinusitis and rhinosinusitis). Because bacteria and ''viruses'' (and occasionally, fungi) are the cause of most ''sinus infections'"", some experts say that the bacteria, viruses, or fungi can be transferred from person-to–person, and occasionally cause sinus infections. Other experts say that sinus infections, although caused by bacteria and viruses, occur because the conditions in the individual's sinuses are optimal for infection. Moreover, infection can be caused bacteria, viruses, or fungi that are already present in a person so that person-to-person transfer is not required for them to develop. ""'However, the majority of doctors think that most people do not transmit sinus infections except in rare instances, and conclude that sinus infections are not ''contagious''. '""Still, there is widespread agreement that bacteria, fungi and/or viruses are transmitted from person-to-person (contagious) even if the disease, sinusitis, is not. It's recommended that individuals with sinus infections avoid direct contact (for example, through kissing) with those who are more prone to infection, for example: infants, the elderly, and those who have weakened immune systems to reduce the chance of transferring bacteria, fungi, and viruses to other people as they may cause problems other than sinus infections. Viral or bacterial organisms that reside in the person's body are major causes of sinusitis.""'Since the majority of doctors consider sinus infections to be non-contagious, the only spread of sinusitis would consist of the bacteria to the various sinuses within each person.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of a sinus infection?,"'Sinus infections usually begin with the symptoms of a ''cold'' (for example, a ''runny nose'', occasional ''cough'' and/or mild ''fever''), and then develop into ''pain'' and pressure in the sinus ''cavities''. About 7 to 10 days after initial ''cold-like symptoms'' other symptoms develop that suggest you may have a ''sinus infection''. ''Sinus infection symptoms'' include:''Many people with a sinus infection or sinusitis may develop signs and symptoms that include:'""Definitive diagnosis of a sinus infection is based on the patient's history, physical exam, and evidence of sinus inflammation that may be seen with ""'X-rays'' or ''CT scan'' of the sinuses.'  A yellowish-greenish nasal discharge that may have an odor Bad breath Puffiness around the eyes Sinus headaches Pressure in the sinuses Coughing Fatigue Earaches Sore throat"
What natural or home remedies help relieve sore throat symptoms and signs?,"'Natural home remedies that relieve and soothe ''sore throat'' symptoms include:''Symptoms, especially those caused by viruses, usually are treated with OTC ''drugs'' that reduce inflammation and swelling, for example:'  OTC decongestants Steam vaporizers Warm compresses Pain relievers, for example, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for example, ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) Decongestant nasal sprays Saline sprays Salt-water sprays Neti-Pots with distilled water"
How long do the signs and symptoms of sinusitis and sinus infections last?," Acute sinusitis or sinus infections symptoms and signs last about three weeks if the signs and symptoms go away. Chronic sinusitis or sinus infections usually last about eight weeks or longer. Recurrent sinusitis is acute sinusitis that occurs several times over one year, which may develop into chronic sinusitis."
How long does it take for a sinus infection to go away? Can they be cured?,"'A person may be ""cured"" of a sinus infection when the symptoms stop, usually after about 3 weeks. However, a ""cure"" often is temporary in some people that either have chronic or recurrent sinus infections. Bacterial sinus infections may benefit from antibiotics (sometimes long-term antibiotic treatment is required before the patient is ""cured"" of a bacterial sinusitis), but there is no antibiotic treatment for viral sinusitis.' "
What medications help relieve and soothe pain and other symptoms? When is surgery necessary?,"'''Pain'' relievers to manage ''pain'' and other symptoms of sinus infections or sinusitis include''Some people have sinus infections because of other conditions or diseases. For example, people with ''asthma'' have ''airway'' narrowing and are at a higher risk of developing sinusitis.''Prescription medications to reduce ''asthma symptoms'' may reduce the tendency to develop sinusitis.''Surgery for sinusitis and sinus infections''Some people may need to have surgery or other procedures to open up narrowed or obstructed nasal or sinus passages in people with the following conditions:' acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (for example, ibuprofen [Advil and Motrin] and naproxen [Aleve]). Nasal polyps A deviated septum Chronic sinus infections or sinusitis A deviated septum in the nose to relieve sinusitis"
When should I call my doctor for sinusitis or sinus infections?,"'If you develop persistent ''fever'"" or have a history of recurrent or chronic sinusitis or if you have sinus symptoms that don't improve or get worse, you should contact your doctor.""'However, ''seek medical care immediately if you develop:' Severe headaches Swellings in the forehead and/or eyes Shortness of breath Stiff neck Confusion"
What are the testicles? What do they look like (pictures)?,"'The testicles form part of the male reproductive organs, with a primary function of producing sperm and the male hormone testosterone.' Testicles are contained within an external sac-like structure called the scrotum, which is located between the penis and the anus. Adult testicles are about the size two large olives. It is common for one testicle to hang lower than the other within the scrotum. Located near the back of each testicle lies the epididymis, which is a coiled tubular structure that functions to store and transport sperm. A tubular structure containing blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic vessels and the vas deferens called the spermatic cord courses from the abdomen and is connected to each testicle. Apart from containing vital structures for each testicle, the spermatic cord also suspends the testicles within the scrotum."
What does testicular pain feel like? How severe is the pain?,"'Testicular pain is pain or discomfort that is felt in one or both testicles. The pain may originate from the testicle itself, or it may be the result of other conditions affecting the scrotum, groin, or abdomen. Though there are numerous medical conditions that can cause testicular pain, it is important to understand that a few of them constitute medical emergencies that require immediate medical attention in order to prevent impairment or loss of testicular function. Testicular pain can be an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) condition. The testicular pain may be constant or intermittent.' "
What causes testicular pain? What are other symptoms of pain in the testicles?,"'Many diseases and other health problems can cause pain in one or both testicles. Testicular pain along with other symptoms and signs vary depending on the underlying cause. However, often times the symptoms can be very similar between the various causes, making it difficult to distinguish among the conditions which require urgent medical attention. ''Therefore, if you experience testicular pain, call your doctor immediately or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department. '  "
"Testicular torsion causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicular torsion typically occurs because of an anomaly affecting the normal attachment of the testicle within the scrotum, often referred to as the ""bell clapper"" deformity. This abnormality allows the testicle to be freely suspended and twist spontaneously. Often times, this anomaly is present in both testicles. Trauma to the testicle is a rare cause of testicular torsion.''Testicular torsion is most common in males younger than 30 years of age, with a peak incidence between 12 to 18 years of age. It can also occur more frequently during the ''neonatal'' period. Testicular torsion most often affects the left testicle, and it is the most common cause of testicle loss in adolescent males.''Testicular torsion generally comes on suddenly. Severe testicle pain that is only felt in one testicle may also have these signs and symptoms:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Elevation of the affected testicle within the scrotum Horizontal positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum Loss of the cremasteric reflex on the affected side (normally, the testicle elevates with light stroking of the upper inner thigh area)."
"Epididymitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Epididymitis occurs when there is inflammation of the epididymis (a structure within the scrotum). Generally, the condition is result of an infection. Epididymitis primarily affects adult men, and is most common between the ages of 19 to 40 years; however, it can occur in prepubescent boys and elderly men.''Sexually transmitted diseases or ''STDs'' that are most commonly caused by the bacteria ''Chlamydia trachomatis'' and ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' are the most common cause of epididymitis in sexually active men. In younger and older males, the infection usually is caused by bacteria such as ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') that are found in the urinary tract. Infection in these age groups is typically the result of an abnormality within the genitourinary system.''Epididymitis comes on gradually. The testicular pain can be mild, moderate, or severe, and only in one testicle. Epididymitis also may have symptoms and signs including:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, typically localized to the area of the epididymis, though it can become more generalized and involve the whole testicle as the illness progresses Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Urethral discharge Urinary symptoms, such as burning, urgency, or frequency"
"Inguinal hernia causes, symptoms, and signs","'An ''inguinal hernia'' is a bulge or protrusion of intestine through a defect in the abdominal wall musculature of the groin area. This protrusion can sometimes cause ''swelling of the scrotum'' and subsequent testicular pain.''Inguinal hernias are common and they can sometimes cause discomfort in the scrotum and/or testicles. Signs and symptoms of an inguinal ''hernia'' may include a:' Bulge in the scrotum or in the inguinal area, that may become more pronounced with coughing or straining; and Dull ache or burning sensation in the scrotum and/or testicles."
"Testicular tumor causes, symptoms, and signs","""Generally, testicular tumors don't cause pain; however, occasionally some tumors can cause pain and discomfort of the testicle or scrotum. Signs and symptoms of a tumor in a testicle may include a:"" Lump or mass of the testicle Change in the size or texture of the testicle Dull ache of the lower abdomen, lower back or groin area Feeling of heaviness in the scrotum"
"Orchitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Orchitis is a sign of inflammation of a testicle, usually because of an infection, for example, the mumps, the most common cause of the condition. Usually, mumps orchitis occurs in males who have not reached ''puberty''; however, there has been an increase in cases in boys who have gone through puberty and adolescent males, secondary to the decreased use of the mumps ''vaccine''. Rarely, orchitis can be caused by a bacterial infection that, usually, is the result of progression of epididymitis (epididymo-orchitis).''Because orchitis generally occurs as a consequence of an infection (most often mumps), it is typically also accompanied by other systemic infectious symptoms. Testicular pain may range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms of orchitis may include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or redness Fever and chills Headache Body aches Nausea Fatigue Parotid gland inflammation (parotitis) in cases of mumps"
"Trauma and injury causes, symptoms, and signs","'Trauma or injury of any type to the testicles can cause severe pain and discomfort. Blunt testicular trauma (around 85%) is the most common cause of testicle pain. Examples of causes of injuries to the testicle include sports injuries, a direct kick to the groin or testicle, car accidents, and straddle injuries. Usually, the pain improves with time. Rarely, trauma to the testicles can cause more severe injuries requiring immediate medical attention.''The testicular pain may range from severe to absent at the time the person sees a doctor. Rarely however, the injury may seem minor, but there may be a serious underlying injury to the testicle.''Other symptoms and signs of trauma or injury to a testicle include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or bruising Bruising of the area between the scrotum and the anus (perineum) Nausea and vomiting"
"Testicle rupture causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicle rupture is a serious injury that is a result of a disruption to the connective tissue enveloping the testicle (tunica albuginea), which then causes extrusion of testicular tissue. Often, a sign of testicular rupture is a blood collection (hematocele) that surrounds the testicle.''Other types of injuries that cause testicular rupture include penetrating trauma and testicular dislocation. These types of testicular injuries typically require surgery.' "
"Torsion of a testicular appendage cause, symptoms, and signs","'Torsion of a testicular appendage occurs due to twisting (torsion) of the testicular or epididymal appendage, which are functionless structures that are remnants of tissue from human development. The testicular appendage lies between the testicle and the epididymis, while the epididymal appendage typically projects from the epididymis. As with testicular torsion, twisting of these structures leads to a decrease in blood flow and subsequent testicular pain. This is a common condition in younger boys, with most cases occurring between 7 to 14 years of age. Though this condition is benign and self-limiting, it must be distinguished from the more serious testicular torsion.''With torsion of a testicular appendage, the onset of testicle pain may be sudden or gradual, and the severity of pain may range from mild to severe. Generally, a person has no symptoms or signs like nausea, vomiting, and fever.''The testicle and/or scrotum generally appear normal, without swelling and redness; however, other symptoms and signs may include:''Preservation of the normal vertical positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum, and preservation of the cremasteric reflex is generally maintained.' Testicular tenderness, typically only localized to the top of the right or left testicle. Sometimes, a small blue-dot is visualized near the top of the affected testicle (blue-dot sign)."
Can kidney stones cause testicular pain and other symptoms and signs?,"'Occasionally, the pain associated with kidney stones can radiate into the groin area and cause testicular pain. However, the testicles appear normal with no swelling or redness. Other signs and symptoms of kidney stones may include:' Back (flank) pain and tenderness Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Urinary symptoms, such as blood in the urine, discomfort with urination and urinary frequency"
How are the causes of testicular pain diagnosed?,"""In order to diagnose the underlying condition causing testicular pain, a health care professional will perform a complete history and physical exam. Laboratory testing and imaging studies may also be ordered depending on the health care professional's initial impression and evaluation.""'Laboratory testing may include:''Imaging studies may be ordered by your health care professional to further delineate the underlying cause of the testicular pain. In certain patients with testicular pain whose symptoms are strongly suggestive of testicular torsion, immediate urologic consultation prior to testing should be obtained in order to prevent potential delays in definitive surgical management.''A color Doppler testicular ''ultrasound'' is a noninvasive imaging study that can evaluate the blood flow to the testicles, as well as the presence of testicular tumors, fluid collections, testicular rupture, and hernias. A kidney ultrasound can be helpful in the evaluation of kidney stones.''This is an imaging study requiring the intravenous administration of a radionuclide, useful for the evaluation of testicular torsion, as well as other causes of testicular pain. It is used much less commonly than ultrasound.''CT scan'' or a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) X-ray ''These particular imaging studies are sometimes ordered if there is a suspicion that the testicular pain is being caused by kidney stones or other conditions in the abdomen or pelvis.' Blood work Urinalysis A swab of the urethra (if the patient has penile discharge suggestive of a sexually transmitted disease)"
What is the treatment for testicular pain?,"'The treatment for testicular pain varies depending on the underlying cause. As already noted, some conditions causing testicular pain are medical emergencies requiring immediate surgical intervention.''The treatment of uncomplicated epididymitis can generally be managed as an outpatient, and consists of the following treatment measures:''In general, acute epididymitis that is properly treated resolves without complications. However, in some cases of epididymitis, such as those associated with serious systemic symptoms or in those accompanied by various complications, hospitalization may be necessary. A urologist will be consulted in these more serious cases.''The treatment for torsion of the testicular or epididymal appendage is directed toward relief of symptoms, and consists of the following measures:''Most patients improve with these treatment measures within 1 week, though symptoms may last longer. In cases of testicular pain refractory to conservative management, surgical excision of the affected tissue is considered.''The treatment for kidney stones generally depends on the location of the ''kidney stone'', the size of the ''kidney stone'', and any associated complications, such as infection. An uncomplicated kidney stone can typically be treated with the following measures:''Several different measures exist for treating kidney stones that do not pass spontaneously, such as ''lithotripsy'' (the use of ''shock'' waves to break up the kidney stone) and other more invasive surgical procedures.''Certain patients with intractable pain, intractable vomiting or those with signs of infection require hospitalization. In those with ''urinary tract infection'' and an obstruction in the genitourinary system, antibiotics and emergent urologic intervention are necessary.''The treatment and management of testicular trauma depends on the severity of injury. Minor cases of testicular trauma without suspected serious underlying testicular injury can be managed as an outpatient with the following measures:''With testicular rupture, immediate surgical repair is necessary to preserve testicular function and viability. Other situations requiring surgical management include certain blunt trauma injuries with associated blood collections (hematoceles), penetrating trauma, and certain cases of testicular dislocation.''The treatment of orchitis depends on the infectious organism responsible for causing the testicular inflammation. Both viral and bacterial orchitis can be treated with the following measures:''Bacterial orchitis and epididymo-orchitis require antibiotics. Those cases caused by ''viruses'' do not require antibiotics.'   Definitive management of testicular torsion requires surgery by a urologist. During surgery, the affected testicle is untwisted, and if it is viable, the testicle is secured to the scrotal wall (orchiopexy). The unaffected testicle may also be secured to prevent testicular torsion from occurring, as some males will have the bell clapper abnormality on both sides. Sometimes, the affected testicle can be manually untwisted by a doctor without necessitating emergent surgery, though this is a temporizing measure that ultimately still requires definitive surgical repair. Likewise, some cases of testicular torsion can occur and then resolve spontaneously, and the health care professional must maintain a high index of suspicion in order for this condition to be diagnosed and ultimately surgically repaired. The more rapidly the testicle is untwisted and blood flow is restored, the better the chances for salvaging the affected testicle. If treated within 6 hours of symptom onset, the salvage rate nears 100%, while after 24 hours the salvage rate is between 0% and 10%. Antibiotics (which may vary depending on the patient's age and sexual history), pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Adequate fluid intake Pain medication Anti- nausea medication In some instances medications such as tamsulosin (Flomax), which may facilitate the passage of kidney stones The treatment for a testicular tumor depends on various factors. A testicular mass is considered cancer until proven otherwise. If testicular cancer is diagnosed, patients are referred to an oncologist who will discuss the different treatment options available. Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs The definitive treatment of inguinal hernias requires surgical repair, sometimes electively as an outpatient, while others require intervention on a more emergent basis. Occasionally, inguinal hernias may not be repaired even electively because a patient is too high-risk to undergo surgery. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary in cases of inguinal hernias that are not reducible (unable to be pushed back into the abdomen) and in those cases of strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine). Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs"
What are the complications of causes of testicular pain?,"'The complications associated with the different causes of testicular pain are varied. Some individuals may suffer from chronic testicular pain, even after the acute cause of the testicular pain has been treated. Other potential complications may include:'   Permanent damage to the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Infection Cosmetic deformity Epididymitis complications Epididymo-orchitis Abscess (a collection of pus) formation Impaired fertility Systemic blood infection (sepsis) There are no significant complications for torsion of a testicular appendage. Permanent damage to the testicle Atrophy (decrease in size) of the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Abscess formation Cosmetic deformity Testicular torsion Incarceration (hernia unable to be pushed back in) Strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine protruding through the abdominal wall defect) Atrophy of the testicle Impaired fertility Abscess formation Permanent kidney damage Urosepsis (systemic blood infection arising from infected urine) The complications of a testicular tumor vary depending on the underlying type of tumor and the extent of disease."
How can testicular pain be prevented?,"'There are a few measures that you can take to prevent certain causes of testicular pain. However, many of the causes are not entirely preventable.' For epididymitis or bacterial orchitis caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), condom use can reduce the risk of transmission of STDs. The use of appropriate protective gear during sporting activities can help prevent testicular trauma. Mumps immunization can decrease the incidence of viral orchitis."
What is infectious mononucleosis?,"'Infectious mononucleosis'', ""mono,"" ""kissing disease,"" and glandular ''fever'' are all terms popularly used for the very common infection typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but other ''viruses'' can also cause the disease. This article focuses specifically on the Epstein-Barr virus as a cause of mono since this is the characteristic virus associated with the condition.''The symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus infection include fever, ''fatigue'', malaise, and ''sore throat''. The designation ""''mononucleosis''"" refers to an increase in a particular type of mononuclear white blood cells (lymphocytes) in the bloodstream relative to the other white blood cells as a result of the viral infection. Scientifically, EBV is classified as a member of the herpesvirus family.''The disease was first described in 1889 and was referred to as ""Drüsenfieber,"" or glandular fever. The term infectious mononucleosis was first used in 1920 when an increased number of lymphocytes were found in the blood of a group of college students who had fever and symptoms of the condition.' "
What are the symptoms of mono?,"'The initial ''symptoms of mono'' are''These initial symptoms can last from one to three days before the more intense symptoms of the illness begin. The more common intense symptoms include''It is typically the severe sore throat that prompts people to contact their doctor.'   a general lack of energy or malaise, fatigue, a loss of appetite, and chills. a severe sore throat and fever, which may be persistent."
What are the signs of mono?,"'In addition to a fever from 102 F-104 F, the most common signs of mono are''The ''tonsils'"" have a whitish coating in at least one-third of the cases. The spleen (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest ""'lymph node'') is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the rib cage, which becomes enlarged or swollen in about half of patients with mono. An ''enlarged liver'' and abnormalities in ''liver function'' tests (blood tests) may be detected (see Complications, below). Some of patients have a splotchy red ''rash'' over the body, which has a similar appearance to the ''rash'' of ''measles''. Early in the course of disease (over the first few days of illness), a temporary swelling (''edema'') of both upper eyelids may appear.' a very reddened throat and tonsils (tonsillitis) and swollen lymph nodes in the neck that typically occur on both sides."
What is the cause of mono?,"""The EBV that causes mono is found throughout the world. By the time most people reach adulthood, antibodies against EBV can be detected in their blood. In the U.S., up to 95% of adults 35-40 years of age have antibodies directed against EBV. This means that most people, sometime in their lives, have been infected with EBV. The body's immune system produces antibodies to attack and help destroy invading viruses and bacteria. These specific EBV antibodies can be detected in the blood of people who have been infected with mono.""'When infection occurs in childhood, the virus most often produces no symptoms. It is estimated that only about 10% of children who become infected with EBV develop the illness. Likewise, probably because of immunity from prior infection, adults typically do not develop the illness. Most cases of infectious mononucleosis occur in the 15-24 age group.''While there are other illnesses falling under the broad classification of mononucleosis that can cause similar symptoms (''cytomegalovirus'' [''CMV''] infection is one example) and an increase in blood lymphocytes, the mononucleosis caused by the EBV is by far the most common.'  "
What are the risk factors for mono?,"'The EBV can infect anyone. As previously discussed, the majority of people have become infected with the virus by the time that they reach adulthood, and the majority of these infections produce no symptoms and are not recognized as mono. Mono is most often diagnosed in adolescents and young adults, with a peak incidence at 15-17 years of age. However, it can also be seen in children. Generally, the illness is less severe in young children and may mimic the symptoms of other common ''childhood illnesses'', which may explain why it is less commonly diagnosed or recognized in this younger age group.'  "
How is mono transmitted or spread? What is the incubation period for mono? What is the contagious period for mono?,"'Mono is spread by person-to-person contact. Saliva is the primary method of transmitting mono, which leads to the infection of B lymphocytes in the mouth and throat. Infectious mononucleosis developed its common name of ""kissing disease"" from this prevalent form of transmission among teenagers. It typically takes between four to eight weeks for people become symptomatic after the initial Epstein-Barr virus infection. A person with mono can also pass the disease by ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'', causing small droplets of infected saliva and/or ''mucus'' to be suspended in the air which can be inhaled by others. Sharing food or ''beverages'' from the same container or utensil can also transfer the virus from one person to another since contact with infected saliva may result.'""Most people have been exposed to the virus as children, and as a result of the exposure, they have developed immunity to the virus. It is of note that most people who are exposed to the EBV don't ever develop mononucleosis. The incubation period for mono, meaning the time from the initial viral infection until the appearance of clinical symptoms, is between four and eight weeks. During an infection, the contagious period in which a person is likely able to transmit the virus to others lasts for at least a few weeks and possibly longer, even after symptoms have disappeared (see below).""'Research has shown that, depending on the method used to detect the virus, anywhere from 20%-80% of people who have had mononucleosis and have recovered will continue to secrete the EBV in their saliva for years due to periodic ""reactivations"" of the viral infection. Since healthy people without symptoms also secrete the virus during reactivation episodes throughout their lifetime, isolation of people infected with EBV is not necessary. It is currently believed that these healthy people, who nevertheless secrete EBV particles, are the primary reservoir for transmission of EBV among humans. Therefore, it can be difficult to precisely determine how long the infection may be contagious.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose infectious mono?,"'The diagnosis of mono is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. Mono is confirmed by blood tests that may also include tests to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms, such as tests to rule out ''strep throat''. Early in the course of the mono, blood tests may show an increase in one type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes have an unusual or appearance (known as atypical lymphocytes) when viewed under a microscope, which suggests mono.'""More specific blood tests, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of mono. These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test may reveal inflammation and abnormalities in liver function. Diagnostic tests performed in the laboratory may be of value to rule out other causes of sore throat and fever, including ""'cytomegalovirus'' infection, ''strep throat'', and less common conditions such as ''acute HIV infection'' or ''toxoplasmosis''.' "
What health care specialists treat infectious mono?,"'Infectious mono'"" is often managed by primary care specialists, including pediatricians and family-medicine specialists. Internal medicine specialists also treat patients with mono. With complications or severe situations, other medical specialists including infectious-disease specialists, hematologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, or neurologists, may be consulted. With certain clinical complications such as rupture of the spleen, a surgeon will be involved in the patient's care."" "
What is the usual course and treatment of mono?,"'In most cases of mono, no specific medical treatment is necessary. The illness is usually self-limited and passes much the way other common viral illnesses resolve. Treatment is directed toward the relief of clinical symptoms and signs. Available antiviral ''drugs'' have no significant effect on the overall outcome of mono and may actually prolong the course of the illness. Occasionally, ''strep throat'' occurs in conjunction with mono and is best treated with ''penicillin'' or ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', ''PCE'', Pediazole, Ilosone). ''Ampicillin'' (Omnipen, Polycillin, Principen) and ''amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'', DisperMox, ''Trimox'') should be avoided if there is a possibility of mono since up to 90% of patients with mono develop a rash when taking these medications. If this happens, the individuals may then be inappropriately thought to have an ''allergy'' to penicillin.''For the most part, supportive or comfort measures are all that is necessary. Antiviral medications have not been shown to be of benefit. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') can be given for fever and any ''headache'' or body aches. A sufficient amount of ''sleep'' and rest is important. The throat soreness is worst during the first five to seven days of illness and then subsides over the next seven to 10 days. The swollen, tender ''lymph nodes'' generally subside by the third week.''A feeling of fatigue or ''tiredness'' may persist for months following the acute infection phase of the illness. It is recommended that patients with mono avoid participation in any contact sports for three to four weeks after the onset of symptoms to prevent ''trauma'' to the ''enlarged spleen''. The enlarged spleen is susceptible to rupture, which can be life-threatening. Cortisone medication is occasionally given for the treatment of severely ''swollen tonsils'' or throat tissues that threaten to obstruct ''breathing''.''Patients can continue to have virus particles present in their saliva for as long as 18 months after the initial infection. When symptoms persist for more than six months, the condition is frequently called ""chronic"" EBV infection or ""chronic mononucleosis."" However, laboratory tests generally cannot confirm continued active EBV infection in people with chronic EBV symptoms.'  "
What are the complications of mono?,"'A common, but usually not serious, complication of mono is a mild inflammation of the liver, or ''hepatitis''. This form of hepatitis is rarely serious or requires treatment. It generally resolves on its own as the condition improves. The enlargement of the spleen that occurs with mono makes traumatic rupture of the spleen a possible complication. Swelling of the throat and tonsils can also lead to ''airway'' obstruction when severe. Infection in the area of the tonsil can rarely become a serious ''abscess'' referred to as a peritonsillar abscess.''Fortunately, the more severe complications of mono are quite rare, and mono is very rarely fatal in healthy people. The rare severe complications include destruction of ''red blood cells'' (hemolytic ''anemia'') and inflammation of the sac surrounding the ''heart'' (''pericarditis''), the heart muscle itself (''myocarditis''), and the brain (''encephalitis''). Mono tends to be more aggressive in patients with abnormal immune systems, such as people with ''AIDS'' or those who are taking medications that suppress immune function.''The EBV has been associated with some types of ''cancers'', most commonly ''lymphomas''. This occurs most frequently in people whose immune systems have been compromised due to disease or immune-suppressive drugs. EBV infection has also been found to be associated with two types of ''cancer'' is sometimes found in other cultures -- nasopharyngeal ''carcinoma'' (''cancer'"" of the pharynx and nose) in southern China and Burkitt's ""'lymphoma'"" of the jaw among children in equatorial Africa. Further, numerous studies have also found that EBV infection is associated with the development of at least one subtype of Hodgkin's disease. However, since the vast majority of people have been infected with EBV and never develop these types of tumors, EBV infection cannot be the sole cause of these cancers. The overwhelming majority of people who have had mono recover completely without any serious complications."" "
What is the prognosis of mono?,"'Most people with mono recover completely with no long-term problems. The fatigue associated with the condition may persist for a few months after the fever and other symptoms have resolved. Severe complications as described above are very rare.''Infectious mononucleosis is usually a self-limited, although sometimes prolonged, and often uncomfortable illness. While specific treatment is rarely necessary, the potential complications make it essential that people with this illness be under the care of a physician.' "
Is it possible to prevent mono?,"'Since mono is spread from person to person, avoiding close personal contact with infected individuals and practicing excellent hygienic practices can help prevent transmission of the virus. This includes avoiding sharing contaminated utensils like toothbrushes and drinking glasses. However, since periodic reactivations of the virus infection seem to occur in healthy individuals and because many infected people who may transmit the virus to others will not have symptoms of the condition, ''prevention'' is extremely difficult. In fact, these individuals without symptoms are believed to be the primary source of transmission of the virus. The fact that up to 95% of adults have antibodies to EBV suggests that prevention of the infection is difficult if not impossible. It is not known why some people develop the symptoms of mono while others appear to acquire the EBV infection without having symptoms. It is possible that many infections occur and produce mild symptoms and are not recognized as mono, while other infections may not produce symptoms at all.' "
What is infertility?,"'In general, infertility is defined as not being able to get pregnant (conceive) after one year (or longer) of unprotected sex. Because fertility in women is known to decline steadily with age, some providers evaluate and treat women aged 35 years or older after 6 months of unprotected sex. Women with infertility should consider making an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist—a doctor who specializes in managing infertility. Reproductive endocrinologists may also be able to help women with recurrent ''pregnancy'' loss, defined as having two or more spontaneous miscarriages.''Pregnancy is the result of a process that has many steps.''To get pregnant''Infertility may result from a problem with any or several of these steps.''Impaired fecundity is a condition related to infertility and refers to women who have difficulty ''getting pregnant'' or carrying a pregnancy to term.'   A woman’s body must release an egg from one of her ovaries (ovulation). A man’s sperm must join with the egg along the way (fertilize). The fertilized egg must go through a fallopian tube toward the uterus (womb). The fertilized egg must attach to the inside of the uterus (implantation)."
Is infertility a common problem?,"'Yes. About 6% of married women aged 15 to 44 years in the United States are unable to get pregnant after one year of trying (infertility). Also, about 12% of women aged 15 to 44 years in the United States have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term, regardless of marital status (impaired fecundity).' "
Is infertility just a woman's problem?,"'No, infertility is not always a woman’s problem. Both men and women can contribute to infertility.''Many couples struggle with infertility and seek help to become pregnant, but it is often thought of as only a woman’s condition. However, in about 35% of couples with infertility, a male factor is identified along with a female factor. In about 8% of couples with infertility, a male factor is the only identifiable cause.''Almost 9% of men aged 25 to 44 years in the United States reported that they or their partner saw a doctor for advice, testing, or treatment for infertility during their lifetime.' "
What causes infertility in men?,"'Infertility in men can be caused by different factors and is typically evaluated by a semen analysis. When a semen analysis is performed, the number of sperm (concentration), motility (movement), and morphology (shape) are assessed by a specialist. A slightly abnormal semen analysis does not mean that a man is necessarily ''infertile''. Instead, a semen analysis helps determine if and how male factors are contributing to infertility.' Varicoceles, a condition in which the veins on a man’s testicles are large and cause them to overheat. The heat may affect the number or shape of the sperm. Trauma to the testes may affect sperm production and result in lower number of sperm. Unhealthy habits such as heavy alcohol use, smoking, anabolic steroid use, and illicit drug use. Use of certain medications and supplements. Cancer treatment involving the use of certain types of chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery to remove one or both testicles Medical conditions such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, certain types of autoimmune disorders, and certain types of infections may cause testicular failure. Improper function of the hypothalamus or pituitary glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands in the brain produce hormones that maintain normal testicular function. Production of too much prolactin, a hormone made by the pituitary gland (often due to the presence of a benign pituitary gland tumor), or other conditions that damage or impair the function of the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland may result in low or no sperm production. These conditions may include benign and malignant (cancerous) pituitary tumors, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, exposure to too much estrogen, exposure to too much testosterone, Cushing’s syndrome, and chronic use of medications called glucocorticoids. Genetic conditions such as a Klinefelter’s syndrome, Y-chromosome microdeletion, myotonic dystrophy, and other, less common genetic disorders may cause no sperm to be produced, or low numbers of sperm to be produced."
What increases a man's risk of infertility?," Age. Although advanced age plays a much more important role in predicting female infertility, couples in which the male partner is 40 years old or older are more likely to report difficulty conceiving. Being overweight or obese. Smoking. Excessive alcohol use. Use of marijuana. Exposure to testosterone. This may occur when a doctor prescribes testosterone injections, implants, or topical gel for low testosterone, or when a man takes testosterone or similar medications illicitly for the purposes of increasing their muscle mass. Exposure to radiation. Frequent exposure of the testes to high temperatures, such as that which may occur in men confined to a wheelchair, or through frequent sauna or hot tub use. Exposure to certain medications such as flutamide, cyproterone, bicalutamide, spironolactone, ketoconazole, or cimetidine. Exposure to environmental toxins including exposure to pesticides, lead, cadmium, or mercury."
What causes infertility in women?,"'Women need functioning ovaries, fallopian tubes, and a uterus to get pregnant. Conditions affecting any one of these organs can contribute to female infertility. Some of these conditions are listed below and can be evaluated using a number of different tests.''A woman’s ''menstrual cycle'' is, on average, 28 days long. Day 1 is defined as the first day of “full flow.” Regular predictable periods that occur every 24 to 32 days likely reflect ovulation. A woman with irregular periods is likely not ovulating.''Ovulation can be predicted by using an ovulation predictor kit and can be confirmed by a blood test to check the woman’s ''progesterone'' level on day 21 of her menstrual cycle. Although several tests exist to evaluate a woman’s ovarian function, no single test is a perfect predictor of fertility. The most commonly used markers of ovarian function include follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value on day 3 to 5 of the menstrual cycle, anti-müllerian hormone value (AMH), and antral follicle count (AFC) using a transvaginal ultrasound.''Disruptions in ovarian function may be caused by several conditions and warrants an evaluation by a doctor.''When a woman doesn’t ovulate during a menstrual cycle, it’s called anovulation. Potential causes of anovulation include the following''Risk factors for blocked fallopian tubes (tubal occlusion) can include a history of pelvic infection, history of ruptured ''appendicitis'', history of ''gonorrhea'' or ''chlamydia'', known ''endometriosis'', or a history of abdominal surgery.''Tubal evaluation may be performed using an X-ray that is called a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), or by chromopertubation (CP) in the operating room at time of laparoscopy, a surgical procedure in which a small incision is made and a viewing tube called a laparoscope is inserted.''Depending on a woman’s symptoms, the uterus may be evaluated by transvaginal ultrasound to look for fibroids or other anatomic abnormalities. If suspicion exists that the fibroids may be entering the endometrial ''cavity'', a sonohystogram (SHG) or ''hysteroscopy'' (HSC) may be performed to further evaluate the uterine environment.'   Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a condition that causes women to not ovulate, or to ovulate irregularly. Some women with PCOS have elevated levels of testosterone, which can cause acne and excess hair growth. PCOS is the most common cause of female infertility. Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Women are born with all of the eggs that they will ever have, and a woman’s egg count decreases over time. Diminished ovarian reserve is a condition in which there are fewer eggs remaining in the ovaries than normal. The number of eggs a woman has declines naturally as a woman ages. It may also occur due to congenital, medical, surgical, or unexplained causes. Women with diminished ovarian reserve may be able to conceive naturally, but will produce fewer eggs in response to fertility treatments. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). FHA is a condition caused by excessive exercise, stress, or low body weight. It is sometimes associated with eating disorders such as anorexia. Improper function of the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands in the brain produce hormones that maintain normal ovarian function. Production of too much of the hormone prolactin by the pituitary gland (often as the result of a benign pituitary gland tumor), or improper function of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, may cause a woman not to ovulate. Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). POI, sometimes referred to as premature menopause, occurs when a woman’s ovaries fail before she is 40 years of age. Although certain exposures, such as chemotherapy or pelvic radiation therapy, and certain medical conditions may cause POI, the cause is often unexplained. About 5% to 10% of women with POI conceive naturally and have a normal pregnancy. Menopause. Menopause is an age-appropriate decline in ovarian function that usually occurs around age 50. By definition, a woman in menopause has not had a period in one year. She may experience hot flashes, mood changes, difficulty sleeping, and other symptoms as well. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is an X-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. A radiologist injects dye into the uterus through the cervix and simultaneously takes X-ray pictures to see if the dye moves freely through fallopian tubes. This helps evaluate tubal caliber (diameter) and patency. Chromopertubation is similar to an HSG but is done in the operating room at the time of a laparoscopy. Blue-colored dye is passed through the cervix into the uterus and spillage and tubal caliber (shape) is evaluated."
What increases a woman's risk of infertility?,"'Female fertility is known to decline with' Age. More women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to have children. In fact, about 20% of women in the United States now have their first child after age 35. About one-third of couples in which the woman is older than 35 years have fertility problems. Aging not only decreases a woman’s chances of having a baby, but also increases her chances of miscarriage and of having a child with a genetic abnormality. Aging decreases a woman’s chances of having a baby in the following ways:She has a smaller number of eggs left.Her eggs are not as healthy.She is more likely to have health conditions that can cause fertility problems.She is more likely to have a miscarriage. She has a smaller number of eggs left. Her eggs are not as healthy. She is more likely to have health conditions that can cause fertility problems. She is more likely to have a miscarriage. Smoking. Excessive alcohol use. Extreme weight gain or loss. Excessive physical or emotional stress that results in amenorrhea (absent periods)."
How long should couples try to get pregnant before seeing a doctor?,"'Most experts suggest at least one year for women younger than age 35. However, for women aged 35 years or older, couples should see a health care provider after 6 months of trying unsuccessfully. A woman’s chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.''Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility. So, couples with the following signs or symptoms should not delay seeing their health care provider when they are trying to become pregnant''It is a good idea for any woman and her partner to talk to a health care provider before trying to get pregnant. They can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby, and can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving.' Irregular periods or no menstrual periods. Very painful periods. Endometriosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease. More than one miscarriage. Suspected male factor (i.e., history of testicular trauma, hernia surgery, chemotherapy, or infertility with another partner)."
How will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?,"'Doctors will begin by collecting a medical and sexual history from both partners. The initial evaluation usually includes a semen analysis, a tubal evaluation, and ovarian reserve testing.' "
How do doctors treat infertility?,"'Infertility can be treated with medicine, surgery, intrauterine insemination, or assisted reproductive technology.''Often, medication and intrauterine insemination are used at the same time. Doctors recommend specific treatments for infertility on the basis of' The factors contributing to the infertility. The duration of the infertility. The age of the female. The couple’s treatment preference after counseling about success rates, risks, and benefits of each treatment option."
What are some of the specific treatments for male infertility?,"'Male infertility may be treated with medical, surgical, or assisted reproductive therapies depending on the underlying cause. Medical and surgical therapies are usually managed by an ''urologist'' who specializes in infertility. A reproductive endocrinologist may offer intrauterine inseminations (IUIs) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) to help overcome male factor infertility.' "
What medicines are used to treat infertility in women?,"'Some common medicines used to treat infertility in women include''*Note: Use of trade names and commercial sources is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the US. Department of Health and Human Services.''Many fertility ''drugs'' increase a woman’s chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses may have more problems during pregnancy. Multiple fetuses have a higher risk of being born prematurely (too early). Premature ''babies'' are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems.' Clomiphene citrate (Clomid®*) is a medicine that causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. It is often used in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other problems with ovulation. It is also used in women with normal ovulation to increase the number of mature eggs produced. This medicine is taken by mouth. Letrozole (Femara ®*) is a medication that is frequently used off-label to cause ovulation. It works by temporarily lowering a woman’s progesterone level, which causes the brain to naturally make more FSH. It is often used to induce ovulation in woman with PCOS, and in women with normal ovulation to increase the number of mature eggs produced in the ovaries. Human menopausal gonadotropin or hMG (Menopur®*; Repronex®*; Pergonal®*) is a medication often used for women who don’t ovulate because of problems with their pituitary gland—hMG acts directly on the ovaries to stimulate development of mature eggs. It is an injectable medicine. Follicle-stimulating hormone or FSH (Gonal-F®*; Follistim®*) is a medication that works much like hMG. It stimulates development of mature eggs within the ovaries. It is an injectable medication. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs and GnRH antagonists are medications that act on the pituitary gland to prevent a woman from ovulating. They are used during in vitro fertilization cycles, or to help prepare a woman’s uterus for an embryo transfer. These medications are usually injected or given with a nasal spray. Metformin (Glucophage®*) is a medicine doctors use for women who have insulin resistance or diabetes and PCOS. This drug helps lower the high levels of male hormones in women with these conditions. This helps the body to ovulate. Sometimes clomiphene citrate or FSH is combined with metformin. This medicine is taken by mouth. Bromocriptine (Parlodel®*) and Cabergoline (Dostinex ®*) are medications used for women with ovulation problems because of high levels of prolactin."
What is intrauterine insemination (IUI)?,"'Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an ''infertility treatment'' that is often called artificial insemination. In this procedure, specially prepared sperm are inserted into the woman’s uterus. Sometimes the woman is also treated with medicines that stimulate ovulation before IUI.''IUI is often used to treat' Mild male factor infertility. Couples with unexplained infertility."
What is assisted reproductive technology (ART)?,"'Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) includes all fertility treatments in which both eggs and embryos are handled outside of the body. In general, ART procedures involve removing mature eggs from a woman’s ovaries using a needle, combining the eggs with sperm in the laboratory, and returning the embryos to the woman’s body or donating them to another woman. The main type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF).' "
How often is assisted reproductive technology (ART) successful?,"'Success rates vary and depend on many factors, including the clinic performing the procedure, the infertility diagnosis, and the age of the woman undergoing the procedure. This last factor—the woman’s age—is especially important.''CDC collects success rates on ART for some fertility clinics. According to the CDC’s 2015 ART Success Rates, the average percentage of fresh, nondonor ART cycles that led to a live birth were''Success rates also vary from clinic to clinic and with different infertility diagnoses.''ART can be expensive and time-consuming, but it has allowed many couples to have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. This is a problem that can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are transferred back to the uterus. For example, transfer of a single embryo, rather than multiple embryos, greatly reduces the chances of a multiple pregnancy and its risks such as preterm birth.' 31% in women younger than 35 years of age. 24% in women aged 35 to 37 years. 16% in women aged 38 to 40 years. 8% in women aged 41 to 42 years. 3% in women aged 43 to 44 years. 3% in women older than 44 years of age."
What are the different types of assisted reproductive technology (ART)?,"'Older ART methods that are rarely used in the United States today include''ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs (eggs from another woman), donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women who cannot produce eggs. Also, donor eggs or donor sperm are sometimes used when the woman or man has a ''genetic disease'' that can be passed on to the baby. An ''infertile'' woman or couple may also use donor embryos. These are embryos that were either created by couples in infertility treatment or were created from donor sperm and donor eggs. The donated embryo is transferred to the uterus. The child will not be genetically related to either parent.' In vitro fertilization (IVF), meaning fertilization outside of the body, is the most effective and the most common form of ART. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a type of IVF that is often used for couples with male factor infertility. With ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg. The alternative to ICSI is “conventional” fertilization where the egg and many sperm are placed in a petri dish together and the sperm fertilizes an egg on its own. Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or tubal embryo transfer. This is similar to IVF. Fertilization occurs in the laboratory. Then the very young embryo is transferred to the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), involves transferring eggs and sperm into the woman’s fallopian tube. Fertilization occurs in the woman’s body."
Gestational Carrier,"'Women with ovaries but no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. This may also be an option for women who shouldn’t become pregnant because of a serious health problem. In this case, a woman uses her own egg. It is fertilized by her partner’s sperm and the embryo is placed inside the carrier’s uterus.' "
What is endocarditis?,'Endocarditis is a serious inflammation of one of the four heart valves. ' 
What causes endocarditis?,"'Endocarditis is caused by a growth of bacteria on one of the heart valves, leading to an infected mass called a ""vegetation"". The infection may be introduced during brief periods of having bacteria in the bloodstream, such as after dental work, ''colonoscopy'', and other similar procedures.' "
What are the symptoms of endocarditis?,"'Patients with endocarditis can develop:''In endocarditis, blood cultures can often detect the bacteria causing the endocarditis. Patients can also develop ''anemia'', ''blood in urine'', elevated white blood cell count, and a new ''heart murmur''. '   fever, fatigue, chills, weakness aching joints and muscles, night sweats, edema (fluid collection) in the leg(s), foot (feet), and abdomen, malaise, shortness of breath, and occasionally, scattered small skin 
lesions."
Who is at risk for endocarditis?,"'People with existing diseases of the heart valves (''aortic stenosis'', mitral stenosis, ''mitral regurgitation'', etc.) and people who have undergone heart valve replacements are at an increased risk of developing endocarditis. These people are usually given antibiotics prior to any procedure which may introduce bacteria into the bloodstream.  This includes routine dental work, minor surgery, and procedures that may traumatize body tissues such as colonoscopy and gynecologic or urologic examinations. Examples of antibiotics used include oral  ''amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'') and ''erythromycin'' (Emycin, ''Eryc'',''PCE''), as well as intramuscular or intravenous ''ampicillin'', gentamicin, and ''vancomycin''.' "
How is endocarditis diagnosed?,"'The infection on the valve can cause build up of nodules on the valves called ""vegetations"". These valve vegetations can be detected by echocardiography (an ''ultrasound'' examination of the heart). The most accurate method of detecting valve vegetations is with a procedure called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). In this procedure an echo-transducer is placed on the tip of a flexible endoscope. The endoscope is inserted through the mouth into the ''esophagus''. The transducer at the tip of the endoscope is then able to take sound wave ""pictures"" of the heart valves located adjacent to the lower esophagus. It is important to realize that endocarditis may exist without visible vegetations on the heart valve; the exact diagnosis is made by the identification of bacteria in a blood culture, in the appropriate clinical setting.' "
How is endocarditis treated?,"'The mainstay of treatment is aggressive antibiotics, generally given intravenously, usually for 4-6 weeks. The duration and intensity of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and the type of bacterial organism responsible. In cases where the valve has been severely damaged by the infection, resulting in severe valve dysfunction, surgical replacement of the valve may be necessary. Response to treatment is indicated by a reduction in fever, negative blood bacterial cultures, and findings on echocardiography.'  "
Facts you should know about scleritis," Scleritis is inflammation of the white portion of the eye, the sclera. Scleritis is a serious eye disease that is often associated with underlying autoimmune disorders. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of scleritis is essential to prevent permanent vision loss."
What is scleritis?,"'Scleritis is inflammation of the sclera, the white portion of the eye.' "
What is the sclera?,"'The sclera is the tough, white fibrous outer wall layer of the eyeball. It is a type of connective tissue. The sclera provides both the white color of the eye and maintains the shape of the eyeball. It extends from the edge of the ''cornea'' (the clear, dome-shaped window in the front of the eye) around to the ''optic nerve'' in the back of the eye.' "
What causes scleritis?,"'Scleritis is an uncommon disease and is differentiated from episcleritis, which is inflammation of the surface membrane covering the sclera and is a more common eye condition. In episcleritis, only the superficial tissue between the white of the eye (sclera) and the blood vessel-filled covering (''conjunctiva'') is inflamed.''Approximately one-half of scleritis cases are associated with underlying diseases that affect the body internally (systemic diseases). Connective tissue disorders, autoimmune diseases, and generalized vasculitic abnormalities may all first appear as scleritis or manifest themselves as scleritis at some other time during the course of the underlying disease.''Scleritis may be seen in association with ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''arthritis'', other types of inflammatory ''arthritis'' (''ankylosing spondylitis'', ''reactive arthritis'', ''gouty arthritis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'', relapsing ''polychondritis''), ''polyarteritis nodosa'', ''mixed connective tissue disease'', progressive ''systemic sclerosis'' (''scleroderma''),\xa0granulomatous polyangiitis, ''polymyositis'', '""Sjögren's syndrome""', ''giant cell arteritis'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'', and ''allergic'' ''angiitis''.''Scleritis may be the initial manifestation of these underlying illnesses. Some of these conditions are organ-threatening and potentially lethal.''Scleritis can also be the result of an infectious process caused by bacteria including ''pseudomonas'', fungi, mycobacterium, ''viruses'', or parasites. ''Trauma'', chemical exposure, or postsurgical inflammation can also cause scleritis.''No cause is found in some cases of scleritis.''Scleritis may affect either one or both eyes. In patients with disease in both eyes, an underlying systemic cause is almost always found.' "
Is scleritis contagious?, 
What are risk factors for scleritis?,'The peak incidence of scleritis is in people aged 40-50 years old. Women are more commonly affected than men. The presence of known autoimmune or ''connective tissue disease'' markedly increases the risk of scleritis.'  
What are symptoms of scleritis?,"'Symptoms of scleritis include ''pain'', redness, tearing, light sensitivity (''photophobia''), tenderness of the eye, and decreased visual acuity.''Pain'' is nearly always present and typically is severe and accompanied by tenderness of the eye to touch. The ''pain'' may be boring, stabbing, and often awakens the patient from ''sleep''. The extreme ''pain'' of scleritis helps to differentiate it from other common causes of ''redness of the eyes'', such as ''conjunctivitis'' or episcleritis.''There is usually no discharge from the eye in scleritis.''The discoloration that is caused by the inflammation can have a bluish hue and can involve the entire white of the eye or be localized to only one area.''Decreased visual acuity may be caused by extension of scleritis to the adjacent structures, leading to inflammation of the ''cornea'' (''keratitis'') or the colored portion of the front of the eye (''uveitis''), ''glaucoma'', ''cataract'', and abnormalities of the retina.'  "
What are signs of scleritis?,"'In scleritis, there is redness of the blood vessels adjacent to the sclera. This redness can have a bluish or violet tinge. With repeated episodes or long-standing scleritis, the sclera can thin and the underlying brown choroid may become visible through the residual sclera.''Scleritis may be nodular with multiple round or oval elevated areas of the sclera. Scleritis may also be necrotizing, resulting in areas of thinning and softening of the normally fairly rigid sclera. Areas of absence of redness may be due to death (necrosis) of inflamed blood vessels.''Scleritis can be characterized as being located in the front or back of the eye (anterior or posterior), depending on the location of the disease upon examination.''Visual acuity can be decreased if there is secondary clouding of the cornea or of the ''lens'' of the eye. ''Intraocular pressure'' can be increased from ''congestion'' of the blood vessels involved in draining aqueous fluid from the eye. ''Intraocular'' pressure can also be decreased if the ciliary body, which lies deeper than the sclera, is secondarily involved by inflammation.''Disturbances of eye movement can be seen since the extraocular muscles can become irritated where they insert into the sclera. This can cause ''double vision''.' "
Scleritis vs. episcleritis,"'Many of the conditions associated with scleritis are serious. Episcleritis is a much more common and milder inflammation of the tissue. The extreme pain of scleritis helps to differentiate it from other common causes of ''redness of the eyes'' such as episcleritis, which is not as painful.' "
Scleritis vs. conjunctivitis,"'Many of the conditions associated with scleritis are serious. ''Conjunctivitis'' is a much more common cause of a ''red eye''. The extreme pain of scleritis helps to differentiate it from other common causes of ''redness of the eyes'' such as ''conjunctivitis'', which can cause ''itching'' and burning, but is not exceptionally painful. There is usually no discharge from the eye in scleritis while there is often a discharge with ''conjunctivitis''.' "
What is necrotizing scleritis?,"'Necrotizing scleritis is the most severe and destructive form of scleritis, sometimes leading to loss of the eye from multiple complications, or occasionally perforation of the eyeball (globe). In necrotizing scleritis, there is breakdown of the scleral tissue.' "
What specialists treat scleritis?,'Ophthalmologists treat scleritis. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who has specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. Your ophthalmologist may consult with an immunologist or ''rheumatologist'' to assist in your treatment depending on the particular situation.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose scleritis?,"'Scleritis is usually diagnosed by the history and the clinical findings on slit lamp examination by an ophthalmologist. The slit lamp is a special viewing instrument that eye specialists use to stabilize the head while magnifying and viewing the structures of the eye.''In order to determine the cause of the scleritis, blood tests including ''rheumatoid factor'', antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, human leukocyte antigen typing, and erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' may be ordered. If infectious disease is suspected, appropriate cultures or serological tests may be necessary. If ''granulomatosis with polyangiitis'' is considered, sinus ''X-rays'' and a ''chest X-ray'' may be ordered. Radiographic examination of joints may assist in the diagnosis of various types of arthritis. If orbital inflammation is suspected in addition to the scleritis, an ''MRI'' of the orbit may be helpful for diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for scleritis?,"'Treatment of scleritis resulting from an underlying disease process usually requires specific therapy for that disease.''Topical treatment with eye drops is an adjunct to such systemic treatment. These eye drops will usually be anti-inflammatory, such as topical steroid drops or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drops (''NSAIDs''). Topical antibiotics are used if the scleritis is felt to be infectious.''In situations where no underlying disease process is found, eye drops to counter inflammation are used, but they are often insufficient to control the process. Systemic treatment with ''NSAIDs'', cortisone medication (''corticosteroids''), or immune modulating agents such as ''methotrexate'' (MTX) can be the first choice. But ''azathioprine'', ''mycophenolate mofetil'', ''cyclophosphamide'', or ''cyclosporine'' are also used. Anti-TNF agents such as the ''biologics'' ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') or ''adalimumab'' (''Humira'') can also be used.''Localized, subconjunctival steroid injections are often helpful in certain situations or if systemic side effects of these ''drugs'' are of concern.''The delivery of steroid eyedrops using a low-level electrical current to encourage drug migration into the affected tissue, known as iontophoresis, is currently in ''clinical trials''.''Rarely, surgical procedures may be required if there is scleral thinning. In order to preserve the integrity of the eye, scleral grafts available through eye banks can be used. Corneal tissue may also be used if there is perforation or severe thinning in the limbal area.'  "
Are there home remedies for scleritis?, 
What are the complications of scleritis?,"'Complications of scleritis include inflammation of the cornea (''keratitis''), anterior or posterior ''uveitis'', ''glaucoma'', ''cataract'', retinal swelling, scleral thinning, peripheral corneal shinning, and retinal macular swelling.''Corneal or scleral thinning, if untreated, may lead to a hole in the side of the eye (''ocular'' perforation) and severe ''vision loss'' or ''blindness''. Scleritis may be recurrent. Long-term treatment with ''corticosteroid'' eye drops may itself cause ''cataract'' and ''glaucoma''.' "
What is the prognosis for scleritis?,"'Scleritis is a serious eye disease which must be evaluated, treated, and monitored aggressively to avoid vision loss. Scleritis may be recurrent, but is usually responsive to therapy. It is critical that any underlying disease be diagnosed and treated. Many of the conditions associated with scleritis are serious and may only be diagnosed during the evaluation for the cause of the scleritis. The scleritis itself may respond to treatment, but the underlying disease process may not.''In general, scleritis in association with ''granulomatosis with polyangiitis'' is difficult to treat and may lead to vision loss even with treatment. The scleritis seen with the spondyloarthropathies is usually very responsive to treatment. Scleritis that occurs in the absence of an underlying disease will typically respond well to treatment. When recurrent scleritis symptoms are noticed, urgent treatment can result in optimal outcome.' "
Is it possible to prevent scleritis?,'Scleritis is an inflammation of the white of the eye. It is a serious eye disease which is often associated with underlying autoimmune disorders. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential in preventing permanent vision loss. There is no preventive treatment for most cases. Patients with underlying disease processes should be made aware of the possibility of scleritis occurring and should have access to immediate care and careful monitoring by an ophthalmologist.' 
What research is being done on scleritis?,'Current research in scleritis is trying to determine the exact immune abnormalities leading to the disease and is searching for more precise medication to target those portions of the immune system.' 
What is vaginitis?,"'Vaginitis refers to inflammation of the vagina that often occurs in combination with inflammation of the vulva, a condition known as vulvovaginitis. Vaginitis is often the result of an infection with yeast, bacteria, or ''Trichomonas'', but it may also arise due to physical or chemical irritation of the area. Not all infections that cause vaginitis are considered sexually transmitted diseases (''STDs''), but some STDs cause vaginitis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of vaginitis?,"'Vaginitis causes irritation of the vagina that can result in;''It is also possible to have vaginitis or an ''STD'' without experiencing any symptoms.'   burning, itching, pain, vaginal discharge, pain during sexual intercourse or urination, and vaginal odor."
How do you get vaginitis? What causes it?,"'Infectious causes of vaginitis include bacteria, yeast, and ''Trichomonas''.''Vaginitis in young girls has also been described and is thought to arise from ''poor hygiene'' practices that allow the spread of fecal bacteria from the anal area into the vagina.'   Bacterial vaginosis is the most common bacterial infection that causes vaginitis. This condition results from an imbalance in the bacteria normally present in the vagina. It is not clear if sexual activity plays a role in the development of bacterial vaginosis, and some experts believe it can occur in women who have not had sexual contact. The STDs gonorrhea and Chlamydia are other bacterial causes of vaginitis. Yeast infections, such as Candida infection, are a common cause of vaginitis. Yeast infections are not considered to be STDs. Trichomonas (""Trich"") is a parasitic infection that is transmitted through sexual contact. Non-infectious causes of vaginitis include physical or chemical irritation, such as:Douches, soaps, or fragrancesSpermicidesReduced estrogen levels around the time of menopause Douches, soaps, or fragrances Spermicides Reduced estrogen levels around the time of menopause"
What are the risk factors for vaginitis?,"'The risk factors for vaginitis depend upon the type of vaginitis.''Risk factors for ''STDs'' include multiple sexual partners and unprotected intercourse.''Some of the known risk factors for ''bacterial vaginosis'' include ''cigarette smoking'', multiple sex partners, ''douching'', and using IUDs for ''contraception''.''Risk factors for ''yeast infection'' are varied. They can include suppression of the immune system either due to ''cancer'' or other conditions, or by taking immune-suppressing medications. Antibiotic use is another known risk factor. ''Pregnancy'', ''diabetes'', taking ''oral contraceptives'"", and douching can all increase a woman's likelihood of developing yeast vaginitis."" "
Which tests diagnose vaginitis?,"'The symptoms and signs of vaginitis strongly suggest the diagnosis. At the time of diagnosis, a pelvic examination is typically performed that may include removal of a sample of vaginal discharge. The sample may be viewed under the microscope to look for ''Trichomonas'' organisms, or it may be sent to a laboratory for culture or other specialized tests to identify infectious organisms.' "
What is the treatment for vaginitis?,"'The treatment for vaginitis depends upon its cause. Infectious vaginitis is treated with antibiotic medications. Bacterial vaginitis is treated with either oral antibiotics, intra-vaginal antibiotic creams, or injections (shots) of antibiotics. Treatment guidelines are always updated to reflect the patterns of resistance to antibiotics of circulating bacterial ''strains''.' "
What medications treat vaginitis?,"'Antibiotics that may be used in the management of ''bacterial vaginosis'' include ceftriaxone (Rocephin), ''erythromycin'', ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl''), ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin''), ''cefixime'' (''Suprax''), ''doxycycline'' (Doryx), and ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'').''Antifungal medications are used to treat ''yeast infections'', and antifungal preparations are available ''over-the-counter'' for yeast vaginitis. Examples of antifungal medications include ''fluconazole'', ''terconazole'' (''Terazol''), ''clotrimazole'' (''Gyne-Lotrimin''), ''miconazole'' (''Monistat''), butoconazole (Gynazole), and ''Nystatin''.''Metronidazole (Flagyl) is the drug of choice for treating ''T''richomonas'' infections''.''Vaginitis due to infections cannot be cured by home remedies. However, many women find that home care strategies can help control unpleasant symptoms. These include allowing air to circulate around the vagina when possible by wearing loose, cotton undergarments and clothing. Removing undergarments at night may also be helpful.''Vaginitis due to thinning and irritation of the vaginal wall as a result of lowered estrogen levels at ''menopause'' can be treated with hormonal therapy, either in topical (applied directly to the vagina) or oral form. Non-hormonal vaginal lubricant products are also available.'  "
Can vaginitis be cured? What if it is not treated?,"'Most cases of vaginitis do not cause long-term problems when properly treated. If untreated, vaginal infections may spread to other pelvic organs, a condition known as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID). PID can be serious and result in impaired ''fertility''. Sometimes, vaginitis recurs even after successful treatment, and another course of treatment is necessary.''STDs that occur in ''pregnant'' women should also be promptly treated to avoid complications for the mother or baby.' "
Can vaginitis be prevented?,'Vaginitis due to STDs can be prevented by practicing ''safe sex'' or abstinence. It is not possible to prevent all cases of ''yeast infection'' or bacterial vaginosis. Attention to hygiene practices and avoiding spread of fecal material to the vagina may help prevent vaginitis in young girls.' 
What Is Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)?,"'Inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD'') is a term that includes a group of diseases that cause chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI, digestive) tract. The two most common types of ''inflammatory bowel disease'"" are Crohn's disease (""'Crohn disease'') and ''ulcerative colitis'"" (UC). In Crohn's disease, the inflammation appears in patches anywhere in the GI tract from the mouth to the anus. In ""'ulcerative colitis'', there is chronic inflammation and sores (ulcers) that are continuous along the small intestine and colon.'  "
What Is an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diet Plan?,"'There is no special ''diet'' that is recommended for treating ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD'""), but some people with Crohn's disease or ""'ulcerative colitis'' manage symptoms with dietary changes and a low-residue or low-''fiber'' ''diet'' that includes:''People with Crohn’s disease may have difficulty tolerating dairy products because of intolerance to milk (''lactose intolerance''). They also are more prone to nutritional deficiencies because of the lack of nutrient absorption in the intestine. If you have ''IBD'', discuss any dietary changes with your doctor, registered dietitian, nutritionist, or other health care professional.' Eating smaller and more frequent meals Taking vitamins and other nutritional supplements Avoiding problem or trigger foods such as fatty and fried foods, meats, spicy foods, diary, and fiber-rich foods because they often trigger symptoms of bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain and cramping."
Foods to Avoid in an IBD Diet,"'Some people with ''inflammatory bowel'"" disease, for example, Crohn's ulcerative ""'colitis'', find that certain foods or products trigger flares, which worsens the disease. Examples of foods to avoid if you have ''IBD'' include:'  Fatty, fried foods Spicy foods Meats Creamy sauces High-fiber foods including raw fruits and vegetables Nuts, seeds, and beans Caffeinated beverages Sweets including candy, soda, and juice Alcohol"
Foods to Include in an IBD Diet,"""People with\xa0Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis'' often find it difficult to get their daily nutritional needs because of their disease. ''Vitamins'' and other nutritional ''supplements'' can help provide some of the necessary nutritional needs to people with ''IBD''.''A low-residue ''diet''\xa0can relieve flare-ups. Include foods that are soft and bland, for example:''Talk with a doctor, nutritionist, dietician, or other health care professional about your specific dietary needs if you have ''inflammatory bowel'' disease.'

What is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?,"""Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are known as the ""'inflammatory bowel'"" diseases (IBD). The precise cause of IBD remains unknown. These diseases are believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic, or environmental factors (for example, infections) that interact with the body's immune (defense) system. When the intestinal immune system does not function properly, many white blood cells accumulate in the inner lining (mucosa) of the gut. The white cells then release chemicals that lead to tissue injury (inflammation). This inflammation of the mucosa can cause ""'diarrhea'"", which is the most common symptom of  ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, with or without the intestinal complications.""  "
What are the intestinal complications of IBD?,"'''The intestinal complications of IBD occur when the intestinal inflammation is severe, extends beyond the inner lining (mucosa) of the intestines, is widespread, and/or is of long duration (chronic). For example, severe mucosal inflammation can cause ulcers, bleeding, and toxic megacolon (a condition in which the colon widens, or dilates, and loses its ability to properly contract). Inflammation that extends beyond the inner lining and through the intestinal wall is responsible for strictures (scarring that causes narrowing of the intestinal wall) and fistulas (tubular passageways originating from the bowel wall and connecting to other organs or the skin). Strictures, in turn, can lead to bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine (SIBO). If the inflammation of the small bowel is widespread, malabsorption of nutrients can be a complication. Chronic inflammation can also be associated with colon ''cancer''.'' The majority of IBD patients experience periods during which their disease intensifies (flares) or subsides (remissions). Although most patients require medication for IBD, they are able to live normal, productive lives. Some patients, but certainly not all, will develop intestinal complications of IBD. When these complications occur, they should be recognized and usually treated. Some patients with IBD develop complications outside of the intestine (extraintestinal), such as certain kinds of ''arthritis'', skin ''rashes'', ''eye problems'', and ''liver disease''. These extraintestinal complications are discussed in other articles on IBD.'' This review will describe the various types of intestinal complications that are associated with IBD, and will also summarize methods for their diagnosis and treatment. Please note that the terms bowel, intestine, and gut are used synonymously. The small bowel, or intestines, includes from top to bottom, the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large bowel is also called the colon.' "
Are the intestinal complications of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease different?,"""Some intestinal complications of IBD occur in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. For example, ulceration of the inflamed inner intestinal lining (mucosa), which causes ""'abdominal pain'"" and intestinal bleeding, may complicate both diseases. Since both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease involve the colon,  complications that are associated with the colon, such as toxic megacolon and  colon ""'cancer'"", occur in both diseases. Additionally, there are no intestinal complications that occur only in ulcerative colitis and not in  Crohn's disease. On the other hand, certain intestinal complications of IBD occur predominantly in Crohn's disease (for example, fistulas) or exclusively in Crohn's disease and not in  ulcerative colitis (for example, malabsorption and SIBO)."""" The differences in intestinal complications between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease depend on the characteristically dissimilar behaviors of the inflammation associated with these diseases. In Crohn's disease, the inflammation usually extends from the inner lining (mucosa) through the entire thickness of the bowel wall. This spreading inflammatory process may thereby lead to fistulas, abscesses, or strictures of the bowel. By contrast, the inflammation in ulcerative colitis is limited to the inner lining of the colon. The development of these particular complications is, therefore, much less common in ulcerative colitis. Also, Crohn's disease can affect any area of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus, whereas ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon. Therefore, complications involving the small intestine, such as malabsorption and SIBO, as previously noted, occur only in Crohn's disease and not in ulcerative colitis."" "
Do intestinal ulcers occur in IBD?,"""When the inflammation in the inner lining of the intestine becomes severe, it can break through the inner lining to form ulcers. The ulcers associated with ulcerative colitis are located in the colon, whereas ulcers in Crohn's disease may be found anywhere in the gut from the mouth (aphthous ulcers) to the anus. When examined, ulcerative colitis ulcers are typically shallow and more numerous, while Crohn's disease ulcers are usually deeper and with more distinct borders.""'The symptoms caused by intestinal ulcers are predominantly ''abdominal pain'', ''cramps'', and bleeding. Sometimes, however, ulcers may be present in IBD but are not associated with any symptoms (asymptomatic).'""In Crohn's disease, the inflammation and accompanying ulcers occur most commonly in the ileum, jejunum, and colon, but can occasionally occur in the duodenum. Note, however, that these ulcers are entirely different from the far more common acid-related peptic ulcers in the duodenum."" "
How are ulcers in IBD diagnosed and treated?,"'Intestinal ulcers can be diagnosed by directly viewing the lining of the intestines. Various procedures, utilizing viewing instruments called endoscopes, are available. Endoscopes are flexible, thin, tubular instruments that are inserted into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through either the mouth or rectum, depending on the procedure. Which procedure is done depends on the part of the GI tract that is being examined. ''Endoscopy'' can be done for either the upper or ''lower GI'' tracts. The endoscope is inserted through the mouth for ''upper endoscopy'' or through the rectum for lower endoscopy. The colon is examinedeither by ''sigmoidoscopy'' (using sigmoidoscopes) for the lower (sigmoid) part ofthe colon or by ''colonoscopy'' (using a ''colonoscope'') for the entire colon.''The upper GI tract is examined by a procedure called esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (''EGD'""). An upper GI endoscope is used for this procedure. EGD is useful in detecting Crohn's disease ulcers in the ""'esophagus'', stomach, and the duodenum.''Crohn\'s disease ulcers in the small intestine may be seen by a procedure called enteroscopy, in which a special endoscope (called an enteroscope) is used. But enteroscopies need special equipments and are not widely available. Ulcers in the small intestine, however, are more often diagnosed with an X-ray study called a ""small bowel follow-through"" (SBFT). In this test, the patient swallows a few cups of barium, which coats the lining of the small intestine. On the X-ray, the barium may show the presence of ulcers. However, SBFT may not be accurate, and may not detect small ulcers in the small bowel. In patients suspected of having small bowel Crohn\'s disease ulcers and yet have normal SBFT studies, CT (''computerized tomography'') of the small bowel and capsule enteroscopy may be helpful in diagnosis.''Capsule enteroscopy is a procedure where a patient swallows a small camera the size of a pill. The camera located inside ''the pill'"" takes multiple images of the inside of the small bowel and transmits these images wirelessly onto a recorder worn around the patient's waist. The recorded images are later reviewed by a doctor. Both CT of the small bowel and capsule enteroscopy in some studies have been found to be more accurate than the traditional SBFT in diagnosing Crohn's disease of the small bowel.""'The treatment of ulcers in IBD is aimed at decreasing the underlying inflammation with various medications. These medications include ''mesalamine'' (''Asacol'', ''Pentasa'', or ''Rowasa''), ''corticosteroids'', antibiotics, or immunosuppressive\xa0medications such as 6-MP (6-''mercaptopurine'', ''Purinethol'') or ''azathioprine'' (Imuran). In some cases, ulcers can be very resistant to these treatments and the use of stronger ''drugs'' may be required. These drugs include an immunosuppressive medication, ''cyclosporine'' (''Neoral'' or ''Sandimmune''), or the newer ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'""), which is an antibody to one of the body's inflammation-inducing chemicals called ""'tumor'' necrosis factor (TNFa). ''Adalimumab'' (''Humira'') and ''certolizumab'' (''Cimzia'') are also in the same class of drugs as infliximab. Occasionally, therapy with medications fails to heal IBD ulcers and surgical treatment is needed.' "
Does gastrointestinal bleeding occur in IBD?,"""Bleeding from the intestinal tract, or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, may complicate the course of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. ""'GI bleeding'' is often referred to as ''rectal bleeding'' when the blood comes out of the rectum, usually with the stools. If the source of bleeding is in the colon, the blood is usually a red color. The longer the blood the remains in the intestine, however, the darker it becomes. Thus, ''rectal bleeding'' originating from higher up in the intestinal tract is usually black, except for very rapid bleeding, which can still be red.'' Patients with ulcerative colitis usually experience some degree of chronic (long duration) rectal bleeding, which can be continuous or intermittent. The bleeding may be mild, as when it is limited to occasional drops on the toilet paper or streaks of blood around the stools. At times, however, the bleeding may be more severe or acute, with the passage of greater amounts of blood or large ''blood clots'"". The more severe rectal bleeding is most likely due to more severe inflammation and extensive ulceration of the colon. In Crohn's disease, mild or severe intestinal inflammation also may occur, but the ulcers and bleeding are less frequent than in ulcerative  colitis. Because of the deep nature of ulcers in Crohn's disease, however, the GI bleeding tends to be acute (sudden and brief) and sporadic. Furthermore, in Crohn's disease, the site of bleeding can be anywhere in the GI tract, including the colon."" "
How is gastrointestinal bleeding in IBD diagnosed and treated?,"'''Intestinal bleeding in IBD is usually diagnosed by EGD for the upper GI tract or colonoscopy for the lower GI tract. These methods allow for direct visualization of the bleeding site, which can be particularly helpful. Additionally, special instruments can be used through the upper GI endoscopes or colonoscopes, which may effectively treat the bleeding lesions and stop ongoing blood loss. Sometimes, if the bleeding is severe and the bleeding site is suspected to be in the small intestine, other tests may be needed. One of these tests is a special X-ray study called an ''angiogram'', which uses a dye to visualize the intestinal blood vessels that may be bleeding. Another test is a nuclear medicine study called a tagged red blood cell scan, which tracks the ''red blood cells'' from the blood stream to the gut. Each of these tests can help identify the site of bleeding. Pinpointing the bleeding site becomes additionally important if surgery is ultimately needed.'' No medications as yet have been shown to specifically stop acute GI bleeding in IBD. Nevertheless, the initial approach to IBD-associated GI bleeding is aggressive medical treatment of the underlying inflammation and ulceration. Chronic bleeding might respond to medications if the inflammation resolves and the ulcers heal. If the medications or endoscopic treatments do not stop acute or severe chronic bleeding, however, surgical removal (resection) of the bleeding area of the gut may be necessary.' "
How do intestinal strictures form in IBD?,"'When inflammation is present for a long time (chronic), it sometimes can cause scarring (fibrosis). ''Scar tissue'' is typically not as flexible as healthy tissue. Therefore, when fibrosis occurs in the intestines, the scarring may narrow the width of the passageway (lumen) of the involved segments of the bowel. These constricted areas are called strictures. The strictures may be mild or severe, depending on how much they block the contents of the bowel from passing through the narrowed area.'""Crohn's disease is characterized by inflammation that tends to involve the deeper layers of the intestines. Strictures, therefore, are more commonly found in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Additionally, strictures in Crohn's disease may be found anywhere in the gut. Remember that the intestinal inflammation in ulcerative colitis is confined to the inner lining (mucosa) of the colon. Accordingly, in chronic ulcerative colitis, benign (not ""'malignant'') strictures of the colon occur only rarely. In fact, a narrowed segment of the colon in ulcerative colitis may well be caused by a colon cancer rather than by a benign (non-cancerous), chronic inflammatory stricture.' "
"What are symptoms of intestinal strictures, and how are they diagnosed and treated?","'Individuals may not know that they have an intestinal stricture. The stricture may not cause symptoms if it is not causing significant blockage (obstruction) of the bowel. If a stricture is narrow enough to hinder the smooth passage of the bowel contents, however, it may cause abdominal ''pain'', cramps, and ''bloating'' (distention). If the stricture causes an even more complete obstruction of the bowel, patients may experience more severe ''pain'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and an inability to pass stools.''An ''intestinal obstruction'' that is caused by a stricture can also lead to perforation of the bowel. The bowel must increase the strength of its contractions to push the intestinal contents through a narrowing in the bowel. The contracting segment of the intestine above the stricture, therefore, may experience increased pressure. This pressure sometimes weakens the bowel wall in that area, thereby causing the intestines to become abnormally wide (dilated). If the pressure becomes too high, the bowel wall may then rupture (perforate). This perforation can result in a severe infection of the abdominal ''cavity'' (''peritonitis''), abscesses (collections of infection and pus), and fistulas (tubular passageways originating from the bowel wall and connecting to other organs or the skin). Strictures of the small bowel also can lead to bacterial overgrowth, which is yet another intestinal complication of IBD.''Intestinal strictures of the small intestine may be diagnosed with a small bowel follow-through (SBFT) X-ray. For this study, the patient swallows barium, which outlines the inner lining of the small intestine. Thus, the X-ray can show the width of the passageway, or lumen, of the intestine. Upper GI endoscopy (EGD) and enteroscopy are also used for locating strictures in the small intestine. For suspected strictures in the colon, barium can be inserted into the colon (''barium enema''), followed by an X-ray to locate the strictures. Colonoscopy is another diagnostic option.''Intestinal strictures may be composed of a combination of ''scar'' tissue (fibrosis) and tissue that is inflamed and, therefore, swollen. A logical and sometimes effective treatment for these strictures, therefore, is medication to decrease the inflammation. Some medications for IBD, such as infliximab, however, may make some strictures worse. The reason is that these medications may actually promote the formation of scar tissue during the healing process. If the stricture is predominantly scar tissue and is only causing a mild narrowing, symptoms may be controlled simply by changes in the ''diet''. For example, the patient should avoid high ''fiber'' foods, such as raw carrots, celery, beans, seeds, nuts, fiber, bran, and dried fruit.'""If the stricture is more severe and can be reached and examined with an endoscope, it may be treated by stretching (dilation) during the endoscopy. In this procedure, special instruments are used through the endoscope to stretch open the stricture, usually with a balloon thatis passed through an endoscope. Once the balloon traverses the stricture, it is inflated and the force of the balloon dilates the stricture to a bigger size, thus opening the lumen to make it wider. If that doesn't work, some patients will require surgery. Typically, this procedure does not produce long-lasting results.""'Surgery sometimes is needed to treat intestinal strictures. The operation may involve cutting out (resecting) the entire narrowed segment of bowel, especially if it is a long stricture. More recently, a more limited operation, called stricturoplasty, has been devised. In this procedure, the surgeon simply ''cuts'"" open the strictured segment lengthwise and then sews the tissue closed crosswise so as to enlarge the width of the bowel's passageway (lumen). After surgery in Crohn's disease patients, medication still should be taken to prevent inflammation from recurring, especially at the site of the stricture. The reason for this recommendation is that after abdominal operations, recurrent intestinal inflammation is a common problem in Crohn's disease. Furthermore, the risk of post-operative intestinal fistulas and abscesses is increased in Crohn's disease patients. Therefore, only abdominal surgery that is absolutely necessary should be done in patients with Crohn's disease."" "
What are intestinal fistulas?,"""Intestinal fistulas are tubular connections between the bowel and other organs or the skin. Fistulas form when inflammation extends through all of the layers of the bowel and then proceeds to tunnel through the layers of other tissues. Accordingly, fistulas are much more common in Crohn's disease than in  ulcerative colitis. (In the latter, as you recall, the inflammation is confined to the inner lining of the large intestine.) Fistulas often are multiple. They may connect the bowel to other loops of the bowel (enteroenteric fistulas), to the abdominal wall (enterocutaneous), to the skin around the anus (perianal), and to other internal locations such as the urinary bladder (enterovesical), vagina (enterovaginal), muscles, and scrotum."""" In Crohn's disease patients, fistulas may form in conjunction with intestinal strictures. One reason for this association is that both fistulas and strictures can begin with inflammation of the entire thickness of the bowel wall (transmural inflammation). Subsequent scarring (fibrosis) causes strictures while continuing inflammation and tissue destruction leads to the fistulas. A stricture can also help create a fistula. As already mentioned, a perforation of the intestine can occur above an obstructing stricture. The perforation can create a tract outside of the bowel wall. A fistula then may develop in this tract."" "
What symptoms do fistulas cause and how are they diagnosed and treated?,"""Some fistulas, especially those that connect adjacent loops of bowel, may not cause significant symptoms. Other fistulas, however, can cause significant abdominal pain and external drainage, or create a bypass of a large segment of intestine. Such a bypass can occur when a fistula connects one part of the bowel to another part that is further down the intestinal tract. The fistula thereby creates a new route for the intestinal contents. This new route bypasses the segment of intestine between the fistula's upper and lower connections to the intestine. Sometimes, fistulas can open and close sporadically and unevenly. Thus, for example, the outside of a fistula might heal before the inside of the fistula. Should this occur, the bowel contents can accumulate in the fistulous tract and result in a pocket of infection and pus (""'abscess''). An abscess may be quite painful and can be dangerous, especially if the infection spreads to the bloodstream.''Fistulas sometimes are difficult to detect. Although the outside opening of a fistula may be simple to see, the inside opening that is connected to the bowel may not be easy to locate. The reason for this difficulty is that fistulas from the bowel can have long, winding tunnels that finally lead to the skin or an internal organ. Endoscopy might detect the internal opening of a fistula, but it can easily be missed. Sometimes, a small bowel barium X-ray will locate a fistula. Often, however, an exam under general anesthesia may be required to fully examine areas that have fistulas, especially around the anus and vagina.''Intestinal fistulas that do not cause symptoms often require no treatment. Fistulas that cause significant symptoms, however, usually require treatment, although they are frequently difficult to heal.''Fistulas located around the anus (perianal) sometimes can be improved by treatment with the antibiotics, ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl'') or ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'""). In response to the antibiotics, some of these fistulas even close completely. Also, treatment with the immunosuppressive medications, azathioprine or 6MP, improves fistulas located around the anus (perianal) in almost two thirds of patients, including complete healing in one third. More recently, the new drug infliximab (Remicade), which is an antibody to one of the body's inflammation-inducing chemicals, has been shown to produce very similar results. Remember, however, that infliximab might worsen strictures, which, as mentioned, can sometimes be associated with fistulas.""'When medications for the treatment of fistulas are discontinued, they usually re-open within 6 months to a year. Steroids do not heal fistulas and should not be used for this purpose. Other medications that suppress the immune system, such as cyclosporine or ''tacrolimus'' (FK506 or ''Prograf''), are currently being studied for the treatment of fistulas. Sometimes, resting the bowel by feeding the patient solely with total parenteral (intravenous) ''nutrition'' (TPN), and thus nothing by mouth, is required to treat fistulas. Even if these fistulas heal in response to the TPN, they commonly recur when eating is resumed.'""Fistulas sometimes require surgery. For example, when fistulas around the anus become very severe, they can interfere with the patient's ability to control bowel movements (continence). In this situation, the surgeon might make an opening (ostomy) to the skin from the bowel above the fistulas. The intestinal contents are thereby diverted away from the fistulas. Occasionally, when absolutely necessary, intestinal fistulas are surgically removed, usually along with the involved segment of the bowel. Fistulas from the intestine to the bladder or vagina are frequently very difficult to close with medical treatment alone and often require surgery."" "
What are fissures and how are they treated?,"""Fissures are tears in the lining of the anus. They may be superficial or deep. Fissures are especially common in Crohn's disease. They differ from fistulas in that fissures are confined to the anus and do not connect to other parts of the bowel, other internal organs, or the skin. Still, fissures can cause mild to severe ""'rectal pain'' and bleeding, especially with bowel movements. The most common treatment for anal fissures is periodic sitz baths or topical creams that relax the muscle (sphincter) around the anus. Injections of tiny amounts of botulinum toxin into the muscles around the anus have been reported to be helpful in relaxing the sphincter, thereby allowing the fissures to heal. The benefit of this type of therapy, however, is still controversial. Sometimes, surgery is needed to relieve the persistent pain or bleeding of an ''anal fissure'"". For example, the surgeon may cut out (excise) the fissure. Alternatively, the muscle around the anus can be cut (sphincterotomy) to relax the sphincter so that the fissure can heal. However, as is the cases with any surgery in patients with Crohn's disease, post-operative intestinal complications can occur frequently.""  "
What is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)?,"""Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can occur as a complication of Crohn's disease but not of ulcerative colitis since the small intestine is not involved in ulcerative colitis. SIBO can result when a partially obstructing small bowel stricture is present or when the natural barrier between the large and small intestines (ileocecal valve) has been surgically removed in Crohn's disease. Normally, the small bowel contains only few bacteria, while the colon has a tremendous number of resident bacteria. If a stricture is present or the ileocecal valve has been removed, bacteria from the colon gain access to the small bowel and multiply there. With SIBO, the bacteria in the small bowel begin to break down (digest) food higher up than normal in the GI tract. This ""'digestion'' produces ''gas'"" and other products that cause abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. In addition, the bacteria chemically alter the bile salts in the intestine. This alteration impairs the ability of the bile salts to transport fat. The resulting malabsorption of fat is another cause of diarrhea in Crohn's disease. (As previously mentioned, inflammation of the intestinal lining is the most common cause of diarrhea in patients with IBD.)""'SIBO can be diagnosed with a hydrogen breath test (HBT). In this test, the patient swallows a specified amount of glucose or another ''sugar'' called ''lactulose''. If bacteria have reproduced in the small bowel, the glucose or lactulose is metabolized by these bacteria, which causes the release of hydrogen in the breath. The amount of hydrogen in the breath is measured at specific time intervals after the ingestion of the ''sugar''. In a patient with SIBO, the hydrogen is eliminated into the breath sooner than the hydrogen that is produced by the normal bacteria in the colon. Accordingly, the detection of large amounts of hydrogen at an early interval in the testing indicates the possibility of SIBO. Another test, which may be more specific, uses a sugar called xylose. In this test, the swallowed xylose is tagged with a very small amount of radioactive carbon 14 (C14). The C14 is measured in the breath and interpreted by applying the same principles as used for hydrogen in the HBT.'' The best treatment for bacterial overgrowth is antibiotics for approximately 10 days using, for example, ''neomycin'', metronidazole, or ciprofloxacin. After this treatment, the breath test may be repeated to confirm that the bacterial overgrowth has been eliminated. SIBO may recur, however, if the stricture itself is not treated, or if the bacterial overgrowth is due to the surgical removal of the ileocecalvalve.' "
Does colon cancer occur in IBD?,"""The risk of developing colon cancer is 20 times higher for patients with IBD than it is for the general population. The association with colon cancer is more clearly established in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. An increased risk most likely also exists, however, for patients with Crohn's disease that affects the colon. In ulcerative colitis, the risk of acquiring colon cancer increases according to how much of the colon is involved and the duration of colitis. Thus, after about 8 to 10 years of ulcerative colitis, especially if the entire colon is involved, the risk of developing colon cancersubstantially increases. Other risk factors for colon cancer in IBD patients include a ""'liver disease'' called ''primary sclerosing cholangitis'' (''PSC''), a family history of colon cancer, and a history of ''liver'' transplantation. Additional possible risk factors include the use of concurrent immunosuppressive medications and a deficiency of the vitamin, ''folic acid''.''The way in which colon cancer develops in IBD patients is thought to be different from the way in which it develops in other people. In individuals without IBD, usually a benign (not malignant) polyp initially forms in the colon. Then, depending on the type of polyp and the genetic ''makeup'' of the patient, the polyp may eventually become cancerous. In IBD, the constant processof inflammatory injury and repair of the lining of the colon (colonic mucosa) isbelieved to make the individual more susceptible to the cancer. The idea is that the mucosal cells are dividing so rapidly that they are liable to make mistakes in their DNA (mutations). These mutated cells can then become pre-cancerous (dysplastic) cells, which later can turn into cancer.''Additionally, pre-cancerous cells in IBD develop in ways other than in a polyp. In fact, pre-cancerous cells can develop in tissue that appears completely normal or exhibits only mild irregularities. For this reason, a colon cancer may not be discovered in IBDpatients until the cancer has progressed to a later stage. In later stages, thecancer can invade tissues beyond the colon or spread (''metastasize'') to otherparts of the body.'""As already mentioned, patients with IBD, especially ulcerative colitis, have an increasedrisk of developing colon cancer. Performing a colectomy (removal of the colon)before the cancer develops in these patients is a sure way to prevent coloncancer. Actually, the concept is to remove the pre-cancerous cells (dysplasia)in the colon before they can turn into cancer. Accordingly, inspection for dysplasia and cancer by yearly colonoscopies with multiple colonic biopsies isrecommended for patients with ulcerative colitis. The monitoring is suggested to begin after thepatient has had ulcerative colitis for 8 to10 years. Many physicians recommend a similarmonitoring program for Crohn's disease patients who have inflammation of the colon (colitis),even though the association with colon cancer is less well established in Crohn's disease.Remember that ulcerative colitis involves only the colon, whereas Crohn's disease, which involves the smallbowel, colon, or both, often does not affect the colon.""'Colonoscopy clearly is the best method for monitoring colon cancer. An otherwise negative colonoscopy in ulcerative colitis, however, does not guarantee that the colon is free of cancer orpre-cancerous cells. The reason for this is that the multiple biopsies that aredone during the colonoscopy still make up only a tiny percentage of the entire lining of the colon. However, if pre-cancerous cells are found on a microscopic examination of the biopsies, a colectomy (surgical removal of the colon) may be recommended to prevent cancer from developing. One caution here is that the diagnosis of dysplasia should be made only in the absence of concurrent, active, inflammation of the colon. This is due to the fact that inflammation sometimes can mimic the microscopic appearance of dysplasia.'""In patients with Crohn's disease, there is an increased risk of developing ""'lymphoma'' oradenocarcinoma of the small intestine. Since the small intestine is not involved in ulcerative colitis, there is no increased risk of this cancer in ulcerative colitis patients. Even though there is a higher risk of these ''cancers'"" in Crohn's disease, the percentage of patients actually contracting them is very small. Still, certain conditions predispose Crohn's disease patients to an even higher cancer risk. These conditions include bypassed segments of the bowel and chronic fissures, fistulas, or strictures. Even so,routine monitoring for small bowel cancer in Crohn's disease patients by X-ray or enteroscopy is not currently recommended because these diagnostic procedures are difficult, time-consuming, and not very effective for this purpose. If however, after many years of Crohn's disease, the disease suddenly changes its course or becomes difficult to treat, the possibility of a small bowel cancer should be investigated."" "
What should be done about polyps in IBD?,"'Not all polyps that are found in IBD patients are pre-cancerous or cancerous.Some polyps form as a result of the inflammatory and healing processes. These polyps are called inflammatory polyps or pseudopolyps, and they do not turn into cancer. The only way to make sure that polyps do not have pre-cancerous or cancerous cells, however, is to remove (biopsy) and examine them under the microscope.' "
What is toxic megacolon and what are its causes and symptoms?,"'Toxic megacolon is a widened (dilated) segment of the colon in a patient withsevere inflammation of the colon (colitis). The megacolon develops when thelining of the colon is so inflamed that the colon loses its ability to contractproperly. When this happens, the propelling (peristaltic) contractions areunable to move the ''intestinal gas'' along through the colon. The colon, therefore, accumulates excessive amounts of gas. The gas then increases the pressure on thebowel wall, which causes the colon to dilate.''Patients with toxic megacolon usually are very ill, with abdominal pain, bloating (distention), and ''fever''. Thedilated colon can allow bacteria to leak through the bowel wall into the bloodstream (septicemia). With continuing dilation, the inflamed colonic wall becomesat high risk for bursting (perforating) and causing inflammation of the abdominal ''cavity'' (peritonitis). Both septicemia and peritonitis are serious infections, which, in some cases, can even lead to death.'""Toxic megacolon typically occurs when inflammation of the colon is severe. This complication, however, does not occur exclusively in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Thus, a toxic megacolon can develop in other types of colitis, such as amebiasis or bacillary dysentery (""'shigella''). Narcotics, ''codeine'', or anti-diarrheal medications such asdiphenoxylate (Lomotil) or ''loperamide'' (Imodium) can decrease the contractions ofthe colon and allow excessive gas to accumulate. These medications, therefore, predispose to the development of toxic megacolon and should be avoided during severe episodes (flares) of colitis.' "
What kind of malabsorption occurs in IBD?,"""Malabsorption means abnormal intestinal absorption. Crohn's disease usually affects the small intestine, which is the part of the gut that absorbs most nutrients.Remember that Crohn's disease involves the small bowel and/or the colon, while ulcerative colitis involves only the colon. Crohn's disease of the upper part (duodenum) and middle part (jejunum) of the small intestine may interfere with the absorption of proteins, sugars, iron,""'vitamins'', and ''fats'"". This widespread malabsorption in Crohn's disease, which does not occur in ulcerative colitis, may lead to ""'weight loss'"" and malnutrition. In addition, some unabsorbed nutrients can cause the small or large intestine to secrete increased amounts of liquid, which worsens the diarrhea in Crohn's disease. (As previously mentioned, diarrhea is the most common symptom in patients with IBD, with or without the intestinal complications.) The lower end (ileum) of the small intestine is the part of the bowel most commonly involved in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, however, the function of the ileum is normal. When the ileum is involved in patients with Crohn's disease (or surgically removed),a decreased absorption of vitamin B12 may occur. If a deficiency of B12 develops, a particular type of ""'anemia'' called ''pernicious anemia'' can result.''The ileum is also the major area for intestinal absorption of bile acids. The bile acids are compounds that are secreted in the bile by the liver into the duodenum. The major function of bile acids is to help transport and absorb fats,mostly in the jejunum. Bile acids that are not absorbed by a diseased or removed ileum pass into the colon. The bile acids then induce the colon to secrete liquid, which aggravates the diarrhea. If the bile acids are not sufficiently absorbed in the colon and consequently become deficient, fat malabsorption and more diarrhea can result.'""Extensive Crohn's disease, usually involving the surgical removal of several intestinal segments over the years, can lead to a debilitating condition known as short bowel syndrome. In this condition, the patients hav emany of the intestinal complications of Crohn's disease, including severe malabsorption. They can also suffer from the previously mentioned complications not directly affecting the intestinal tract (extraintestinal). Additionally, these patients frequently have certain other extraintestinal complications, such asosteoporosis (thin or porous bones), osteomalacia (soft bones), ""'gallstones'', and ''kidney stones''.''The treatment of malabsorption in patients with IBD includes medications to treat the underlying intestinal inflammation. Decreasing the inflammation can improve the intestinal absorption of the nutrients that were malabsorbed. The malabsorption or deficiency of B12 may need to be treated by administering the vitamin in the vein or into the muscle. Diarrhea that is induced by bile acid scan be treated with ''cholestyramine'', a compound that works by binding the bile acids.''Supplemental calories and nutrients may be administered as special liquid diets. These so-called elemental diets are composed of proteins, carbohydrates,''vitamins'', and fats that are broken down into smaller particles that are easier for the intestine to absorb. Unfortunately, however, these diets often do not smell or taste very good. Nevertheless, they can be administered through a small tube inserted through the nose (enteral feeding). For patients who are unable to tolerate any food or liquid by mouth or by enteral feeding, ''nutrition'"" may need to be given solely through the veins (total parenteral nutrition). Finally, a small bowel transplant can now be done for patients with severe Crohn's disease or otherwise unmanageable short bowel syndrome."" "
What is inflammatory breast cancer?,"'Inflammatory breast cancer is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer. It is typically a very aggressive disease and is called ""inflammatory"" because the cancer cells block the lymphatic vessels, resulting in changes in the breast (swelling and redness) that make the breast appear to be inflamed, resembling an infection in the breast (''mastitis''). Over 250,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer each year; inflammatory breast cancers make up only 1%-5% of breast cancers.' "
What are the causes and risk factors for inflammatory breast cancer?,"'The causes and risk factors for inflammatory breast cancer are the same as those for breast cancer in general. Certain genetic mutations and family history of breast cancer are two of the known risk factors. However, inflammatory breast cancer tends to affect certain women more frequently than others (See ""How is inflammatory breast cancer different from other breast cancers?"").' "
How is inflammatory breast cancer different from other breast cancers?,"'Inflammatory breast cancer is typically an aggressive form of cancer that spreads rapidly. Because it involves the lymphatic system and the cancer cells have invaded the lymph vessels at the time of diagnosis, it is already at a more advanced stage (or extent of spread) than many breast cancers when it is discovered. This type of breast cancer is usually found in women at a younger age than most breast cancers; the median age for diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer is 57 years compared to 62 years for all breast cancers.''Inflammatory breast cancer is more common in African American women than in Caucasian women and is diagnosed at an earlier average age. In Africa American women, the median age at diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer is 54 years, compared with 58 years for Caucasian women. Inflammatory breast cancer is also more common in ''obese'' women than in women with normal body weight.''Inflammatory breast cancers often are hormone receptor negative, meaning that their cells do not have receptors for estrogen or ''progesterone'' on the surface. This means that therapies (such as ''tamoxifen'' [''Nolvadex'']) that target estrogen-driven tumor growth are unlikely to be effective.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer?,"'Unlike most breast cancers, which may or may not cause any symptoms, inflammatory breast cancer produces signs and symptoms of inflammation in the breast tissue, including''Other possible symptoms and signs include''Sometimes, a mass or lump can be felt in the breast, but commonly no mass can be felt. ''Enlarged lymph nodes'' may be present in the underarm or near the collarbone.''While the symptoms of inflammation in the breast are characteristic of inflammatory breast cancer, they can also arise due to infections and other conditions such as mastitis, so any unusual symptoms or changes in the breasts should be evaluated by a medical professional.'   swelling and skin redness that affect a large part (at least one-third) of the breast, pitting, dimpling, bruising, orange peel (peau d'orange) appearance due to the buildup of lymphatic fluid, and nipple may be pulled inward (inverted). a rapid increase in size of the breast, heaviness, burning, and tenderness."
What types of doctors treat inflammatory breast cancer?,"'As with all types of breast cancers, surgeons (including surgical oncologists and breast surgeons) are involved in the treatment plan for removal of the tumor and sometimes ''lymph nodes''. Further treatment is done by oncologists (specialists in treating cancers), including both medical oncologists and ''radiation'' oncologists. These providers work as a team and will call in additional specialists as needed (radiation oncologist).' "
What tests and exams do health care professionals use to diagnose inflammatory breast cancer?,"'Screening ''mammography'' has made it possible to detect many breast cancers before they produce any signs or symptoms. However, inflammatory breast cancer produces symptoms, so in the case of this cancer, the ''mammogram'' may be used to evaluate the breast when symptoms are present or to determine the location for a ''breast biopsy''. Due to the rapid spread of the cancer, this cancer is sometimes found between the routine mammogram exams. Other imaging tests, including ''MRI'', ''ultrasound'', PET scans, and ''CT scans'' may be used to evaluate the breast if inflammatory breast cancer is suspected. A ''bone scan'' to look for spread (''metastasis'') to the bones may also be performed if a diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer is confirmed.''Even if imaging tests show an abnormality or are suspicious for breast cancer, definitive diagnosis requires a tissue sample, or biopsy. A biopsy may be taken of a small area of the abnormality (an incisional biopsy), or the entire abnormal area may be removed at the time of biopsy (excisional biopsy). A ''skin biopsy'' might also be taken at the same time as the breast biopsy. Biopsy allows the pathologist (a physician with special training in the diagnosis of diseases based on tissue samples) to determine if cancer is present, and if so, what type of cancer. Biopsy also provides a tissue sample for further tests that are done (see below) to determine the best type of treatment. If a mass is not identified in the breast, a skin biopsy can sometimes be used to establish the diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer. The diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer can be challenging.''The diagnostic guidelines for inflammatory breast cancer require that the following factors are present:''Certain laboratory tests are typically performed on all breast cancer tumor samples to help determine the optimum treatment. These include:' A rapid onset of erythema (redness), edema (swelling), and a peau d'orange appearance and/or abnormal breast warmth, with or without a lump that can be felt These symptoms have been present for less than six months. The redness covers at least one-third of the breast. A biopsy from the affected breast reveals invasive cancer. Hormone receptor status: Breast cancer tissue is tested for the presence of receptors for the hormones estrogen (estrogen receptor or ER) and progesterone (progesterone receptor or PR). If these receptors are present, the tumor is referred to as hormone receptor-positive. This means that hormone-directed therapies may be effective in stopping tumor growth. HER2: Another test performed on breast cancer tissue measures the overexpression of a protein called HER2. If a tumor is HER2-positive (HER-2+), drugs that target this specific protein may be given. About 15% of women have so-called triple-negative breast cancers. This means that they do not express any of these tumor markers (ER, PR, or HER2). As mentioned before, inflammatory breast cancers often do not express the hormone receptors ER and PR. Newer laboratory tests may be useful for some types of tumors to help determine the prognosis and treatment plan. These include, for example, studies of gene expression in the particular tumor or tests to look for the presence of circulating tumor cells or tumor DNA."
What are the stages of inflammatory breast cancer?,"'Staging of a cancer refers to the determination of how far the tumor has spread at the time of diagnosis. Staging is determined by a variety of methods including results from surgical procedures, ''lymph node'' biopsy, and imaging tests. Staging is important because it aids in developing a treatment plan.''Cancer in situ (DCIS) is referred to as stage 0, because the tumor cells are located in the breast ducts and have not invaded the surrounding tissue. Invasive breast cancers are staged along a scale of I to IV, with stage I being the earliest stage and stage IV representing tumors that have metastasized to other parts of the body like the bones, ''lungs'', or brain. Because inflammatory breast cancers have already spread into the lymphatic vessels and cause symptoms related to this presence in the lymphatic system, all inflammatory breast cancers are stage III or stage IV at diagnosis.' "
Are there home remedies for inflammatory breast cancer?,"'Although home remedies are not appropriate for the treatment of inflammatory breast cancer, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle while undergoing medical treatment. This includes maintaining your general health by eating a healthy ''diet'', ''smoking cessation'', ''exercise'', and getting adequate rest and ''sleep''.' "
What is the treatment for inflammatory breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer treatment for inflammatory breast cancer typically involves chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. In some cases, additional targeted therapies are given. The term ''neoadjuvant'' refers to therapies that are given prior to surgery, while ''adjuvant'' refers to treatments given after surgery.''Neoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to chemotherapy medications that are given prior to surgery to shrink the tumor. In patients with inflammatory breast cancer, this is often done so that the tumor is smaller and easier to remove at surgery. A typical course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy would involve at least six cycles of chemotherapy over four to six months. The chemotherapy regiment usually involves taxane and anthracycline drugs.''If the tumor cells express the HER2 protein (see above), targeted therapies such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) can also be given as a neoadjuvant (prior to surgery) therapy and continued after surgery (adjuvant therapy). Inflammatory breast cancers are often positive for the HER2 protein, so the tumors can be responsive to treatments that target this protein. In addition to trastuzumab, other drugs that target HER2 activity are available.''It is less common for inflammatory breast cancers to express hormone (ER or PR) receptors, but if the tumor is hormone receptor-positive, hormone therapies that target estrogen can be effective. Tamoxifen is a drug that interferes with the activity of estrogen in the body and is a common ''hormone therapy'' drug. It can be given to both premenopausal and ''postmenopausal'' women. In postmenopausal women, drugs known as aromatase inhibitors are also used as hormone therapy. Examples of aromatase inhibitors include ''anastrozole'' (''Arimidex''), ''letrozole'' (''Femara''), and ''exemestane'' (''Aromasin'').''Surgery for inflammatory breast cancer usually involves a modified radical ''mastectomy'' with removal of lymph nodes, since the tumor has spread into the lymphatic system. Following surgery, radiation therapy is typically administered to the chest wall. This treatment uses radiation to destroy remaining cancer cells. The most common type of radiation therapy is given in a clinic, usually five days a week for several weeks.''Adjuvant therapy after surgery can include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these methods described above.''Clinical trials'"", in which new drugs, new therapies, or combination of drugs and therapies are tested, may be available for some patients with inflammatory breast cancer and offer an additional treatment option. Anyone interested in taking part in a clinical trial should discuss this possibility doctor. Information about clinical trials is available from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER and at ""'http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials''.' "
What are the survival rates and prognosis for inflammatory breast cancer?,"'The prognosis, or survival rates, for breast cancer depend upon the extent to which the cancer has spread and the treatment received. Because inflammatory breast cancer is diagnosed when the cancer has already spread to the lymphatic system, survival rates for this type of breast cancer are not as favorable as for other types of breast cancer. Still, it is important to remember that statistics about breast cancer are based on studies of patients who were diagnosed years ago, and since therapies are constantly improving, current survival rates may be even higher.''In terms of inflammatory breast cancer, some factors are associated with a better prognosis (more favorable outcome):'""According the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, the five-year median survival for women with inflammatory breast cancer (from 1990 through 2008) was 57 months for stage III disease and 21 months for stage IV disease.""  Stage: Stage III tumors have a better prognosis than stage IV tumors. Grade: Higher-grade tumors (grade refers to the extent to which the cells resemble normal breast cells under a microscope; the higher the grade, the more abnormal the cells) tend to have a worse prognosis. Studies have shown that African American women with inflammatory breast cancer have a worse prognosis than women of other racial groups. Inflammatory breast cancers that are estrogen receptor-positive tend to have a better prognosis than those that are estrogen receptor-negative. Women who undergo multimodal therapy (a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy) have a better prognosis than women who do not have this type of therapy."
Is it possible to prevent inflammatory breast cancer?,"'There is no guaranteed way to prevent any type of breast cancer. Modifying the risk factors that can be altered (increase ''exercise'', keep a good body weight, etc.) can help in decreasing the risk of getting breast and other cancers. Some women who are at increased risk of breast cancers may be given medications to decrease their risk or even undergo ''preventive mastectomy'' if they are at very high risk for breast cancer. None of these measures, though, are 100% effective in preventing breast cancer.' "
"Facts you should know about the flu (influenza, conventional, H1N1, H3N2, and bird flu [H5N1])"," Viruses that infect the respiratory tract cause influenza (commonly called ""the flu""). Flu symptoms includefever,chills,cough,sore throat,headache,muscle aches, andfatigue. fever, chills, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue. The incubation period for flu is about 1-4 days. Flu is contagious, and flu symptoms may last up to 7-14 days. Doctors use a patient's history, physical exam, and laboratory tests to diagnose the flu. Flu spreads directly and indirectly; directly from person to person by airborne droplets produced during sneezing or coughing, for example, and indirectly when contaminated droplets land on surfaces that are subsequently touched by uninfected individuals. Influenza viruses fall into three types, designated A, B, and C, with influenza A types usually causing the most problems in humans. Most people who get the conventional or seasonal flu recover completely in 1-2 weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially life-threatening medical complications, such as pneumonia. The flu can make chronic health problems worse Annual influenza vaccination can prevent much of the illness and death caused by conventional or seasonal influenza. Influenza A undergoes frequent antigenic changes that require the development of new vaccines and necessitate that people to obtain a new vaccination every year. Researchers are developing new vaccine technology. In April 2009, a new flu virus termed novel H1N1 swine flu developed in Mexico, rapidly spread worldwide, and caused the WHO to declare a flu pandemic. Eventually, the WHO declared the pandemic over in 2010. In 2012, a new type of flu strain developed, H3N2v, but has not developed into any epidemic situations currently. Effectiveness of the flu vaccine varies year to year because strains causing flu also vary yearly. Some home remedies may reduce flu symptoms. Like the influenza virus, drug treatments are constantly changing and improving, but currently, timely vaccination is still considered the best defense against the flu. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers antiviral drugs an important adjunct to the flu vaccine in the control of the disease process. People should be aware that flu pandemics can cause severe flu symptoms and sometimes cause death in many individuals who may be more susceptible to the pandemic flu than the conventional flu. However, the previous pandemic flu virus (H1N1) has been available in vaccines and is part of the conventional circulating flu viruses. Bird flu (H5N1) mainly infects birds, but it also infects humans who have close contacts with birds. Individuals should check with their doctors to determine if they are at higher risk of getting severe flu symptoms than the normally healthy population. The flu vaccination will not help prevent the coronavirus infection. You can get the flu and COVID-19 at the same time. Although it may be safe to have a coronavirus vaccine if you already had a flu shot, there is no data and coronavirus vaccines are not yet (9/12/2020) approved by the FDA.

What is flu (influenza)?,"'Influenza, commonly called ""the flu,"" is an illness caused by RNA viruses (''Orthomyxoviridae'' family) that infect the respiratory tract of many animals, birds, and humans. In most people, the infection results in the person getting a ''fever'', ''cough'', ''headache'', and malaise (tired, no energy); some people also may develop a ''sore throat'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. The majority of individuals has flu symptoms for about 1-2 weeks and then recovers with no problems. However, compared with most other viral respiratory infections, such as the ''common cold'', influenza (flu) infection can cause a more severe illness with a mortality rate (death rate) of about 0.1% of people infected with the virus.''The above is the usual situation for the yearly occurring ""conventional"" or ""seasonal"" flu strains. However, there are situations in which some flu outbreaks are severe. These severe outbreaks occur when a portion of the human population is exposed to a flu strain against which the population has little or no immunity because the virus has become altered in a significant way. These outbreaks are usually termed epidemics. Unusually severe worldwide outbreaks (pandemics) have occurred several times in the last hundred years since influenza virus was identified in 1933. By an examination of preserved tissue, the worst influenza pandemic (also termed the Spanish flu or Spanish influenza) occurred in 1918 when the virus caused between 40-100 million deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate estimated to range from 2%-20%.''In April 2009, a new influenza strain against which the world population has little or no immunity was isolated from humans in Mexico. It quickly spread throughout the world so fast that the WHO declared this new flu strain (first termed ''novel H1N1 influenza'"" A swine flu, often later shortened to H1N1 or swine flu) as the cause of a pandemic on June 11, 2009. This was the first declared flu pandemic in 41 years. Fortunately, there was a worldwide response that included vaccine production, good hygiene practices (especially hand washing), and the virus (H1N1) caused far less morbidity and mortality than was expected and predicted. The WHO declared the pandemic's end on Aug. 10, 2010, because it no longer fit into the WHO's criteria for a pandemic.""'Researchers identified a new influenza-related viral strain, H3N2, in 2011, but this strain has caused only about 330 infections with one death in the U.S. Since 2003, researchers identified another strain, H5N1, a bird flu virus, that caused about 650 human infections. This virus has not been detected in the U.S. and easily spreads among people in contrast to other flu strains. Unfortunately, people infected with H5N1 have a high death rate (about 60% of infected people die). Currently, H5N1 does not readily transfer from person to person like other flu viruses.''The most recent data for the mortality (death rates) from influenza rate (death rate) for the United States in 2016 indicates that mortality from influenza varies from year to year. Death rates estimated by the CDC range from about 12,000 during 2011-2012 to 56,000 during 2012-2013. In the 2017-2018 season, deaths reached a new high of about 79,000. The CDC estimates between 24,000-62,000 deaths occurred in the 2019-2020 flu season. Experts suggest that a large percentage of people went unvaccinated or refused to vaccinate family members, causing the increased the number of deaths due to the flu.''Haemophilus influenzae'' is a bacterium incorrectly considered to cause the flu until the virus was demonstrated to be the correct cause in 1933. This bacterium can cause lung infections in infants and young children, and it occasionally causes ear, eye, sinus, joint, and a few other infections, but it does not cause the flu.''Another confusing term is ''stomach flu''. This term refers to a gastrointestinal tract infection, not a ''respiratory infection'' like influenza (flu). Influenza viruses do not cause the stomach flu (''gastroenteritis''). Another name problem is with the condition called swine flu. Swine flu is a ''flu-like'' illness that usually infects pigs, but the term ''swine flu ''was applied to a flu strain that also could infect humans (H1N1). In 2018-19, the pig version of the virus (not infecting humans to date) killed the majority of pigs in China, forcing that country to begin to utilize its emergency stockpile of pork. The viral strain has now been detected in South Korea. ''Although initially symptoms of influenza may mimic those of a ''cold'', influenza is more debilitating with symptoms of ''fatigue'', fever, and respiratory ''congestion''. Colds can be caused by over 100 different virus types, but only influenza viruses (and subtypes) A, B, and C cause the flu. In addition, colds do not lead to life-threatening illnesses like ''pneumonia'', but severe infections with influenza viruses can lead to ''pneumonia'' or even death.' "
Flu vs. cold,"'Compared with most other viral respiratory infections, such as the ''common cold'', influenza (flu) infection usually causes a more severe illness with a mortality rate (death rate) of about 0.1% of people infected with the virus. Cold symptoms (for example, ''sore throat'', ''runny nose'', cough (with possible ''phlegm'' production), congestion, and slight fever) are similar to flu symptoms, but the flu symptoms are more severe, last longer, and may include ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and cough that is often a dry cough.''The following table from the CDC helps to distinguish between a cold and influenza:' "
Flu vs. food poisoning,"'Although some of the symptoms of influenza may mimic those of ''food poisoning'', others do not. Most symptoms of ''food poisoning'' include ''nausea'', vomiting, watery ''diarrhea'', ''abdominal pain'', ''cramps'', and fever. Note that the majority of ''food poisoning symptoms'' are related to the gastrointestinal tract, except for fever. The common flu signs and symptoms include fever but also include symptoms that are not typical for food poisoning, because the flu is a respiratory disease. Consequently, respiratory symptoms of ''nasal congestion'', dry cough, and some ''breathing'' problems help distinguish the flu from food poisoning.' "
What are the causes of the flu (influenza)?,"'Influenza viruses cause the flu and are divided into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza A and influenza B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter and are often associated with increased rates of hospitalization and death. Influenza type C differs from types A and B in some important ways. Type C infection usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all. It does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact of influenza types A and B. Efforts to control the impact of influenza are aimed at types A and B, and the remainder of this discussion will be devoted only to these two types.''Influenza viruses continually change over time, usually by mutation (change in the viral RNA). This constant changing often enables the virus to evade the immune system of the host (humans, birds, and other animals) so that the host is susceptible to changing influenza virus infections throughout life. This process works as follows: A host infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the virus changes, the ""first"" antibody no longer recognizes the ""newer"" virus and infection can occur because the host does not recognize the new flu virus as a problem until the infection is well under way. The first antibody developed may provide partial protection against infection with a new influenza virus. In 2009, almost all individuals had no antibodies that could recognize the novel H1N1 virus immediately.''Type A'"" viruses are divided into subtypes or strains based on differences in two viral surface proteins called the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N). There are at least 16 known H subtypes and nine known N subtypes. These surface proteins can occur in many combinations. When spread by droplets or direct contact, the virus, if not killed by the host's immune system, replicates in the respiratory tract and damages host cells. In people who are immune compromised (for example, ""'pregnant'' women, infants, ''cancer'' patients, ''asthma'' patients, people with pulmonary disease, and many others), the virus can cause viral pneumonia or ''stress'"" the individual's system to make them more susceptible to ""'bacterial infections'', especially bacterial pneumonia. Both pneumonia types, viral and bacterial, can cause severe disease and sometimes death.''Influenza type A viruses undergo two major kinds of changes. One is a series of mutations that occurs over time and causes a gradual evolution of the virus. This is called antigenic ""drift."" The other kind of change is an abrupt change in the hemagglutinin and/or the neuraminidase proteins. This is called antigenic ""shift."" In this case, a new subtype of the virus suddenly emerges. Type A viruses undergo both kinds of changes; influenza type B viruses change only by the more gradual process of antigenic drift and therefore do not cause pandemics.''The 2009 pandemic-causing H1N1 virus was a classic example of antigenic shift. Research showed that novel H1N1 swine flu has an RNA genome that contains five RNA strands derived from various swine flu strains, two RNA strands from bird flu (also termed avian flu) strains, and only one RNA strand from human flu strains. According to the CDC, mainly antigenic shifts over about 20 years led to the development of novel H1N1 flu virus. A diagram that illustrates both antigenic shift and drift (see Figure 2) and features influenza A types H1N1 and bird flu (H5N1), but almost every influenza A viral strain can go through these processes that changes the viral RNA. A recent flu epidemic in India was partially blamed on antigenic drift/shift.' "
When does flu season begin and end?,"""Flu season officially begins in October of each year and extends to May of the following year. According to the CDC, people can follow the development of flu across the United States by following CDC's weekly update of the locations where flu is developing in the U.S. (see the ""'flu map'').' "
What are flu (influenza) symptoms in adults and in children?,"'Typical clinical symptoms of the flu may include''Although ''appetite loss'', nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can sometimes accompany influenza infection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent. The term ""stomach flu"" is a misnomer that some people use to describe gastrointestinal illnesses caused by other microorganisms. H1N1 infections, however, caused more nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea than the conventional (seasonal) flu viruses. Depending upon the severity of the infection, some patients can develop ''swollen lymph nodes'', ''muscle pain'', ''shortness of breath'', severe ''headaches'', ''chest pain'' or chest discomfort, ''dehydration'', and even death.''Most individuals who contract influenza recover in a week or two, however, others develop potentially life-threatening complications like pneumonia. In an average year, influenza is associated with about 36,000 deaths nationwide and many more hospitalizations. Flu-related complications can occur at any age; however, the elderly and people with chronic health problems are much more likely to develop serious complications after the conventional influenza infections than are younger, healthier people. When people ignore or refuse flu vaccination, the death rate increases as shown by the recent higher death rates.'   fever (usually 100 F-103 F in adults and often even higher in children, sometimes with facial flushing and/or sweating), chills, respiratory symptoms such ascough (more often in adults),sore throat (more often in adults),runny or stuffy nose (congestion, especially in children),sneezing, cough (more often in adults), sore throat (more often in adults), runny or stuffy nose (congestion, especially in children), sneezing, headache, muscle aches (body aches), and fatigue, sometimes extreme."
Influenza A virus information,"""As mentioned previously, has hemagglutinin on the viral surface. The viral hemagglutinins have at least 18 types, but these types are broken into two main influenza A virus categories. For example, one of the two main categories include human H1, H2, and avian H5 viruses while the other major category includes human H3 and avian H7 viruses. Researchers in 2016 at UCLA and the University of Arizona discovered that if you were exposed to one of these groups as a child, you had a much better chance of being protected against other viruses in that same group or category later in life. For example, if you are exposed to H2 as a child and then later in life to H2 or H5 viruses, you may have as high as a 75% chance of protection against those H2 and/or H5 strains. But if you are exposed to the other major category that included H3 or H7, you would be much more susceptible to these viral types. The reverse situation would be true if you were exposed as a child to H3 or H7 viruses. The researchers concluded that the immunological imprinting early in life helps determine the response (immune response) to these viral types or categories. Consequently, the first strain of flu that a person is exposed to in childhood likely determines that person's risk in the future for severity of the flu depending upon the exact category of the first viral strain that infects the child. The researchers hope to exploit these new findings in the development of new and more effective flu vaccines."" "
What is the incubation period for the flu?,"'Incubation period for the flu, which means the time from exposure to the flu virus until initial symptoms develop, typically is 1-4 days with an average incubation period of 2 days.' "
How long is the flu contagious?,'The flu is typically contagious about 24-48 hours before symptoms appear (from about the last day of the incubation period) and in normal healthy adults is contagious for another 5-7 days. Children are usually contagious for a little while longer (about 7-10 days). Individuals with severe infections may be contagious as long as symptoms last (about 7-14 days).' 
How long does the flu last?,"'In adults, flu symptoms usually last about 5-7 days, but in children, the symptoms may last longer (about 7-10 days). However, some symptoms such as ''weakness'' and fatigue may gradually wane over several weeks.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose the flu (influenza)?,"""Medical professionals clinically diagnose the flu by evaluating the patient's history of association with people known to have the disease and their symptoms listed above. Usually, a health care professional performs a quick test (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) to see if the patient has an influenza A or B viral infection. Most of the tests can distinguish between A and B types. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or positive for types A or B. If it is positive for type A, the person could have a conventional flu strain or a potentially more aggressive strain such as H1N1. Most of the rapid tests are based on ""'PCR'' technology that identifies the genetic material of the virus. Some rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) can screen for influenza in about 10-30 minutes.'""Swine flu (H1N1) and other influenza strains like bird flu or H3N2 are definitively diagnosed by identifying the particular surface proteins or genetic material associated with the virus strain. In general, this testing is done in a specialized laboratory. However, doctors' offices are able to send specimens to specialized laboratories if necessary."" "
How does flu spread?,"'Flu easily spreads from person to person both directly and indirectly. Human-to-human flu transmission occurs via droplets contaminated with the virus. Produced by coughing, sneezing, or even talking, these droplets land near or in the mouth or the nose of uninfected people, and the disease may spread to them. The disease can spread indirectly to others if contaminated droplets land on utensils, dishes, clothing, or almost any surface that uninfected people then touch. If the infected person touches their nose or mouth, for example, they transfer or spread the disease to themselves or others.' "
What is the key to flu (influenza) prevention?,"""Annual influenza vaccination can prevent most of the illness and death that influenza causes. The CDC's current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued recommendations for everyone 6 months of age and older, who do not have any contraindications to vaccination, to receive a flu vaccine each year.""'Flu vaccine (influenza vaccine made from inactivated and sometimes attenuated [noninfective] virus or virus components) is specifically recommended for those who are at high risk for developing serious complications from influenza infection.''Other simple hygiene methods can reduce or prevent some individuals from getting the flu. For example, avoiding kissing, handshakes, and sharing ''drinks'"" or food with infected people and avoiding touching surfaces like sinks and other items handled by individuals with the flu are good preventive measures. Washing one's hands with soap and water or by using an ""'alcohol''-based hand sanitizer frequently during the day may help prevent the infection. Individuals with the flu should avoid coughing or sneezing on uninfected people; quick hugs are probably okay as long as there is no contact with mucosal surfaces and/or droplets that may contain the virus. Wearing a mask may help reduce your chances of getting the disease, and if you unknowingly or know you have the infection, help to reduce spreading it to others.' "
Are there any nasal spray vaccine or flu shot side effects in adults or in children?,"'Although annual influenza (injectable) vaccination has long been recommended for people in the high-risk groups, many still do not receive the vaccine, often because of their concern about side effects. They mistakenly perceive influenza as merely a nuisance and believe that the vaccine causes unpleasant side effects or that it may even cause the flu. The truth is that influenza vaccine causes no side effects in most people. In the past, patients with egg ''allergy'' had restrictions on getting the vaccine. However, extensive research has indicated that there is not enough egg protein in the vaccine to trigger an immune response, and all the recommendations about ''allergies'' to eggs has been dropped for the 2018-2019 flu season by several organizations that regulate vaccines. The vaccine is not recommended while individuals have active infections or active diseases of the nervous system. Less than one-third of those who receive the vaccine have some soreness at the vaccination site, and about 5%-10% experience mild side effects, such as ''headache'', low-grade fever, or ''muscle cramps'', for about a day after vaccination; some may develop ''swollen lymph nodes''. These side effects are most likely to occur in children who have not been exposed to the influenza virus in the past. The intradermal shots reportedly have similar side effects as the IM shot but are less intense and may not last as long as the IM shot.''Nevertheless, some older people remember earlier influenza vaccines that did, in fact, produce more unpleasant side effects. Vaccines produced from the 1940s to the mid-1960s were not as highly purified as modern influenza vaccines, and it was these impurities that caused most of the side effects. Since the side effects associated with these early vaccines, such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and/or fatigue and malaise, were similar to some of the symptoms of influenza, people believed that the vaccine had caused them to get the flu. However, injectable influenza vaccine produced in the United States has never been capable of causing influenza because it consists of killed virus.''Another type of influenza vaccine (nasal spray) is made with live attenuated (altered) influenza viruses (LAIV). This vaccine is made with live viruses that can stimulate the immune response enough to confer immunity but do not cause classic influenza symptoms (in most instances). The nasal spray vaccine (''FluMist'') was only previously approved for healthy individuals ages 2-49 years of age and was recommended preferentially for healthy children aged 2 through 8 who did not have contraindications to receiving the vaccine. However, this season, the CDC and others report there is no preference expressed for any vaccine over another. The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'"" (AAP) recommends that all children 6 months and older receive a seasonal flu vaccine (some children under the age of 9 will need 2 doses). AAP and others recommend both inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as vaccine options for the 2020-2021 season with no preference for any vaccine type. However, FluMist, a live attenuated vaccine, is recommended for ages 2-49 only. For additional information about vaccines, see https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunizations/Influenza-Implementation-Guidance/Pages/Annual-AAP-Influenza-Policy.aspx or your child's doctor. This nasal spray vaccine contains live attenuated virus (less able to cause flu symptoms due to a designed inability to replicate at normal body temperatures). Side effects of the nasal spray vaccine include nasal congestion, sore throat, and fever. ""'Headaches'', muscle aches, irritability, and malaise have also been noted. In most instances, if side effects occur, they only last a day or two. This nasal spray has been produced for conventional flu viruses and should not be given to pregnant women or anyone who has a medical condition that may compromise the immune system because in some instances the flu may be a side effect.''Some people do not receive influenza vaccine because they believe it is not very effective. There are several different reasons for this belief. People who have received influenza vaccine may subsequently have an illness that is mistaken for influenza, and they believe that the vaccine failed to protect them. In other cases, people who have received the vaccine may indeed have an influenza infection. Overall vaccine effectiveness varies from year to year, depending upon the degree of similarity between the influenza virus strains included in the vaccine and the strain or strains that circulate during the influenza season. Because the vaccine strains must be chosen 9-10 months before the influenza season, and because influenza viruses mutate over time, sometimes mutations occur in the circulating virus strains between the time the vaccine strains are chosen and the next influenza season ends. These mutations sometimes reduce the ability of the vaccine-induced antibody to inhibit the newly mutated virus, thereby reducing vaccine effectiveness. This commonly occurs with the conventional flu vaccines as the specific virus types chosen for vaccine inclusion are based on reasoned projections for the upcoming flu season. Occasionally, the vaccine does not match the actual predominating virus strain and is not very effective in generating a specific immune response to the predominant infecting flu strain.'  "
How effective is the flu vaccine?,"'Vaccine efficacy also varies from one person to another. Past studies of healthy young adults have shown influenza vaccine to be 70%-90% effective in preventing illness. In the elderly and those with certain chronic medical conditions such as ''HIV'', the vaccine is often less effective in preventing illness. Studies show the vaccine reduces hospitalization by about 70% and death by about 85% among the elderly who are not in ''nursing'' homes. Among nursing home residents, vaccine can reduce the risk of hospitalization by about 50%, the risk of pneumonia by about 60%, and the risk of death by 75%-80%. However, these figures did not apply to the 2014-2015 flu vaccine because the quadrivalent (four antigenic types) vaccine did not match well with 2014-2015 circulating strains of the flu (vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be 23%). This occurs because the vaccine needs to be produced months before the flu season begins, so the vaccine is designed by projecting and choosing the most likely viral strains to include in the vaccine. If drift results in changing the circulating virus from the strains used in the vaccine, efficacy may be reduced. However, the vaccine is still likely to lessen the severity of the illness and to prevent complications and death, according to the CDC.' "
"Why 
do people need to get the flu (influenza) vaccine every year?","'Although only a few different influenza virus strains circulate at any given time, people may continue to become ill with the flu throughout their lives. The reason for this continuing susceptibility is that influenza viruses are continually mutating, through the mechanisms of antigenic shift and drift described above. Each year, researchers update the vaccine to include the most current influenza virus strains that are infecting people worldwide. The fact that influenza viral genes continually change is one of the reasons people must get the vaccine every year. Another reason is that antibody produced by the host in response to the vaccine declines over time, and antibody levels are often low one year after vaccination so even if the same vaccine is used, it can act as a booster shot to raise immunity.''Many people still refuse to get flu shots because of misunderstandings, fear, ""because I never get any shots,"" or simply a belief that if they get the flu, they will do well. These are only some of the reasons -- there are many more. The U.S. and other countries\' populations need to be better educated about vaccines; at least they should realize that safe vaccines have been around for many years (''measles'', ''mumps'', ''chickenpox'', and even a vaccine for ''cholera''), and as adults they often have to get a vaccine-like shot to test for ''tuberculosis'' exposure or to protect themselves from ''tetanus''. The flu vaccines are as safe as these vaccines and shots that are widely accepted by the public. Consequently, better efforts need to be made to make yearly flu vaccines as widely acceptable as other vaccines. Susceptible people need to understand that the vaccines afford them a significant chance to reduce or prevent this potentially debilitating disease, hospitalization and, in a few, a lethal flu-caused disease.' "
What are some flu treatments an individual can do at home (home remedies)?,"'First, individuals should be sure they are not members of a high-risk group that is more susceptible to getting severe flu symptoms. Check with a physician if you are unsure if you are a higher-risk person. The CDC recommends home care if a person is healthy with no underlying diseases or conditions (for example, ''asthma'', lung disease, pregnant, or immunosuppressed).''Increasing liquid intake, warm showers, and warm compresses, especially in the nasal area, can reduce the body aches and reduce nasal congestion or head congestion. Nasal strips and humidifiers may help reduce congestion, especially while trying to ''sleep''. Some physicians recommend ''nasal irrigation'' with saline to further reduce congestion; some recommend nonprescription decongestants like pseudoephedrine (''Sudafed''). ''Over-the-counter'' fever-reducing medications like\xa0''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'' and others) can treat a fever. Read labels for safe dosage. Cough drops, over-the-counter cough syrup, or cough medicine that may contain dextromethorphan (''Delsym'') and/or ''guaifenesin'' (''Mucinex'"") can suppress a cough. Notify a doctor if an individual's symptoms at home get worse.""  "
What types of doctors treat the flu?,"'Individuals with mild flu symptoms may not require the care of a physician unless they are a member of a high-risk group as described above. For many individuals, treatment is provided by their primary care physician or provider (including internists or family medicine specialists and physician assistants and other primary caregivers) or pediatrician. Complicated or severe flu infections may require consultation with an emergency-medicine physician, critical care specialist, infectious-disease specialist, and/or a lung specialist (''pulmonologist'').' "
What medications treat the flu?,"'The CDC published the following guidance concerning antiviral drugs:''Antiviral medications with activity against influenza viruses (anti-influenza drugs) are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine in the control of influenza.''The CDC recommended the following antiviral medications for the treatment of influenza (flu) for the 2020-2021 season: oral oseltamivir (''Tamiflu''), inhaled zanamivir (''Relenza''), intravenous peramivir (Rapivab), and oral Baloxavir. ''Over-the-counter medications that may help reduce symptoms of congestion (decongestants), coughing (cough medicine), and ''dehydration'' include ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), acetaminophen (Tylenol), ''NSAIDs'' (Advil, Motrin, ''Aleve''), guaifenesin (Mucinex), dextromethorphan (Delsym), pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), and oral fluids. ''Aspirin'' may be used in adults but not in children.''Antibiotics treat bacterial infections, not viral illnesses like the flu.''Individuals with the flu may also benefit from some additional bed rest, throat lozenges, and possibly nasal irrigation; drinking fluids may help prevent ''symptoms of dehydration'' (for example, dry ''mucus'' membranes and decreased urination).' Influenza antiviral prescription drugs treat influenza or to prevent influenza. Oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. In October 2018 (10/24/2018), the FDA approved a new antiviral drug (baloxavir marboxil [Xofluza]) for flu treatment that prevents viral replication."
What can people eat when they have the flu?,"'While a person has the flu, good ''nutrition'' can help the recovery process. Anyone with the flu needs to avoid dehydration, soothe sore throat and/or ''upset stomach'', and have a good protein intake. Avoid dehydration by maintaining an adequate fluid intake. Sore throat and ''upset stomach'' may be relieved by broths or warm soups (chicken, vegetable, or beef) and plain crackers, toast, and ''ginger'' tea or noncarbonated ginger ale. Scrambled eggs, yogurt, and/or protein drinks are good protein sources. In addition, bananas, rice, and applesauce are food that are often recommended for those with an upset stomach. This list is not exhaustive but should provide a balanced approach to help speed recovery from the flu.' "
When should a person go to the emergency department for the flu?,"'The CDC urges people to seek emergency medical care for a sick child with any of these flu effects (symptoms or signs):'""The following is the CDC's list of symptoms that should trigger emergency medical care for adults:"" Fast breathing or trouble breathing (shortness of breath) Bluish or gray skin color Not drinking enough fluids Severe or persistent vomiting Not waking up or not interacting Being so irritable that the child does not want to be held Flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and cough Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Sudden dizziness Confusion Severe or persistent vomiting Influenza-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough Having a high fever for more than 
3 days is another danger sign, according to the WHO, so the CDC has also included this as another serious symptom."
"Who should receive the flu vaccine, and who has the highest risk factors? When should someone get the flu shot?","'In the United States, the flu season usually occurs from about November until April. Officials have decided each new flu season will start each year on Oct. 4. Typically, activity is very low until December, and peak activity most often occurs between January and March. Ideally, the conventional flu vaccine should be administered between September and mid-November. Flu season typically occurs between October and May. It takes about 1-2 weeks after vaccination for antibodies against influenza to develop and provide protection. The CDC has published a summary list of their current recommendations of who should get the current vaccine.''Updated CDC information and guidance in this report includes the following taken directly from the CDC:''Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications.''A licensed vaccine appropriate for age and health status should be used. Consult package information for age indications.''Emphasis should be placed on vaccination of high-risk groups and their contacts/caregivers. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to (no hierarchy is implied by order of listing):''For more information and details too extensive to include here (for example, vaccine types, scheduled doses, side effects), the following site is recommended: Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) -- United States, 2020-21.

What is the prognosis for patients who get the flu? What are possible complications of the flu?,"'In general, the majority (about 90%-95%) of people who get the disease feel terrible (see symptoms) but recover with no problems. People with suppressed immune systems historically have worse outcomes than uncompromised individuals; current data suggest that pregnant individuals, children under 2 years of age, young adults, and individuals with any immune compromise or debilitation are likely to have a worse prognosis. Complications of long-term problems from the flu may worsen medical conditions such as asthma, ''congestive heart failure'', and ''diabetes''. Other complications may include ''ear infections'', ''sinus infections'', dehydration, pneumonia, and even death. In most outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics, the mortality rates are highest in the older population (usually above 50 years old). Complications of any flu virus infection, although relatively rare, may resemble severe viral pneumonia or the ''SARS'' (''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' caused by a coronavirus strain) outbreak in 2002-2003, in which the disease spread to about 10 countries with over 7,000 cases, over 700 deaths, and had a 10% mortality rate. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a rare immune disorder that can result in weakness or ''paralysis'', may occur after having the flu or very rarely, after vaccination against the flu (estimated by the CDC to be about one person per every million people vaccinated).' "
Can the flu be deadly?,"'Yes. However, associated deaths per year depend upon the virulence of the particular strain of virus that is circulating. That means for any given year, the likelihood of dying from the flu varies according to the specific infecting viruses. For example, from 1976-2007 (the most reliable available data according to the CDC), deaths associated with the flu range from a low of about 3,000 per year to a high of about 49,000 per year. The CDC estimates about 36,000 deaths/year (average) in the U.S. in recent years, but these may increase if vaccination rates continue to fall. The 1918 influenza pandemic (1918-1919) was estimated to cause 20-50 million deaths worldwide.' "
What is the bird (avian) flu?,"'The bird flu, also known as avian influenza and H5N1, is an infection caused by avian influenza A. Bird flu can infect many bird species, including domesticated birds such as chickens. In most cases, the disease is mild; however, some subtypes can be pathogenic and rapidly kill birds within 48 hours. These bird viruses rarely infect humans. People who get infected with bird flu usually have direct contact with the infected birds or their waste products. Depending on the viral type, the infections can range from mild influenza to severe respiratory problems or death. Human infection with bird flu is rare but frequently fatal. More than half of those people infected (over 650 infected people) have died (current estimates of the mortality [death] rates in humans is about 60%). Fortunately, this virus does not seem to be easily passed from person to person. The major concern among scientists and physicians about bird flu is that it will change (mutate) its viral RNA enough to be easily transferred among people and produce a pandemic similar to the one of 1918. There have been several isolated instances where a person had been reported to get avian flu in 2010; the virus was detected in South Korea (three human cases), resulting in a quarantine of two farms, and in 2012, over 10,000 turkeys died in a H5N1 outbreak with no human infections recorded. Recent research suggests that some people may have had exposure to H5N1 in their past but had either mild or no symptoms.''In addition, researchers, in an effort to understand what makes an animal or bird flu become easily transmissible to humans, developed a bird flu strain that is likely easily transmitted from person to person. Although it exists only in research labs, there is controversy about both the synthesis and the scientific publication of how this potentially highly pathogenic strain was created.' "
Do antiviral agents protect people from the flu?,"'Vaccination is the primary method for control of influenza; however, antiviral agents have a role in the prevention and treatment of mainly influenza type A infection. Regardless, antiviral agents should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for vaccination. Most effectiveness of these drugs is reported to occur if the antivirals are given within the first 48 hours after infection; some researchers maintain there is little or no solid evidence these drugs can protect people from getting the flu so some controversies exist regarding these agents.' "
Is it safe to get a flu shot that contains thimerosal?,"'Thimerosal is a preservative that contains mercury and is used in multidose vials of conventional flu vaccines to prevent contamination when the vial is repeatedly used to extract the vaccine. Although thimerosal is being phased out as a vaccine preservative, it is still used in flu vaccines in low levels. There is no data that indicates thimerosal in these vaccines has caused ''autism'' or other problems in individuals. However, flu vaccine that is produced for single use (not a multidose vial) contains no thimerosal; however, these vials are not as readily available to doctors and likely cost more to produce. Consequently, the FDA has published these two questions with clear answers that are quoted below:''However, as stated above, the FDA goes on to say that single-dose vial of conventional and other flu vaccines will not contain the preservative thimerosal, so that if a person wants to avoid the thimerosal, they can ask for vaccine that comes in a single-dose vial. The nasal spray vaccine contains no thimerosal, but it is not recommended for use in pregnant women. The CDC further states, that after numerous studies, there is no established link between flu shots with or without thimerosal and ''autism''.' "
Where can people find additional information about the flu?,"'During a flu pandemic, guidelines and situations can change rapidly. People are advised to be aware that several sources are available to them to keep current with developments. The web sites below are frequently updated, especially when a pandemic is declared. The first web site contains an update written for the public and caregivers; the government and WHO sites provide detailed information that are updated as guidelines and developments occur.''http://www.who.int/topics/influenza/en/''http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/''http://www.fda.gov/' "
Will the flu shot help fight the coronavirus?,"'Coronavirus (''SARS''-CoV-2) is the cause of the current pandemic of ''COVID-19''. This virus is different from the flu viruses, and there is no data suggesting a flu vaccine (shot) will protect you from getting ''COVID-19''. However, flu vaccines reduce the chances of getting the flu.' "
Can you get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time?,"'It is possible to get the flu and COVID-19 at the same time. There is little or no data available to determine how often such concurrent infections may happen.''Unfortunately, to date (9/12/2020), all coronavirus vaccines are still undergoing testing and are not yet approved for use by the FDA. However, there is no current information that suggests that getting a flu shot will cause any coronavirus vaccine to be unsafe to take. It is possible that taking the shots for both at the same time may reduce the immune response of one or both. Other studies seem likely to produce an answer.' "
"Facts you should know about the flu (influenza, conventional, H1N1, H3N2, and bird flu [H5N1])"," Viruses that infect the respiratory tract cause influenza (commonly called ""the flu""). Flu symptoms includefever,chills,cough,sore throat,headache,muscle aches, andfatigue. fever, chills, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue. The incubation period for flu is about 1-4 days. Flu is contagious, and flu symptoms may last up to 7-14 days. Doctors use a patient's history, physical exam, and laboratory tests to diagnose the flu. Flu spreads directly and indirectly; directly from person to person by airborne droplets produced during sneezing or coughing, for example, and indirectly when contaminated droplets land on surfaces that are subsequently touched by uninfected individuals. Influenza viruses fall into three types, designated A, B, and C, with influenza A types usually causing the most problems in humans. Most people who get the conventional or seasonal flu recover completely in 1-2 weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially life-threatening medical complications, such as pneumonia. The flu can make chronic health problems worse Annual influenza vaccination can prevent much of the illness and death caused by conventional or seasonal influenza. Influenza A undergoes frequent antigenic changes that require the development of new vaccines and necessitate that people to obtain a new vaccination every year. Researchers are developing new vaccine technology. In April 2009, a new flu virus termed novel H1N1 swine flu developed in Mexico, rapidly spread worldwide, and caused the WHO to declare a flu pandemic. Eventually, the WHO declared the pandemic over in 2010. In 2012, a new type of flu strain developed, H3N2v, but has not developed into any epidemic situations currently. Effectiveness of the flu vaccine varies year to year because strains causing flu also vary yearly. Some home remedies may reduce flu symptoms. Like the influenza virus, drug treatments are constantly changing and improving, but currently, timely vaccination is still considered the best defense against the flu. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers antiviral drugs an important adjunct to the flu vaccine in the control of the disease process. People should be aware that flu pandemics can cause severe flu symptoms and sometimes cause death in many individuals who may be more susceptible to the pandemic flu than the conventional flu. However, the previous pandemic flu virus (H1N1) has been available in vaccines and is part of the conventional circulating flu viruses. Bird flu (H5N1) mainly infects birds, but it also infects humans who have close contacts with birds. Individuals should check with their doctors to determine if they are at higher risk of getting severe flu symptoms than the normally healthy population. The flu vaccination will not help prevent the coronavirus infection. You can get the flu and COVID-19 at the same time. Although it may be safe to have a coronavirus vaccine if you already had a flu shot, there is no data and coronavirus vaccines are not yet (9/12/2020) approved by the FDA.

What is flu (influenza)?,"'Influenza, commonly called ""the flu,"" is an illness caused by RNA viruses (''Orthomyxoviridae'' family) that infect the respiratory tract of many animals, birds, and humans. In most people, the infection results in the person getting a ''fever'', ''cough'', ''headache'', and malaise (tired, no energy); some people also may develop a ''sore throat'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. The majority of individuals has flu symptoms for about 1-2 weeks and then recovers with no problems. However, compared with most other viral respiratory infections, such as the ''common cold'', influenza (flu) infection can cause a more severe illness with a mortality rate (death rate) of about 0.1% of people infected with the virus.''The above is the usual situation for the yearly occurring ""conventional"" or ""seasonal"" flu strains. However, there are situations in which some flu outbreaks are severe. These severe outbreaks occur when a portion of the human population is exposed to a flu strain against which the population has little or no immunity because the virus has become altered in a significant way. These outbreaks are usually termed epidemics. Unusually severe worldwide outbreaks (pandemics) have occurred several times in the last hundred years since influenza virus was identified in 1933. By an examination of preserved tissue, the worst influenza pandemic (also termed the Spanish flu or Spanish influenza) occurred in 1918 when the virus caused between 40-100 million deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate estimated to range from 2%-20%.''In April 2009, a new influenza strain against which the world population has little or no immunity was isolated from humans in Mexico. It quickly spread throughout the world so fast that the WHO declared this new flu strain (first termed ''novel H1N1 influenza'"" A swine flu, often later shortened to H1N1 or swine flu) as the cause of a pandemic on June 11, 2009. This was the first declared flu pandemic in 41 years. Fortunately, there was a worldwide response that included vaccine production, good hygiene practices (especially hand washing), and the virus (H1N1) caused far less morbidity and mortality than was expected and predicted. The WHO declared the pandemic's end on Aug. 10, 2010, because it no longer fit into the WHO's criteria for a pandemic.""'Researchers identified a new influenza-related viral strain, H3N2, in 2011, but this strain has caused only about 330 infections with one death in the U.S. Since 2003, researchers identified another strain, H5N1, a bird flu virus, that caused about 650 human infections. This virus has not been detected in the U.S. and easily spreads among people in contrast to other flu strains. Unfortunately, people infected with H5N1 have a high death rate (about 60% of infected people die). Currently, H5N1 does not readily transfer from person to person like other flu viruses.''The most recent data for the mortality (death rates) from influenza rate (death rate) for the United States in 2016 indicates that mortality from influenza varies from year to year. Death rates estimated by the CDC range from about 12,000 during 2011-2012 to 56,000 during 2012-2013. In the 2017-2018 season, deaths reached a new high of about 79,000. The CDC estimates between 24,000-62,000 deaths occurred in the 2019-2020 flu season. Experts suggest that a large percentage of people went unvaccinated or refused to vaccinate family members, causing the increased the number of deaths due to the flu.''Haemophilus influenzae'' is a bacterium incorrectly considered to cause the flu until the virus was demonstrated to be the correct cause in 1933. This bacterium can cause lung infections in infants and young children, and it occasionally causes ear, eye, sinus, joint, and a few other infections, but it does not cause the flu.''Another confusing term is ''stomach flu''. This term refers to a gastrointestinal tract infection, not a ''respiratory infection'' like influenza (flu). Influenza viruses do not cause the stomach flu (''gastroenteritis''). Another name problem is with the condition called swine flu. Swine flu is a ''flu-like'' illness that usually infects pigs, but the term ''swine flu ''was applied to a flu strain that also could infect humans (H1N1). In 2018-19, the pig version of the virus (not infecting humans to date) killed the majority of pigs in China, forcing that country to begin to utilize its emergency stockpile of pork. The viral strain has now been detected in South Korea. ''Although initially symptoms of influenza may mimic those of a ''cold'', influenza is more debilitating with symptoms of ''fatigue'', fever, and respiratory ''congestion''. Colds can be caused by over 100 different virus types, but only influenza viruses (and subtypes) A, B, and C cause the flu. In addition, colds do not lead to life-threatening illnesses like ''pneumonia'', but severe infections with influenza viruses can lead to ''pneumonia'' or even death.' "
Flu vs. cold,"'Compared with most other viral respiratory infections, such as the ''common cold'', influenza (flu) infection usually causes a more severe illness with a mortality rate (death rate) of about 0.1% of people infected with the virus. Cold symptoms (for example, ''sore throat'', ''runny nose'', cough (with possible ''phlegm'' production), congestion, and slight fever) are similar to flu symptoms, but the flu symptoms are more severe, last longer, and may include ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and cough that is often a dry cough.''The following table from the CDC helps to distinguish between a cold and influenza:' "
Flu vs. food poisoning,"'Although some of the symptoms of influenza may mimic those of ''food poisoning'', others do not. Most symptoms of ''food poisoning'' include ''nausea'', vomiting, watery ''diarrhea'', ''abdominal pain'', ''cramps'', and fever. Note that the majority of ''food poisoning symptoms'' are related to the gastrointestinal tract, except for fever. The common flu signs and symptoms include fever but also include symptoms that are not typical for food poisoning, because the flu is a respiratory disease. Consequently, respiratory symptoms of ''nasal congestion'', dry cough, and some ''breathing'' problems help distinguish the flu from food poisoning.' "
What are the causes of the flu (influenza)?,"'Influenza viruses cause the flu and are divided into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza A and influenza B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter and are often associated with increased rates of hospitalization and death. Influenza type C differs from types A and B in some important ways. Type C infection usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all. It does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact of influenza types A and B. Efforts to control the impact of influenza are aimed at types A and B, and the remainder of this discussion will be devoted only to these two types.''Influenza viruses continually change over time, usually by mutation (change in the viral RNA). This constant changing often enables the virus to evade the immune system of the host (humans, birds, and other animals) so that the host is susceptible to changing influenza virus infections throughout life. This process works as follows: A host infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the virus changes, the ""first"" antibody no longer recognizes the ""newer"" virus and infection can occur because the host does not recognize the new flu virus as a problem until the infection is well under way. The first antibody developed may provide partial protection against infection with a new influenza virus. In 2009, almost all individuals had no antibodies that could recognize the novel H1N1 virus immediately.''Type A'"" viruses are divided into subtypes or strains based on differences in two viral surface proteins called the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N). There are at least 16 known H subtypes and nine known N subtypes. These surface proteins can occur in many combinations. When spread by droplets or direct contact, the virus, if not killed by the host's immune system, replicates in the respiratory tract and damages host cells. In people who are immune compromised (for example, ""'pregnant'' women, infants, ''cancer'' patients, ''asthma'' patients, people with pulmonary disease, and many others), the virus can cause viral pneumonia or ''stress'"" the individual's system to make them more susceptible to ""'bacterial infections'', especially bacterial pneumonia. Both pneumonia types, viral and bacterial, can cause severe disease and sometimes death.''Influenza type A viruses undergo two major kinds of changes. One is a series of mutations that occurs over time and causes a gradual evolution of the virus. This is called antigenic ""drift."" The other kind of change is an abrupt change in the hemagglutinin and/or the neuraminidase proteins. This is called antigenic ""shift."" In this case, a new subtype of the virus suddenly emerges. Type A viruses undergo both kinds of changes; influenza type B viruses change only by the more gradual process of antigenic drift and therefore do not cause pandemics.''The 2009 pandemic-causing H1N1 virus was a classic example of antigenic shift. Research showed that novel H1N1 swine flu has an RNA genome that contains five RNA strands derived from various swine flu strains, two RNA strands from bird flu (also termed avian flu) strains, and only one RNA strand from human flu strains. According to the CDC, mainly antigenic shifts over about 20 years led to the development of novel H1N1 flu virus. A diagram that illustrates both antigenic shift and drift (see Figure 2) and features influenza A types H1N1 and bird flu (H5N1), but almost every influenza A viral strain can go through these processes that changes the viral RNA. A recent flu epidemic in India was partially blamed on antigenic drift/shift.' "
When does flu season begin and end?,"""Flu season officially begins in October of each year and extends to May of the following year. According to the CDC, people can follow the development of flu across the United States by following CDC's weekly update of the locations where flu is developing in the U.S. (see the ""'flu map'').' "
What are flu (influenza) symptoms in adults and in children?,"'Typical clinical symptoms of the flu may include''Although ''appetite loss'', nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can sometimes accompany influenza infection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent. The term ""stomach flu"" is a misnomer that some people use to describe gastrointestinal illnesses caused by other microorganisms. H1N1 infections, however, caused more nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea than the conventional (seasonal) flu viruses. Depending upon the severity of the infection, some patients can develop ''swollen lymph nodes'', ''muscle pain'', ''shortness of breath'', severe ''headaches'', ''chest pain'' or chest discomfort, ''dehydration'', and even death.''Most individuals who contract influenza recover in a week or two, however, others develop potentially life-threatening complications like pneumonia. In an average year, influenza is associated with about 36,000 deaths nationwide and many more hospitalizations. Flu-related complications can occur at any age; however, the elderly and people with chronic health problems are much more likely to develop serious complications after the conventional influenza infections than are younger, healthier people. When people ignore or refuse flu vaccination, the death rate increases as shown by the recent higher death rates.'   fever (usually 100 F-103 F in adults and often even higher in children, sometimes with facial flushing and/or sweating), chills, respiratory symptoms such ascough (more often in adults),sore throat (more often in adults),runny or stuffy nose (congestion, especially in children),sneezing, cough (more often in adults), sore throat (more often in adults), runny or stuffy nose (congestion, especially in children), sneezing, headache, muscle aches (body aches), and fatigue, sometimes extreme."
Influenza A virus information,"""As mentioned previously, has hemagglutinin on the viral surface. The viral hemagglutinins have at least 18 types, but these types are broken into two main influenza A virus categories. For example, one of the two main categories include human H1, H2, and avian H5 viruses while the other major category includes human H3 and avian H7 viruses. Researchers in 2016 at UCLA and the University of Arizona discovered that if you were exposed to one of these groups as a child, you had a much better chance of being protected against other viruses in that same group or category later in life. For example, if you are exposed to H2 as a child and then later in life to H2 or H5 viruses, you may have as high as a 75% chance of protection against those H2 and/or H5 strains. But if you are exposed to the other major category that included H3 or H7, you would be much more susceptible to these viral types. The reverse situation would be true if you were exposed as a child to H3 or H7 viruses. The researchers concluded that the immunological imprinting early in life helps determine the response (immune response) to these viral types or categories. Consequently, the first strain of flu that a person is exposed to in childhood likely determines that person's risk in the future for severity of the flu depending upon the exact category of the first viral strain that infects the child. The researchers hope to exploit these new findings in the development of new and more effective flu vaccines."" "
What is the incubation period for the flu?,"'Incubation period for the flu, which means the time from exposure to the flu virus until initial symptoms develop, typically is 1-4 days with an average incubation period of 2 days.' "
How long is the flu contagious?,'The flu is typically contagious about 24-48 hours before symptoms appear (from about the last day of the incubation period) and in normal healthy adults is contagious for another 5-7 days. Children are usually contagious for a little while longer (about 7-10 days). Individuals with severe infections may be contagious as long as symptoms last (about 7-14 days).' 
How long does the flu last?,"'In adults, flu symptoms usually last about 5-7 days, but in children, the symptoms may last longer (about 7-10 days). However, some symptoms such as ''weakness'' and fatigue may gradually wane over several weeks.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose the flu (influenza)?,"""Medical professionals clinically diagnose the flu by evaluating the patient's history of association with people known to have the disease and their symptoms listed above. Usually, a health care professional performs a quick test (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) to see if the patient has an influenza A or B viral infection. Most of the tests can distinguish between A and B types. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or positive for types A or B. If it is positive for type A, the person could have a conventional flu strain or a potentially more aggressive strain such as H1N1. Most of the rapid tests are based on ""'PCR'' technology that identifies the genetic material of the virus. Some rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) can screen for influenza in about 10-30 minutes.'""Swine flu (H1N1) and other influenza strains like bird flu or H3N2 are definitively diagnosed by identifying the particular surface proteins or genetic material associated with the virus strain. In general, this testing is done in a specialized laboratory. However, doctors' offices are able to send specimens to specialized laboratories if necessary."" "
How does flu spread?,"'Flu easily spreads from person to person both directly and indirectly. Human-to-human flu transmission occurs via droplets contaminated with the virus. Produced by coughing, sneezing, or even talking, these droplets land near or in the mouth or the nose of uninfected people, and the disease may spread to them. The disease can spread indirectly to others if contaminated droplets land on utensils, dishes, clothing, or almost any surface that uninfected people then touch. If the infected person touches their nose or mouth, for example, they transfer or spread the disease to themselves or others.' "
What is the key to flu (influenza) prevention?,"""Annual influenza vaccination can prevent most of the illness and death that influenza causes. The CDC's current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued recommendations for everyone 6 months of age and older, who do not have any contraindications to vaccination, to receive a flu vaccine each year.""'Flu vaccine (influenza vaccine made from inactivated and sometimes attenuated [noninfective] virus or virus components) is specifically recommended for those who are at high risk for developing serious complications from influenza infection.''Other simple hygiene methods can reduce or prevent some individuals from getting the flu. For example, avoiding kissing, handshakes, and sharing ''drinks'"" or food with infected people and avoiding touching surfaces like sinks and other items handled by individuals with the flu are good preventive measures. Washing one's hands with soap and water or by using an ""'alcohol''-based hand sanitizer frequently during the day may help prevent the infection. Individuals with the flu should avoid coughing or sneezing on uninfected people; quick hugs are probably okay as long as there is no contact with mucosal surfaces and/or droplets that may contain the virus. Wearing a mask may help reduce your chances of getting the disease, and if you unknowingly or know you have the infection, help to reduce spreading it to others.' "
Are there any nasal spray vaccine or flu shot side effects in adults or in children?,"'Although annual influenza (injectable) vaccination has long been recommended for people in the high-risk groups, many still do not receive the vaccine, often because of their concern about side effects. They mistakenly perceive influenza as merely a nuisance and believe that the vaccine causes unpleasant side effects or that it may even cause the flu. The truth is that influenza vaccine causes no side effects in most people. In the past, patients with egg ''allergy'' had restrictions on getting the vaccine. However, extensive research has indicated that there is not enough egg protein in the vaccine to trigger an immune response, and all the recommendations about ''allergies'' to eggs has been dropped for the 2018-2019 flu season by several organizations that regulate vaccines. The vaccine is not recommended while individuals have active infections or active diseases of the nervous system. Less than one-third of those who receive the vaccine have some soreness at the vaccination site, and about 5%-10% experience mild side effects, such as ''headache'', low-grade fever, or ''muscle cramps'', for about a day after vaccination; some may develop ''swollen lymph nodes''. These side effects are most likely to occur in children who have not been exposed to the influenza virus in the past. The intradermal shots reportedly have similar side effects as the IM shot but are less intense and may not last as long as the IM shot.''Nevertheless, some older people remember earlier influenza vaccines that did, in fact, produce more unpleasant side effects. Vaccines produced from the 1940s to the mid-1960s were not as highly purified as modern influenza vaccines, and it was these impurities that caused most of the side effects. Since the side effects associated with these early vaccines, such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and/or fatigue and malaise, were similar to some of the symptoms of influenza, people believed that the vaccine had caused them to get the flu. However, injectable influenza vaccine produced in the United States has never been capable of causing influenza because it consists of killed virus.''Another type of influenza vaccine (nasal spray) is made with live attenuated (altered) influenza viruses (LAIV). This vaccine is made with live viruses that can stimulate the immune response enough to confer immunity but do not cause classic influenza symptoms (in most instances). The nasal spray vaccine (''FluMist'') was only previously approved for healthy individuals ages 2-49 years of age and was recommended preferentially for healthy children aged 2 through 8 who did not have contraindications to receiving the vaccine. However, this season, the CDC and others report there is no preference expressed for any vaccine over another. The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'"" (AAP) recommends that all children 6 months and older receive a seasonal flu vaccine (some children under the age of 9 will need 2 doses). AAP and others recommend both inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as vaccine options for the 2020-2021 season with no preference for any vaccine type. However, FluMist, a live attenuated vaccine, is recommended for ages 2-49 only. For additional information about vaccines, see https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunizations/Influenza-Implementation-Guidance/Pages/Annual-AAP-Influenza-Policy.aspx or your child's doctor. This nasal spray vaccine contains live attenuated virus (less able to cause flu symptoms due to a designed inability to replicate at normal body temperatures). Side effects of the nasal spray vaccine include nasal congestion, sore throat, and fever. ""'Headaches'', muscle aches, irritability, and malaise have also been noted. In most instances, if side effects occur, they only last a day or two. This nasal spray has been produced for conventional flu viruses and should not be given to pregnant women or anyone who has a medical condition that may compromise the immune system because in some instances the flu may be a side effect.''Some people do not receive influenza vaccine because they believe it is not very effective. There are several different reasons for this belief. People who have received influenza vaccine may subsequently have an illness that is mistaken for influenza, and they believe that the vaccine failed to protect them. In other cases, people who have received the vaccine may indeed have an influenza infection. Overall vaccine effectiveness varies from year to year, depending upon the degree of similarity between the influenza virus strains included in the vaccine and the strain or strains that circulate during the influenza season. Because the vaccine strains must be chosen 9-10 months before the influenza season, and because influenza viruses mutate over time, sometimes mutations occur in the circulating virus strains between the time the vaccine strains are chosen and the next influenza season ends. These mutations sometimes reduce the ability of the vaccine-induced antibody to inhibit the newly mutated virus, thereby reducing vaccine effectiveness. This commonly occurs with the conventional flu vaccines as the specific virus types chosen for vaccine inclusion are based on reasoned projections for the upcoming flu season. Occasionally, the vaccine does not match the actual predominating virus strain and is not very effective in generating a specific immune response to the predominant infecting flu strain.'  "
How effective is the flu vaccine?,"'Vaccine efficacy also varies from one person to another. Past studies of healthy young adults have shown influenza vaccine to be 70%-90% effective in preventing illness. In the elderly and those with certain chronic medical conditions such as ''HIV'', the vaccine is often less effective in preventing illness. Studies show the vaccine reduces hospitalization by about 70% and death by about 85% among the elderly who are not in ''nursing'' homes. Among nursing home residents, vaccine can reduce the risk of hospitalization by about 50%, the risk of pneumonia by about 60%, and the risk of death by 75%-80%. However, these figures did not apply to the 2014-2015 flu vaccine because the quadrivalent (four antigenic types) vaccine did not match well with 2014-2015 circulating strains of the flu (vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be 23%). This occurs because the vaccine needs to be produced months before the flu season begins, so the vaccine is designed by projecting and choosing the most likely viral strains to include in the vaccine. If drift results in changing the circulating virus from the strains used in the vaccine, efficacy may be reduced. However, the vaccine is still likely to lessen the severity of the illness and to prevent complications and death, according to the CDC.' "
"Why 
do people need to get the flu (influenza) vaccine every year?","'Although only a few different influenza virus strains circulate at any given time, people may continue to become ill with the flu throughout their lives. The reason for this continuing susceptibility is that influenza viruses are continually mutating, through the mechanisms of antigenic shift and drift described above. Each year, researchers update the vaccine to include the most current influenza virus strains that are infecting people worldwide. The fact that influenza viral genes continually change is one of the reasons people must get the vaccine every year. Another reason is that antibody produced by the host in response to the vaccine declines over time, and antibody levels are often low one year after vaccination so even if the same vaccine is used, it can act as a booster shot to raise immunity.''Many people still refuse to get flu shots because of misunderstandings, fear, ""because I never get any shots,"" or simply a belief that if they get the flu, they will do well. These are only some of the reasons -- there are many more. The U.S. and other countries\' populations need to be better educated about vaccines; at least they should realize that safe vaccines have been around for many years (''measles'', ''mumps'', ''chickenpox'', and even a vaccine for ''cholera''), and as adults they often have to get a vaccine-like shot to test for ''tuberculosis'' exposure or to protect themselves from ''tetanus''. The flu vaccines are as safe as these vaccines and shots that are widely accepted by the public. Consequently, better efforts need to be made to make yearly flu vaccines as widely acceptable as other vaccines. Susceptible people need to understand that the vaccines afford them a significant chance to reduce or prevent this potentially debilitating disease, hospitalization and, in a few, a lethal flu-caused disease.' "
What are some flu treatments an individual can do at home (home remedies)?,"'First, individuals should be sure they are not members of a high-risk group that is more susceptible to getting severe flu symptoms. Check with a physician if you are unsure if you are a higher-risk person. The CDC recommends home care if a person is healthy with no underlying diseases or conditions (for example, ''asthma'', lung disease, pregnant, or immunosuppressed).''Increasing liquid intake, warm showers, and warm compresses, especially in the nasal area, can reduce the body aches and reduce nasal congestion or head congestion. Nasal strips and humidifiers may help reduce congestion, especially while trying to ''sleep''. Some physicians recommend ''nasal irrigation'' with saline to further reduce congestion; some recommend nonprescription decongestants like pseudoephedrine (''Sudafed''). ''Over-the-counter'' fever-reducing medications like\xa0''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'' and others) can treat a fever. Read labels for safe dosage. Cough drops, over-the-counter cough syrup, or cough medicine that may contain dextromethorphan (''Delsym'') and/or ''guaifenesin'' (''Mucinex'"") can suppress a cough. Notify a doctor if an individual's symptoms at home get worse.""  "
What types of doctors treat the flu?,"'Individuals with mild flu symptoms may not require the care of a physician unless they are a member of a high-risk group as described above. For many individuals, treatment is provided by their primary care physician or provider (including internists or family medicine specialists and physician assistants and other primary caregivers) or pediatrician. Complicated or severe flu infections may require consultation with an emergency-medicine physician, critical care specialist, infectious-disease specialist, and/or a lung specialist (''pulmonologist'').' "
What medications treat the flu?,"'The CDC published the following guidance concerning antiviral drugs:''Antiviral medications with activity against influenza viruses (anti-influenza drugs) are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine in the control of influenza.''The CDC recommended the following antiviral medications for the treatment of influenza (flu) for the 2020-2021 season: oral oseltamivir (''Tamiflu''), inhaled zanamivir (''Relenza''), intravenous peramivir (Rapivab), and oral Baloxavir. ''Over-the-counter medications that may help reduce symptoms of congestion (decongestants), coughing (cough medicine), and ''dehydration'' include ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), acetaminophen (Tylenol), ''NSAIDs'' (Advil, Motrin, ''Aleve''), guaifenesin (Mucinex), dextromethorphan (Delsym), pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), and oral fluids. ''Aspirin'' may be used in adults but not in children.''Antibiotics treat bacterial infections, not viral illnesses like the flu.''Individuals with the flu may also benefit from some additional bed rest, throat lozenges, and possibly nasal irrigation; drinking fluids may help prevent ''symptoms of dehydration'' (for example, dry ''mucus'' membranes and decreased urination).' Influenza antiviral prescription drugs treat influenza or to prevent influenza. Oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. In October 2018 (10/24/2018), the FDA approved a new antiviral drug (baloxavir marboxil [Xofluza]) for flu treatment that prevents viral replication."
What can people eat when they have the flu?,"'While a person has the flu, good ''nutrition'' can help the recovery process. Anyone with the flu needs to avoid dehydration, soothe sore throat and/or ''upset stomach'', and have a good protein intake. Avoid dehydration by maintaining an adequate fluid intake. Sore throat and ''upset stomach'' may be relieved by broths or warm soups (chicken, vegetable, or beef) and plain crackers, toast, and ''ginger'' tea or noncarbonated ginger ale. Scrambled eggs, yogurt, and/or protein drinks are good protein sources. In addition, bananas, rice, and applesauce are food that are often recommended for those with an upset stomach. This list is not exhaustive but should provide a balanced approach to help speed recovery from the flu.' "
When should a person go to the emergency department for the flu?,"'The CDC urges people to seek emergency medical care for a sick child with any of these flu effects (symptoms or signs):'""The following is the CDC's list of symptoms that should trigger emergency medical care for adults:"" Fast breathing or trouble breathing (shortness of breath) Bluish or gray skin color Not drinking enough fluids Severe or persistent vomiting Not waking up or not interacting Being so irritable that the child does not want to be held Flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and cough Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Sudden dizziness Confusion Severe or persistent vomiting Influenza-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough Having a high fever for more than 
3 days is another danger sign, according to the WHO, so the CDC has also included this as another serious symptom."
"Who should receive the flu vaccine, and who has the highest risk factors? When should someone get the flu shot?","'In the United States, the flu season usually occurs from about November until April. Officials have decided each new flu season will start each year on Oct. 4. Typically, activity is very low until December, and peak activity most often occurs between January and March. Ideally, the conventional flu vaccine should be administered between September and mid-November. Flu season typically occurs between October and May. It takes about 1-2 weeks after vaccination for antibodies against influenza to develop and provide protection. The CDC has published a summary list of their current recommendations of who should get the current vaccine.''Updated CDC information and guidance in this report includes the following taken directly from the CDC:''Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications.''A licensed vaccine appropriate for age and health status should be used. Consult package information for age indications.''Emphasis should be placed on vaccination of high-risk groups and their contacts/caregivers. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to (no hierarchy is implied by order of listing):''For more information and details too extensive to include here (for example, vaccine types, scheduled doses, side effects), the following site is recommended: Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) -- United States, 2020-21. ''For additional information: ''MMWR Recomm Rep'' 2020;69(No. RR-8), at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html.'

What is the prognosis for patients who get the flu? What are possible complications of the flu?,"'In general, the majority (about 90%-95%) of people who get the disease feel terrible (see symptoms) but recover with no problems. People with suppressed immune systems historically have worse outcomes than uncompromised individuals; current data suggest that pregnant individuals, children under 2 years of age, young adults, and individuals with any immune compromise or debilitation are likely to have a worse prognosis. Complications of long-term problems from the flu may worsen medical conditions such as asthma, ''congestive heart failure'', and ''diabetes''. Other complications may include ''ear infections'', ''sinus infections'', dehydration, pneumonia, and even death. In most outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics, the mortality rates are highest in the older population (usually above 50 years old). Complications of any flu virus infection, although relatively rare, may resemble severe viral pneumonia or the ''SARS'' (''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' caused by a coronavirus strain) outbreak in 2002-2003, in which the disease spread to about 10 countries with over 7,000 cases, over 700 deaths, and had a 10% mortality rate. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a rare immune disorder that can result in weakness or ''paralysis'', may occur after having the flu or very rarely, after vaccination against the flu (estimated by the CDC to be about one person per every million people vaccinated).' "
Can the flu be deadly?,"'Yes. However, associated deaths per year depend upon the virulence of the particular strain of virus that is circulating. That means for any given year, the likelihood of dying from the flu varies according to the specific infecting viruses. For example, from 1976-2007 (the most reliable available data according to the CDC), deaths associated with the flu range from a low of about 3,000 per year to a high of about 49,000 per year. The CDC estimates about 36,000 deaths/year (average) in the U.S. in recent years, but these may increase if vaccination rates continue to fall. The 1918 influenza pandemic (1918-1919) was estimated to cause 20-50 million deaths worldwide.' "
What is the bird (avian) flu?,"'The bird flu, also known as avian influenza and H5N1, is an infection caused by avian influenza A. Bird flu can infect many bird species, including domesticated birds such as chickens. In most cases, the disease is mild; however, some subtypes can be pathogenic and rapidly kill birds within 48 hours. These bird viruses rarely infect humans. People who get infected with bird flu usually have direct contact with the infected birds or their waste products. Depending on the viral type, the infections can range from mild influenza to severe respiratory problems or death. Human infection with bird flu is rare but frequently fatal. More than half of those people infected (over 650 infected people) have died (current estimates of the mortality [death] rates in humans is about 60%). Fortunately, this virus does not seem to be easily passed from person to person. The major concern among scientists and physicians about bird flu is that it will change (mutate) its viral RNA enough to be easily transferred among people and produce a pandemic similar to the one of 1918. There have been several isolated instances where a person had been reported to get avian flu in 2010; the virus was detected in South Korea (three human cases), resulting in a quarantine of two farms, and in 2012, over 10,000 turkeys died in a H5N1 outbreak with no human infections recorded. Recent research suggests that some people may have had exposure to H5N1 in their past but had either mild or no symptoms.''In addition, researchers, in an effort to understand what makes an animal or bird flu become easily transmissible to humans, developed a bird flu strain that is likely easily transmitted from person to person. Although it exists only in research labs, there is controversy about both the synthesis and the scientific publication of how this potentially highly pathogenic strain was created.' "
Do antiviral agents protect people from the flu?,"'Vaccination is the primary method for control of influenza; however, antiviral agents have a role in the prevention and treatment of mainly influenza type A infection. Regardless, antiviral agents should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for vaccination. Most effectiveness of these drugs is reported to occur if the antivirals are given within the first 48 hours after infection; some researchers maintain there is little or no solid evidence these drugs can protect people from getting the flu so some controversies exist regarding these agents.' "
Is it safe to get a flu shot that contains thimerosal?,"'Thimerosal is a preservative that contains mercury and is used in multidose vials of conventional flu vaccines to prevent contamination when the vial is repeatedly used to extract the vaccine. Although thimerosal is being phased out as a vaccine preservative, it is still used in flu vaccines in low levels. There is no data that indicates thimerosal in these vaccines has caused ''autism'' or other problems in individuals. However, flu vaccine that is produced for single use (not a multidose vial) contains no thimerosal; however, these vials are not as readily available to doctors and likely cost more to produce. Consequently, the FDA has published these two questions with clear answers that are quoted below:''However, as stated above, the FDA goes on to say that single-dose vial of conventional and other flu vaccines will not contain the preservative thimerosal, so that if a person wants to avoid the thimerosal, they can ask for vaccine that comes in a single-dose vial. The nasal spray vaccine contains no thimerosal, but it is not recommended for use in pregnant women. The CDC further states, that after numerous studies, there is no established link between flu shots with or without thimerosal and ''autism''.' "
Where can people find additional information about the flu?,"'During a flu pandemic, guidelines and situations can change rapidly. People are advised to be aware that several sources are available to them to keep current with developments. The web sites below are frequently updated, especially when a pandemic is declared. The first web site contains an update written for the public and caregivers; the government and WHO sites provide detailed information that are updated as guidelines and developments occur.''http://www.who.int/topics/influenza/en/''http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/''http://www.fda.gov/' "
Will the flu shot help fight the coronavirus?,"'Coronavirus (''SARS''-CoV-2) is the cause of the current pandemic of ''COVID-19''. This virus is different from the flu viruses, and there is no data suggesting a flu vaccine (shot) will protect you from getting ''COVID-19''. However, flu vaccines reduce the chances of getting the flu.' "
Can you get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time?,"'It is possible to get the flu and COVID-19 at the same time. There is little or no data available to determine how often such concurrent infections may happen.''Unfortunately, to date (9/12/2020), all coronavirus vaccines are still undergoing testing and are not yet approved for use by the FDA. However, there is no current information that suggests that getting a flu shot will cause any coronavirus vaccine to be unsafe to take. It is possible that taking the shots for both at the same time may reduce the immune response of one or both. Other studies seem likely to produce an answer.' "
Facts you should know about the influenza vaccine (flu shot)," Types of influenza (flu) vaccines include the injection (killed virus), recombinant (made without flu virus), and nasal spray vaccines (containing live virus). Each year, influenza viruses change slightly, making the seasonal vaccine used in previous years ineffective. The vaccine is generally effective against the influenza virus within two weeks of administration. The vaccine is only effective against the strains of the virus that match the vaccine. The seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness is dependent upon the extent of the match between the virus strains used to prepare the vaccine and those viruses in actual circulation in the community. The age and health status of the individual also play a role in determining the vaccine effectiveness."
What is influenza (flu)?,"'The flu (or common flu) is a viral infection that spreads from person to person in secretions of the nose and ''lungs'', for example when ''sneezing''. Medically, the common flu is another name for influenza. Flu is a ''respiratory infection'', that is, an infection that develops primarily in the lungs. People often call respiratory infections caused by other viruses the flu, but this is incorrect. These other infections are usually categorized as URIs (upper respiratory infections) and have multiple causes. Influenza usually causes higher ''fever'', more malaise, and severe body aches than other respiratory infections. Although other viruses may cause these ''flu-like symptoms'', they do so less frequently.''Influenza viruses are divided scientifically into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter. Influenza type C usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact of influenza types A and B. ''Type A'' viruses are divided into subtypes and are named based on differences in two viral surface proteins called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 16 known H subtypes and nine known N subtypes.''The flu is a common illness. The CDC reports for the 2018/2019 influenza season show that in the United States''The so-called ''swine flu'' pandemic of 2009 was caused by a novel influenza A virus designated ''H1N1'' based upon its surface protein types. This virus was originally referred to as swine flu because many of the genes in this new virus were very similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. However, this virus was actually quite different from the typical swine flu viruses found in pigs.' 5%-20% of the population gets the flu, nearly 500,000 people are hospitalized from flu-related complications, about 34,000 people die from the flu or its complications."
Why vaccinate for the flu?,"'The flu is highly infectious and is a potentially serious viral ''respiratory infection'' that can even be life threatening. Whereas with other viral respiratory infections the symptoms usually are mild and most people can continue working or going to school while ill, with the flu, the symptoms are severe and prolonged and cause individuals to miss days of work or school. The infection stresses the body. In addition, superinfections may occur as a complication of the flu. Superinfections are ''bacterial infections'' that occur on top of a respiratory infection. Bacterial respiratory infections also are a serious type of infection, and the simultaneous viral and bacterial infection can overwhelm the function of the lungs and the body. Among the elderly and the very young, it can cause death. Because of its infectiousness, morbidity (severity of symptoms and time lost from work or school), and the potential for death, it is important to prevent the flu by influenza vaccination. Although there are medications to treat the flu, they are expensive, not as effective as influenza vaccination, and need to be started within 24-48 hours of the start of symptoms.'  "
What are the different types of flu vaccines?,"'Flu ''vaccines'' are routinely available for seasonal influenza. Pandemic vaccines may also be developed for specific strains of the flu virus that cause widespread disease, such as occurred with the H1N1 virus in 2009.''Each year, composition of the influenza viruses changes, making the vaccine used in previous years ineffective. Each year, a new vaccine must be prepared that will be effective against the types of influenza virus that are expected to circulate in the upcoming influenza season. These are known as seasonal flu vaccines. The reason for the differences in circulating strains of the flu virus is that the virus can mutate (or change its structure) rapidly, leading to new subtypes of the virus. The key is to be able to predict which influenza viruses are going to cause infection and to prepare a vaccine against those viruses. Usually, scientists can predict accurately which types of influenza virus will cause infections and prepare an appropriate vaccine. Typically, the viruses used to prepare flu vaccine are grown in eggs, but a newer, egg-free version of the vaccine has been developed. In 2017, updated guidelines from the Influenza Vaccine and Egg ''Allergy'' Practice Parameter Workgroup commissioned by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) stated that the risk is so small that even asking patients about egg ''allergy'' is no longer necessary. Health care professionals can now safely administer flu vaccines to people who are ''allergic'' to eggs. Flu viruses may also be made using recombinant technology that does not involve growing the actual flu virus in eggs.''The vaccine is generally effective against the influenza virus within two weeks of administration. The vaccine is only effective against the strains of the virus that match the vaccine. These strains vary from flu season to flu season each year. This is the reason that revaccination is required annually with the vaccine that matches the strains of influenza that are currently prevalent.''Flu vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, meaning that it contains killed influenza virus, or a recombinant vaccine, meaning that it was made without using virus particles at all. Health care providers inject the vaccine into muscles or skin, stimulating the immune system to produce an immune response (antibodies) to the influenza virus.''Medical professionals administer the ""flu shot"" vaccine as a single dose of liquid injected through the skin into muscle (intramuscular or IM). Typically, health care professionals inject the flu vaccine into the deltoid muscle at the side of the arm, using ''alcohol'' rubbed over the skin for sterilization. Health care professionals administer the vaccine annually, each fall. Side effects of the flu vaccine are uncommon.''Two types of vaccines are available: a trivalent vaccine that targets three strains of flu virus, as well as a quadrivalent vaccine that targets four strains. Both the trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are available as an intramuscular injection. Special vaccines preparations are available for people over 65 years of age that produce a stronger immune response.''The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends the use of injectable influenza vaccines (either trivalent or quadrivalent, including inactivated influenza vaccines and recombinant influenza vaccines) or the nasal spray vaccine for the influenza season of 2019-20.''The nasal-spray flu vaccine (sometimes called LAIV for live attenuated influenza vaccine, brand name ''FluMist'') was first licensed in 2003. It is directed against the same strains of virus as the flu shot but differs in that it contains weakened live influenza viruses instead of killed viruses and is administered by nasal spray instead of injection. The vaccine is termed an attenuated vaccine because the vaccine viruses are weakened so that they themselves do not cause severe ''flu symptoms''. The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for use in non-''pregnant'' individuals 2-49 years old. It should not be used for people with certain underlying medical conditions. All LAIV are quadrivalent (four-component).''The live viruses in the nasal-spray vaccine are weakened so that they do not cause severe symptoms. However, mild symptoms can occur as a side effect of the vaccination. Side effects of the nasal-spray flu vaccine can includedrunny nose, ''headache'', ''sore throat'', and ''cough''. Children who receive the vaccine may also develop mild ''fever'' and muscle aches.' "
What flu viruses does the flu vaccine protect against?,"'Flu vaccines are developed each year and are designed to protect against the influenza viruses that are predicted to be the most common during the upcoming season. Some vaccines contain three viral strains (trivalent), while others contain four virus types (quadrivalent).' "
How does the flu vaccine work to prevent the flu?,"'The flu vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce of antibodies in the body that fight the particular flu virus in the vaccination. When the virus enters a vaccinated person, the antibodies attack and kill the virus and prevent infection. Antibodies are produced against the specific strains of the virus contained in the yearly vaccine.''Flu vaccination does not protect against infection caused by microbes other than the influenza virus.' "
Will the flu vaccine help fight the coronavirus?,"'The coronavirus (''SARS''-CoV-2) and influenza are two different illnesses caused by different viruses. The flu shot will not help fight coronavirus infection, but getting a flu shot remains an important step in protecting your health and in reducing the overall burden of respiratory illness in the community. Having enough people vaccinated against the flu ensures that hospitals and clinics keep adequate space to treat patients with coronavirus infections. It is expected that both the coronavirus and the flu may be present at the same time in the 2020-21 flu season, and being vaccinated against the flu helps protect yourself and vulnerable populations against an illness that might happen at the same time as a coronavirus infection.' "
Can you get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time?,"'According to the CDC, ""While it\'s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the fall and winter (of 2020-21), CDC believes it\'s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes ''COVID-19'' will both be spreading. In this context, getting a flu vaccine will be more important than ever."" There is no evidence to suggest that it is not possible to have both diseases at the same time.' "
Is it safe to have a coronavirus vaccine if you already had a flu vaccine?,"'There is no coronavirus vaccine currently available, but vaccine developers are working to ensure development of a vaccine that is safe for everyone, including those who have had flu shots. Currently in the absence of a coronavirus vaccine, it is especially important for the 2020-21 flu season to receive a flu shot for its overall health benefits.' "
When should one receive the flu vaccine?,'Health care professionals recommend getting the influenza vaccination before flu season begins in your community. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to produce a sufficient antibody response against the flu. Flu season can begin in October and last as late as May.' 
Who should receive the flu vaccine?,"'The CDC recommends that every individual over 6 months of age receive the seasonal flu vaccine. While everyone should get a vaccination, it is particularly important for some groups. Vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications if they get the flu, such as those with ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', and chronic lung disease as well as pregnant women and those over 65 years of age. It is also important for caregivers to get ''vaccinations'', in addition to those who live with people in these risk groups.' "
Who should not receive the flu vaccine?,"'Those who should avoid the flu vaccine include the following:' People who have ever had a severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine People with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS) that occurred after receiving influenza vaccine and who are not at risk for severe illness from influenza should generally not receive vaccine. People under 65 years of age should not receive the high-dose flu shot. If you are sick with a fever when you go to get your flu shot, you should talk to your doctor or nurse about whether or not you should get your shot later. However, you can get a flu shot at the same time you have a respiratory illness without fever or if you have another mild illness."
What are flu vaccine risks and side effects? Can the flu vaccine give me the flu?,"'Serious side effects of the flu vaccine are uncommon. Side effects of the injection vaccine include soreness at the site of the injection, muscle aching, fever, and feeling unwell. Very rarely, people have reported serious allergic reactions. The viruses in the nasal spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms; they cannot cause you to get the flu. Side effects from the nasal spray may include ''runny nose'', mild fever, ''sore throat'', ''cough'', muscle aches, ''headache'', and ''vomiting''.''Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an illness characterized by fever, nerve damage, and muscle ''weakness''. In 1976, vaccination with the swine flu vaccine was associated with development of GBS. Studies have evaluated if other flu vaccines were associated with GBS, with only one of the studies showing an association. That single study suggested that one person out of 1 million vaccinated people may be at risk of GBS associated with the vaccine.'

What should I do about adverse reactions to the flu vaccine?,'You should contact your health care professional in the case of any serious side effects. Mild side effects such as soreness at the injection site typically resolve on their own without treatment.' 
How effective is the flu vaccine (flu shot)?,"'The effectiveness of the flu vaccine is dependent upon the extent of the match between the virus strains used to prepare the vaccine and those viruses in actual circulation. The age and health status of the individual also play a role in determining the effectiveness of the vaccine. While vaccine effectiveness can vary, recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40%-60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are similar to those used in the vaccines. Similar reductions in the number of people hospitalized with the flu have also been observed. Rates of flu prevention may be even higher in healthy adults under 65 years of age.' "
What was the novel H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine?,"'The H1N1 vaccine was a pandemic vaccine designed to provide immunity against the novel H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, initially referred to as swine flu. Initially, health care providers gave the H1N1 vaccine to those at highest risk for complications of this illness (children, pregnant women, caregivers of children). Even though the virus proved not to be as deadly as expected, researchers suggest the H1N1 vaccine was effective in reducing the effects of this flu virus.' "
What is the best way to locate a flu vaccine clinic?,"""People can obtain flu shots through a health care professional's office, at community health departments, and at many pharmacies. Additionally, many employers and schools host flu shot clinics. Some employers may offer the vaccine free of charge. A health care professional's office should be able to provide information about flu shot clinics available in the community."" "
Introduction,'You have been informed by your healthcare provider that you will need to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of a medication to treat your health condition. ''The treatment for many conditions relies on medications administered by IV infusion therapy.' 
How do I prepare for the infusion?,"'Below are a few helpful suggestions to help you create a pleasant and healing experience. ''Check with your healthcare practitioner or the staff at the infusion center for any pre-infusion instructions. Some examples may include: '   The first and most important step is to replace confusion with confidence.  Make a list of questions that pertain to your health condition or questions about your medication and infusion to review with your healthcare practitioner. It may be necessary to make an appointment to review all of your questions.  Learn about the infused medication. There are many places to obtain information about your medication. Discuss the medication(s) with your doctor. Pharmaceutical companies often provide information in the offices and on the Internet for patients and their families. There may also be medical books written about your medication or health condition.  Visit the Infusion Center and meet the medical staff before your first infusion.  Drink plenty of water to be sure you are well hydrated. If you have a heart condition, kidney condition or any other health condition that prevents you from drinking large amounts of fluid, check with your healthcare practitioner for instructions on how to hydrate before your infusion procedure. Some infusions may require that you pre-medicate with medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Check with the infusion staff regarding any pre-medications you need to take prior to your infusion, the dose, and the best time to take the medications.  Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes. You will want to be comfortable, and most likely your vital signs will monitored (for example, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate (breathing rate), or a cardiac monitor may be attached to your chest). Every infusion center is different, so check with yours in regard to what to expect. Wearing loose fitting clothes allows the medical staff to easily and properly monitor your vital signs.  Consider wearing clothing with layers to allow for temperature control. The temperature of the infusion center may be cool or warm; also some intravenous infusions can make you feel either warm or cool. Having layers of clothing allows you the flexibility to easily control your comfort zone.  Most infusion centers will provide blankets, pillows, water and coffee. Check to see what the center provides in case they do not offer something that will make you more comfortable.  Do not wear any fragrance or perfume, other patients may be allergic. Bring a complete list of current medications, allergies, and emergency contact information for the infusion staff to add to your chart."
What are some things I can do to pass the time while receiving therapy?,"'Things to take or do:''PLEASE DO NOT TALK ON YOUR CELL PHONE'' - Place your phone on vibrate mode or turn it off. This is not a time for talking on the phone (unless you have an OK from the infusion staff).''Arrive at the infusion center with a:'  Book Magazine Newspaper Crossword puzzle or Suduko game Hand held games - (if they are quiet or have headphones) Bring your own music (I-pod or MP3 player) A neck pillow - the type used on airplanes Pictures of your family or loved ones Study for that upcoming test Bring your computer and get some work done, watch a movie, or play games. Snacks and a drink (if allowed in the infusion room) Bring paper and pen - make a list of things you need to do Write a letter -a letter of encouragement - of love - of thanks. Catch up on paper work Plan a party Make your shopping list Knit Crochet Draw or doodle Plan a trip Take a nap Pray Meditate Smile Positive attitude (you are in good hands). Personal affirmation - Find one that feels good and energizes you. For example: ""I have the perfect medicine...at the perfect time...I am healing."" Sit back and relax"
What happens during and after the infusion?,"'Be confident that you are receiving excellent care!' Ask questions and notify the staff immediately if you are not feeling ""right"" or have a concern.  Consider talking with someone in the Infusion Center receiving treatment. They may have some advice about their health condition that will help you. You may meet a new friend.  After your infusion is completed, ask for any important post infusion instructions. You may need to take post-infusion medications. Check with your healthcare practitioner or the infusion staff for detailed instructions.  A dressing will be placed in the area where your infusion was done. This dressing should be kept in place for at least 30 minutes or longer. If you are on a blood thinner, leave the dressing in place longer to avoid any bleeding. Check with the staff at the Infusion Center in regard to the length of time necessary to keep the dressing in place.  If you have an allergy to tape, inform the infusion staff (advise them of all allergies).  Obtain a phone number to call in the event that you have any questions or possible side effects to the medication you receive (such as a fever or rash) after your infusion has been completed. "

What is an ingrown hair?,"'An ingrown hair happens when the sharp tip of the hair curls back or grows sideways into the skin of the ''hair follicle''. It is a benign condition, which usually appears as a small tan or sometimes pink bump under the skin. Often, a small pinpoint (often dark) part of the underlying hair may be seen under the ''skin bump''. In severe cases, multiple small red or pink little ''bumps'' at hair follicles may be seen on any skin area that normally grows hair.''An ingrown hair is a very common skin condition occurring primarily after ''puberty''. Ingrown hairs tend to be more common in areas with coarse hairs, like the bikini area in women, and beard and neck in men. Individuals with thicker, tightly curled hairs, such as African Americans, tend to have the highest rate of problems with ingrown hairs, particularly of the beard area. Rarely, an ingrown hair may also appear in other skin parts, such as the ''eyelid'' or thighs. An ingrown hair is medically harmless, yet it may become cosmetically disfiguring and lead to scarring, skin discoloration (referred to as post-inflammatory ''hyperpigmentation''), ''skin infection'', and rarely ''keloid'' ''scar'' formation.'  "
What causes an ingrown hair?," Hair that is cut close to or below the follicular opening may have a sharp tip that can pierce the skin to cause an ingrown hair. Improper shaving techniques are the major cause of ingrown hairs. Other hair-removal methods, including waxing, as well as common friction from tight clothing, may worsen the situation. Although an ingrown hair is primarily caused by improper or aggressive hair removal, it sometimes occurs naturally as too much dead skin debris blocks the hair follicle opening, causing the hair to grow sideways."
Who develops ingrown hairs?,"'Nearly everyone will have an ingrown hair at some time. Overall, teenagers and adults are more prone to ingrown hairs. African-American individuals with thicker, coarser tightly curling hairs tend to have the highest rate of problems with ingrown hairs.' "
What are symptoms and signs of an ingrown hair?,"   Symptoms include itch and tenderness. An ingrown hair can lead to a localized foreign-body inflammatory reaction, which causes the pinpoint red or pink bumps on the skin. Some of the bumps may be slightly red or have an accompanying light-red halo indicating inflammation. Sometimes, the curled hair can be barely visible at the center of the bump. Small pustules or dry red bumps are often scattered over an area that has been shaved recently. Often the bumps start a few days to weeks after hair removal and get worse as the hairs grow back. Pustules may be a sign of folliculitis due to the infection with common skin bacteria, such as Staphylococcus."
Are ingrown hairs the same as razor bumps or pseudofolliculitis?,"'One type of ingrown hair is pseudofolliculitis, also called ""''razor bumps'',"" in which small red bumps appear on the beard area (lower face and neck) and may flare with repeat shaving. ''Razor bumps'' are commonly experienced by African-American men, especially those who shave frequently. Flesh-colored red bumps with a hair shaft in their center are seen in shaved areas adjacent to the hair follicle opening. Pustules and abscesses may occasionally form, especially if there are bacteria on the skin. In chronic or inadequately treated situations, post-inflammatory ''hyperpigmentation'', scarring, and rare ''keloid'"" formation may occur. This skin condition is mostly seen in darker skin or African skin with facial hair because of the curvature of these patients' hair follicles."" "
What is the treatment for an ingrown hair?,"'Although an ingrown hair can heal on its own and spontaneously dislodge, in some cases, it may be tough to get rid of it. Available treatments include''Best results may be achieved with combination therapy. Consulting a medical doctor who specializes in dermatology may be necessary for the optimal treatment of more severe cases.''Chemical depilatories like Neet or Nair can loosen the structure of hair, resulting in blunt tips of shaved hairs at the follicular opening. Chemical depilatories may be used every second or third day rather than every day to avoid chemical irritation on the skin. Hydrocortisone cream can be applied to alleviate the irritation caused by chemical depilatories.''Tretinoin'' (''Retin A'') cream can help decrease skin plugging or hyperkeratosis. Topical ''tretinoin'' cream may thin out the ''epidermis'', reduce the buildup of dead skin cells, and decrease hair embedding into the follicles. Topical ''corticosteroid'' creams are applied to reduce inflammation of inflamed ingrown hairs.''Topical and oral antibiotics may be required for severe cases that form pustules and abscesses, which indicate secondary infection. Topical antibiotics, including ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, Ilosone) and ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin''), topical antibacterial agents, such as ''benzoyl peroxide'' (Persa-Gel), and the combinations of topical antibiotics and antibacterial agent, can help reduce the growth of skin bacteria and treat secondary infection. Oral antibiotics, such as ''tetracycline'' (Sumycin) or ''cephalexin'' (''Keflex'', Keftabs), are used to control infected pustules or ''abscess'' formation. Antibacterial washes, such as ''benzoyl peroxide'' (Clearasil, Proactiv) or chlorhexidine (Hibiclens), can be used once or twice a day to control the infection. Topical ''eflornithine'' HCl 13.9% cream (''Vaniqa'') is a prescription that can reduce the rate of hair growth when applied to the skin twice a day over one to two months. Hence, it can be useful as long-term therapy in individuals with excessive facial hair or patients who have pseudofolliculitis barbae.''For skin discoloration, prescribed fading creams such as hydroquinone 4% (''Eldoquin''), kojic acid, azelaic acid 15%-20%, or ''over-the-counter'' fading creams with 2% hydroquinone can help improve any residual or persistent discoloration.''Laser hair removal may be an option for preventing ingrown hairs. Laser treatments applied to an area help to permanently decrease the number of hairs. Currently, laser removal works primarily on dark hairs only. Laser hair removal is generally very fast, efficient, and safe. Laser treatment risks include skin discoloration.''Electrolysis'' may be used to permanently remove hairs. This procedure targets individual hair follicles and can be performed on any color of skin and any size and color of hair. The destruction of hair follicles is permanent. ''Electrolysis'' is often slow, tedious, and requires multiple treatments.'   chemical depilatories, improved shaving techniques, topical antibiotics if infected, medical removal of the ingrown hair by small incision and pulling out the hair, and hair-removal laser."
Are there any home remedies for an ingrown hair?,"'Although no cure exists, it is possible to decrease the occurrence of ingrown hairs. The easiest way to do this is through proper hair and skin hygiene.'   Hydrate and soften both the skin and the hair before shaving. This can result in a duller, rounded tip to the hair, which decreases the likelihood for hairs to reenter the skin. Use a moistened washcloth, a wet sponge, or a soft-bristled toothbrush with a mild soap to wash the beard or hair for several minutes via a circular motion to help dislodge stubborn tips. Some natural mild exfoliators, such as salt and sugar, can be applied to treat the redness or irritation that comes with the ingrown hair. Do not shave against the direction or grain of the hair growth. Avoid shaving too closely to the skin. When using electric razors, some shaving techniques may help prevent ingrown hair. Keep the head of the electric razor slightly off the surface of the skin and shave in a slow, circular motion. Pressing the razor too close to the skin or pulling the skin taut can result in too close of a shave. Leave very short 1 mm-2 mm stubble with shaving to help reduce the tendency of shaving too closely. These shaving techniques can avoid creating a sharp tip when shaving and prevent hair from reentering the skin by leaving slightly longer stubble. Another way to prevent ingrown hairs is by avoiding shaving and allowing hair to grow naturally."
Do ingrown hairs affect the entire body?,"'Ingrown hairs most characteristically involve areas that are shaved, like the beard, bikini area, and legs. Other common locations of ingrown hairs include the face, neck, thighs, and buttocks. Although possible, it is rare to have ingrown hairs all over the body. Ingrown hairs do not affect the mouth, palms, vagina, or soles of the ''feet'', as there are no hair follicles in these locations.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose an ingrown hair?,"'The diagnosis of ingrown hair is typically very straightforward and based on the skin appearance. In some cases, a small ''skin biopsy'' may be used to help the doctor confirm the diagnosis. Other times, a skin bacterial culture may be taken by a cotton-tip applicator to assist in determining an infectious cause. A few other medical conditions may look just like ingrown hairs and need to be examined more closely by a physician specializing in conditions of the skin called a dermatologist.' "
Does diet have anything to do with ingrown hairs?,"'Overall, ''diet'' does not seem to affect ingrown hairs.' "
What else could an ingrown hair look like?,"'Other medical conditions can mimic ingrown hairs. Some possible look-alike ''skin conditions'' include''Less common mimickers include''Folliculitis'' of ingrown hairs may also resemble uncommon ''skin conditions'' like' folliculitis, keratosis pilaris, acne, cyst, abscess (furuncle), milia (whiteheads), eczema, impetigo, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, heat rash (miliaria), or dry skin (xerosis). chickenpox, herpes, pustular psoriasis, molluscum contagiosum, viral warts, Fox-Fordyce disease, Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome, pruritic papular eruption of HIV disease, and erythema toxicum neonatorum. lichen spinulosus, pityriasis rubra pilaris, phrynoderma (vitamin A deficiency), ulerythema ophryogenes, ichthyosis vulgaris, eruptive vellus hair pseudofolliculitis barbae, erythromelanosis follicularis faciei et colli, keratosis follicularis (Darier disease), Kyrle disease, lichen nitidus, lichen spinulosus, perforating folliculitis, and trichostasis spinulosa."
Is it possible to prevent ingrown hairs?," The simplest way to prevent ingrown hairs is to allow hair to grow without cutting it too short. Shaving and waxing can cause or exacerbate ingrown hairs. The shaving techniques described above can be applied to prevent or decrease the occurrence of ingrown hairs. Topical hair-growth-inhibitor cream eflornithine (Vaniqa), electrolysis, or hair-removal lasers can also effectively help decrease ingrown hairs."
What are ingrown toenails?,"'An ingrown toenail (onychocryptosis) is caused by the pressure from the ingrowth of the nail edge into the skin of the toe. Once the edge of the nail breaks through the skin, it produces inflammation. Initially presenting as a minor discomfort, it may progress into an infection in the adjacent skin (''cellulitis'') and/or become a reoccurring problem. Ingrown toenails most commonly affect the large (great) toes.'  "
What causes ingrown toenails?,"'An imbalance between the size of the nail and the enlargement of the nail skin edge causes ingrown toenails. This condition can be exacerbated by improper trimming of the toenail, an ''inherited'"" or hereditary condition, and improper shoe fitting. Injury by overly aggressive pedicures and nail picking are also common causes. Some people's toenails naturally curl inward (known as pincer nails). These toenails can easily become painful. Adolescents and athletes perspire more often. This causes nails and skin to be soft. The thin nail can eventually split and pierce the softened skin.""  "
Are some people more prone to ingrown toenails?,"'There are a number of risk factors that may predispose a person to having an ingrown toenail. The following are some of the more common:' Athletics, particularly stop and start sports such as tennis, soccer, and basketball Improper shoe gear that is either too small or too large Repetitive pressure or trauma to the feet Poor foot hygiene Abnormal gait and poor foot mechanics such as pronation Foot or toe deformities, such as bunions, hammertoes, and flat foot Congenital toenail deformity Abnormally long toes Obesity Diabetes Heart, kidney, and thyroid problems, which may cause foot and leg swelling Fungus infection of the nails (onychomycosis) Arthritis Bony or soft-tissue tumors of the toes Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating of the feet) Edema of the lower extremities"
Which nails are most commonly affected by ingrown toenails?,"'Ingrown toenails most commonly occur in the large or ""great toes."" Those great toes that are shorter than the second toes are even more prone to ingrown toenails. However, any of the toenails can be affected on either border or side.' "
What causes infections in ingrown toenails?,"'The warm, moist environment of the feet can be a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. These commonly include ''Staphylococcus'', ''Pseudomonas'', dermatophytes, ''Candida'', and ''Trichophyton''. When there is a break in the skin from the offending nail border, these organisms can invade the area and cause an infection. Treatment for these infections is essential to maintain healthy toenails and feet. The medical term for infected ingrown toenail is called ''paronychia''. If not treated, the infected toenail can cause serious problems such as ''chronic pain'' and disfigurement, cellulitis, and bone infection.' "
What are ingrown toenail symptoms and signs?,"'Ingrown toenail symptoms and signs include redness, ''pain'', and swelling. Sometimes there may be a clear yellowish drainage, or if it becomes infected, ''pus drainage''. Young children may show signs of ''limping'' in order to avoid putting pressure at the ingrown toenail site. Occasionally, ingrown toenails resolve without treatment. A podiatrist should treat painful, persistent, and recurring ingrown toenails. If the ingrown toenail has been present for a long time, a very vascular tissue called granulation tissue may form that easily bleeds.' "
How do physicians diagnose an ingrown toenail?,"'The diagnosis of an ingrown toenail is typically straightforward and does not require diagnostic labs or images. However, the signs and symptoms of ingrown toenails can vary quite dramatically, particularly if an infection develops. There may simply be some tenderness at the nail border when pressure is applied. There is typically an incurvation of the nail or a spike of nail (spicule) pressing into the skin of the nail border. Associated redness and swelling localized to the nail also suggest the diagnosis of an ingrown toenail. When an infection is involved, there may be severe redness and swelling, drainage, pus, and malodor.''Making the proper diagnosis requires taking into account the medical history and all possible causative factors. If one is unsure, seek professional help. Some conditions such as tumors, foreign bodies, trauma, and fungal infection may appear to be an ingrown toenail to the untrained eye.' "
What are possible complications of ingrown toenails?,"'A persisting ingrown toenail can have serious consequences. A localized infection of the nail border (paronychia) can progress to a deeper soft-tissue infection (cellulitis), which can in turn progress to a bone infection (''osteomyelitis''). Complications can include scarring of the surrounding skin and nail borders (nail fold hypertrophy) as well as thickened, deformed (onychodystrophy) fungal toenails (''onychomycosis''). Sometimes, there is an enlargement of soft tissue at the nail fold that easily bleeds and drains.' "
Are there any home remedies for an ingrown toenail?,"'The following home remedies may provide temporary relief.''If symptoms persist, seek medical treatment from a podiatrist.'   Lukewarm water foot soaks for 15-20 minutes with any one of the following options can be helpful: one part white vinegar to four parts water; 2 tablespoons Epsom salts per quart of water; or a dilute Clorox type bleach with 1/3 teaspoon of Clorox in 1 gallon of water. Gently massage the affected skin area downward while soaking. Elevate the foot and leg. Take oral anti-inflammatory medications. Apply antibacterial ointments on the affected side of the nail. Trim the toenail straight across the top without digging into the corners or leaving them too short. Carefully rolling back the overgrown skin at the affected nail border may allow you to slip a small piece of cotton or dental floss to lift the offending edge of the nail up from the skin. Wait for the nail to outgrow while attempting any one of the above methods."
When should someone seek medical treatment for an ingrown toenail?,"'People with ''diabetes'' or those who have a compromised immune system or poor circulation should promptly seek the care of a podiatrist/physician for ingrown toenail treatment even if the symptoms appear mild. If home remedies are not successful within a week or there is persistent ''pain'' and/or signs of infection, seek podiatric medical treatment. Symptoms and signs of infection can include:' Swelling Redness Streaking (redness spreading from the toe to middle of the foot) Pain Malodor Drainage that may be yellow, green, or white and purulent (containing pus)"
What kind of doctor treats ingrown toenails?,"""Although many types of doctors, including family physicians, pediatricians, urgent-care walk-in physicians, and dermatologists, can treat ingrown toenails, podiatrists (foot and ankle specialty doctors) are uniquely qualified among the medical professionals to treat this condition. A podiatrist's office is also equipped with necessary instruments required to perform ingrown toenail procedures."" "
What is the treatment for ingrown toenails?,"'There are various types of treatments, including self-care, soaking, avoidance of shoe pressure on the toenails, proper methods to trim the nails, and various surgical treatments. Sometimes antibiotics may be required.' "
What types of nail surgery are used for ingrown toenails?,"'Surgical treatments include the following: temporary resection and removal of the offending nail border or corner, avulsion (detachment) of the nail or offending nail border, or permanent elimination of the nail (matrixectomy) or offending nail border (partial matrixectomy). A matrixectomy is the destruction or removal of the cells where the nail grows from called the nail matrix. The nail matrix is at the base of the toenail under the skin. This procedure can be done surgically by dissection, chemically, or electrically by destroying part or all of the matrix cells. These procedures are commonly reserved for chronic or recurrent situations.'  "
Do surgical procedures that treat ingrown toenails require anesthesia?,"'Simple resection and removal of the offending nail edge often does not require anesthesia. However, nail avulsion and matrixectomy does require local anesthesia. The anesthesia is injected directly into the toe and its effect lasts throughout the procedure. Because the anesthesia is administered locally, there is a minimal effect on driving or ''walking'' after the procedure.' "
What does the recovery from toenail surgery entail?,"'The operated foot should be elevated for the remainder of the day. Typically, the dressings are removed the day following the procedure. Cleansing of the ''wound'' or soaks in Epsom salts and/or antimicrobial soap followed by application of an antibacterial cream and small bandage (Band-Aid) twice a day for one to two weeks can help to prevent infection. Open toe or loose-fitting, wide toe box shoes are recommended to avoid pressure to the toe while healing. Your doctor may want to see you return in a few weeks to ensure appropriate healing of the procedure site.' "
What is the appearance of the nail after surgery?,"'If a permanent resection of the nail was performed (matrixectomy), the nail will appear narrower by a few millimeters on the affected nail border. Unless a large portion of the nail was removed during the procedure, the overall appearance of the nail does not change significantly. If the nail matrix is not removed or cauterized, then the nail should regrow to its original appearance and width.'""If conservative treatments fail, surgery to remove the offending nail border is recommended. If the condition is recurrent and/or chronic, a matrixectomy may be recommended. Both procedures (removal of offending nail and matrixectomy) are usually performed in your doctor or podiatrist's office."" "
What are the potential complications of surgery?,"'Complications from ingrown toenail surgeries are rare but can occur. Complications include infection after the procedure, prolonged tenderness along the procedure site, a slow-healing wound (especially in those with ''diabetes''), and recurrence. You are more prone to post-surgery complications if you do not follow proper instruction to care for the ingrown toenail. Fortunately, these complications are fairly easy to manage. If you are prone to infection, your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics following the procedure.' "
How can people prevent ingrown toenails from recurring?,"'Avoid shoes that are too small (putting pressure on the toenail) or too large (where the foot is moving back-and-forth inside the shoe). Improperly fitting footwear can cause trauma to the toenail. Sometimes the best shoes for symptomatic ingrown toenails are those without a closed toe box. Use proper methods of trimming the toenail with clean instruments, cut straight across toenails, and do not trim them too short. Wear corrective orthotic devices if you have faulty foot mechanics that result in excessive pressure at the nail fold.'  "
Ingrown toenail do's, Do wear properly fitting shoes that allow you to wiggle your toes without having your foot slide around within. Do avoid repeated pressure and trauma to the toenails. Do wear sport-specific shoes. Do practice good foot hygiene. Do trim toenails straight across.
Ingrown toenail don'ts, Don't cut down the corners of the toenails. Don't trim toenails too short. Don't wear improperly fitting shoes. Don't avoid treatment by a professional if symptoms persist. Don't do surgery on the toenail yourself.
What is the prognosis for an ingrown toenail?,"'The prognosis for an ingrown toenail is generally very good, particularly if you seek professional treatment when the problem does not resolve itself after a week or so and a medical professional addresses risk factors.' "
What causes inguinal hernia?,"'Sometimes, inguinal hernias may have no known cause. In other cases, it may occur due to''Risk factors for ''inguinal hernia'':' Elevated pressure within the abdomen. Pre-existing weak spots in the abdominal wall, for example, from birth. Weakness of the abdominal wall due to aging or injury. Straining during bowel movements due to chronic constipation. Strenuous exercise, especially heavy weight lifting. Pregnancy. Chronic coughing or sneezing. Male sex Being older Being white Family history Chronic cough Chronic smoking Chronic constipation Pregnancy Premature birth and low birth weight  Previous inguinal hernia or hernia repair surgery"
What is inguinal hernia?,"'A ''hernia'' is when part of a tissue or an organ bulges through a weak point in the body. There are various types of hernias occurring in different parts of the body.''An ''inguinal hernia''\xa0occurs when part of the intestine or surrounding fat and structures bulge through a weak point in the lower abdominal wall. Sometimes, lower abdominal organs such as parts of the female reproductive organs can also bulge through the weak point. They’re more common in men than in women. In men, an inguinal hernia can cause a bulge in the groin and scrotum. Sometimes, it may be difficult to distinguish between inguinal hernia and femoral hernia. Femoral hernia presents as a small- to medium-sized lump in the groin.\xa0'""Inguinal hernia may be asymptomatic initially, but it can worsen and lead to life-threatening complications. An inguinal hernia doesn't disappear on its own, and surgery is usually required to fix an inguinal hernia."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of inguinal hernia?,"'Inguinal hernia signs and symptoms include:''Signs and symptoms in children:'""Inguinal hernias in newborns and children occur due to weakness in the abdominal wall that's present at birth. A hernia may be visible only while crying, coughing, or straining during bowel movements. Infants may be irritable and may not eat properly."" A bulge on either side of the pubic bone, more commonly on the right side Bulge becomes more prominent, especially while coughing or straining Pain or discomfort at the site of the bulge The feeling of heaviness or a dragging sensation in the groin Weakness or increased pressure in the groin Pain and swelling around the testicles if the protruding intestine descends into the scrotum"
What happens if inguinal hernia is not treated?,"'If untreated, the following complications can occur:''Signs and symptoms of a strangulated hernia include:' Pressure on surrounding tissues: Inguinal hernias tend to worsen and apply pressure over the surrounding structures, reducing blood flow. Incarceration: If the contents of the hernia are not able to be pushed back, it means they are incarcerated (trapped) in the weak point in the abdominal wall. It can lead to strangulation. Strangulation: Incarcerated hernia can cut off blood flow to part of the intestine that is trapped by causing strangulation. This leads to the death of the affected tissues. A strangulated hernia is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Fever Sudden and severe pain at the hernia site Warmth and tenderness at the hernia site  Change of color of the bulge to red, purple or blue, or black Nausea Vomiting Difficulty passing gas and stools"
Can inguinal hernias be prevented?,"'The following tips may help prevent inguinal hernias:' Maintaining healthy body weight and decreasing abdominal wall pressure Avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol Avoiding heavy lifting and straining while exercising Correcting chronic constipation to prevent straining during bowel movements. Eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluids can help improve constipation, if not, seeking medical attention is required. Seeking medical attention to treat chronic cough"
How is inguinal hernia treated?,"'In the early stages of inguinal hernia and when it is asymptomatic, the doctor might advise observation and follow-up. A supportive truss may be worn to help relieve symptoms, with the guidance of a doctor.''Surgery is recommended to fix hernia because they do not improve or disappear on their own. Surgery is performed under anesthesia. There are two general types of hernia surgeries—open hernia repair and laparoscopic repair.' Open hernia repair: An incision is made in the groin, and the contents of the hernia are pushed back into the abdomen. The weakened area in the abdominal wall is usually reinforced with a synthetic mesh. This is called hernioplasty. It may take several weeks to fully recover and resume normal activities. Laparoscopic hernia repair: This is a minimally invasive procedure. Several small incisions are made over the abdomen through which a laparoscope (a small tube with a light source and camera) and surgical instruments are inserted. The abdominal wall is usually reinforced with a synthetic mesh. Recovery is faster than open surgery."
What are corticosteroids?,"'Corticosteroids are a class of medications that are related to cortisone, a steroid. Medications of this class powerfully reduce inflammation. They are used to reduce the inflammation caused by a variety of diseases. Cortisone is one type of ''corticosteroid''. For the purpose of this review, ""cortisone"" is used interchangeably with ""corticosteroid.""''Corticosteroids can be taken by mouth, inhaled, applied to the skin, given intravenously (into a vein), or injected into the tissues of the body. Examples of corticosteroids include ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone'' (given by mouth), ''methylprednisolone'' sodium succinate injection (''Solu-Medrol'') (given intravenously), as well as triamcinolone (Kenalog), betamethasone (Celestone), methylprednisolone (''Depo-Medrol''), and others (given by injection into body tissues). This article describes the role of cortisone injections into the soft tissues and joints.'  "
What types of doctors administer cortisone injections?,"'Many different health care professionals administer cortisone shots. The specialty administering the cortisone depends on the condition being treated. For example, a primary care doctor or nurse practitioner may administer a systemic cortisone injection in the gluteus muscle to treat an ''allergic reaction''. Orthopedic surgeons commonly give cortisone injections into a joint, such as a cortisone injection into the knee to treat knee ''osteoarthritis''. Dermatologists treat some ''skin conditions'' with special preparations of cortisone (to minimize the risk of changing the appearance of the skin after the injection). ''Rheumatologists'' administer cortisone injections into joints to treat ''joint inflammation'' caused by ''rheumatoid arthritis'' or other forms of ''arthritis''.' "
Is a cortisone injection merely a pain reliever or  temporary remedy?,"'Corticosteroids are not ''pain'' relievers. They reduce inflammation. When corticosteroids relieve pain, it is because they have reduced inflammation that would be causing pain.''While the inflammation for which corticosteroids are given can recur, corticosteroid injections can provide months to years of relief when used properly. These cortisone shots also can cure diseases (permanently resolve them) when the problem is tissue inflammation localized to a small area, such as ''bursitis'' and tendinitis. They can also cure certain forms of ''skin inflammation''.' "
For what conditions are cortisone injections used?,"'Cortisone injections can be used to treat the inflammation of small areas of the body (local injections), or they can be used to treat inflammation that is widespread throughout the body (systemic injections). Examples of conditions for which local cortisone injections are used include inflammation of a bursa (''bursitis of the hip'', knee, elbow, or shoulder), a tendon (tendinitis such as ''tennis elbow''), and a joint (arthritis). Knee ''osteoarthritis'', ''hip bursitis'', painful foot conditions such as ''plantar fasciitis'', ''rotator cuff'' tendinitis, ''frozen shoulder'', and many other conditions may be treated with cortisone injections. Certain skin disorders, such as ''alopecia'' (a specific type of ''hair loss''), can be treated with cortisone injections.''Corticosteroid injections given in the shoulder may cure localized soft-tissue inflammation in the shoulder, such as bursitis or tendinitis. Cortisone injections of the shoulder may be used in conjunction with physical therapy to treat ''rotator cuff'' syndrome and ''impingement syndrome''.''Injections of cortisone and a local anesthetic such as ''lidocaine'' are sometimes used to confirm a diagnosis. For example, if pain in the buttock and groin improves after a cortisone injection in the hip, the pain is caused by hip arthritis rather than arthritis in the low back.''Epidural injections in the lumbar spine (lumbar epidural) are cortisone injections inserted into a specific location in the spinal canal of the low back by a specialist under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy). These injections may help relieve ''back pain'' and ''sciatica''. Epidural injections can also be given in other areas of the spinal canal to relieve upper back and ''neck pain''.''Systemic corticosteroid injections are used for more widespread conditions affecting many joints or the skin, such as ''allergic'' reactions, ''asthma'', and ''rheumatoid arthritis''. These injections are usually given intramuscularly, into a large muscle group such as the gluteus muscles in the buttocks, or into the deltoid muscle in the shoulder. The corticosteroid is then absorbed into the blood and travels through the bloodstream to treat the inflammation. Systemic corticosteroids can also be administered intravenously to treat more severe widespread inflammation.'  "
What are the advantages of cortisone injections?,"'When a joint is swollen, joint fluid may be removed before cortisone is injected. If fluid is removed, it can be analyzed with laboratory testing to determine what caused the joint to swell. This is a big advantage as it is a powerful and accurate diagnostic test.''A distinct benefit of a steroid injection is that the relief of localized inflammation in a particular body area is more rapid and powerful than with traditional anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' given by mouth, such as ''aspirin''. A single injection also can avoid certain side effects that can accompany many ''over-the-counter'"" oral anti-inflammatory medications, notably irritation of the stomach. Cortisone injections can be administered easily in the doctor's office. Other advantages include the rapid onset of the medication's action, dependability, high success rate, and minimal side effects."" "
What are the disadvantages and side effects of cortisone injections?,"'Disadvantages of cortisone injections are the necessity of piercing the skin with a needle as well as potential short- and long-term side effects. It should be emphasized that though each of these side effects is possible, they usually do not occur.''Short-term cortisone injections complications are uncommon but include''Increased pain after the injection is typically due to a post-injection flare because true ''allergies'' to cortisone are very rare. Tendons can be weakened by steroid injections administered in or near tendons. Tendon ruptures as a result have been reported. Facial flushing may occur in up to 40% of cases but lasts only briefly. ''Sweating'', ''dizziness'', and ''insomnia'' are uncommon side effects. Nerve damage is a very uncommon side effect.''In people who have ''diabetes'"", cortisone injections can elevate a person's blood ""'sugar'"". In patients with underlying infections, cortisone injections can suppress somewhat the body's ability to fight the infection and possibly worsen the infection or may mask the infection by suppressing the symptoms and signs of inflammation. Generally, cortisone injections are used with caution in people with ""'diabetes'' and avoided in people with active infections. Cortisone injections are also used cautiously in people with a ''bleeding disorder''.''Long-term complications of corticosteroid injections depend on the dose and frequency of the injections. With higher doses and frequent administration, which increases total systemic exposure to the corticosteroid, potential side effects include'   shrinkage (atrophy) and lightening of the color (depigmentation) of the skin at the injection site, introduction of bacterial infection into the body (such as a joint infection), local bleeding from broken blood vessels in the skin or muscle, soreness at the injection site, aggravation of inflammation in the area injected because of reactions to the corticosteroid medication (post-injection cortisone flare). thinning of the skin, easy bruising, weight gain, puffiness of the face, acne (steroid acne), elevation of blood pressure, cataract formation, thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), a rare but serious type of damage to the bones of the large joints (avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis)."
Are there special side effects that can occur with cortisone joint injections?,"'Cortisone injections into a joint may have side effects in addition to those described above. Unique side effects of joint injections involve injury to the joint tissues, particularly with repeated injections. These injuries include thinning of the joint cartilage, weakening of the ligaments of the joint, increased inflammation in the joint (arthritis) due to a reaction to a corticosteroid that has crystallized, and introduction of infection into the joint.' "
Are there special advantages in using cortisone injections for joint inflammation (arthritis)?,"'Cortisone injections into a joint can be beneficial in rapidly reducing ''joint pain'' while restoring function to a body part immobilized by inflammation, such as an arthritic knee or elbow. This might be particularly important in certain circumstances, such as the gainful employment of a family breadwinner or someone who lives alone. Despite potential and infrequently reported adverse reactions as described above, it is generally felt that low, intermittent doses of corticosteroids pose little risk of significant side effects.''Cortisone injections into a joint also can decrease the inflammation in diseased joints throughout the body when the corticosteroids are absorbed from the joint into the circulation.' "
How are cortisone injections of soft tissues given?,"'The medical professional administering the injection draws up the corticosteroid into a syringe. A local anesthetic (such as lidocaine) may simultaneously be drawn into the syringe. Next, the area to be injected is selected. Typically, the skin over the area to be injected is sterilized with a liquid solution, either ''alcohol'' or Betadine.''Sometimes, the area is topically anesthetized by rapid cooling using a spray such as ethyl chloride. The needle of the syringe then is inserted into the tissue to be injected and the solution is ejected from the syringe into the area of inflammation. The needle then is withdrawn, and a sterile bandage is applied to the injection site.' "
How are cortisone injections into a joint given?,"'The method of administering a cortisone injection into a joint (intra-articular joint injection) is similar to that of soft-tissue injections. Betadine, however, is more commonly used for sterilization of the skin over the joint. This is an important precaution to prevent introducing infection into the joint. Furthermore, if there is an excessive amount of fluid within the joint, it often is removed first with a separate syringe and needle prior to injection of the cortisone. Removal of this joint fluid allows the doctor to examine the fluid and submit a sample to the laboratory for diagnosis. Removal also rapidly relieves pain by reducing the pressure in the fluid-filled joint. Finally, removal of fluid may allow the joint to heal more quickly. After a health care professional removes the fluid, he or she injects the cortisone medication into the joint, sometimes along with an anesthetic such as lidocaine or ''bupivacaine'' (''Marcaine''). Some health care professionals use an ''ultrasound'' to guide the needle into the exact location desired prior to injecting the cortisone into a joint (injection with ultrasound guidance).' "
How long does it take to recover after a cortisone injection?,'Recovery after a cortisone injection does not take long. Resting the joint after the injection is important to allow the inflammation to decrease. Formal ''exercise'' involving the injected joint should be avoided for several days after the injection.' 
Are cortisone injections painful?,"""In an expert's hands, the opposite is more often the case. That is, minimal pain from the procedure is noted while relief from the pain of the inflammation occurs rapidly. Occasionally, cortisone injections of joints that have degenerated (become damaged) or that are particularly small (such as finger joints) can be associated with temporary minor pain at the time of the injection. This is not generally expected. Less frequently, nerves can be irritated, either directly by the needle during the injection or by the corticosteroid medication. Again, pain after the injection is not common or anticipated."" "
How long does a cortisone injection last?,"'At times the relief from a cortisone injection begins almost immediately after the procedure, but it can take a few days for relief. A cortisone injection administered for certain conditions may be curative (such as for certain types of bursitis or mild ''trigger finger''), but with some conditions the symptoms of the condition recur after weeks or months. In this situation, another cortisone injection can be given, but risks of side effects increase with more frequent or regular injections.' "
How often can someone receive cortisone injections?,"'How often cortisone injections are given varies based on the reason for the injection. This is determined on a case-by-case basis by the health care practitioner. If a single cortisone injection is curative, then further injections are unnecessary. Sometimes, a series of injections might be necessary; for example, cortisone injections for a trigger finger may be given every three weeks, to a maximum of three times in one affected finger. In other instances, such as knee osteoarthritis, a second cortisone injection may be given approximately three months after the first injection, but the injections are not generally continued on a regular basis.' "
How many cortisone injections can someone receive?,"'There is no absolute maximum number of cortisone injections that a person may receive. The risk of side effects increases as the number of injections increases, and so the risks and benefits of each injection are considered carefully prior to administration. It is unusual to give cortisone shots in the same location on a routine basis.' "
What is a trigger point?,"'Trigger points are focal areas of spasm and inflammation in skeletal muscle. The rhomboid and trapezius back muscles, located in the upper back and behind the shoulder areas, are a common site of trigger points. Trigger points in these areas can cause ''neck pain'', ''shoulder pain'', and ''headache''. In addition to the upper spine, trigger points can also occur in the low back or less commonly in the extremities.''Often there is a palpable nodule in the muscle where the trigger point is located. The area is tender, and frequently when pushed, ''pain'' radiates from the trigger point itself to an area around the trigger point. Trigger points commonly accompany chronic musculoskeletal disorders such as ''fibromyalgia'', myofascial ''pain'' syndrome, ''neck pain'', and ''low back pain''. They may also occur with tension ''headache'' and temporomandibular pain. Acute ''trauma'' or repetitive minor injury can lead to the development of trigger points.' "
What is a trigger point injection? What medications may be in a trigger point injection?,"'A trigger point injection (TPI) is an injection that is given directly into the trigger point for ''pain management''. The injection may be an anesthetic such as ''lidocaine'' (''Xylocaine'') or ''bupivacaine'' (''Marcaine''), a mixture of anesthetics, or a ''corticosteroid'' (cortisone medication) alone or mixed with lidocaine. Sometimes, a needle alone is inserted into the trigger point, and no medication is injected. This may be helpful and is referred to as ""dry needling."" With the injection, the trigger point is made inactive and the pain is relieved.' "
What types of doctors administer trigger point injections?,"'Trigger point injections are frequently administered by ''rheumatologists'', pain-management doctors, and physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors. Some internists, family practice doctors, generalists, and neurologists perform trigger point injections.' "
How do health care providers perform trigger point injections? What technique to physicians use to administer a trigger point injection?,"""The trigger point injection is performed in the health care professional's office, usually with the patient either lying on the exam table on the stomach or sitting on the exam table. The exact technique varies. The health care professional performing the procedure locates the trigger point by manual palpation and marks the site. ""'Ultrasound'' guidance is not generally necessary. The injection site is then cleaned. ''Alcohol'' or another skin cleanser such as betadine is commonly used to clean the injection site. Frequently, a numbing spray such as ethyl chloride is used to anesthetize the skin and make the actual injection less painful. The needle is then inserted into the trigger point and the medication is injected. After the injection, a simple adhesive bandage may be applied. If the area is painful after the injection, ice, heat, ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), or ''over-the-counter'' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') or ''naproxen'' sodium may be used.' "
When do patients need a trigger point injection?,"'Trigger point injection is used when a patient has a painful trigger point, especially when pain radiates from the trigger point to the surrounding area. Trigger point injections may be used as a treatment for conditions such as ''fibromyalgia'' and myofascial pain syndrome. However, the trigger points commonly recur with ''chronic pain'' syndromes.' "
What are complications and side effects of trigger point injections?,"'A potential complication from the trigger point injection procedure is post-injection pain. This is relatively uncommon, but it can occur. This pain usually resolves by itself after a few days. It is more common when no medication is injected into the trigger point (dry needling). Ice, heat, or over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium may be useful for post-injection pain.''If a steroid medication is injected into the trigger point, there is a risk of shrinkage of the fat under the skin, leaving a dent in the skin. This does not occur when only anesthetic is injected without any steroid medication. Other side effects are rare with trigger point injections but can occur anytime a needle punctures the skin, including infection and bleeding.'  "
How frequently will patients need trigger point injections?,"'Optimally, a trigger point resolves after one injection. This may happen when a patient has one isolated trigger point, especially if the cause of the trigger point has been removed (such as a trigger point caused by a repetitive minor trauma or movement that will no longer be performed). Trigger points caused by chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome tend to recur due the underlying problem. In these cases, trigger point injections may be administered on a regular or as needed basis. The frequency of trigger point injections depends on the medication being injected. If only lidocaine or a mixture of anesthetics is injected, then the injections can be administered as ongoing therapy as frequently as monthly. If a steroid medication is injected, TPIs should be administered much less frequently, at the discretion of the treating health care professional, because of the risk of tissue damage or shrinkage from the steroid medication.'  "
What Is the Growth Plate?,"'The growth plate, also known as the epiphyseal plate or physis, is the area of growing tissue near the end of the long bones in children and adolescents. Each long bone has at least two growth plates: one at each end. The growth plate determines the future length and shape of the mature bone. When growth is complete--sometime during adolescence--the growth plates close and are replaced by solid bone. ' "
Who Gets Growth Plate Injuries?,"'These injuries occur in children and adolescents. The growth plate is the weakest area of the growing skeleton, weaker than the nearby ligaments and tendons that connect bones to other bones and muscles. In a growing child, a serious injury to a joint is more likely to damage a growth plate than the ligaments that stabilize the joint. An injury that would cause a sprain in an adult can be associated with a growth plate injury in a child. ''Injuries to the growth plate are ''fractures''. They comprise 15 percent of all childhood fractures. They occur twice as often in boys as in girls, with the greatest incidence among 14- to 16-year-old boys and 11- to 13-year-old girls. Older girls experience these fractures less often because their bodies mature at an earlier age than boys. As a result, their bones finish growing sooner, and their growth plates are replaced by stronger, solid bone. ''Approximately half of all growth plate injuries occur in the lower end of the outer bone of the forearm (radius) at the wrist. These injuries also occur frequently in the lower bones of the leg (tibia and fibula). They can also occur in the upper leg bone (femur) or in the ankle, foot, or hip bone. '  "
What Causes Growth Plate Injuries? ,"'While growth plate injuries are caused by an acute event, such as a fall or a blow to a limb, chronic injuries can also result from overuse. For example, a gymnast who practices for hours on the uneven bars, a long-distance runner, or a baseball pitcher perfecting his curve ball can all have growth plate injuries.''In one large study of growth plate injuries in children, the majority resulted from a fall, usually while ''running'' or playing on furniture or playground equipment. Competitive sports, such as football, basketball, softball, track and field, and gymnastics, accounted for one-third of all injuries. Recreational activities, such as biking, sledding, skiing, and skateboarding, accounted for one-fifth of all growth plate fractures, while car, motorcycle, and all-terrain-vehicle accidents accounted for only a small percentage of fractures involving the growth plate. ''Whether an injury is acute or due to overuse, a child who has ''pain'' that persists or affects athletic performance or the ability to move or put pressure on a limb should be examined by a doctor. A child should never be allowed or expected to ""work through the ''pain''."" '""Children who participate in athletic activity often experience some discomfort as they practice new movements. Some aches and pains can be expected, but a child's complaints always deserve careful attention. Some injuries, if left untreated, can cause permanent damage and interfere with proper growth of the involved limb. ""'Although many growth plate injuries are caused by accidents that occur during play or athletic activity, growth plates are also susceptible to other disorders, such as bone infection, that can alter their normal growth and development. ''Adapted from ''Play It Safe, a Guide to Safety for Young Athletes'' with permission of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. ' Child abuse can be a cause of skeletal injuries, especially in very young children, who still have years of bone growth remaining. One study reported that half of all fractures due to child abuse were found in children younger than age 1, whereas only 2 percent of accidental fractures occurred in this age group.  Injury from extreme cold (for example, frostbite) can also damage the growth plate in children and result in short, stubby fingers or premature degenerative arthritis.  Radiation, which is used to treat certain cancers in children, can damage the growth plate. Moreover, a recent study has suggested that chemotherapy given for childhood cancers may also negatively affect bone growth. The same is true of the prolonged use of steroids for rheumatoid arthritis.  Children with certain neurological disorders that result in sensory deficit or muscular imbalance are prone to growth plate fractures, especially at the ankle and knee. Similar types of injury are seen in children who are born with insensitivity to pain.  The growth plates are the site of many inherited disorders that affect the musculoskeletal system. Scientists are just beginning to understand the genes and gene mutations involved in skeletal formation, growth, and development. This new information is raising hopes for improving treatment of children who are born with poorly formed or improperly functioning growth plates.  Inability to continue play because of pain following an acute or sudden injury  Decreased ability to play over the long term because of persistent pain following a previous injury  Visible deformity of the child's arms or legs  Severe pain from acute injuries that prevent the use of an arm or leg. 
"
How Are Growth Plate Fractures Diagnosed? ,"'After learning how the injury occurred and examining the child, the doctor will use x rays to determine the type of ''fracture'"" and decide on a treatment plan. Because growth plates have not yet hardened into solid bone, they don't show on x rays. Instead, they appear as gaps between the shaft of a long bone, called the metaphysis, and the end of the bone, called the epiphysis. Because injuries to the growth plate may be hard to see on x ray, an x ray of the noninjured side of the body may be taken so the two sides can be compared. ""'Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), which is another way of looking at bone, provides useful information on the appearance of the growth plate. In some cases, other diagnostic tests, such as computed tomography (CT) or ''ultrasound'', will be used. ''Adapted from ''Disorders and Injuries of the Musculoskeletal System'"", 3rd Edition. Robert B. Salter, Baltimore, Williams and Wilkins, 1999. Used with the author's permission. """"Since the 1960's, the Salter-Harris classification, which divides most growth plate fractures into five categories based on the type of damage, has been the standard. The categories are as follows: ""'The epiphysis is completely separated from the end of the bone or the metaphysis, through the deep layer of the growth plate. The growth plate remains attached to the epiphysis. The doctor has to put the fracture back into place if it is significantly displaced. Type I injuries generally require a cast to keep the fracture in place as it heals. Unless there is damage to the blood supply to the growth plate, the likelihood that the bone will grow normally is excellent.''This is the most common type of growth plate fracture. The epiphysis, together with the growth plate, is separated from the metaphysis. Like type I fractures, type II fractures typically have to be put back into place and immobilized. ''This fracture occurs only rarely, usually at the lower end of the tibia, one of the long bones of the lower leg. It happens when a fracture runs completely through the epiphysis and separates part of the epiphysis and growth plate from the metaphysis. Surgery is sometimes necessary to restore the joint surface to normal. The outlook or prognosis for growth is good if the blood supply to the separated portion of the epiphysis is still intact and if the fracture is not displaced. ''This fracture runs through the epiphysis, across the growth plate, and into the metaphysis. Surgery is needed to restore the joint surface to normal and to perfectly align the growth plate. Unless perfect alignment is achieved and maintained during healing, prognosis for growth is poor. This injury occurs most commonly at the end of the humerus (the upper arm bone) near the elbow. ''This uncommon injury occurs when the end of the bone is crushed and the growth plate is compressed. It is most likely to occur at the knee or ankle. Prognosis is poor, since premature stunting of growth is almost inevitable. ''A newer classification, called the Peterson classification, adds a type VI fracture, in which a portion of the epiphysis, growth plate, and metaphysis is missing. This usually occurs with an ''open wound'' or ''compound fracture'', often involving lawnmowers, farm machinery, snowmobiles, or gunshot wounds. All type VI fractures require surgery, and most will require later reconstructive or corrective surgery. Bone growth is almost always stunted. '  "
What Kind of Doctor Treats Growth Plate Injuries?,"'For all but the simplest injuries, the doctor may recommend that the injury be treated by an orthopaedic surgeon (a doctor who specializes in bone and joint problems in children and adults). Some problems may require the services of a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal disorders in children. ' "
How Are Growth Plate Injuries Treated?,"'As indicated in the previous section, treatment depends on the type of fracture. Treatment, which should be started as soon as possible after injury, generally involves a mix of the following: ''The affected limb is often put in a cast or splint, and the child is told to limit any activity that puts pressure on the injured area. '""If the fracture is displaced, the doctor will have to put the bones or joints back in their correct positions, either by using his or her hands (called manipulation) or by performing surgery (open reduction and internal fixation). After the procedure, the bone will be set in place so it can heal without moving. This is usually done with a cast that encloses the injured growth plate and the joints on both sides of it. The cast is left in place until the injury heals, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to two or more months for serious injuries. The need for manipulation or surgery depends on the location and extent of the injury, its effect on nearby nerves and blood vessels, and the child's age. ""'These treatments may also be recommended after the fracture is healed. '""Long-term followup is usually necessary to monitor the child's recuperation and growth. Evaluation includes x rays of matching limbs at 3- to 6-month intervals for at least 2 years. Some fractures require periodic evaluations until the child's bones have finished growing. Sometimes a growth arrest line may appear as a marker of the injury. Continued bone growth away from that line may mean that there will not be a long-term problem, and the doctor may decide to stop following the patient. ""  "
What Is the Prognosis for Growth in the Involved Limb of a Child With a Growth Plate Injury?,"'About 85 percent of growth plate fractures heal without any lasting effect. Whether an arrest of growth occurs depends on the following factors, in descending order of importance: ''Treatment depends on the above factors and also bears on the prognosis. ''The most frequent complication of a growth plate fracture is premature arrest of bone growth. The affected bone grows less than it would have without the injury, and the resulting limb could be shorter than the opposite, uninjured limb. If only part of the growth plate is injured, growth may be lopsided and the limb may become crooked. ''Growth plate injuries at the knee are at greatest risk of complications. Nerve and blood vessel damage occurs most frequently there. Injuries to the knee have a much higher incidence of premature growth arrest and crooked growth. ' Severity of the injury--If the injury causes the blood supply to the epiphysis to be cut off, growth can be stunted. If the growth plate is shifted, shattered, or crushed, a bony bridge is more likely to form and the risk of growth retardation is higher. An open injury in which the skin is broken carries the risk of infection, which could destroy the growth plate.  Age of the child--In a younger child, the bones have a great deal of growing to do; therefore, growth arrest can be more serious, and closer surveillance is needed. It is also true, however, that younger bones have a greater ability to remodel.  Which growth plate is injured--Some growth plates, such as those in the region of the knee, are more responsible for extensive bone growth than others.  Type of growth plate fracture--The five fracture types are described in the section, How Are Growth Plate Fractures Diagnosed? Types IV and V are the most serious. "
What Are Researchers Trying To Learn About Growth Plate Injuries?,"'Researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health continue to seek better ways to diagnose and treat growth plate injuries and to improve patient outcomes.''Examples of such work include:''NIAMS currently funds Core Centers for Musculoskeletal Disorders at major medical centers. These centers provide the resources for established, currently funded investigators who are often from different disciplines, to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to common research problems in musculoskeletal disorders.' Use of therapies to enhance the body's production of chondrocytes. These cells are essential to growth at the ends of the bones. Research on drugs that protect the growth plate during radiation treatment. Identifying radiologic predictors for premature closure of the growth plate following fractures. By predicting the injuries most likely to result in arrested growth, doctors could opt to treat them differently and more aggressively. Research on cancer drugs to determine which ones are likely to affect the growth plates. Further investigating the mechanisms responsible for cartilage and growth-plate defects. Development of methods to regenerate musculoskeletal tissue by using principles of tissue engineering."

What is an inner ear infection? What does the ear look like?,"'An inner ear infection is technically an infection of the innermost part of the ear. Often, an inner ear infection is not an infection, but an inflammation or irritation of the parts of the ear responsible for balance and hearing. Less commonly, an inner ear infection is a true infection caused by a virus or bacteria. When the inner ear is inflamed or irritated, symptoms such as ''dizziness'', loss of balance, ringing in the ear (''tinnitus''), ''nausea'', and ''vomiting'' may come on suddenly.''The ear anatomy is divided into three parts, the outer, middle, and inner ear.' The outer ear consists of the parts you can see outside the body, the auricle (also known as pinna), the earlobe, and the ear canal up to the eardrum. The middle ear consists of the eardrum (tympanic membrane) and the auditory bones (ossicles) - the incus, malleus, and stapes. The inner ear consists of the fluid-filled semicircular canals, snail-shaped cochlea, vestibular nerve, and auditory nerve."
What are the signs and symptoms of an inner ear infection?,"'Some people with an inner ear infection may have few or no symptoms at all. When symptoms do appear, they tend to come on rapidly. Symptoms of an inner ear infection may include:''The symptoms of inner ear infections are very similar to other inner ear disorders such as ''labyrinthitis'' and ''vestibular'' neuritis.'   Dizziness or spinning sensation (vertigo) Nausea and vomiting Problems with balance or walking Hearing loss (or decrease in sound volume) in one ear Earache or ear pain Fever (sometimes) Feeling of fullness in the ear Ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or hearing abnormal sounds"
What causes inner ear infections?,"'A viral infection is the most common cause of an inner ear infection. ''Viruses'' associated with inner ear infections include ''influenza'', ''herpes'' viruses, ''Epstein-Barr virus'', and ''polio''. Less frequently, a bacterial infection may cause an inner ear infection.'  "
How long does an ear infection last? How long do symptoms last?,"'How long an ear infection lasts depends on how severe the infection is. When treated promptly, most inner ear infections will resolve in days to about 2 weeks duration, with no permanent damage to the ear. Some inner ear infections may lead to permanent partial or total ''hearing loss''. There can also be damage to the ''vestibular system'', which is responsible for balance, which may prolong the time for recovery.''Most ear infections that affect the outer or middle ear are mild and go away within one to two weeks. Inner ear disorders can last longer. Chronic ear infections can last 6 weeks or more.' "
How can you tell if you have an inner ear infection?,"'The only way to know if you have an inner ear infection or another ear problem is to see a doctor. If you experience symptoms of an ear infection such as ear ''pain'', nausea, vomiting, dizziness, spinning sensation, fullness in the ear, ringing in the ear, problems with balance or walking, or hearing loss, see a doctor.''A doctor will look into the ear with an instrument called an otoscope. An otoscope helps see inside the ear canal and eardrum to see if there is redness or swelling, build up of ''earwax'"", or if there are any abnormalities in the ear. The doctor may gently puff air against the eardrum to see if it moves, which is normal. If it doesn't, this may indicate fluid buildup in the middle ear.""'Inner ear infection symptoms such as dizziness and loss of balance can resemble other medical problems, so a doctor will rule out conditions that may cause the symptoms such as ''head injury'', ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', side effects of medications, ''anxiety'', and neurological disorders.''Other ways to tell if you have an inner or middle ear infection include:' Most ear infections are infections of the middle ear (otitis media). Middle ear infections are commonly associated with upper respiratory infections (common cold), and a virus or bacteria may cause them. They are more common in children. Symptoms differ slightly from inner ear infections. Symptoms of middle ear infection include ear pain, fever and ear discharge. Hearing reduction may also be noted with a middle ear infection. Since middle ear infections commonly occur with an upper respiratory infection (a ""cold""), other symptoms of a middle ear infection include sinus pressure, sore throat, and runny nose. Nausea, vomiting, and dizziness usually are not symptoms of a middle ear infection."
Will antibiotics or other medication treat and cure inner ear infections?,"'Over-the-counter'' (OTC) and prescription medications may be used to treat symptoms associated with an inner ear infection.'   Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and vertigo may be relieved with diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) may be taken to relieve pain. Do not give children and teenagers aspirin as this has been linked with a serious condition called Reye's syndrome. AVOID: cold and cough medicines, especially in young children, as these can have dangerous side effects. Steroids such as prednisone may help with inflammation. Antibiotics or antiviral medications to treat the infection Nausea may be controlled with:meclizine (Antivert)promethazine hydrochloride (Phenergen)lorazepam (Ativan)diazepam (Valium) meclizine (Antivert) promethazine hydrochloride (Phenergen) lorazepam (Ativan) diazepam (Valium) If you become dehydrated from severe vomiting, you may need medical treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids."
What home remedies relieve ear pain and other symptoms?,"'Home remedies cannot treat or cure an inner ear infection, but they may help relieve ear pain and other symptoms.''Some natural remedies and alternative treatments are touted as treatment or cures for inner ear infections, including ''garlic'' oil or ''tea tree oil'' eardrops, apple cider vinegar, basil, olive oil, and hydrogen peroxide. Scientific studies do not show any of these to be effective.''Some chiropractors also claim to be able to treat inner ear infections with manipulation. There are currently no studies that show chiropractic to be effective.''Talk to your doctor before using any home remedies for an ear infection.' A warm compress may ease pain Standing or keeping your head upright while sitting can help drain the ear A saltwater gargle may help clear Eustachian tubes and soothe a sore throat. Do not smoke and limit alcohol intake Use stress management techniques to control emotional and psychological stress becase it can worsen symptoms"
How can I prevent an inner ear infection?,"'An inner ear infection itself is not ''contagious'', but the viruses and bacteria that may cause them are. To prevent infection, practice good hygiene.''Children should be vaccinated, specifically with pneumococcal conjugate ''vaccine'' and the ''H. ''flu'' ''vaccine'' to protect against several types of pneumococcal and ''H. ''flu'' bacterial ear infections.' Wash your hands frequently Avoid sharing food and drinks, especially with someone you know to have an ear infection Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke"
Facts you should know about stinging insect allergies," Severity of reactions to stings varies greatly. Most insect stings do not produce allergic reactions. Anaphylactic reactions are the most serious reactions and can be fatal. Anaphylactic reactions can cause swelling of the tongue, hoarseness, difficulty breathing, and loss of consciousness. Itching, hives, skin flushing, and tingling or itching inside the mouth are typical signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to insect stings. Avoidance and prompt treatment are essential. Allergists are physicians specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies. Epinephrine (available in portable, self-injectable form) is the treatment of choice for anaphylactic reactions. In selected people, allergy injection therapy is highly effective in preventing future reactions. The three ""A's"" of insect allergy are adrenaline, avoidance, and allergist."
What are stinging insects?,"'Stinging insects found in the United States include honeybees, yellow jackets, hornets, wasps, and fire ants. While not everyone is allergic to insect venom, reactions in the skin such as mild ''pain'', swelling, and redness may occur with an ''insect sting''.' "
What types of insect sting reactions occur?,"'Most insect-sting reactions are not allergic and result in local ''pain'', itching, swelling, and redness at the site of the sting. Some extension of the swelling is expected. Local treatment is usually all that is needed for this type of reaction. Disinfect the area, keep it clean, and apply ice. Topical ''corticosteroid'' creams are sometimes used to decrease inflammation, and ''antihistamines'' can help control itching.''Large local reactions may involve increased swelling (that lasts for 48 hours up to one week) that may be accompanied by ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Large local reactions occur in about 10% of insect stings and are not allergic in origin. Occasionally, the site of an ''insect sting'' will become infected, and antibiotics are needed.''Systemic (body-wide) reactions are allergic responses and occur in people who have developed antibodies against the insect venom from a prior exposure. It is estimated that between 0.3%-3% of stings trigger a systemic allergic reaction.'  "
What are signs and symptoms of insect sting allergies?,"'The allergic reaction to an insect sting varies from person to person. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include itching, hives, flushing of the skin, tingling or itching inside the mouth, and ''nausea'' or ''vomiting''. The most serious allergic reaction is called ''anaphylaxis'', which can be fatal. Difficulty breathing, swallowing, ''hoarseness'', swelling of the tongue, ''dizziness'', and ''fainting'' are signs of a ''severe allergic reaction''. These types of reactions usually occur within minutes of the sting but have been known to be delayed for up to 24 hours. Prompt treatment is essential, and emergency help is often needed.' "
Who is at risk for insect sting allergies?,"'Over 2 million Americans are allergic to stinging insects. The degree of ''allergy'' varies widely. Most people are not allergic to insect stings, and most insect stings result in only local itching and swelling. Many, however, will have severe allergic reactions. Severe allergic reactions to insect stings are responsible for at least 50 deaths each year in the U.S.''If you are known to be allergic to insect stings, then the next sting is more likely to be similar or worse than the previous sting. Since most stings occur in the summer and fall, you are at greatest risk during these months. Males under the age of 20 are the most common victims of serious insect-sting allergic reactions, but this may reflect a greater exposure to insects of males, rather than a true predisposition.' "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose an insect sting allergy?,"'In a person with a known ''insect sting allergy'', the presence of the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction following a sting or bite is typically sufficient to establish the diagnosis of an allergic reaction.''A person who is unsure whether or not they have an allergy to stinging insects can consult an allergist/immunologist physician for testing. Two types of tests, skin tests and blood tests, can be used to determine whether or not you have an allergy to specific types of stinging insects. Skin testing involves placing a sample of the insect venom on or slightly under the top level of skin and observing the area for signs of an allergic reaction. Blood testing involves a test called a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) to determine the amount of IgE antibodies in your blood to a specific substance.' "
What specialists treat insect sting allergies?,"'Allergy specialists and immunologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing ''allergies'' and prescribing allergy injection therapy for stinging-insect allergy (see below). The actual allergic reaction itself may be treated by emergency-medicine or primary-care physicians, including pediatricians, internists, or family practitioners.' "
What is the treatment for a severe allergic reaction? What's the best way to remove a stinger?,"""Honeybee stingers are barbed stingers that are left behind in the person's skin after the initial sting. If the stinger is removed by pinching the stinger, more venom is actually injected into the skin. It is better to remove the stinger by gently lifting the stinger using a fingernail or knife edge to flick the stinger out of the skin. Other stinging insects do not leave stingers behind and this technique does not apply.""'An allergic reaction is treated with epinephrine (adrenaline). Several self-injectable devices are available by prescription, including ''EpiPen'', ''Auvi-Q'', and others. These devices are filled with the epinephrine to be injected in to the subcutaneous tissue or muscle, preferably into the front of the thigh. These self-injected devices usually contain only one dose and, on occasion, more than one dose is needed. Venom extractors are commercially available, but they have not been demonstrated to have any benefit.''If a serious sting reaction occurs, always seek medical attention, even if epinephrine is used and all seems stable. The allergic reaction can subsequently progress and become more serious after epinephrine has worn off. Sometimes epinephrine is not enough and intravenous fluids or other treatment is needed. If you are known to be seriously allergic to insects, you must remember to carry the epinephrine at all times especially when out of reach of medical care (such as in the woods or even on an airplane). If epinephrine is not available when you are stung, contact a doctor as soon as possible. In addition to epinephrine, an oral dose of ''antihistamine'' (like ''diphenhydramine'' [''Benadryl'']) can reduce the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Antihistamines take effect in about one hour. Ultimately, however, it is crucial to attempt to avoid the sting.'  "
Are there home remedies for insect sting allergies?,"'There are no home remedies that can prevent an allergic reaction or treat a severe reaction such as anaphylaxis. You can take steps to relieve the symptoms of a mild allergic reaction, including' taking an oral antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or using a topical steroid cream, applying cold compresses to the affected area, and cleaning the area with soap and water to prevent secondary infection."
How can I avoid insect stings?,"'Obviously, the best treatment is avoiding the insect sting. Certain precautionary measures will greatly decrease your chances of being stung. Honeybees are not aggressive and will usually not sting unless disturbed or injured. The majority of honeybee stings are on the bottom of the bare foot while stepping on the bee. Avoid ''walking'' barefoot on lawns where honeybees or other stinging insects may be present. Yellow jackets nest in the ground and in walls. Caution should be used with unusual forms in walls and mounds in the ground. Hornets and wasps often nest in bushes, in trees, and under roofs. Use caution too in these areas and in selecting employment requiring exposure to these conditions.''Bright colors attract insects seeking nectar. Stinging insects are attracted to food and strong smells. Avoid open food in garbage cans, dumps, and open picnic areas. Do not wear perfumes, hair sprays, and colognes. Keep the body covered as much as possible with light-colored clothing. Insect repellents are not effective against stinging insects.' "
What can I do about becoming immune to insect allergy?,"'All people who have had a significant reaction to a stinging insect should be evaluated by an allergy specialist for possible venom immunotherapy (''allergy shots'' that develop an immunity to insect allergy). Selected patients with significant sensitivity to insect venom and specific symptoms can undergo allergy injection therapy for stinging-insect allergy. ''Allergy immunotherapy'' against stinging insects in these selected patients is almost 100% effective.''This type of treatment usually involves a gradually increasing dose of the venom over 10-20 weeks. Then a ""maintenance"" dosage every four to eight weeks is given. After approximately three to five years, discontinuation of the venom shot is considered. Therapy for three to five years confers long-term protection in most people. The risk of severe adverse reactions from this venom therapy is minimal (less than 0.2%), and no deaths have been reported to date.''The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends the following:' Avoid disturbing likely beehive sites, such as large trees, tree stumps, logs, and large rocks. If a colony is disturbed, run and find cover as soon as possible. Running in a zigzag pattern may be helpful. Never stand still or crawl into a hole or other space with no way out. Do not slap at the bees. Cover as much of the head and face as possible, without obscuring vision, while running. Once clear of the bees, remove stingers and seek medical care if necessary, especially if there is a history of allergy to bee venom."
What is the prognosis for an insect sting allergy?,'Most people recover from allergic reactions to insect stings without further complications. Those who have a history of severe reactions or anaphylaxis should always carry a self-injecting epinephrine source. Immunotherapy (allergy shots) for insect sting allergy as a treatment choice has an excellent outcome for certain people with insect sting allergy.' 
What is insomnia?,"'Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or both, despite adequate opportunity and time to sleep, leading to impaired daytime functioning. Insomnia may be a cause of or result of poor quality and/or quantity of sleep.''Insomnia is very common. Ninety percent of the general population has experienced acute insomnia at least once. Approximately 10% of the population may suffer from chronic (long-standing) insomnia.''The problem affects people of all ages including children, although it is more common in adults and its frequency increases with age. In general, women are affected more frequently than men.'  "
3 Types of insomnia based on the duration of symptoms and signs,"'Insomnia may be divided into three types based on the duration of symptoms.''Insomnia can also be classified based on the underlying reasons for insomnia, for example:'""It's important to make a distinction between insomnia and other similar terminology; short duration sleep and sleep deprivation."" Transient insomnia: lasts one week or less and maybe termed transient insomnia Short-term insomnia: lasts more than one week but resolves in less than three weeks Long-term or chronic insomnia lasts more than three weeks. Sleep hygiene Existing health problems or other diseases Sleep disorders Stress factors Short duration sleep may be normal in some patients who may require less time for sleep without feeling daytime impairment, the central symptom in the definition of insomnia. Sleep deprivation: In insomnia, adequate time and opportunity for sleep are available, whereas, in sleep deprivation, lack of sleep is due to lack of opportunity or time to sleep because of voluntary or intentional avoidance of sleep."
Signs and symptoms of insomnia,'Impairment of daytime functioning is the defining and the most common symptom of insomnia.''Other common insomnia symptoms include:'  Daytime fatigue Daytime sleepiness Mood changes Poor attention and concentration Lack of energy Anxiety Poor social function Headaches Increased errors and mistakes
Who gets insomnia?,'There are no specific risk factors for insomnia because of the variety of underlying causes that may lead to insomnia. The medical and psychiatric conditions listed earlier may be considered risk factors for insomnia if untreated or difficult to treat. Some of the emotional and environmental situations that were also mentioned above may act as risk factor for insomnia.' 
What causes insomnia?,"'Insomnia may have many causes and, as described earlier, it can be classified based upon the underlying cause. The ''International Classification of ''Sleep Disorders'', has classified insomnia into multiple categories:'   Adjustment insomnia (acute insomnia): short-term or acute insomnia usually do to stress or environmental changes Psychophysiologic insomnia (primary insomnia): prolonged stress with chronic insomnia Paradoxical insomnia: little or no sleep at nights with rare normal night sleep because of a pattern of consciousness throughout the night, or where near constant awareness of environmental stimuli occurs Insomnia due to medical condition: insomnia associated with disorders such as advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), arthritis, cancer, renal disease, fibromyalgia, neurologic problems, Parkinson's disease, and chronic fatigue syndrome Insomnia due to mental disorder: depression, schizophrenia, and maniac phase of bipolar illness, for example Insomnia due to drug or substance abuse: for example, alcohol abuse, stimulant abuse, caffeine abuse Insomnia not due to substances or known physiologic conditions, unspecified: temporary diagnostic term used for suspected but unproven underlying mental, physiological or environmental problems Inadequate sleep hygiene: proper sleep scheduling, routine use of alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, frequent daytime napping, using the bed for watching TV, snacking, or reading and/or studying for tests or work related subjects Idiopathic insomnia: long-term insomnia begun in infancy or childhood with no readily identifiable underlying cause Behavioral insomnia of childhood: insomnia in children based on adult caregiver observations Primary sleep disorders causing insomnia: insomnia due to restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea (shallow breathing) syndrome, nocturia (need to urinate at night) or circadian rhythm disorders for example"
Insomnia caused by stress and lifestyle factors,"'9 Common situational and stress factors leading to acute or adjustment insomnia may include:''Most of these factors may be short-term, transient, and controllable or modifiable by actions a patient decides to take, and therefore insomnia may resolve in many patients when the underlying factor is removed or corrected.' Jet lag Physical discomfort (hot, cold, lighting, noise, unfamiliar surroundings) Working different shifts Stressful life situations (divorce or separation, death of a loved one, losing a job, preparing for an examination) Illicit drug use Cigarette smoking Caffeine intake prior to going to bed Alcohol intoxication or withdrawal Certain medications"
When should I call the doctor or other health care professional if I can't sleep?,"'In general, acute insomnia related to transient situational factors resolves spontaneously when the provoking factor is removed or corrected. However, medical evaluation by a doctor may be necessary if the insomnia persists or it is thought to be related to a medical or a psychiatric condition. Many people choose not to discuss their insomnia symptoms with their doctor; however, individuals should contact their doctor if insomnia is interfering with daytime activities.''There are also specialized doctors who evaluate and treat insomnia and other sleep disorders. ''Sleep apnea'' may be evaluated by board-certified sleep physicians from varying backgrounds who have specialized in sleep disorders. Other doctors who evaluate and treat sleep disorders are neurologists with a specialty in sleep disorders.' "
Is there a test to diagnose the condition?,"'Evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia may start with a thorough medical and psychiatric patient history taken by the doctor or other health care professional. As mentioned previously, many medical and psychiatric conditions can be responsible for insomnia.''A doctor will examine\xa0the patient to assess for any abnormal findings as well. Portions of the exam may include:''Laboratory or blood work'' pertinent to these conditions can also be a part of the assessment.''Sleep patterns'"": The patient's family members and bed partners also need to be interviewed to ask about the patient's sleep patterns, ""'snoring'', or movements during sleep.''Sleep habits:'' Specific questions regarding sleep habits and patterns are also a vital part of the assessment. Asleep\xa0history focuses on:''Sleep logs or diaries:'' Sleep logs or diaries may be used for this purpose to record these parameters on a daily basis for a more accurate assessment of your sleep patterns.''Sleep history:'' Sleep history also typically includes questions about possible symptoms associated with insomnia. You may be asked about daytime functioning, ''fatigue'', concentration and attention problems, naps, and other common symptoms of the condition.''Other diagnostic tests may be done as part of the evaluation for insomnia, although they may not be necessary for all patients with insomnia.''Polysomnography is a test that is done in sleep centers if medical conditions such as sleep apnea are suspected. In this test, the person will be required to spend a full night at the sleep center while being monitored for heart rate, brain waves, ''respiration'', movements, oxygen levels, and other parameters while they are sleeping. The data is then analyzed by a specially trained physician to diagnose or rule out sleep apnea or other disorders of sleep.'""Actigraphy is another more objective test that may be performed in certain situations but is not routinely a part of the evaluation for insomnia. An actigraph is a motion detector that senses the person's movements during sleep and wakefulness. It is worn similar to a wristwatch for days to weeks, and the movement data are recorded and analyzed to determine sleep patterns and movements. This test may be useful in cases of primary insomnia disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, or sleep state misconception. Many commercially available devices are popular today for patients to use on their own and track their sleep patterns. The majority of these devices have not been evaluated against the gold standard devices and methods. Their role in identifying true insomnia has yet to be established in the scientific literature."" Assessment of mental status and neurological function Heart, lung, and abdominal exam Ear, nose, and throat exam Measurement of the neck circumference and waist size. Questions about any routine medications you are currently taking, and the use of any illegal drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine. Duration of sleep Time of sleep Time to fall sleep Number and duration of awakenings Time of final awakening in the morning Time and length of any daytime naps The typical sleep environment"
What are the treatments for insomnia; can it be cured?,"'The treatment of insomnia depends largely on the cause of the problem. In cases where an obvious situational factor is responsible for the insomnia, correcting or removing the cause generally cures the problem. For example, if insomnia is related to a transient stressful situation, such as jet lag or an upcoming examination, it will then be cured when the situation resolves.''Generally speaking, the treatment of insomnia can be divided into non-medical or behavioral approaches and medical therapy. Both approaches are necessary to successfully treat the problem, and combinations of these approaches may be more effective than either approach alone.'""When it's related to a known medical or psychiatric condition, then appropriate treatment of that problem is in the forefront of therapy for insomnia in addition to the specific therapy for insomnia itself. Without adequately addressing the underlying cause, insomnia will likely go on despite taking aggressive measures to treat it with both medical and non-medical therapies.""  "
Natural and home remedies to cure insomnia,"'There are several recommended techniques used in treating people with insomnia. These are non-medical strategies and are generally advised to be practiced at home in combination with other remedies for insomnia, such as medical treatments for insomnia and treatment for any underlying medical or psychiatric disorders.''Some of the most important of these behavioral techniques are sleep hygiene, stimulus control, relaxation techniques, and sleep restriction. Behavioral sleep specialists may also be available in some clinics and can be very helpful in managing the non-medical treatment options. They may use additional techniques dealing with ''cognitive behavioral therapy'', including some biofeedback methods that help patients with insomnia relax and transition to sleep. They also may recommend you keep a sleep diary.' "
Sleep hygiene,"'Sleep hygiene is one of the components of non-medical treatments for insomnia, and includes simple steps that may improve initiation and maintenance of sleep. Sleep hygiene consists of the following strategies:'   Sleep as much as possible to feel rested, then get out of bed (do not over-sleep). Maintain a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily. Do not force yourself to sleep. Do not drink caffeinated beverages or other stimulants in the afternoon or evening. Do not drink alcohol prior to going to bed. Do not smoke, especially in the evening. Adjust the bedroom environment to induce sleep. Avoid watching television in bed and for 30 minutes before bed. Do not go to bed hungry, but avoid foods that may cause reflux. Resolve stress and anxiety before going to bed. Exercise regularly, but not 4-5 hours prior to bed time."
Stimulus control,"'Stimulus control refers to techniques used to help with initiating sleep. These techniques are used to induce an environment in the bedroom that promotes sleep. Some simple steps include:''Relaxation techniques, which are also a part of non-medical therapy for insomnia, involve sitting or lying comfortably and relaxing muscles of the body in one area at time. This may be combined with deep, relaxed breathing to promote further body relaxation.' Use the bed only for having sex and sleeping, not working, reading, watching TV, eating, or other mentally stimulating activities. Go to bed only when you feel ready to sleep. Turn off the lights and all the noise in and around the bedroom. Get up at the same time every morning to avoid over-sleeping. If you do not fall asleep longer than 20 minutes after going to bed, get up and try some relaxation techniques until you are ready to sleep again."
Sleep restriction,"'Sleep restriction refers another non-medical behavioral therapy for insomnia which involves limiting the time spent in bed for sleeping only. Many people with insomnia may stay in bed for a long time after they wake up in the morning. This over-sleeping may disrupt the circadian rhythm and make sleep initiation more difficult the following night.''Sleep dairies or logs are used to record the actual time spent sleeping each night, and the time spent in bed is gradually reduced to the exact time spent sleeping by shortening the total time in bed. This method gradually reduces and eliminates over-sleeping over a period of time. It also increases the drive to sleep and makes sleep more efficient, as the time spent in bed approximates the duration of sleep.' "
"Benzodiazepine, non-benzodiazepine, and antidepressant medications to cure insomnia","'The main classes of medications used to treat insomnia are the ''sedatives'' and ''hypnotics'', such as the ''benzodiazepines'' and the non-''benzodiazepine'' sedatives.''Several medications in the benzodiazepine class have been used successfully for the treatment of insomnia, and the most common ones include:''Another common benzodiazepine, ''diazepam'' (''Valium''), is typically not used to treat insomnia due to its longer sedative effects.''Non-benzodiazepine sedatives are also used commonly for the treatment of insomnia and include most of the newer drugs. Some of the most common ones are:''Some anti-depressants (for example, ''trazodone'' [''Desyrel''], ''amitriptyline'' [''Elavil'', ''Endep''], ''doxepin'' [Sinequan, Adapin]) can be used effectively to treat insomnia in patients who also may suffer from ''depression''. Some anti-psychotics have been used to treat insomnia, although their routine use for this purpose is generally not recommended.'   quazepam (Doral), triazolam (Halcion), estazolam (ProSom), temazepam (Restoril), flurazepam (Dalmane), and lorazepam (Ativan). zaleplon (Sonata), zolpidem (Ambien or Ambien CR [note that as of January 1, 2014 the FDA changed the recommended dosage and precautions], Zolpimist, Intermezzo), and eszopiclone (Lunesta)."
"Melatonin, Rozerem, and Belsomra for problems sleeping","'Melatonin'':'' a chemical released from the brain which induces sleep, has been tried in supplement form for treatment of insomnia as well. It has been generally ineffective in treating common types of insomnia, except in specific situations in patients with known low levels of melatonin. Melatonin may be purchased ''over-the-counter'' (OTC without a prescription).''Ramelteon'' (''Rozerem''): ''a newer drug that acts by mimicking the action of melatonin. It has been used effectively in certain groups of patients with the problem.''Antihistamines'':'' There also other medications that are not in the sedative or hypnotic classes, which have been used in the treatment of insomnia. Sedative antihistamines, ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') have been used as ''sleep aids'' because of their sedative effects. However, this is not a recommended use of these or other similar drugs due to many side effects and long-term drowsiness the following day.''A doctor or sleep specialist is the best person to discuss these different medications, and to decide which one may be the best for each specific individual. Many of these drugs have a potential for abuse and ''addiction'' and need to be used with caution. Several of these medications can not taken without the supervision of the prescribing doctor.' "
Can insomnia be cured?,"""Insomnia overall has a favorable outlook. Many cases of insomnia are related to transient situational stresses and are easily reversed when the situation is resolved. In cases of long-standing (chronic) insomnia, any medical or psychiatric cause needs to be assessed and treated. Medical and non-medical home remedies are available for treating insomnia and are generally successful. Combinations of non-medical and medical therapy are usually the most successful. Medical treatment for insomnia without addressing the underlying cause of a person's insomnia will often result in long-term medication use with no resolution of the underlying cause."" "
What is endoscopic sinus surgery? Is it painful?,"'Traditional sinus surgery involves the precise removal of diseased and/or obstructing sinus tissue (nasal obstruction removal) with improvement in the natural drainage channels by the creation of a pathway for infected material to drain from the sinus ''cavities''. In most situations, the surgeon will employ endoscopic techniques that allow better and more precise visualization without the need for external incisions. As a result, there is less swelling, bleeding, and discomfort, and a faster recovery from sinus surgery. However, you should expect some nasal and sinus pressure and pain for several days after surgery. Endoscopic sinus surgery may have additional terms such as ""functional"" and ""bilateral"" attached -- functional means the surgery aims to return sinuses to normal while bilateral means that both right and left sinuses are involved.  ''Sinus surgery, unlike other types of surgery where a diseased part or organ is removed, involves the re-routing of existing sinus pathways in addition to removal of diseased tissue. ''It cannot be emphasized more strongly that post-operative care is as equally important as the surgery itself.'' One of the most common causes of failure of this procedure is poor post-operative care and follow-up. The doctor can only do so much. It is up to the patient to share in the responsibility of caring for this chronic illness. The following instructions are designed to help patients recover from sinus surgery as easily as possible and to prevent complications. It is very important that patients read these instructions or those provided by their surgeon and follow them carefully.''This information is provided to help people prepare for sinus surgery and to help them understand more clearly the associated beliefs, risks, and complications of sinus surgery. However, ask your doctor if you have questions to help you better understand the procedure.'  "
What do the sinuses look like (pictures)?, 
"What are the risks, side effects, and complications of sinus surgery?","""The following complications and risks of sinus surgery have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is here for patient information only - not to make patients overly concerned - but to make them aware and more knowledgeable concerning potential aspects of sinus surgery. The surgeon will review the risks and benefits of the surgery when obtaining consent for the operation and will be able to discuss the chance of these complications with respect to an individual's potential risks of surgery at that time."" Failure to resolve the sinus infections or recurrence of sinus problems and/or polyps. Bleeding. In very rare situations, a need for blood products or a blood transfusion may be required. Patients have the right, should they choose, to have autologous (using their own stored blood) or designated donor blood prepared in advance in case an emergency transfusion is necessary. Patients are encouraged to consult with their doctor regarding these issues if they are interested. 
	Chronic nasal drainage with excessive dryness or crusting of the nose (empty 
	nose syndrome). Need for further and more aggressive surgery. Need for allergy evaluation, treatments, or environmental controls. Surgery is not a cure for or a substitute for good allergy control or treatment. Failure to improve or resolve concurrent respiratory illness such as, but not limited to, asthma, bronchitis, or cough. Failure to resolve associated ""sinus or nasal"" headaches. The exact cause of headaches can be difficult to determine and may have many different causes that are not sinus-related. The patient or physician may require consultation with another specialist such as a neurologist. Damage to the eye and its associated structures. 
	Damage to the skull base with resultant meningitis, brain abscess, or 
	leakage of spinal fluid Secondary atrophic rhinitis Permanent numbness of the upper teeth, palate, or face. Nasal obstruction due to failure to control infection or polyps. Prolonged pain, impaired healing, and the need for hospitalization. Failure to restore or worsening of the sense of smell or taste."
What is empty nose syndrome?,"'Empty nose syndrome is a condition that may occur after facial ''trauma'' and/or sinus surgery (for example, ''septoplasty'', turbinate reduction or removal) that results in a sensation of being unable to breathe and/or having nasal blockage. The nose appears dry and crusty but drains constantly. The upper nasal mucosa swells and produces ''mucus'', but the turbinates function poorly to warm and humidify the air, if at all, resulting in a dry lower nose that drips constantly from the swollen upper nasal mucosa, often into the throat.' "
How do you prepare for sinus surgery? What happens before surgery?,"""In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either the hospital or a surgical center (surgicenter). In both facilities, quality care can be provided without the inconvenience of an overnight stay. An anesthesiologist will review the patient's medical history before surgery, and will monitor anesthesia of the patient throughout the procedure. If the doctor has ordered pre-operative laboratory studies, the patient should arrange to have these done several days in advance, and bring all lab results to the hospital the day of surgery for review.""'Arrange for someone to spend the first night after surgery with the patient, if possible in case the patient needs to remain overnight.''After surgery, the doctor will usually advise the patient to start using saline irrigation. There are many different ways to irrigate the sinuses; depending on the surgery that was performed, the surgeon will advise the patient on the best method for this to be done.''In general, patients that have sinus surgery should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days prior to the date of surgery. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''Advil'') should not be taken within 7 days of the date of surgery. Many ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or Advil-like ''drugs''. Therefore, it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question, call the doctors that prescribed the medications (surgeon, primary care physician, cardiologist or other specialists) or consult your pharmacist. Depending on the planned surgery, the surgeon may have the patient refrain from such medications for a longer period. ''Acetaminophen'' (Tylenol) is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Usually the surgeon will give prescriptions for post-surgery pain medications at the preoperative visit. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of surgery.''In most pre-operative preparations, patients must not eat or drink anything 8 hours prior to the time of surgery; the surgeon or hospital/surgical center will let the patient know the specific details regarding what time to stop eating and drinking. This includes even water, candy, or chewing gum. ''Smokers'' should make every effort to stop ''smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes as much in advance of surgery as possible. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding.''If a person is sick or has a fever the day before surgery, they should inform the surgeon. If a patient wakes up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. The surgeon and the anesthesiologist will decide if it is safe to proceed with surgery.' "
What happens on the day of sinus surgery?," It is important that patients know precisely what time they are to check-in with the surgical facility, and that they allow sufficient preparation time. Bring all papers and forms, including any preoperative orders and history sheets. Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes that do not have to be pulled over their head. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home, including earrings, watches, rings, etc. Remove all make-up with a cleansing cream. Patients should thoroughly wash their face with soap and water. Do not apply make-up or cream to the face. If possible, avoid using hair clips or other materials to hold up hair. Do not take any medication unless instructed by the doctor or the anesthesiologist. Usually, in the pre-operative holding room, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) and the patient may be given a medication to help them relax."
What happens during the sinus surgery procedure?,"'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a ''gas'' and an intravenous medication to put the patient to ''sleep'' and to maintain anesthesia at a safe and comfortable level. During the procedure, the patient will be continuously monitored. The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room. The whole procedure usually takes several hours. The surgeon will come to the waiting room to talk with any family or friends once the patient is safely in the recovery room.' "
What happens after sinus surgery (pictures)?,"""After surgery, the patient will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor the patient's vital signs. Usually, patients will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once they have fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. Patients will need a friend or family member to pick them up from the surgical facility. Someone (a responsible adult) should spend the first night after surgery with the patient in case any post-surgical problems develop.""'On arrival at home from the surgical facility, the patient should go to bed and rest with their head elevated on two to three pillows. By keeping the head elevated above the ''heart'', ''edema'' and swelling from the sinus surgery can be minimized. Patients may get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom but should avoid straining with bowel movements because this may cause some surgical site bleeding. If the person is constipated, they should take a ''stool softener'' or a gentle ''laxative''.''Some patients may have noticeable swelling of the nose, upper lip, cheeks, or around the eyes for several days after surgery. This swelling is normal and will gradually go away. People can help reduce it by putting an ice pack on the face, ''bridge'' of the nose, and eyes as much as tolerated. This will also help with postoperative edema and pain. Some patients have found frozen vegetables in packages (for example ''bags'' of frozen peas) to be a convenient ice pack which nicely conforms to the face. The frozen material should be separated from the skin by a towel or similar barrier to avoid any skin damage. Many clinicians suggest periods of 15 minutes of such ice-pack treatment followed by 15 minutes of removal to not damage the skin.''Moderate bleeding from the nose is normal and will gradually decrease. The gauze dressing (""mustache dressing"") will collect blood and should be changed as needed. It is not unusual to change these dressings every hour during the first 24 hours after surgery. It is recommended to purchase gauze pads prior to surgery so that the patient will have enough for dressing changes. After a few days the patient will probably not need to use the dressing any longer. Do not take aspirin, aspirin-containing medications, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen''/Advil, ''Naprosyn'', and others) for as long as the surgeon has instructed following surgery, because such medications may increase bleeding and slow clotting at the surgical site.''It is best to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated once the patient has recovered fully from the anesthetic. Avoid hot liquids for several days. Even though people may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to go slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, patients may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery. If ''vomiting'' persists, please contact the surgeon; the doctor may prescribe medication to reduce or eliminate vomiting. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''Patients may be prescribed antibiotics after surgery and should finish all the pills that have been ordered. Some form of a narcotic may also be prescribed and is to be taken as needed for pain. If the patient requires narcotics, they should not drive and should consider having a responsible person stay with them. In some situations, the doctor may give steroids to be taken either before and or after surgery. Take this medication as prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. The steroids are instrumental in facilitating proper healing. If patients have any questions or they feel that they are developing a reaction to any of these medications, he or she should consult their doctor immediately. Patients should not take any other medication, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless they have discussed it with the doctor.' "
How long does it take to recovery from sinus surgery?,"'How long it takes for recovery depends on the extent of the surgery. Recovery may take a few days. It may take up to 3 to 5 days to feel completely back to normal. Patients should refrain from activities that increase heart rate or ''blood pressure'' such as ''running'', exercising, ''weight lifting'', or other similar activities. It is imperative to obtain guidance from the surgeon as to when they may resume all normal activities. Until this time, patients should rest and limit physical exertion to improve recovery.'  "
What are the general instructions and follow-up care after sinus surgery?,"""In many cases, packs or nasal packing is placed in the nose to control postoperative bleeding. The surgeon will tell the patient when to return to the office to have these packs removed. Patients may need to call the office to schedule this postoperative appointment. Please arrange for someone to drive the patient to and from the office for this first visit in case any complications (for example, additional bleeding) develop. Patients should eat a light meal before coming and avoid taking excessive pain medications. In addition, most patients will also have several subsequent office visits scheduled to assess healing, remove crusts, and insure a speedy recovery. These visits are very important as the surgeon may use the endoscope (camera to look in the nose) to clean up the sinuses and perform further debridement if necessary. This post-operative surveillance by the surgeon is very crucial in the individual's long-term success with the surgery.""""After the packing has been removed, individuals may breathe through their nose, but should not blow or sneeze through it for 7 to 10 days to reduce the chance of bleeding. If a person must sneeze, they should try to sneeze through an open mouth. Many surgeons tell patients to expect some light blood-tinged drainage from the nose for several days. If bleeding becomes excessive, apply an ice pack (described previously) and rest quietly with head elevated while applying mild to moderate pressure to the nose. If bleeding continues, call the doctor's office.""'One of the most important things patients can do after surgery (post-op care) is nasal irrigation. Immediately after the nasal packs are removed patients should use a saline nasal spray such as ""Ocean Spray"" several times per day to prevent crusting and nasal dryness from forming in the nose. The surgeon will tell patients when to discontinue the nasal spray and will let them know the best way to irrigate the sinuses.''Patients should go back to work or school only when the doctor says you can and should plan on resting for several days following surgery. Avoid excessive talking, smiling, hard chewing, strenuous activities, and lifting heavy objects, bumping the nose, and bending over. Try not to rest ''eyeglasses'' on the bridge of the nose until soreness and swelling subside. People may wear ''contact lenses'' once eye swelling and any eye irritation has resolved. Alcohol and tobacco should be avoided because they may prolong swelling and healing. Smoke, dust, and fumes may irritate the nose and cause an infection. In general, people may use usual make-up any time after surgery, as long as the structures (for example, eyelids) with make-up are relatively normal and are not irritated by the application of make-up. Be gentle while brushing the upper ''teeth''. They will often be tender for several weeks, and some people may have some numbness of the teeth and palate for several months.''Patients should plan to remain in the general area where the surgery was performed for 3 weeks to allow for postoperative care and in case bleeding occurs, the patient can be seen by the surgeon that did the procedure and who should best be able to treat the patient.' "
What natural home remedies should you use after sinus surgery?,"'It is important for all patients with chronic sinus disease to understand that they have a chronic illness. Successful sinus surgery will only help control the complications and discomfort of chronic sinus disease. The following three areas of prevention should always be remembered:' Maximize 
	moisture. Patients should always remember to maximize moisture in their nose. Keeping sinuses moist makes mucus thinner, allowing the sinuses to drain better. This drainage in turn helps prevent infection. Use a humidifier, drink plenty of water, avoid drying substances such as alcohol and caffeine, try to avoid smoke, which dries out sinus linings, and use plenty of saline irrigation. Avoid 
	allergy particles (allergens). People may want to wear a mask when they clean or are exposed to dust. Sit in the non-smoking sections of restaurants. Avoid exposure to pollens during peak season and keep an air-conditioner on during allergy season. Prevent 
	colds. Avoid exposure to colds and flu whenever possible; obtain a yearly flu vaccination."
When should you call your surgeon for complications following endoscopic sinus surgery?," A sudden increase in the amount of bleeding from the nose unrelieved by pressure, ice, and head elevation. A fever greater than 101.5 F (38.6 C) that persists despite increasing the amount of fluid intake and acetaminophen (Tylenol) use. Persistent sharp pain or headache that is not relieved by the prescribed pain medication. Increased swelling or redness of the nose or eyes. Drainage of a thin, clear fluid in large quantities from usually only one side of the nose. This would be different from the clear, thicker mucus drainage normally produced by the nose."
What is an insulin pump?,"'The ''insulin pump'' is a device for continuous ''insulin'' delivery. An insulin pump is composed of a pump reservoir similar to that of an insulin cartridge, a battery-operated pump, and a computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered.

How big is an insulin pump?,"'Currently, pumps on the market are about the size of a standard communications beeper. ' "
How does an insulin pump work?,"'The typical insulin pump isattached to a thin ''plastic'' tube (an infusion set) that has a soft cannula (or plasticneedle) at the end through which insulin passes. This cannula is inserted underthe skin, usually on the abdomen. The cannula is changed every two days. Thetubing can be disconnected from the pump while showering or ''swimming''. The pumpis used for continuous insulin delivery, 24 hours a day. The amount of insulinis programmed and is administered at a constant rate (basal rate). Often, theamount of insulin needed over the course of 24 hours varies depending on factorslike ''exercise'', activity level, and''sleep''.''The insulin pump allows the user to program many different basal rates toallow for variation in lifestyle. In addition, the user can program thepump to deliver a bolus (large dose of insulin) during meals to cover the excess demands ofcarbohydrate ingestion.' "
How common is an insulin pump?,"'Hundreds of thousands of people with ''diabetes'' worldwide are using an insulin pump. Although insulin pumps were first used by people with ''type 1 diabetes'', people with ''type 2 diabetes'' sometime use them as well. Many children successfully use insulin pumps. Insulin pumps allow for tight blood ''sugar'' control and lifestyle flexibility while minimizing the effects of ''low blood sugar'' (''hypoglycemia''). Newer models of the pump have been developed that do not require a tubing, in fact - the insulin delivery device is placed directly on the skin and any adjustments needed for insulin delivery are made through a PDA like device that must be kept within a 6 foot range of the insulin delivery device, and can be worn in a pocket, kept in a purse, or on a tabletop when working.''Probably the most exciting innovation in pump technology is the ability to use the pump in tandem with newer glucose sensing technology, known as an ""artificial pancreas,"" that administers insulin based on actual glucose levels as determined by the glucose sensor. The first such device was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2013. Manufactured by Medtronic, the device is approved for use in people with ''diabetes'' who are 16 years of age or older. With the new device, insulin delivery is halted if a pre-programmed glucose level threshold is met. In a recent study conducted on 95 patients in Australia, the use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with automated insulin suspension reduced the rate of hypoglycemia in patients with ''type 1 diabetes''. Further studies of this coupled ""closed-loop"" technology (continuously sensing and responding to the body\'s needs)  are ongoing. ' "
What is insulin resistance?,"'Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas. These cells are scattered throughout the pancreas in small clusters known as the islets of Langerhans. The insulin produced is released into the blood stream and travels throughout the body. Insulin is an essential hormone that has many actions within the body. Most actions of insulin are directed at metabolism (control) of carbohydrates (sugars and starches), ''lipids'' (''fats'""), and proteins. Insulin also regulates the functions of the body's cells, including their growth. Insulin is critical for the body's use of glucose as energy.""""Insulin resistance (IR) is a condition in which the body's cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. That is, the normal response to a given amount of insulin is reduced. As a result, higher levels of insulin are needed in order for insulin to have its proper effects, and the pancreas compensates by trying to produce more insulin. This resistance occurs in response to the body's own insulin (endogenous) or when insulin is administered by injection (exogenous).""""With insulin resistance, the pancreas produces more and more insulin until the pancreas can no longer produce sufficient insulin for the body's demands, and then blood ""'sugar'' rises. Insulin resistance is a risk factor for development of ''diabetes'' and ''heart disease''.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of insulin resistance?,'There are no specific signs and symptoms of insulin resistance.' 
What causes insulin resistance?,"'There are several causes for insulin resistance, and genetic factors (inherited component) are usually significant. Some medications can contribute to insulin resistance. In addition, insulin resistance is often seen with the following conditions:''Other causes of or factors that may worsen insulin resistance can include:'   The metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions involving excess weight (particularly around the waist), high blood pressure, and elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Obesity Pregnancy Infection or severe illness Stress Inactivity and excess weight During steroid use Taking certain medications Older age Sleep problems (especially sleep apnea) Cigarette smoking"
Is insulin resistance prediabetes?,"'Type 2 ''diabetes mellitus'' (T2D) is the type of ''diabetes'' that occurs later in life or with obesity at any age. Insulin resistance precedes the development of ''type 2 diabetes'', sometimes by years. In individuals who will ultimately develop ''type 2 diabetes'', research shows that blood glucose and insulin levels are normal for many years, until at some point in time, insulin resistance develops.''High insulin levels are often associated with central obesity, cholesterol abnormalities, and/or ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''). When these disease processes occur together, it is called the metabolic syndrome.''One action of insulin is to cause the body\'s cells (particularly the muscle and fat cells) to remove and use glucose from the blood. This is one way by which insulin controls the level of glucose in blood. Insulin has this effect on the cells by binding to insulin receptors on the surface of the cells. You can think of it as insulin ""knocking on the doors"" of muscle and fat cells. The cells hear the knock, open up, and let glucose in to be used. With insulin resistance, the muscles don\'t hear the knock (they are resistant). So the pancreas is notified it needs to make more insulin, which increases the level of insulin in the blood and causes a louder knock.''The resistance of the cells continues to increase over time. As long as the pancreas is able to produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance, blood glucose levels remain normal. When the pancreas can no longer produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels begin to rise. Initially, this happens after meals -- when glucose levels are at their highest and more insulin is needed -- but eventually while fasting too (for example, upon waking in the morning). When blood ''sugar'' rises abnormally above certain levels, type 2 ''diabetes'' is present.' "
What are normal insulin levels?,"'The exact values for normal or high insulin levels vary according to the laboratory and the type of test performed. With insulin resistance, there is a high fasting insulin level and a normal to high fasting blood glucose level. High or elevated insulin levels can be seen with other medical conditions as well, including insulin-producing tumors (insulinomas), Cushing syndrome, and fructose or galactose intolerance.' "
What conditions are associated with insulin resistance?,"'While the metabolic syndrome links insulin resistance with abdominal obesity, elevated cholesterol, and ''high blood pressure'', several other medical conditions are specifically associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may contribute to the following conditions:''Type 2 diabetes:'' Overt diabetes may be the first sign insulin resistance is present. Insulin resistance can be noted long before type 2 diabetes develops. Individuals reluctant or unable to see a health care professional often seek medical attention when they have already developed type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.''Fatty ''liver'':'' Fatty liver is strongly associated with insulin resistance. Accumulation of fat in the liver is a manifestation of the disordered control of lipids that occurs with insulin resistance. Fatty liver associated with insulin resistance may be mild or severe. Newer evidence suggests fatty liver may even lead to ''cirrhosis'' of the liver and, possibly, ''liver cancer''.''Arteriosclerosis:'' Arteriosclerosis (also known as ''atherosclerosis'') is a process of progressive thickening and hardening of the walls of medium-sized and large arteries. Arteriosclerosis is responsible for:''Other risk factors for arteriosclerosis include:''Skin lesions:'' Skin lesions include increased skin tags and a condition called acanthosis nigricans (AN). Acanthosis nigricans is a darkening and thickening of the skin, especially in folds such as the neck, under the arms, and in the groin. This condition is directly related to the insulin resistance, though the exact mechanism is not clear.''Polycystic ovary syndrome'' (''PCOS''):'' Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common hormonal problem which affects menstruating women. It is associated with irregular periods or no periods at all (''amenorrhea''), obesity, and increased body hair in a male pattern of distribution (called hirsutism; for example, moustache, sideburns, beard, mid-chest, and central belly hair).''Hyperandrogenism:'' With ''PCOS'', the ovaries can produce high levels of the hormone testosterone. This high testosterone level can be seen with insulin resistance and may play a role in causing PCOS. Why this association occurs is unclear, but it appears the insulin resistance somehow causes abnormal ovarian hormone production.''Growth abnormalities:'"" High levels of circulating insulin can affect growth. While insulin's effects on glucose metabolism may be impaired, its effects on other mechanisms may remain intact (or at least less impaired). Insulin is an anabolic hormone which promotes growth. Patients may actually grow larger with a noticeable coarsening of features. Children with open growth plates in their bones may actually grow faster than their peers. However, neither children nor adults with insulin resistance become taller than predicted by their familial growth pattern. Indeed, most adults simply appear larger with coarser features. The increased incidence of skin tags mentioned earlier may occur through this mechanism too.""'Reproductive abnormalities in women'   Coronary artery disease (leading to angina and heart attack) Strokes Peripheral vascular disease High levels of ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol High blood pressure (hypertension) Smoking Diabetes mellitus from any cause Family history of arteriosclerosis Acanthosis nigricans is a cosmetic condition strongly associated with insulin resistance in which the skin darkens and thickens in creased areas (for example, the neck, armpits, and groin). Skin tags occur more frequently in patients with insulin resistance. A skin tag is a common, benign condition where a bit of skin projects from the surrounding skin. Skin tags vary significantly in appearance. A skin tag may appear smooth or irregular, flesh-colored or darker than surrounding skin, and either be simply raised above surrounding skin or attached by a stalk (peduncle) so that it hangs from the skin."
Who is more likely to develop insulin resistance?,"'An individual is more likely to have or develop insulin resistance if he or she:' Is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) more than 25 kg/m2. You can calculate your BMI by taking your weight (in kilograms) and dividing twice by your height (in meters). Is a man with a waist more than 40 inches or a woman with a waist more than 35 inches Is over 40 years of age Is of Latino, African American, Native American, or Asian American ancestry Has close family members who have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or arteriosclerosis Has had gestational diabetes Has a history of high blood pressure, high blood triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, arteriosclerosis (or other components of the metabolic syndrome) Has polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Displays acanthosis nigricans"
Which specialties of doctors treat insulin resistance?,"'Insulin resistance may be treated by primary care professionals, including internists, family doctors, or pediatricians. Endocrinologists, specialists in hormonal disorders, also treat patients with insulin resistance.' "
Is there a test to diagnose insulin resistance?,"'A health care professional can identify individuals likely to have insulin resistance by taking a detailed history, performing a physical examination, and simple laboratory testing based on individual risk factors.''In general practice, the fasting blood glucose and insulin levels are usually adequate to determine whether insulin resistance and/or diabetes is present. The exact insulin level for diagnosis varies by assay (by laboratory). However, a fasting insulin level above the upper quartile in a non-diabetic patient is considered abnormal.' "
Can insulin resistance be reversed?,"'Management of insulin resistance is through lifestyle changes (such as ''diet'', exercise, and ''disease prevention'') and medications.\xa0''Weight loss'' may help reverse insulin resistance along with and taking small steps, such as exercising and eating healthier foods. It also\xa0can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with ''prediabetes''.' "
Is there a special diet meal plan to treat insulin resistance?,"'The need for insulin can be reduced by altering the diet, particularly the carbohydrates in the diet. Carbohydrates are absorbed into the body as they are broken up into their component sugars. Some carbohydrates break and absorb faster than others; these are referred to as having a high ''glycemic index''. These carbohydrates increase the blood glucose level more rapidly and require the secretion of more insulin to control the level of glucose in the blood.''Examples of carbohydrates with a ''high glycemic index'' that rapidly raise blood glucose levels include:''Examples of foods with a low glycemic index include:''Since foods are rarely eaten in isolation, one could argue that the glycemic index of each food is less important than the overall profile of the whole meal and associated ''drinks''.' Unrefined sugars (such as fruit juice and table sugar) White bread Unrefined corn and potato products (such as bagels, mashed potatoes, doughnuts, corn chips, and French fries) Foods with higher fiber content (such as whole grain breads and brown rice) Non-starchy vegetables (such as broccoli, green beans, asparagus, carrots, and greens). These are low in calories and in total carbohydrates, and contain vitamins and fiber."
What foods help prevent type 2 diabetes?,"'Foods that are particularly helpful for people trying to prevent type 2 diabetes and maintain a healthy weight are similar to the ''low glycemic index foods'' described above:''Several studies have confirmed that ''weight loss'' -- and even ''aerobic exercise'' without ''weight loss'' -- increases the rate at which muscle cells take glucose from the blood as a result of improved sensitivity.' Vegetables and fruits provide fiber and vitamins. Fat-free or low-fat dairy products provide calcium and strengthen bones. Avoid full-fat dairy products, as high-fat foods can worsen insulin resistance. Whole-grain products have a lower glycemic index than refined grains and are rich in fiber. Nuts contain fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, or sardines, is a source of ""good"" (heart-healthy) fats. Lean meats or beans are an excellent source of protein."
Can exercise reduce the development of type 2 diabetes?,'Multiple studies have shown that diet and exercise reduce the development of type 2 diabetes and can reduce insulin resistance.' 
What medications treat insulin resistance?,"'Metformin'' (''Glucophage'') is a medication used for treating type 2 diabetes. It exerts two actions that help control blood glucose levels. Metformin prevents the liver from releasing glucose into the blood, and it increases the sensitivity of muscle and fat cells to insulin, allowing them to remove more glucose from the blood. By these actions, metformin lowers blood insulin levels because lower blood sugar levels tell the pancreas to put out less insulin.''Metformin is a reasonably safe medication when used in the proper population. Although occasionally associated with gastrointestinal side effects, metformin is usually well tolerated. While there are no FDA-approved ''drugs'' to prevent type 2 diabetes or to treat pre-type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance), the American Diabetes Association has recommended that metformin be the only drug considered for the ''prevention'' of type 2 diabetes.' "
Can insulin resistance be prevented?,"'Insulin resistance cannot always be prevented, but there are ways to modify risk factors, such as keeping a healthy weight and getting regular exercise.' "
What is the prognosis for insulin resistance?,"'Insulin resistance is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes unless measures are taken to reverse the insulin resistance. Weight loss, eating a healthy diet, not ''smoking'', and exercise, as described previously, can all help reverse insulin resistance.' "
What new research is being conducted on insulin resistance?,"'Insulin resistance has gained awareness and significance, in its own right, as a contributor to the metabolic syndrome. Timely intervention can delay the onset of overt type 2 diabetes. Future studies must assess longer intervals than research to date in order to determine the duration for treatment to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and related complications.''Lifestyle changes (in ''nutrition'' and physical activity) are clearly important to delay the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals with insulin resistance and are the primary recommendation for ''prevention of diabetes'' in high-risk individuals. Metformin is the only drug recommended by guidelines, for those patients at highest risk. Education about these changes must be directed to all groups at risk for type 2 diabetes. ''Childhood obesity'' is epidemic and on the rise in the developed countries. Changes must be made in homes and school cafeterias to ensure healthier ''nutrition''.' "
What is internal bleeding?,"""While the general public understands that internal bleeding means bleeding that can't be seen on the outside of the body, medical personnel tend to use terms that describe more precisely the location inside the body where the bleeding is found. The internal bleeding may occur within tissues, organs, or in ""'cavities'' of the body including the head, spinal canal, chest, and abdomen. Examples of other potential sites of bleeding include the eye and within tissues that line the ''heart'', muscles, and joints.''Bleeding outside the body is quite easy to recognize. If the skin is damaged by a laceration, puncture ''wound'', or ''abrasion'', blood can be witnessed as it streams out of the body. The ''scalp'' and face have a very rich blood supply and are notorious for demonstrating massive blood loss.''Internal bleeding may be much more difficult to identify. It may not be evident for many hours after it begins, and symptoms may only occur when there is significant blood loss or if a ''blood clot'' is large enough to compress an organ and prevent it from functioning properly.'""Internal bleeding occurs when damage to an artery or vein allows blood to escape the circulatory system and collect inside the body. The amount of bleeding depends upon the amount of damage to an organ, the blood vessels that supply it, and the body's ability to repair breaks in the walls of the blood vessels. The repair mechanisms available include both the blood clotting system and the ability of blood vessels to go into spasm to decrease blood flow to an injured area.""'People who take blood-thinning or anti-clotting medication are more prone to bleeding than people who do not take these medications. These individuals may experience significant bleeding even with relatively minor injury or illness, and the risk of bleeding needs to be balanced against the benefits of taking the medication. A variety of ""blood thinning"" medications are now prescribed for many diseases.''Anticoagulation medications include:''Antiplatelet medications'' include:''Some people have genetic or inborn errors of the blood clotting system. Minor injuries may cause major bleeding in these people. ''Hemophilia'' and von Willebrand disease are two examples of hereditary clotting disorders.' warfarin (Coumadin) Heparin enoxaparin (Lovenox) rivaroxaban (Xarelto) edoxaban (Savaysa) dabigatran (Pradaxa) Aspirin clopidogrel (Plavix) prasugrel (Effient) ticagrelor (Brilinta)"
What causes internal bleeding?,"'Bleeding most often occurs due to injury or wound, and depending upon the circumstances, the amount of force required to cause bleeding can be quite variable. Some people can experience spontaneous bleeding not necessarily related to any injury, wound, or trauma.''Most people understand that falling from a height or being involved in a car accident can inflict great force and trauma upon the body. If blunt force is involved, the outside of the body may not necessarily be damaged, but enough compression may occur to internal organs to cause injury and bleeding.''Deceleration may cause organs in the body to be shifted inside the body. This may shear blood vessels away from the organ and cause bleeding. This is often the mechanism for intracranial bleeding such as epidural and subdural hematomas and subarachnoid hemorrhage or bleeding. Force applied to the head causes an acceleration/deceleration injury to the brain, causing the brain to ""bounce around"" inside the skull. This can tear some of the small bridging veins on the surface of the brain and cause bleeding. Since the brain is encased in the skull, which is a solid structure, even a small amount of blood can increase pressure inside the skull and decrease brain function. The shaking within the skull may also cause bleeding within the brain tissue itself (intracerebral hemorrhage).''Organs within the abdominal ''cavity'' are often attached by a pedicle (stalk) to arteries and veins that provide blood supply. In a deceleration injury, the pedicle can shear off, tearing the blood vessels, causing bleeding.''Internal bleeding may occur with broken bones that contain bone marrow in which blood production occurs. These bones have a rich blood supply, and significant amounts of blood can be lost with ''fractures''. The break of a long bone such as the thighbone (femur) can result in the loss of one unit (350 cc to 500 cc) of blood. Flat bones such as the pelvis require much more force to cause a ''fracture''. The trauma from the fracture can tear many blood vessels surrounding the structure, which causes massive internal bleeding.''Bleeding in pregnancy is never normal. ''Bleeding during the first trimester'' of pregnancy is a sign of a potential miscarriage, and is not uncommon. Moreover, ''vaginal bleeding'' during the first few weeks of pregnancy may be a possible symptom and sign of a tubal or ''ectopic pregnancy''. In an ectopic pregnancy, the placenta and the fetus implant in the Fallopian tube or another location outside of the uterine cavity. As the placenta grows, it erodes through the tube or other involved organs and may cause fatal bleeding unless the ectopic pregnancy is recognized and treated.''Bleeding after 20 weeks of pregnancy may be due to ''placenta previa'' or ''placental abruption'', and urgent medical care should be accessed. ''Placenta previa'' describes the situation in which the placenta attaches to the uterus close to the opening of the cervix and may cause painless ''vaginal bleeding''. Abruption occurs when the placenta partially separates from the uterine wall and causes significant ''pain'' with or without bleeding from the vagina.''Whenever a surgeon ''cuts'' into the body, the potential for immediate and delayed bleeding exists. When the operation is near completion, the surgeon tries to make certain that all bleeding has been controlled. This can be done by identifying and tying off blood vessels with ''sutures'' or using staples or clips to maintain hemostasis (hemo=blood + stasis=inactivity, lack of flow). Cautery can be used to ''burn'' blood vessels to prevent them from bleeding. A little bleeding can be expected in most situations.''Sometimes, however, bleeding may occur after the surgery is performed. Blood vessels that have been cut may go into spasm with no evidence of bleeding. They may relax and begin bleeding many hours or days after the completion of a procedure. Similarly, sutures, staples, or clips can dislodge and allow a blood vessel to bleed. Many times the bleeding is self-limited as the body is able to repair itself. On occasion, the patient needs to be returned to the operating room so that the surgeon can explore the area and find the bleeding site. Depending upon the situation, an interventional radiologist may be able to find the bleeding blood vessel and repair it.''Internal bleeding may occur spontaneously, especially in those people who take anticoagulation medications or who have ''inherited'' ''bleeding disorders''. Routine ''bumps'' that occur in daily life may cause significant bleeding issues.''Internal bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract may be caused as a side effect of medications (most often from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' such as ''ibuprofen'' and aspirin) and alcohol. These substances can cause inflammation and bleeding of the ''esophagus'', stomach, and duodenum, the first part of the small intestine as it leaves the stomach.''Long-term ''alcohol abuse'' can cause liver damage, which may cause bleeding problems through a variety of mechanisms including decreased protein and clotting factor production. ''Cirrhosis'', or scarring of the liver, changes blood flow to the liver and leads to ''portal hypertension'' (increased pressure within the blood vessels that supply the liver).'""Esophageal varices (swollen blood vessels around the esophagus) may develop when the liver's blood supply is altered, which has a tendency to make the swollen blood vessels that line the esophagus bleed. Moreover, alcohol directly irritates the lining of the stomach, which leads to inflammation that can cause bleeding.""   Imagine a football player being speared by a helmet to the abdomen. The spleen or liver may be compressed by the force and cause bleeding inside the organ. If the hit is hard enough, the capsule or lining of the organ can be torn, and the bleeding can spill into the peritoneum (the space in the abdominal cavity that contains abdominal organs such as the intestines, liver, and spleen). If the injury occurs in the area of the back or flank, where the kidney is located, retroperitoneal bleeding may occur. The same mechanism causes bleeding due to crush injuries. For example, when a weight falls on a foot, the weight doesn't give, nor does the ground. The force needs to be absorbed by either the bone or the muscles of the foot. This can cause the bone to break and/or the muscle fibers to tear and bleed. Other structures are compressible and may cause internal bleeding. For example, the eye can be compressed in the orbit when a fist or ball hits it. The globe deforms and springs back to its original shape. Rarely, intraorbital hemorrhage (caused by orbital trauma) may occur."
What are the signs and symptoms of internal bleeding?,"'The symptoms of internal bleeding depend upon where the bleeding is located, how much bleeding has occurred, and what structures and functions in the body are affected. Blood outside the circulatory system (the heart and blood vessels) is very irritating to tissues, causing inflammation and pain. Examples of some internal bleeding situations are listed below.''Intracranial bleeding'' from trauma or from a leaking ''aneurysm'' often causes pain, but may also result in symptoms of altered mental function. Subarachnoid bleeding often causes ''headache'' and a stiff neck (meningismus). Neurological examination can range from a near-normal exam to confusion to ''coma''. ''Symptoms of stroke'', including weakness, slurred speech, and ''loss of vision'', may be associated with intracranial bleeding. The signs and symptoms depend upon where and how much blood there is in the brain. If the bleeding continues, symptoms become progressive and easier to recognize. Bleeding may also occur within the spinal canal and affect spinal cord function.''Intra-abdominal bleeding'' may be hidden and present only with pain, but if there is enough blood loss, the patient may complain of weakness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and other symptoms of shock and decreased ''blood pressure''. Once again, the symptoms depend upon where in the abdomen the bleeding occurs.''Blood in the urine'' may be due to internal bleeding at any site within the urinary tract, from the kidney to the bladder. Often bladder infections are associated with blood in the urine, but other causes, including kidney and ''bladder cancer'"", need to be considered based upon the particular symptoms, patient's age, and medical history. Males who may have had prostate surgery may have blood in the urine. Men and women who have had ""'radiation therapy'' may develop inflammation of the bladder wall that can cause a significant amount of bleeding. Some patients with ''kidney stones'' may experience blood in their urine.''Injury due to a deep muscle injury'', and rarely, ''compartment syndrome'"" may occur. Muscles are often sheathed in tight linings. Should enough bleeding and swelling cause the pressure within the muscle compartment to be greater than the patient's blood pressure, blood cannot be pumped to the muscle cells and beyond. Symptoms include intense pain, difficulty moving the joints below the injury, and loss of sensation. Commonly, this is seen in the shin and forearm injuries and may or may not be associated with a ""'broken bone''.''Bleeding may also occur into joints'', causing significant pain and loss of range of motion. This most frequently is seen in patients who are on anti-coagulation medications. An injury may or may not be needed to cause the bleeding.'   If there is bleeding in the stomach, the patient may vomit bright red blood, or if it has been in the stomach for a period, the vomit may look like coffee grounds. Blood in the stool may be due to bleeding anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, from the esophagus and stomach to the colon, rectum and anus. Hemorrhoids are a common cause of blood in the toilet bowl. Black, tarry stools usually signal bleeding from the stomach or duodenum. Black stool may also be due to iron pills, bismuth (Pepto-Bismol) and some foods. If internal bleeding causes blood to spill into the peritoneum, there can be a significant amount of pain with any movement, and the abdomen can become tense and feel rigid to touch. Sometimes, blood in the abdominal cavity moves toward the skin, which a doctor can see during a physical exam. Cullen's sign is the term used to refer to the appearance of bruising surrounding the navel. Bruising between the ribs and hip (on the fleshy side of the body or flank) is a sign of Grey-Turner."
How is internal bleeding diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of internal bleeding begins with a thorough history taken by the health care professional. This is followed by a physical examination, concentrating on the area of the body where the internal bleeding may have occurred. For example, if there is concern about bleeding in the brain, the physical examination will focus on the neurologic system, or if it is intra-abdominal bleeding, the exam will be directed toward the abdomen.''Blood tests may be performed to check for a ''low red blood cell count'', or ''anemia''. However, if the bleeding occurs rapidly, the initial ''hemoglobin'' reading or red blood cell count may be normal.''The suspicion of internal bleeding will often require an imaging test to look for the bleeding source.''In some situations in which the patient is critically ill from internal bleeding, the decision may be made to undergo emergency surgery to find and repair the bleeding site. This may occur in trauma victims with abdominal or chest injuries that have unstable vital signs (decreased level of consciousness, ''low blood pressure'', and other signs of shock) and are at risk for bleeding to death if they were to wait for diagnostic tests.'   If there is concern that there is gastrointestinal bleeding, a gastroenterologist may use fiber optic scopes to look into the esophagus and stomach (endoscopy) or into the colon (colonoscopy) to identify the source. If found, the physician may be able to stop the bleeding using electricity to cauterize or burn the blood vessel that is bleeding. Computerized tomography (CT) is the most common test to look for bleeding in the brain. It is also able to identify brain swelling and fractures of the skull. Ultrasound may be used to look for blood in the abdomen. While it has its place in the management of trauma, ultrasound is especially useful in evaluating obstetric and gynecologic problems such as bleeding from an ovarian cyst or an ectopic or tubal pregnancy. CT also is an effective tool to look for intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal bleeding. It can evaluate the potential injury site, the severity of organ damage, whether the bleeding is contained within an organ (such as the liver, kidney, or spleen) or whether the bleeding has spilled into the peritoneum. It is also a helpful test in assessing pelvic fractures. If the source of bleeding is thought to be due to a damaged artery, angiography may be used to evaluate the arterial blood flow."
What is the treatment for internal bleeding?,"""The initial treatment plan of any patient with internal bleeding begins with assessing the patient's stability and making certain the ABCs are well maintained. This includes making certain the patient:""'The treatment for internal bleeding depends upon where the bleeding is coming from, the patient’s situation, and stability. Basic treatment goals for internal bleeding are to find out where the bleeding is coming from, and repair any damage that the bleeding may have caused.''In patients who take anticoagulation medications and have significant bleeding, the anticoagulation may need to be reversed with medication.'   Has an open Airway Is Breathing Has adequate Circulation (stable pulse rate and blood pressure)"
What are the complications of internal bleeding?,"'Depending upon where it occurs, if not recognized, internal bleeding may cause organ failure, shock, and death. For example:' If there is uncontrolled bleeding in the chest or abdomen, the body may lose enough circulating red blood cells to compromise oxygen delivery to cells in the body. Cells shift from aerobic metabolism using oxygen to anaerobic metabolism. This is only a temporary fix and if allowed to continue, the acid-base balance of the body is adversely affected. If enough cells stop working, the body's organs will also begin to fail (shock). If the bleeding is not stopped, the patient can die. Internal bleeding in the brain may cause minimal damage or it may lead to stroke-like symptoms, coma, and death. Symptoms depend upon the location of the bleeding, the amount of bleeding, and whether the bleeding causes increased pressure within the skull, further affecting brain function."
Overview of urinary function,"'The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The kidneys, a pair of purplish-brown organs, are located below the ribs toward the middle of the back. The kidneys remove water and waste from the blood in the form of urine, keeping a stable balance of salts and other substances in the blood. The kidneys also produce ''erythropoietin'', a hormone that stimulates the formation of ''red blood cells'"". Narrow tubes called ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder, a triangle-shaped, muscular chamber in the lower abdomen. Like a balloon, the bladder's muscular, elastic walls relax and expand to store urine and contract and flatten when urine empties through the urethra. The typical adult bladder can store about 1 ½ cups of urine.""'Adults urinate about 1½ quarts of urine each day. The amount of urine varies depending on the fluids and foods a person consumes. The volume formed at night is about half that formed during the day.''Normal urine contains fluids, salts (for example, sodium and potassium) and waste products, but it is free of bacteria, ''viruses'', and fungi. The wall of the bladder is isolated from urine and toxic substances by a coating on the inside lining of the bladder that discourages bacteria from attaching and growing on the bladder wall.' "
What is interstitial cystitis (IC)/painful bladder syndrome (PBS)?,"'Interstitial ''cystitis'' (IC), also referred to as painful bladder syndrome (PBS), is a condition that causes bladder ''pain'', bladder pressure, chronic urinary urgency (feeling the need to urinate immediately), and frequency (frequent urination). The symptoms of this condition vary among individuals from mild to severe and may even vary with time in the same individual. The term ''cystitis'' refers to any inflammation of the bladder. In contrast to bacterial cystitis that results from an infection in the bladder, a type of ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'""), medical researchers haven't identified an infectious organism in people with interstitial cystitis.""'Estimates of the number of people affected by IC/PBS vary widely and are dependent upon the criteria used for diagnosis. Many experts believe that about 3.3 million women in the U.S. (over age 18) may have IC/PBS, as well as 1.6 million men.''Despite a lack of consistency about the diagnosis of IC/PBS, studies agree that the majority of those affected are women. While individuals of any age may develop IC/PBS, including children, the average age of onset is around 40. Physicians do not consider IC/PBS a hereditary disorder, but multiple cases have occurred among some families, prompting ongoing investigation of the possible role of hereditary factors in the development of IC/PBS.''Observations from ''cystoscopy'"" (visual examination of the inside of the bladder via a camera) have found that two patterns exist for IC, ulcerative and nonulcerative, depending upon the presence or absence of ulcerations or breaks in the bladder lining. Star-shaped ulcerations in the bladder wall are Hunner's ulcers. These appear in less than 10% of cases of IC/PBS in the U.S.""'Over time, interstitial cystitis can cause physical damage to the bladder wall. Scarring and stiffening of the bladder wall may occur because of the chronic inflammation, leading to a decrease in bladder capacity. Glomerulations (areas of pinpoint bleeding) and small areas of bleeding may appear on the bladder wall.'  "
What is the cause of interstitial cystitis?,"'No one knows what causes IC/PBS, but doctors believe that it is a real physical problem and not a result, symptom, or sign of an emotional problem.''One possible cause of IC/PBS is the disruption of the lining layer of the bladder (known as epithelium) that causes it to become leaky, allowing toxic substances in urine to irritate the bladder wall.''Other possible theories about the cause of IC/PBS include an abnormality of the immune response, such as an autoimmune reaction, the presence of an unidentified infection, or increased nervous system activation in the nerves to the bladder. None of these theories has been conclusively proven to cause IC/PBS.' "
What are risk factors for interstitial cystitis?,"""Because physicians don't understand the cause of IC/PBS, there are no definite risk factors for developing the condition. However, women are more likely than men to develop IC/PBS.""'Some associations with other medical conditions appear with IC/PBS. Women with IC/PBS are more likely to have had frequent ''urinary tract infections'' (''UTIs'') and to have had previous gynecologic surgery than women without IC/PBS. Certain chronic illnesses occur more frequently in people with IC/PBS than in the general population. Examples of these associated illnesses are ''inflammatory bowel disease'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), vulvodynia (chronic discomfort in the vulvar area), ''allergies'', ''endometriosis'', and ''fibromyalgia''. While medical researchers have described each of these conditions in at least some studies to be more common in people with IC/PBS than in the general population, there is no evidence that any of these conditions is the cause of IC/PBS.' "
What are interstitial cystitis symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms of IC/PBS vary greatly from one person to another but have some similarities to those of a ''urinary tract infection''. They include''In most women, symptoms usually worsen around the time of their periods. As with many other illnesses, ''stress'' also may intensify the symptoms, but it does not cause them. The symptoms usually have a slow onset, and urinary frequency is the most common early symptom. As IC/PBS progresses over a few years, cycles of pain (flare-ups or flares) and remissions occur. Pain may be mild or so severe as to be debilitating. Symptoms can vary from day to day.'   decreased bladder capacity resulting in frequent urination of smaller amounts of urine day and night, referred to as urinary frequency; a strong, urgent need to urinate when the need to urinate arises, referred to as urinary urgency; bladder pain, bladder pressure, and feelings of pressure, pain, and tenderness around the bladder, pelvis, and perineum (the area between the anus and vagina or anus and scrotum) which may increase as the bladder fills and decrease as it empties; painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia); and discomfort or pain in the penis and scrotum."
What types of doctors treat interstitial cystitis?,"'Urologists are physicians that specialize in diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the urinary tract, including interstitial cystitis. Some gynecologists also may treat patients with interstitial cystitis.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose interstitial cystitis?,"'Because the symptoms of IC/PBS are similar to those of other disorders of the urinary system and because there is no definitive test to identify IC/PBS, doctors must exclude other conditions before making a diagnosis of IC/PBS. Among the disorders to be excluded are urinary tract or vaginal infections, ''bladder cancer'', bladder inflammation or infection caused by ''radiation'' to the abdomen, eosinophilic and tuberculous cystitis, ''kidney stones'', ''endometriosis'', neurological disorders, ''sexually transmitted diseases'', ''urinary tract infection'' with small numbers of bacteria, and, in men, chronic bacterial and nonbacterial ''prostatitis''.''Medical tests that help identify other conditions include a ''urinalysis'', urine culture, cystoscopy, and biopsy of the bladder wall and, in men, laboratory examination of prostatic secretions.''Physical examination of an individual with IC/PBS may reveal tenderness of the bladder either when pushing on the abdomen over the bladder (just above the pubic bone) or during the pelvic examination in women. No specific physical findings are associated with IC/PBS.''Urinalysis and urine culture'': These tests can detect and identify the most common bacteria in the urine that may be causing symptoms. A health care professional obtains a urine sample either by catheterization or by the ""clean catch"" method. For a clean catch, the patient washes the genital area before collecting a sample of urine ""midstream"" in a sterile container. White and red blood cells and bacteria in the urine suggest an infection of the urinary tract that physicians can treat with antibiotics. If urine is sterile for weeks or months while symptoms persist, a doctor may consider a diagnosis of IC/PBS.''Culture of prostatic secretions'': In men, the doctor can obtain a sample of prostatic fluid. This fluid is examined under the microscope for signs of an infection such as red and white blood cells and can be cultured for bacteria. Antibiotics treat prostatic infections.''Potassium sensitivity test'': Doctors use a test known as the intravesical potassium sensitivity test (PST) in the evaluation of IC/PBS. In the PST test, health care professionals instill two different solutions (sterile water and a solution of potassium) separately into the bladder. The patient rates the severity of pain and/or urgency that occur when a health care professional instills each solution. People with normal bladder linings cannot tell the difference between the two solutions, while those with IBC/PBS and other conditions that affect the leakiness of the bladder wall will experience more pain when a health care provider injects the potassium solution into the bladder.''Cystoscopy under anesthesia with bladder distension'':''\xa0''During cystoscopy, the doctor uses a cystoscope -- an instrument made of a hollow tube about the diameter of a drinking straw with several lenses and a source of light - to look inside the bladder and urethra. The doctor will also distend or stretch the bladder to its capacity by filling it with a liquid or ''gas'"". Because bladder distension is painful in IC/PBS patients, before the doctor inserts the cystoscope through the urethra into the bladder, the patient must be given either regional or general anesthesia. Cystoscopy with distension of the bladder with fluid can detect inflammation (visually or with biopsies), a thick and stiff bladder wall, and Hunner's ulcers. After a health care professional drains fluid from the bladder, small red spots, called glomerulations, that represent enlarged blood vessels and pinpoint areas of bleeding can be seen in the bladder's lining.""""The doctor also may determine a patient's bladder capacity -- the maximum amount of liquid or gas the bladder can hold under anesthesia. (Without anesthesia, either pain or a severe urge to urinate limits capacity.) Most people without IC/PBS have normal or large maximum bladder capacities under anesthesia. A small bladder capacity (due to scarring) under anesthesia helps to support the diagnosis of IC/PBS.""'Cystoscopy has its limitations. Ulcers generally do not appear in mild or early cases of IC/PBS, and glomerulations have been observed in normal individuals without symptoms of IC/PBS. Due to these limitations, physicians recommend cystoscopy only to exclude other possible causes of symptoms and not as the definitive diagnostic test for IC/PBS.''It is important to note that the distension often performed with cystoscopy may lead to relief of symptoms in some patients with IC/PBS, which generally lasts from several weeks to months following the procedure.''Biopsy'': A biopsy is a microscopic examination of a small sample of tissue. A physician may remove samples of the bladder and urethra during cystoscopy and examine them with a microscope later. A biopsy helps to exclude ''bladder cancer''. It also may confirm the presence of mast cells or inflammation of the bladder wall that are consistent with a diagnosis of IC/PBS. Nevertheless, there is nothing on the biopsy that can make an absolute diagnosis of IC/PBS.' "
What is the treatment for interstitial cystitis?,"'Oral medications are one treatment option for IC/PBS. These include low doses of ''antidepressants'' of the tricyclic group such as ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil''). This is not due to a belief that IC/PBS is a psychological condition; rather, ''tricyclic antidepressants'' can help reduce the hyperactivation of nerves within the bladder wall. The antiseizure medication ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin'', Gabarone) also treats nerve-related pain and has sometimes been used to treat the pain of IC/PBS. Physicians may prescribe oral ''antihistamines'' such as ''loratadine'' (''Claritin'') to help reduce ''allergic'"" symptoms that may be worsening the patient's IC/PBS.""'For patients who may not respond well to amitriptyline, another type of oral medication that can be used is the heparinoid (''heparin''-like) drug ''pentosan'' polysulfate sodium (PPS; brand name ''Elmiron''). PPS is chemically similar to the substance that lines the bladder, and physicians believe that PPS assists in the protection of the inner lining cells of the bladder. It may take months before symptoms improve after treatment with this medication.''For those individuals who are unable to ''sleep'' well because of the discomfort of IC/PBS, antihistamines such as ''hydroxyzine'' can facilitate ''sleep''.''People sometimes use ''aspirin'' and ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') as a first line of defense against mild discomfort. However, they may make symptoms worse in some patients. ''Over-the-counter'' forms of ''phenazopyridine'' hydrochloride (Azo-Standard, Prodium, and ''Uristat'') may provide some relief from urinary pain, urgency, frequency, and burning. Higher doses of the drug are available by prescription as Prodium and phenazopyridine (Pyridium).''As mentioned previously, because some patients have noted an improvement in symptoms after bladder distension done to diagnose IC/PBS, sometimes health care professionals use bladder distension (termed hydrodistension) for therapy of IC/PBS. Hydrodistension helps reduce symptoms in many people with interstitial cystitis. (Studies have shown an improvement in 40%-80% of patients.) When it is effective, the relief of symptoms persists for several weeks to months after the procedure. Physicians usually perform it under anesthesia or heavy sedation because of discomfort, and some patients have a temporary worsening of symptoms following the procedure.''This procedure may also be called a bladder wash or bath. During a bladder instillation, the bladder is filled with a solution that is held for varying periods, from a few seconds to 15 minutes, before being drained through a narrow tube called a catheter.''In severe cases of IC/PBS, health care professionals administer intravesical solutions along with oral PPS to provide relief until the oral PPS has had time to take effect.''Drugs used for bladder instillations include dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, RIMSO-50), heparin, ''sodium bicarbonate'', PPS, and hydrocortisone (a steroid).''In severe cases of IC/PBS that do not respond well to oral medications or to bladder distension or instillation, other therapies may be attempted. A procedure known as sacral neuromodulation is effective in controlling symptoms in some people with IC/PBS. The term ""neuromodulation"" refers to an alteration of the nervous system. In sacral neuromodulation, a device is implanted that allows for stimulation of the nerves in the sacral (lower back) area. Sacral neuromodulation works by inhibiting the hyperactive signals from the sensory nerves within the bladder wall.''Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation'' (TENS) is a form of neuromodulation that does not involve surgical placement of wires or an impulse generator. With TENS, mild electric pulses enter the body for minutes to hours two or more times a day through wires placed on the surface of the lower back or the suprapubic region, between the navel and the pubic hair, or through special devices inserted into the vagina in women or into the rectum in men. Physicians believe that the electric pulses may increase blood flow to the bladder, strengthen pelvic muscles that help control the bladder, and trigger the release of hormones that block pain. TENS is generally more effective in reducing pain than in reducing urinary frequency.''Surgical procedures that may rarely be performed to treat severe IC/PBS include peripheral denervation (disrupting the nerves to and from the bladder wall), bladder augmentation to increase bladder capacity, and cystectomy (bladder removal) with diversion, or re-routing, of urine flow into an artificial bladder formed from a loop of intestine.'  "
Are there home remedies for interstitial cystitis?,"'There are a number of home remedies and self-care techniques that many people have found to be of benefit in controlling the ''symptoms of interstitial cystitis''/painful bladder syndrome. These include limiting the consumption of certain foods, ''smoking cessation'', ''exercise'', and bladder training.' "
Are lifestyle modifications of value in the management of interstitial cystitis?,"'There is no scientific evidence linking ''diet'' to IC/PBS, but doctors and patients believe that certain foods, including ''alcohol'', spices, ''chocolate'', and ''caffeinated'' and citrus ''beverages'', may contribute to bladder irritation and inflammation. Foods containing acid, for example, carbonated beverages, tomatoes, ''vitamin C'', citrus fruits and beverages, vinegar, cranberries, strawberries, grapes, guava, mango, and pineapple are believed to aggravate IC/PBS. Other foods that may increase symptoms because they contain the natural chemical tyramine include wine, beer, cheese, nuts, yogurt, bananas, ''soy'"" sauce, chicken livers, raisins, sour cream, avocados, canned figs, corned beef, fava beans, brewers' yeast, and chocolate.""'Some people with IC/PBS also have noticed a worsening of symptoms after eating or drinking products containing ''artificial sweeteners''. They may try eliminating such products from their ''diet'' and, if there is a reduction of symptoms, they can reintroduce them one at a time to determine which product seems to be aggravating their symptoms.''Many people with IC/PBS feel that ''smoking'' worsens their symptoms. (Because ''smoking'' is the major known cause of bladder ''cancer'', one of the best things a smoker can do for the bladder is to ''quit smoking''.)''Many IC/PBS patients feel that regular ''exercise'' helps relieve symptoms and, in some cases, hastens remission.''People who have found some relief from pain may then be able to reduce frequency using bladder training techniques. Methods vary, but the patient decides to urinate at designated times and uses relaxation techniques and distractions to help keep to the schedule. Gradually, the patient lengthens the time between urinations. A diary usually is helpful in keeping track of progress.' "
What is the prognosis (outcome) of interstitial cystitis?,"'IC/PBS is a chronic condition characterized by periods of relapse or flare-ups and remission. Doctors do not fully understand why the symptoms worsen at particular times or disappear and then reappear months or years later. Symptoms may be mild or severe and may vary in intensity even in the same individual over time. There is no cure for IC/PBS, and treatments aim to reduce the severity of symptoms.''There has been no treatment shown to be effective in slowing the progression of the disease or in preventing recurrences.' "
Is it possible to prevent interstitial cystitis?,"'Because doctors do not understand the cause, there are no known strategies for preventing IC/PBS. However, some self-care measures may help reduce the severity of symptoms (see section on home remedies).' "

What is interstitial lung disease?,"'Interstitial lung disease includes a group of diseases that have thickening of the supporting tissues between the air sacs of the ''lungs'' as the common factor. The interstitium is a thin layer of tissue that is normally appears as a fine lace on ''X-rays'' or imaging studies (best visualized as the appearance of a sponge).''Interstitial lung disease results from a variety of causes that lead to the thickening of the supporting tissue around the air sacs rather than the air sacs themselves. Interstitial lung disease usually involves all of the lungs diffusely rather than affecting only one area.''A disease of the interstitium is recognized on imaging studies as a thick lace (sponge), sometimes symmetric, and in other types, scattered and irregular.''Several terms related to interstitial lung disease have been used to describe this condition, including ""interstitial ''pneumonia''."" However, since ""''pneumonia''"" is usually associated with an infection, some doctors choose to use the term ""interstitial pneumonitis"" to refer to inflammation in the interstitial space since many of the causes of this inflammation are not infections. ""Interstitial fibrosis"" is the term used to refer to the scarring of the lungs that can result from prolonged interstitial inflammation. Interstitial lung disease can be acute (coming on suddenly) or chronic (occurring over time).' "
What are signs and symptoms of interstitial lung disease?,"'Symptoms and signs of interstitial lung disease occur because the damage to the interstitium of the lung impairs ''breathing'' function.''The two most common symptoms are ''shortness of breath'' and a dry (not producing sputum) ''cough''. These symptoms tend to come on gradually and progress.''Interstitial lung disease that has been present for a long time may cause signs and symptoms related to the lowering of the oxygen levels in the blood, such as ''clubbing'' of the fingertips and enlargement of the ''heart''.''The symptoms can also reflect the underlying disease process and assist in making a diagnosis. ''Fevers'', ''fatigue'', and ''weight loss'' are non-specific but can suggest an infectious process. It is often difficult to make a diagnosis from symptoms alone since so many lung diseases can present with shortness of breath and ''cough''.'  "
What causes interstitial lung disease?,"'Interstitial lung disease has a broad list of causes. The exact cause of interstitial lung disease is not always known (idiopathic). Some of the known common causes include toxins, environmental factors, chronic diseases, ''cancer'', and infections. Depending on the cause, interstitial lung disease can resolve or may lead to irreversible scarring and damage to the lungs.''Known causes of interstitial lung disease include the following:''Examples of idiopathic (unknown causes) forms of interstitial lung disease include:''The distinction among these idiopathic conditions is based on the exact pattern of lung damage, severity, and location of the disease.' Environmental factors, such as toxins like asbestos, mold, certain metals, silica dust, talc, grain dust, or bird droppings; an interstitial disease caused by some of these irritants is referred to as ""hypersensitivity pneumonitis"" Radiation therapy to the chest Certain medications, including some chemotherapy (cancer-fighting) medications and the heart medication amiodarone (Cordarone) Chronic autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and lupus Infections: One of the more common infectious causes of interstitial inflammation is the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Viruses, bacteria, and fungi can all cause interstitial inflammation. Cancer in some cases spreads throughout the lymph system in the lungs and appears as interstitial disease Congestive heart failure, renal failure both can present with similar findings due to excess fluid in the spongy tissue of the lung Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP), sometimes known as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) Usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) Sarcoidosis Lymphangiomyomatosis Langerhans cell histiocytosis"
How is interstitial lung disease diagnosed?,"'The typical symptoms and signs of interstitial lung disease, when they occur, should prompt a diagnostic work-up that includes a thorough medical history and physical examination, including blood tests to examine ''electrolyte'' levels and blood cells counts. There is such a wide variety of causes of interstitial lung disease that besides imaging studies, pulmonary function tests, a few blood tests, and often biopsy, other testing should be specific to the findings of a good history and physical.''A history of exposures to environmental toxins may be explored if there is no apparent cause of the symptoms. Often, the precise diagnosis comes from the history if extensive occupational, vocational, travel, and exposure history is obtained. For example, if a patient has signs and symptoms of a progressive ''cough'' and shortness of breath with radiologic findings of diffuse interstitial disease and enjoys raising and caring for pigeons, the likely diagnosis would be ''hypersensitivity pneumonitis'' (so called ""pigeon breeders lung"").''The precise diagnosis of interstitial lung disease may require more specific testing that can include imaging studies or tissue sampling. These rarely give a definitive diagnosis. Diagnostic studies that may be useful are:''In most major centers, this biopsy is performed by minimally invasive techniques referred to as video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). This usually only requires a brief hospital stay, sometimes less than 24 hours.' Imaging studies of the chest and lungs are often performed early in the process, when symptoms are apparent. Both chest X-rays and high resolution CT scans of the chest may be ordered. Depending on the history and exam, other testing may be beneficial. For instance, a patient may have arthritic complaints consistent with Rheumatoid arthritis. X-rays of the effected joints may be helpful. Echocardiogram is a test that can evaluate cardiac function as well as the pressures in the lung. This can be useful both for diagnosis and treatment. Sometimes blood tests can aid in the diagnosis and or treatment of these patients. Tests for collagen vascular disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), arterial blood gases, liver tests, and others may be beneficial. Noninvasive tests that measure lung function are known as pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The most common of these involves forcefully exhaling into a tube, on a device known as a spirometer, to measure lung volume and air flow. These PFTs are usually supplemented with more elaborate testing involving a device known as a body box. This helps measure more accurately the different lung volumes but also can measure gas exchange through the tissue of the lung (diffusing capacity or DLCO). Bronchoscopy is the direct visualization and examination of the airways of the lungs using a viewing tube. Biopsies (tissue samples) or washings of the airways are often obtained during this procedure for examination in the laboratory. Usually this does not get an accurate or definitive diagnosis, though it can be helpful to evaluate the possibility of infections, cancer, and sarcoidosis. Open lung biopsy is generally necessary if history and less invasive tests are non-diagnostic."
What is the treatment for interstitial lung disease?,"'The treatment of interstitial lung disease depends upon the cause. Definitive diagnosis is often essential since the treatment may involve:''Antibiotics may be given if a bacterial infection is responsible for the condition. Management of the underlying disease process is also essential in a person with interstitial lung disease related to these conditions. If the disease is thought to involve hypersensitivity, then the best therapy is an avoidance of this offending substance.''Depending upon the severity of the symptoms, respiratory support, including supplemental oxygen and even ventilator support, may be required. Respiratory therapists may be part of a treatment team with the goal of improving day to day function. ''Smoking cessation'' is an essential part of the treatment for anyone with interstitial lung disease.''Corticosteroids'' are sometimes used in an attempt to control interstitial inflammation. ''Drugs'' that modulate immune function, like ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), mycophenolate (''Cellcept'') may be given along with or following steroid treatment. These medications may help slow the progression of the disease, but they are unable to reverse the scarring in cases of long-standing interstitial lung disease. In severe cases with irreversible damage, lung transplantation may be indicated.''The disease of idiopathic ''pulmonary fibrosis'"" does not respond to any measures. The diagnosis can be made at times by the history, physical, and characteristic chest CT findings. Sometimes lung biopsy can be avoided if the patient's signs and symptoms present in the classic fashion. If this disease is strongly suspected or diagnosed referral to a tertiary center for transplant center is recommended for evaluation and possible therapeutic ""'research trials''.'   antimicrobial agents, immunosuppressing agents, avoidance behavior, chemotherapy, and in some, no therapy is available."
What is the prognosis for interstitial lung disease?,"'As mentioned previously, some forms of interstitial lung disease resolve completely, while others lead to long-term and irreversible scarring and lung damage with accompanying respiratory failure . ''Pulmonary hypertension'' is a form of ''high blood pressure'' that affects the arteries within the lungs. This form of ''hypertension'' can develop in cases of long-standing interstitial lung disease and can lead to enlargement of the heart and right-sided (the side of the heart that pumps blood back to the lungs to receive oxygen) ''heart failure'' (known as cor pulmonale). The prognosis is dependent upon the type and severity of interstitial lung disease as well as the underlying health status of the patient.' "
Can interstitial lung disease be prevented?,"'Interstitial lung disease can be prevented only to the extent that its individual causes may be prevented. For example, avoidance of known environmental toxins can help prevent lung damage from these exposures.' "
What is intertrigo?,"'Intertrigo is a very common inflammation affecting skin-on-skin contact, such as the groin, armpits, under the breasts (inframammary skin), and skin folds on the anterior torso (panniculus). These areas of skin that touch each other are referred to as the intertriginous zones. In ''obese'' individuals, skin folds may occur in a variety of other areas and so can be affected by intertrigo.' "
What causes intertrigo?,"'A combination of frictional rubbing, increased temperature, and moisture cause an irritant dermatitis known as simple intertrigo. Intertrigo can be complicated by various microorganisms, including yeasts (candidal intertrigo), dermatophytic fungal intertrigo, Gram-positive bacteria (erythrasma), as well as ''allergic'' and irritant reactions to various medications and chemicals. There are also some uncommon exotic dermatologic diseases that have a predilection to appear in the intertriginous zones. The differential diagnosis (other conditions that resemble intertrigo) include familial pemphigus, ''hidradenitis suppurativa'', ''inverse psoriasis'', staphylococcal or streptococcal ''impetigo'', and ''seborrheic dermatitis''. ''Group A strep'' can cause a rare form of streptococcal ''skin infection'' that produces a severe form of intertrigo affecting the neck creases, groin, perianal tissue, and toe webs of infants. Aggressive treatment is appropriate for these conditions.' "
What are risk factors for intertrigo?,"'Environmental factors play a major role in exacerbations of intertrigo. They include increases in temperature and humidity encountered most frequently during the summer months.''Activities such as ''bicycle riding'' or ''running'', which produce repetitive movements resulting in frictional forces which may injure the skin. Men are predisposed to intertrigo of the groin because of the occlusion produced by the male external genitalia. The presence of large folds of skin, such as those that result from ''obesity'', also enhances the likelihood of intertrigo.' "
What are intertrigo symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of intertrigo include ''itching'' and burning in the intertriginous zones. Occasionally, long-standing intertrigo may produce a musty smell. With intertrigo, these areas become inflamed and appear red-brown and sometimes scaly.'  "
What types of physicians diagnose and treat intertrigo?,"'Intertrigo can be diagnosed by most doctors purely on the basis of its appearance -- a red ''rash'' affecting one or more intertriginous areas. If the condition does not respond to conventional treatments, then a referral should be made to a dermatologist.' "
What are intertrigo home remedies and treatments?,"'Treatment of uncomplicated intertrigo primarily involves changing those environmental factors that have predisposed the patient to the condition. Areas of involvement are covered with a mild topical steroid like 1% hydrocortisone cream, which is available without a prescription (''over the counter'', or OTC), and then covered with zinc oxide paste or ointment (''Desitin'').'  "
What are complications of intertrigo?,"'Intertrigo may be complicated by a variety of infectious microorganisms that must be eliminated before the condition is likely to improve. Since ''fungal infections'' are very common in the intertriginous zones, it is important to perform appropriate tests (such as microscopically analyzing small scrapings of affected skin) to exclude this problem. Most dermatologists and some primary care physicians are able to perform potassium hydroxide mounts of scale obtained from the irritated skin right in the office and visualize the fungus under the microscope. There are a variety of other skin diseases that may present a picture similar to intertrigo but are treated quite differently. If the condition does not respond to the simple treatment methods listed above, further diagnostic procedures may have to be done to elucidate the true diagnosis. It is important to make the correct diagnosis in order to select the appropriate treatment. For example, if a yeast or dermatophyte fungus is present, then appropriate topical antifungal therapy is indicated. On the other hand, if a bacteria is involved, then antibiotics are appropriate either topically or orally.' "
What is the prognosis of intertrigo?,'If the patient is willing to change certain habits that may predispose to intertrigo the prognosis is quite good. It almost always resolves rapidly.' 
Is it possible to prevent intertrigo?,"""It's possible to prevent simple intertrigo by liberally applying a lubricating ointment like petrolatum directly into the intertriginous skin fold predisposed to irritation prior to any physical activity. Carefully drying the affected area after bathing or showering is also helpful. In ""'obese'' individuals with a large abdominal skin folds (panniculus), weight reduction and occasionally excisional surgery may diminish the folds, preventing intertrigo.' "
Introduction,'You have been informed by your healthcare provider that you will need to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of a medication to treat your health condition. ''The treatment for many conditions relies on medications administered by IV infusion therapy.' 
How do I prepare for the infusion?,"'Below are a few helpful suggestions to help you create a pleasant and healing experience. ''Check with your healthcare practitioner or the staff at the infusion center for any pre-infusion instructions. Some examples may include: '   The first and most important step is to replace confusion with confidence.  Make a list of questions that pertain to your health condition or questions about your medication and infusion to review with your healthcare practitioner. It may be necessary to make an appointment to review all of your questions.  Learn about the infused medication. There are many places to obtain information about your medication. Discuss the medication(s) with your doctor. Pharmaceutical companies often provide information in the offices and on the Internet for patients and their families. There may also be medical books written about your medication or health condition.  Visit the Infusion Center and meet the medical staff before your first infusion.  Drink plenty of water to be sure you are well hydrated. If you have a heart condition, kidney condition or any other health condition that prevents you from drinking large amounts of fluid, check with your healthcare practitioner for instructions on how to hydrate before your infusion procedure. Some infusions may require that you pre-medicate with medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Check with the infusion staff regarding any pre-medications you need to take prior to your infusion, the dose, and the best time to take the medications.  Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes. You will want to be comfortable, and most likely your vital signs will monitored (for example, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate (breathing rate), or a cardiac monitor may be attached to your chest). Every infusion center is different, so check with yours in regard to what to expect. Wearing loose fitting clothes allows the medical staff to easily and properly monitor your vital signs.  Consider wearing clothing with layers to allow for temperature control. The temperature of the infusion center may be cool or warm; also some intravenous infusions can make you feel either warm or cool. Having layers of clothing allows you the flexibility to easily control your comfort zone.  Most infusion centers will provide blankets, pillows, water and coffee. Check to see what the center provides in case they do not offer something that will make you more comfortable.  Do not wear any fragrance or perfume, other patients may be allergic. Bring a complete list of current medications, allergies, and emergency contact information for the infusion staff to add to your chart."
What are some things I can do to pass the time while receiving therapy?,"'Things to take or do:''PLEASE DO NOT TALK ON YOUR CELL PHONE'' - Place your phone on vibrate mode or turn it off. This is not a time for talking on the phone (unless you have an OK from the infusion staff).''Arrive at the infusion center with a:'  Book Magazine Newspaper Crossword puzzle or Suduko game Hand held games - (if they are quiet or have headphones) Bring your own music (I-pod or MP3 player) A neck pillow - the type used on airplanes Pictures of your family or loved ones Study for that upcoming test Bring your computer and get some work done, watch a movie, or play games. Snacks and a drink (if allowed in the infusion room) Bring paper and pen - make a list of things you need to do Write a letter -a letter of encouragement - of love - of thanks. Catch up on paper work Plan a party Make your shopping list Knit Crochet Draw or doodle Plan a trip Take a nap Pray Meditate Smile Positive attitude (you are in good hands). Personal affirmation - Find one that feels good and energizes you. For example: ""I have the perfect medicine...at the perfect time...I am healing."" Sit back and relax"
What happens during and after the infusion?,"'Be confident that you are receiving excellent care!' Ask questions and notify the staff immediately if you are not feeling ""right"" or have a concern.  Consider talking with someone in the Infusion Center receiving treatment. They may have some advice about their health condition that will help you. You may meet a new friend.  After your infusion is completed, ask for any important post infusion instructions. You may need to take post-infusion medications. Check with your healthcare practitioner or the infusion staff for detailed instructions.  A dressing will be placed in the area where your infusion was done. This dressing should be kept in place for at least 30 minutes or longer. If you are on a blood thinner, leave the dressing in place longer to avoid any bleeding. Check with the staff at the Infusion Center in regard to the length of time necessary to keep the dressing in place.

What causes belching or burping?,"'The ability to belch is almost universal. Belching, also known as burping (medically referred to as eructation), is the act of expelling gas from the stomach out through the mouth. The usual cause of belching is a distended (inflated) stomach caused by swallowed air. The distention of the stomach causes abdominal discomfort, and the belching expels the air and relieves the discomfort. The common reasons for swallowing large amounts of air (aerophagia) are gulping food or drink too rapidly, ''anxiety'', and carbonated ''beverages''. People are often unaware that they are swallowing air. ""Burping"" infants during bottle or ''breastfeeding'' is important in order to expel air in the stomach that has been swallowed with the formula or milk.''Excessive air in the stomach is not the only cause of belching. For some people, belching becomes a habit that does not reflect the amount of air in their stomachs. For others, belching is a response to any type of abdominal discomfort and not just to discomfort due to increased gas. Most people know that when they have mild abdominal discomfort, belching often relieves the problem. This is because excessive air in the stomach often is the cause of mild abdominal discomfort. As a result, people belch whenever they feel mild abdominal discomfort regardless of its cause.''Belching is not the simple act that many people think it is; it requires the coordination of several activities.''One unusual type of belching has been described in individuals who ''habitually belch''. It has been demonstrated that during their belches, air in the room enters the esophagus and is immediately expelled without even entering the stomach, giving rise to a belch. This in-and-out flow of air also is likely to be the explanation for the ability of many people to belch at will, even when there is little or no air in the stomach. Such belching is referred to as ''esophageal belching''.''If the problem causing the discomfort is not excessive air in the stomach, then belching does not provide relief from the discomfort. ''When belching does not ease the discomfort, it might be a sign that something may be wrong within the abdomen, and the cause of the discomfort should be sought. ''Belching by itself, however, does not help the physician determine what may be wrong because it can occur in virtually any abdominal disease or condition that causes abdominal discomfort.'   The larynx must be closed-off so that any liquid or food that might return with the air from the stomach won't get into the lungs. This is accomplished by voluntarily raising the larynx as is done when swallowing. Raising the larynx also relaxes the upper esophageal sphincter so that air can pass more easily from the esophagus into the throat. The lower esophageal sphincter must open so that air can pass from the stomach into the esophagus. While all this is occurring, the diaphragm descends just as it does when a person takes a breath. This increases abdominal pressure and decreases pressure in the chest. The changes in pressure promote the flow of air from the stomach in the abdomen to the esophagus in the chest."
What causes bloating?,"'It is important to distinguish between bloating and distention.''In some instances, bloating may represent a mild form of distention since the abdomen does not become physically (visibly or measurably) enlarged until its volume increases by one quart. Bloating and even mild cases of distention may be caused by relaxation of the abdominal wall muscles and downward movement of the diaphragm.''There are three causes of abdominal distention: an increase in 1) air, 2) fluid, or 3) tissue within the abdomen. The diseases or conditions that cause these increases are very different from one another. Therefore, it is important to determine whether air, fluid, or tissue is distending the abdomen.''There are two types of distention: continuous and intermittent.'   Bloating is the subjective sensation (feeling) that the abdomen is full or larger than normal and, thus, is akin to the symptom of discomfort. In contrast, distention is the objective determination (physical finding) that the abdomen is larger than normal. Distention can be determined by such observations as the inability to fit into clothes, the need to loosen the belt or looking down at the stomach and noting that it is clearly larger than normal. Continuous distention may be caused by the enlargement of an intra-abdominal (within the abdomen) organ, an intra-abdominal tumor, a collection of fluid within the peritoneal cavity, the space that surrounds the intra-abdominal organs (ascites), or just plain obesity. Intermittent distention is usually due to the accumulation of gas and/or occasionally, fluid within the stomach, small intestine, or colon."
What causes flatulence (gas)?,"'Flatulence, also known as farting, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the anus. The average person farts less than 20 times per day. Gas in the gastrointestinal tract has only two sources. It is either swallowed air or is produced by bacteria that normally inhabit the intestines, primarily the colon. Swallowed air rarely is the cause of excessive flatulence.''The source of excessive gas is intestinal bacteria. The bacteria produce the gas (primarily hydrogen and/or methane) when they digest foods, primarily sugars and nondigestible polysaccharides (for example, starch, cellulose), that have not been digested during passage through the small intestine. The bacteria also produce carbon dioxide, but the carbon dioxide is so rapidly absorbed from the intestine that very little passes in flatus.''Sugars''Sugars that are commonly digested poorly (maldigested) and malabsorbed are lactose, ''sorbitol'', and fructose.''Polysaccharides''Starches are another common source of intestinal gas. Starches are polysaccharides that are produced by plants and are composed of long chains of sugars, primarily fructose. Common sources of different types of starch include wheat, oats, potatoes, ''corn'', and rice.''Individuals continuously swallow small amounts of air, and bacteria constantly produce gas. Contractions of the intestinal muscles normally propel the gas through the intestines and cause the gas to be expelled. Flatulence (passing intestinal gas) prevents gas from accumulating in the intestines.''However, there are two other ways in which gas can escape the intestine besides flatulence.'   Lactose is the sugar in milk. The absence of the enzyme lactase in the lining of the intestines, which is a genetic trait, causes the maldigestion. Lactase is important because it breaks apart the lactose into its two component sugars, glucose and galactose, so that they can be absorbed. Sorbitol is a commonly used sweetener in low-calorie foods. Fructose, primarily as high-fructose corn syrup, is a commonly used sweetener in all types of candies and drinks. It also may be found in higher amounts in some fruits and vegetables. Rice is the most easily digested starch, and little undigested rice starch reaches the colon and the colonic bacteria. Accordingly, the consumption of rice produces little gas. In contrast, some of the starches in wheat, oats, potatoes, and, to a lesser extent, corn, all may reach the colon. These starches, therefore, may result in the production of appreciable amounts of gas. The starch in whole grains produces more gas than the starch in refined (purified) grains. Thus, more gas is formed after eating foods made with whole wheat flour than with refined wheat flour. This difference in gas production probably occurs because of the fiber (similar to a complex starch) present in the whole grain flour. Much of this fiber is removed during the processing of whole grains into refined flour. Finally, certain fruits and vegetables, for example, beans and cabbage, also contain poorly digested starches that reach the colon and are easily converted by bacteria into gas. Most vegetables and fruits contain cellulose, another type of polysaccharide that is not digested at all as it passes through the small intestine. However, unlike sugars and other starches, cellulose is used only very slowly by colonic bacteria. Therefore, the production of gas after the consumption of fruits and vegetables usually is not great unless the fruits and vegetables also contain sugars or polysaccharides other than cellulose. First, it can be absorbed across the lining of the intestine into the blood. The gas then travels in the blood and ultimately is excreted by the lungs in the breath. Second, gas can be removed and used by certain types of bacteria within the intestine. In fact, most of the gas that is formed by bacteria in the intestines is removed by other bacteria in the intestines. (Thank goodness!)"
What foods cause gas?,"'Foods that cause gas fall into a category summarized by the acronym, ''FODMAP'', which stands for ""fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols."" Many people attempt a FODMAP elimination ''diet'', but it can be difficult to eliminate these dietary constituents because they are present in a majority of foods. Any condition causing flatulence will respond to a low-FODMAP diet, but the diet is not an easy one to follow, and may require the assistance of a dietitian. If the diet is successful it may be possible to add back some of the excluded foods without a recurrence of flatulence. Examples of FODMAP foods include:''With such an extensive list of foods to be avoided, it is no surprise that a low-FODMAP diet is difficult to initiate and maintain. That is why it is most important to look for a medical condition that is responsible for the excessive gas.' Oligosaccharides: Vegetables such as asparagus, garlic, leeks, onions, and lettuce. Grains such as barley, rye, and wheat. Nuts such as cashews and pistachios. Legumes such as baked beans, kidney beans, chickpeas, lentils, and soy beans Disaccharides: Milk (cow, goat or sheep, evaporated milk, ice cream, margarine, yogurt, and cheese Monosaccharides: Primarily fruits such as apples, boysenberries, figs, mangoes, pears, and watermelon, as well as high-fructose corn syrup and honey Polyols: Fruits such as apples, apricots, blackberries, cherries, peaches, pears, nectarines, plums, and avocados; sweeteners such as sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol; as well as cauliflower, green pepper, mushrooms, and pumpkin"
What causes intermittent abdominal bloating/distention?,"'Excessive production of gas by bacteria is a common cause of intermittent abdominal distention and bloating. Theoretically bacteria can produce too much gas in three ways.''Excessive production of gas by bacteria usually is accompanied by flatulence. Increased flatulence may not always occur; however, gas can be eliminated in other ways such as absorption into the body, utilization by other bacteria, or possibly, by elimination at night without the awareness of the gas passer.''An obstruction (blockage) can occur virtually anywhere from the stomach to the rectum. When the blockage is temporary or partial, it can cause intermittent abdominal bloating/distention. For example, scarring of the pylorus (pyloric stenosis) can obstruct the opening from the stomach into the intestines, thereby blocking the complete emptying of the stomach. After meals, the stomach is normally filled with food and swallowed air. Then, during the next hour or two, the stomach secretes acid and fluid, which mix with the food and assist in digestion. As a result, the stomach distends further. When the obstruction is incomplete, the food, air, and fluid eventually pass into the intestines and the bloating/distention resolves.''An obstruction in the small bowel, which is most commonly due to adhesions (scarring that kinks the intestines) from a previous surgery, is another cause of intermittent abdominal distention. To make matters worse, the distention that is caused by the physical obstruction stimulates both the stomach and intestines to secrete fluid, which adds to the distention.''Severe ''constipation'' or fecal impaction (hardened ''stool'' in the rectum) also can obstruct the flow of the intestinal contents and result in distention. In this case, however, the bloating or distention usually is constant and progressive, and is relieved by bowel movements or removal of the impacted ''stool''.''A functional obstruction is not caused by an actual physical blockage, but rather by the poor functioning of the muscles of the stomach or intestines that propel the intestinal contents. When these muscles are not working normally, the intestinal contents will accumulate and distend the abdomen. Examples of functional obstruction include:''Accumulating evidence shows that some patients with abdominal bloating and distention due to gas may have a functional abnormality of the intestinal muscles that prevents gas from being normally transported through the intestine and expelled. Instead, their gas accumulates in the intestine. Among patients with ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') with abdominal bloating or distention as an important symptom, the gas accumulates in the small intestine and not the colon. The gas accumulates during the day and is greatest in the evening.''Fats'' in food have an effect on the intestine that mimics a functional obstruction. Dietary fat reaching the small intestine causes transport of digesting food, gas, and liquid within the intestines to slow. This can promote the accumulation of food, gas, and liquid, and lead to bloating and/or distention.''Dietary fiber or fiber used for treating ''constipation'' can cause bloating without increasing the production of gas in the intestine. Some believe that this sensation of bloating (and possibly even distention) is caused by ''high-fiber foods'', which slow the passage of gas through the intestine. Of course, some types of fiber may lead to increased production of gas because they are digested to some extent by the colonic bacteria.''Intestinal hypersensitivity''Some people appear to be very sensitive (hypersensitive) to distention of their intestines, and they may feel ''bloated'' even with normal amounts of digesting food, gas, and fluid in the intestine after a meal. The bloating may become aggravated or even progress to distention if the meal contains substantial amounts of fat, perhaps because fat slows the transit of gas and digestion of food out of the stomach and small intestine.' First, the amount of gas that bacteria produce may vary from individual to individual. In other words, some individuals may have bacteria that produce more gas, either because there are more of the bacteria or because their particular bacteria are better at producing gas. Second, there may be poor digestion and absorption of foods in the small intestine, allowing more undigested food to reach the bacteria in the colon. The more undigested food the bacteria have, the more gas they produce. Examples of diseases that involve poor digestion and absorption include lactose intolerance, pancreatic insufficiency, and untreated celiac disease. Third, bacterial overgrowth can occur in the small intestine. Under normal conditions, the bacteria that produce gas are limited to the colon. In some conditions, these bacteria spread back into the small intestine. When this bacterial spread occurs, food reaches the bacteria before it can be fully digested and absorbed by the small intestine. Therefore, the colonic-type bacteria that have moved into the small intestine have a lot of undigested food from which to form gas. This condition, in which the gas-producing bacteria move into the small intestine, is called bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Gastroparesis (paralysis of the stomach) of diabetes Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, an unusual condition in which the muscles of the small intestine do not work normally Hirschsprung's disease, mostly seen in infants, in which a small stretch of colonic muscle does not contract normally due to missing nerves"
"Which specialties of doctors treat excessive gas, gas pain, belching, bloating, and flatulence?","'Excessive gas, gas pain, belching, bloating, and flatulence are usually treated by a ''gastroenterologist''. Often a dietitian can be of great help in dealing with specialized diets and identifying foods that can be most at fault.' "
"How are the causes of belching, bloating/distention, and flatulence evaluated?","""A patient's medical history is important because it directs the evaluation.""'Simple ''X-rays'' of the abdomen, particularly if they are taken during an episode of bloating or distention, often can confirm air as the cause of the distention, since large amounts of air can be seen easily within the stomach and intestine. Moreover, the cause of the problem may be suggested by noting where the gas has accumulated. For example, if the air is in the stomach, emptying of the stomach is likely to be the problem.''X-rays of the small intestine, in which barium is used to fill and outline the small intestine, are particularly useful for determining whether there is an obstruction of the small intestine.''These studies measure the ability of the stomach to empty its contents. For gastric emptying studies, a test meal that is labeled with a radioactive substance is eaten and a Geiger counter-like device is placed over the abdomen to measure how rapidly the test meal empties from the stomach. A delay in emptying of the radioactivity from the stomach can be caused by any condition that reduces emptying of the stomach (for example, pyloric stenosis, gastroparesis).''Imaging studies, including ''ultrasound'' examination, ''computerized tomography'' (CT), and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), are particularly useful in defining the cause of distention that is due to enlargement of the abdominal organs, abdominal fluid, and tumor.''Two types of tests are used to diagnose maldigestion and malabsorption: general tests and specific tests.''The best ''general test ''is a 72-hour collection of stool in which the fat is measured; if maldigestion and/or malabsorption exist because of pancreatic insufficiency or diseases of the lining of the small intestine (for example, ''celiac disease''), the amount of fat will increase before proteins and starches in the stool.''Specific tests'' can be done for maldigestion of individual sugars that are commonly maldigested, including lactose (the ''sugar'' in milk) and sorbitol (a sweetener in low-calorie foods). The specific tests require ingestion of the sugars followed by hydrogen/methane breath testing. (See below.) The sugar fructose, a commonly used sweetener, like lactose and sorbitol, also may cause abdominal bloating/distention and flatulence. However, the problem that can occur with fructose is different from that with lactose or sorbitol. Thus, as already described, lactose and sorbitol may be poorly digested by the pancreatic enzymes and small intestine. Fructose, on the other hand, may be digested normally but may pass so rapidly through the small intestine that there is not enough time for digestion and absorption to take place.''The most convenient way to test for bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine is hydrogen/methane breath testing. Normally, the gas produced by the bacteria of the colon is composed of hydrogen and/or methane. For hydrogen/methane breath testing, a non-digestible sugar, ''lactulose'', is consumed. At regular intervals following ingestion, samples of breath are taken for analysis. When the lactulose reaches the colon, the bacteria form hydrogen and/or methane. Some of the hydrogen or methane is absorbed into the blood and eliminated in the breath where it can be measured in the breath samples.''In normal individuals, there is one peak of hydrogen or methane when the lactulose enters the colon. In individuals who have bacterial overgrowth, there are two peaks of hydrogen or methane. The first occurs when the lactulose passes and is exposed to the bacteria in the small intestine. The second occurs when the lactulose enters the colon and is exposed to the colonic bacteria. Hydrogen breath testing for overgrowth also may be done utilizing lactose, glucose, sorbitol, or fructose as the test sugar.' If the bloating or distention is continuous rather than intermittent, then enlargement of abdominal organs, abdominal fluid, tumors, or obesity are causes to be considered. If the bloating or distention is associated with increased flatulence, then bacteria and excessive gas production are likely factors. If a diet history reveals the consumption of large amounts of milk or dairy products (lactose), sorbitol, or fructose, then the maldigestion and malabsorption of these sugars may be the cause of the distention. When individuals complain of flatulence, it may be useful for them to count the number of times they pass gas for several days. This count can confirm the presence of excessive flatulence since the number of times gas is passed correlates with the total amount (volume) of passed gas. As you might imagine, it is not easy to measure the amount of passed gas. It is normal to pass gas up to 20 times a day. (The average volume of gas passed daily is estimated to be about ¾ of a quart.) If an individual complains of excessive gas but passes gas fewer than 20 times per day, the problem is likely to be something other than too much gas. For example, the problem may be the foul odor of the gas (often due to ingestion of sulfur-containing foods), the lack of ability to control (hold back) the passing of gas, or the soiling of underwear with small amounts of stool when passing gas. All of these problems, like excessive gas, are socially embarrassing and may prompt individuals to consult a doctor. These problems, however, are not due to excessive gas production, and their treatment is different."
"What is the treatment for excessive intestinal gas caused by medical 
conditions?","'The treatment of excessive intestinal gas depends on the cause.'   If maldigestion and/or malabsorption is caused by disease of the intestinal lining, the specific disease must be identified, most commonly through a small bowel biopsy. Then, treatment can be targeted for that condition. For example, if celiac disease is found on the biopsy, a gluten-free diet can be started. If there is a physical obstruction to the emptying of the stomach or passage of food, liquid, and gas through the small intestine, then surgical correction of the obstruction is required. If the obstruction is functional, medications that promote activity of the muscles of the stomach and small intestine are given. Examples of these medicines are erythromycin or metoclopramide (Reglan). Bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel usually is treated with antibiotics. However, this treatment is frequently only temporarily effective or not effective at all. When antibiotics provide only a temporary benefit, it may be necessary to treat patients intermittently or even continuously with antibiotics. If antibiotics are not effective, probiotics (for example, lactobacillus) or prebiotics can be tried although their use in bacterial overgrowth has not been studied. This condition may be difficult to treat."
What natural or home remedies help soothe and get rid of intestinal gas?," If there is maldigestion of specific sugars -- lactose, sorbitol, or fructose -- the offending sugars can be eliminated from the diet. In the case of lactose in milk, an alternative treatment is available. People with lactose intolerance can add enzymes that are similar to intestinal lactase to the milk prior to drinking it in order to break down the lactose into glucose and galactose so that it can be absorbed normally. Some people find that yogurt, in which the lactose has been broken down partially by bacteria, produces less gas than milk. There also are certain types of vegetables and fruits that contain types of starches that are poorly digested by people but well digested by bacteria. These include beans, lentils, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, onions, carrots, apricots, and prunes. Reducing the intake of these vegetables and fruits, as well as foods made from whole grains, should reduce gas and flatulence. However, the list of gas-producing foods is rather long, and it may be difficult to eliminate them all without severely restricting the diet."
What over-the-counter (OTC) products are available to soothe and cure excessive gas?," An interesting form of treatment for excessive gas is alpha-D-galactosidase, an enzyme that is produced by a mold. This enzyme, commercially available as Beano, is consumed as either a liquid or tablet with meals. This enzyme is able to break down some of the difficult-to-digest polysaccharides in vegetables so that they may be absorbed. This prevents them from reaching the colonic bacteria and causing unnecessary production of gas. Beano has been shown to be effective in decreasing the amount of intestinal gas. Two other types of treatment have been promoted for the treatment of gas; simethicone (Phazyme; Flatulex; Mylicon; Gas-X; Mylanta Gas) and activated charcoal. It is unclear whether simethicone has an effect on gas in the stomach. However, it has no effect on the formation of gas in the colon. Moreover, in the stomach, simethicone would be expected only to affect swallowed air, which, as previously mentioned, is an uncommon cause of excessive intestinal gas. Nevertheless, some individuals are convinced that simethicone helps them. Activated charcoal has been shown to reduce the formation of gas in the colon, though the way in which it does so is unknown. When maldigestion is due to pancreatic insufficiency, then supplemental pancreatic enzymes can be ingested with meals to replace the missing enzymes."
What's new in intestinal gas?,"""One study has shed additional light on the role of intestinal gas and the way in which it causes symptoms. Investigators studied 30 patients whose primary complaint was flatulence (although they also had other complaints such as abdominal bloating, distension, and/or discomfort), and 20 healthy people (controls) without issues related to gas. The investigators studied the patients' and controls' production of gas and symptoms on their normal (basal) diet, during and following a standard meal, and during and following a meal that contained foods known to cause more gas (""'flatulent'' diet). During the basal period on their usual diet, not surprisingly, the patients had more symptoms than the controls and evacuated gas (farted) more often than controls (22 vs. 7 times during the day). Interestingly, however, the patients and controls produced the same total volume of gas while on the standard meal. This would suggest that the patients were NOT producing more gas than the controls. Two explanations for these observations would be 1) that the basal diet contained more gas-producing foods, or 2) that patients were more sensitive to gas; in other words, they developed more discomfort producing the same amount of gas as controls (farting more frequently, but with less gas per fart).''On the flatulogenic diet, the controls developed some symptoms, but the patients, not surprisingly, developed worse symptoms. The number of farts increased for both patients and controls but more so for the patients (44 vs. 22 farts, respectively). Nevertheless, the total amount of gas that was produced on the flatulogenic diet was the same for controls and patients. This supported the probability that patients were more sensitive to gas, i.e., they developed more symptoms, and farted more even though they were producing the same amount of gas as controls.''The observations made in this study add considerably to our understanding of intestinal gas and the mechanism whereby gas causes symptoms. In the group of patients that was studied, the symptoms were caused by an abnormal sensitivity to gas and not to the production of more gas. It is important to recognize, however, that although this may be the mechanism for production of symptoms in this group of patients, there are undoubtedly other explanations or contributing factors in other patients with symptoms and flatulence. For example and as explained previously, some patients may retain more gas in the abdomen due to problems with the intestinal muscles leading to intestinal distention and discomfort. Some patients may be on a flatulogenic diet without realizing it, and some patients may indeed be producing more gas than others on the same diet.' "

Any condition causing flatulence will respond to a low-FODMAP diet, but the diet is not an easy one to follow, and may require the assistance of a dietitian. If the diet is successful it may be possible to add back some of the excluded foods without a recurrence of flatulence. Examples of FODMAP foods include:''With such an extensive list of foods to be avoided, it is no surprise that a low-FODMAP diet is difficult to initiate and maintain. That is why it is most important to look for a medical condition that is responsible for the excessive gas.' Oligosaccharides: Vegetables such as asparagus, garlic, leeks, onions, and lettuce. Grains such as barley, rye, and wheat. Nuts such as cashews and pistachios. Legumes such as baked beans, kidney beans, chickpeas, lentils, and soy beans Disaccharides: Milk (cow, goat or sheep, evaporated milk, ice cream, margarine, yogurt, and cheese Monosaccharides: Primarily fruits such as apples, boysenberries, figs, mangoes, pears, and watermelon, as well as high-fructose corn syrup and honey Polyols: Fruits such as apples, apricots, blackberries, cherries, peaches, pears, nectarines, plums, and avocados; sweeteners such as sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol; as well as cauliflower, green pepper, mushrooms, and pumpkin"
What causes intermittent abdominal bloating/distention?,"'Excessive production of gas by bacteria is a common cause of intermittent abdominal distention and bloating. Theoretically bacteria can produce too much gas in three ways.''Excessive production of gas by bacteria usually is accompanied by flatulence. Increased flatulence may not always occur; however, gas can be eliminated in other ways such as absorption into the body, utilization by other bacteria, or possibly, by elimination at night without the awareness of the gas passer.''An obstruction (blockage) can occur virtually anywhere from the stomach to the rectum. When the blockage is temporary or partial, it can cause intermittent abdominal bloating/distention. For example, scarring of the pylorus (pyloric stenosis) can obstruct the opening from the stomach into the intestines, thereby blocking the complete emptying of the stomach. After meals, the stomach is normally filled with food and swallowed air. Then, during the next hour or two, the stomach secretes acid and fluid, which mix with the food and assist in digestion. As a result, the stomach distends further. When the obstruction is incomplete, the food, air, and fluid eventually pass into the intestines and the bloating/distention resolves.''An obstruction in the small bowel, which is most commonly due to adhesions (scarring that kinks the intestines) from a previous surgery, is another cause of intermittent abdominal distention. To make matters worse, the distention that is caused by the physical obstruction stimulates both the stomach and intestines to secrete fluid, which adds to the distention.''Severe ''constipation'' or fecal impaction (hardened ''stool'' in the rectum) also can obstruct the flow of the intestinal contents and result in distention. In this case, however, the bloating or distention usually is constant and progressive, and is relieved by bowel movements or removal of the impacted ''stool''.''A functional obstruction is not caused by an actual physical blockage, but rather by the poor functioning of the muscles of the stomach or intestines that propel the intestinal contents. When these muscles are not working normally, the intestinal contents will accumulate and distend the abdomen. Examples of functional obstruction include:''Accumulating evidence shows that some patients with abdominal bloating and distention due to gas may have a functional abnormality of the intestinal muscles that prevents gas from being normally transported through the intestine and expelled. Instead, their gas accumulates in the intestine. Among patients with ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') with abdominal bloating or distention as an important symptom, the gas accumulates in the small intestine and not the colon. The gas accumulates during the day and is greatest in the evening.''Fats'' in food have an effect on the intestine that mimics a functional obstruction. Dietary fat reaching the small intestine causes transport of digesting food, gas, and liquid within the intestines to slow. This can promote the accumulation of food, gas, and liquid, and lead to bloating and/or distention.''Dietary fiber or fiber used for treating ''constipation'' can cause bloating without increasing the production of gas in the intestine. Some believe that this sensation of bloating (and possibly even distention) is caused by ''high-fiber foods'', which slow the passage of gas through the intestine. Of course, some types of fiber may lead to increased production of gas because they are digested to some extent by the colonic bacteria.''Intestinal hypersensitivity''Some people appear to be very sensitive (hypersensitive) to distention of their intestines, and they may feel ''bloated'' even with normal amounts of digesting food, gas, and fluid in the intestine after a meal. The bloating may become aggravated or even progress to distention if the meal contains substantial amounts of fat, perhaps because fat slows the transit of gas and digestion of food out of the stomach and small intestine.' First, the amount of gas that bacteria produce may vary from individual to individual. In other words, some individuals may have bacteria that produce more gas, either because there are more of the bacteria or because their particular bacteria are better at producing gas. Second, there may be poor digestion and absorption of foods in the small intestine, allowing more undigested food to reach the bacteria in the colon. The more undigested food the bacteria have, the more gas they produce. Examples of diseases that involve poor digestion and absorption include lactose intolerance, pancreatic insufficiency, and untreated celiac disease. Third, bacterial overgrowth can occur in the small intestine. Under normal conditions, the bacteria that produce gas are limited to the colon. In some conditions, these bacteria spread back into the small intestine. When this bacterial spread occurs, food reaches the bacteria before it can be fully digested and absorbed by the small intestine. Therefore, the colonic-type bacteria that have moved into the small intestine have a lot of undigested food from which to form gas. This condition, in which the gas-producing bacteria move into the small intestine, is called bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Gastroparesis (paralysis of the stomach) of diabetes Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, an unusual condition in which the muscles of the small intestine do not work normally Hirschsprung's disease, mostly seen in infants, in which a small stretch of colonic muscle does not contract normally due to missing nerves"
"Which specialties of doctors treat excessive gas, gas pain, belching, bloating, and flatulence?","'Excessive gas, gas pain, belching, bloating, and flatulence are usually treated by a ''gastroenterologist''. Often a dietitian can be of great help in dealing with specialized diets and identifying foods that can be most at fault.' "
"How are the causes of belching, bloating/distention, and flatulence evaluated?","""A patient's medical history is important because it directs the evaluation.""'Simple ''X-rays'' of the abdomen, particularly if they are taken during an episode of bloating or distention, often can confirm air as the cause of the distention, since large amounts of air can be seen easily within the stomach and intestine. Moreover, the cause of the problem may be suggested by noting where the gas has accumulated. For example, if the air is in the stomach, emptying of the stomach is likely to be the problem.''X-rays of the small intestine, in which barium is used to fill and outline the small intestine, are particularly useful for determining whether there is an obstruction of the small intestine.''These studies measure the ability of the stomach to empty its contents. For gastric emptying studies, a test meal that is labeled with a radioactive substance is eaten and a Geiger counter-like device is placed over the abdomen to measure how rapidly the test meal empties from the stomach. A delay in emptying of the radioactivity from the stomach can be caused by any condition that reduces emptying of the stomach (for example, pyloric stenosis, gastroparesis).''Imaging studies, including ''ultrasound'' examination, ''computerized tomography'' (CT), and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), are particularly useful in defining the cause of distention that is due to enlargement of the abdominal organs, abdominal fluid, and tumor.''Two types of tests are used to diagnose maldigestion and malabsorption: general tests and specific tests.''The best ''general test ''is a 72-hour collection of stool in which the fat is measured; if maldigestion and/or malabsorption exist because of pancreatic insufficiency or diseases of the lining of the small intestine (for example, ''celiac disease''), the amount of fat will increase before proteins and starches in the stool.''Specific tests'' can be done for maldigestion of individual sugars that are commonly maldigested, including lactose (the ''sugar'' in milk) and sorbitol (a sweetener in low-calorie foods). The specific tests require ingestion of the sugars followed by hydrogen/methane breath testing. (See below.) The sugar fructose, a commonly used sweetener, like lactose and sorbitol, also may cause abdominal bloating/distention and flatulence. However, the problem that can occur with fructose is different from that with lactose or sorbitol. Thus, as already described, lactose and sorbitol may be poorly digested by the pancreatic enzymes and small intestine. Fructose, on the other hand, may be digested normally but may pass so rapidly through the small intestine that there is not enough time for digestion and absorption to take place.''The most convenient way to test for bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine is hydrogen/methane breath testing. Normally, the gas produced by the bacteria of the colon is composed of hydrogen and/or methane. For hydrogen/methane breath testing, a non-digestible sugar, ''lactulose'', is consumed. At regular intervals following ingestion, samples of breath are taken for analysis. When the lactulose reaches the colon, the bacteria form hydrogen and/or methane. Some of the hydrogen or methane is absorbed into the blood and eliminated in the breath where it can be measured in the breath samples.''In normal individuals, there is one peak of hydrogen or methane when the lactulose enters the colon. In individuals who have bacterial overgrowth, there are two peaks of hydrogen or methane. The first occurs when the lactulose passes and is exposed to the bacteria in the small intestine. The second occurs when the lactulose enters the colon and is exposed to the colonic bacteria. Hydrogen breath testing for overgrowth also may be done utilizing lactose, glucose, sorbitol, or fructose as the test sugar.' If the bloating or distention is continuous rather than intermittent, then enlargement of abdominal organs, abdominal fluid, tumors, or obesity are causes to be considered. If the bloating or distention is associated with increased flatulence, then bacteria and excessive gas production are likely factors. If a diet history reveals the consumption of large amounts of milk or dairy products (lactose), sorbitol, or fructose, then the maldigestion and malabsorption of these sugars may be the cause of the distention. When individuals complain of flatulence, it may be useful for them to count the number of times they pass gas for several days. This count can confirm the presence of excessive flatulence since the number of times gas is passed correlates with the total amount (volume) of passed gas. As you might imagine, it is not easy to measure the amount of passed gas. It is normal to pass gas up to 20 times a day. (The average volume of gas passed daily is estimated to be about ¾ of a quart.) If an individual complains of excessive gas but passes gas fewer than 20 times per day, the problem is likely to be something other than too much gas. For example, the problem may be the foul odor of the gas (often due to ingestion of sulfur-containing foods), the lack of ability to control (hold back) the passing of gas, or the soiling of underwear with small amounts of stool when passing gas. All of these problems, like excessive gas, are socially embarrassing and may prompt individuals to consult a doctor. These problems, however, are not due to excessive gas production, and their treatment is different."
"What is the treatment for excessive intestinal gas caused by medical 
conditions?","'The treatment of excessive intestinal gas depends on the cause.'   If maldigestion and/or malabsorption is caused by disease of the intestinal lining, the specific disease must be identified, most commonly through a small bowel biopsy. Then, treatment can be targeted for that condition. For example, if celiac disease is found on the biopsy, a gluten-free diet can be started. If there is a physical obstruction to the emptying of the stomach or passage of food, liquid, and gas through the small intestine, then surgical correction of the obstruction is required. If the obstruction is functional, medications that promote activity of the muscles of the stomach and small intestine are given. Examples of these medicines are erythromycin or metoclopramide (Reglan). Bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel usually is treated with antibiotics. However, this treatment is frequently only temporarily effective or not effective at all. When antibiotics provide only a temporary benefit, it may be necessary to treat patients intermittently or even continuously with antibiotics. If antibiotics are not effective, probiotics (for example, lactobacillus) or prebiotics can be tried although their use in bacterial overgrowth has not been studied. This condition may be difficult to treat."
What natural or home remedies help soothe and get rid of intestinal gas?," If there is maldigestion of specific sugars -- lactose, sorbitol, or fructose -- the offending sugars can be eliminated from the diet. In the case of lactose in milk, an alternative treatment is available. People with lactose intolerance can add enzymes that are similar to intestinal lactase to the milk prior to drinking it in order to break down the lactose into glucose and galactose so that it can be absorbed normally. Some people find that yogurt, in which the lactose has been broken down partially by bacteria, produces less gas than milk. There also are certain types of vegetables and fruits that contain types of starches that are poorly digested by people but well digested by bacteria. These include beans, lentils, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, onions, carrots, apricots, and prunes. Reducing the intake of these vegetables and fruits, as well as foods made from whole grains, should reduce gas and flatulence. However, the list of gas-producing foods is rather long, and it may be difficult to eliminate them all without severely restricting the diet."
What over-the-counter (OTC) products are available to soothe and cure excessive gas?," An interesting form of treatment for excessive gas is alpha-D-galactosidase, an enzyme that is produced by a mold. This enzyme, commercially available as Beano, is consumed as either a liquid or tablet with meals. This enzyme is able to break down some of the difficult-to-digest polysaccharides in vegetables so that they may be absorbed. This prevents them from reaching the colonic bacteria and causing unnecessary production of gas. Beano has been shown to be effective in decreasing the amount of intestinal gas. Two other types of treatment have been promoted for the treatment of gas; simethicone (Phazyme; Flatulex; Mylicon; Gas-X; Mylanta Gas) and activated charcoal. It is unclear whether simethicone has an effect on gas in the stomach. However, it has no effect on the formation of gas in the colon. Moreover, in the stomach, simethicone would be expected only to affect swallowed air, which, as previously mentioned, is an uncommon cause of excessive intestinal gas. Nevertheless, some individuals are convinced that simethicone helps them. Activated charcoal has been shown to reduce the formation of gas in the colon, though the way in which it does so is unknown. When maldigestion is due to pancreatic insufficiency, then supplemental pancreatic enzymes can be ingested with meals to replace the missing enzymes."
What's new in intestinal gas?,"""One study has shed additional light on the role of intestinal gas and the way in which it causes symptoms. Investigators studied 30 patients whose primary complaint was flatulence (although they also had other complaints such as abdominal bloating, distension, and/or discomfort), and 20 healthy people (controls) without issues related to gas. The investigators studied the patients' and controls' production of gas and symptoms on their normal (basal) diet, during and following a standard meal, and during and following a meal that contained foods known to cause more gas (""'flatulent'' diet). During the basal period on their usual diet, not surprisingly, the patients had more symptoms than the controls and evacuated gas (farted) more often than controls (22 vs. 7 times during the day). Interestingly, however, the patients and controls produced the same total volume of gas while on the standard meal. This would suggest that the patients were NOT producing more gas than the controls. Two explanations for these observations would be 1) that the basal diet contained more gas-producing foods, or 2) that patients were more sensitive to gas; in other words, they developed more discomfort producing the same amount of gas as controls (farting more frequently, but with less gas per fart).''On the flatulogenic diet, the controls developed some symptoms, but the patients, not surprisingly, developed worse symptoms. The number of farts increased for both patients and controls but more so for the patients (44 vs. 22 farts, respectively). Nevertheless, the total amount of gas that was produced on the flatulogenic diet was the same for controls and patients. This supported the probability that patients were more sensitive to gas, i.e., they developed more symptoms, and farted more even though they were producing the same amount of gas as controls.''The observations made in this study add considerably to our understanding of intestinal gas and the mechanism whereby gas causes symptoms. In the group of patients that was studied, the symptoms were caused by an abnormal sensitivity to gas and not to the production of more gas. It is important to recognize, however, that although this may be the mechanism for production of symptoms in this group of patients, there are undoubtedly other explanations or contributing factors in other patients with symptoms and flatulence. For example and as explained previously, some patients may retain more gas in the abdomen due to problems with the intestinal muscles leading to intestinal distention and discomfort. Some patients may be on a flatulogenic diet without realizing it, and some patients may indeed be producing more gas than others on the same diet.' "
What is an intra-articular methylene blue injection?,"'An intra-articular injection of ''methylene blue''\xa0is a procedure performed to diagnose disruption of the joint capsule and help in early treatment.''In the open injuries of the joint, the skin and the soft tissue may penetrate the joint space. The extent of this damage can be verified by intra-articular methylene blue injection. The accuracy of the test ranges from 31% to 99%.\xa0''Like\xa0open ''fractures'', open joint injuries require timely diagnosis and treatment to prevent or minimize long-term morbidity and mortality.'

How is an intra-methylene blue injection performed?,"'Anesthesia''The procedure''After the procedure' The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, as it is a painful procedure. The methylene blue is injected into the joint with an appropriate syringe. If the dye seeps through the wound site, it is highly likely it’s an open joint injury.

A positive test from an open joint injury requires immediate administration of intravenous (IV) antibiotics and an emergency orthopedic evaluation for further exploration."
What are the complications of an intra-articular methylene blue injection?,"'Potential complications of an intra-articular injection of methylene blue, as with any invasive diagnostic procedure, include:' Infection Bleeding Nerve injury False-negative result from injection"
What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.
	"
"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: These are rare tumors that have both solid and cystic components and are found mainly in young Asian and black women. They may reach a large size and can become malignant. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical resection of these tumors."
How do medical professionals diagnose pancreatic cysts?,"'Since the majority of pancreatic cysts are small and produce no symptoms, they often are discovered incidentally when abdominal scans (''ultrasound'' [US], ''computerized tomography'' or CT, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or ''MRI'') are performed to investigate unrelated symptoms. Unfortunately, ultrasound, CT, and MRI cannot reliably distinguish benign cysts (cysts that usually need no treatment) from precancerous and cancerous cysts (cysts that usually require surgical removal).''Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is becoming increasingly useful in determining whether a pancreatic cyst is likely to be benign, precancerous, or cancerous. During endoscopic ultrasound, an endoscope with a small ultrasound transducer at its tip is inserted into the mouth and is passed through the\xa0''esophagus''\xa0and stomach into the duodenum. From this location, which is very close to the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, accurate and detailed images can be obtained of the liver, pancreas and the gallbladder.''During endoscopic ultrasound, fluid from cysts and samples of tissue also can be obtained by passing special needles through the endoscope and into the cysts. The process of obtaining tissue or fluid with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).''The fluid obtained by FNA can be analyzed for cancerous cells (cytology), amylase content, and for tumor markers. Tumor markers, such as CEA (''carcinoembryonic antigen''), are proteins produced in large quantities by cancer cells. For example, pancreatic pseudocyst fluid will typically have high amylase levels but low CEA levels. A benign serous cyst adenoma will have low amylase and low CEA levels, whereas a precancerous or cancerous mucinous cyst adenoma will have low amylase levels but high CEA levels. Most recently, DNA from cells that are aspirated from the cyst has been analyzed for changes suggestive of cancer.''The risks of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration are small and consist of a very small incidence of bleeding and infection.''Occasionally, it is difficult even with the diagnostic tools of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to determine if a pancreatic cyst is cancerous or precancerous. If the answer is not clear, sometimes repeated endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration are done if the suspicion for cancer or precancer is high. In other cases, the cyst is reexamined by CT, MRI, or even endoscopic ultrasound after a few months to detect changes that more strongly suggest that cancer has developed. In still others, surgery is recommended.'  "
What is the treatment for pancreatic cysts?,"'The most important aspect of management of pancreatic cysts is the determination of whether a cyst is benign (and usually needs no treatment) or if it is precancerous or cancerous and must be removed.''The second most important aspect of management is to determine whether a patient with a precancerous or cancerous pancreatic cyst is a suitable surgical candidate. In medical centers experienced in performing pancreatic surgery, surgical removal of precancerous or cancerous cysts results in a high rate of cure.'""Very small cysts can be followed to detect an increase in size that may indicate cancer or an increased risk of developing cancer.\xa0Management decisions must be individualized for each patient after discussions with a doctor familiar with the patient's health status. The following are examples of how a doctor might manage pancreatic cysts.""   Pancreatic pseudocysts need treatment if they persist beyond six weeks after acute pancreatitis, especially if they reach a large size and cause symptoms such as obstruction of the stomach or common bile duct, abdominal pain, or become infected. Small pancreatic cysts (for example, cysts smaller than one cm) will have little chance of being cancerous. Nevertheless, even these small cysts can grow in size and turn cancerous in the future. Thus, these patients are monitored with yearly scans (for example, yearly ultrasound or MRI). The cysts do not have to be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If the cysts grow in size and/or cause symptoms, the patient will be evaluated further using endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm can be studied with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If fluid cytology, CEA measurements or analysis of DNA suggest cancerous or precancerous changes, the patients can be evaluated for pancreatic surgery."
What is an electromyogram?,"'An electromyogram (EMG) is a test that is used to record the electrical activity of muscles. When muscles are active, they produce an electrical current. This current is usually proportional to the level of the muscle activity. An EMG is also referred to as a myogram.''EMGs can be used to detect abnormal electrical activity of muscle that can occur in many diseases and conditions, including muscular dystrophy, inflammation of muscles, pinched nerves, peripheral nerve damage (damage to nerves in the arms and legs), ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'' (''ALS''), ''myasthenia gravis'', ''disc herniation'', and others.'  "
Why is an EMG test done?,"'An EMG is often performed when patients have unexplained muscle ''weakness''. The EMG helps to distinguish between muscle conditions in which the problem begins in the muscle and muscle weakness due to nerve disorders. The EMG can also be used to detect true weakness, as opposed to weakness from reduced use because of ''pain'' or lack of motivation. EMGs can also be used to isolate the level of nerve irritation or injury.'  "
How is an intramuscular EMG done?,"'A needle is inserted through the skin into the muscle. The electrical activity is detected by this needle (which serves as an electrode). The activity is displayed visually on an oscilloscope and may also be detected audibly with a speaker.''Since skeletal muscles are often large, several needle electrodes may need to be placed at various locations to obtain an informative EMG.''After placement of the electrode(s), the patient may be asked to contract the muscle (for example, to bend the leg).''The presence, size, and shape of the wave form (the action potential) produced on the oscilloscope provide information about the ability of the muscle to respond to nervous stimulation. Each muscle ''fiber'' that contracts produces an action potential. The size of the muscle fiber affects the rate (how frequently an action potential occurs) and the size (the amplitude) of the action potential.' "
Is an EMG painful?,"'Yes. There is some discomfort at the time the needle electrodes are inserted. They feel like shots (intramuscular injections), although nothing is injected during an EMG. Afterwards, the muscle may feel a little sore for up to a few days.'  "
How do you prepare for an intramuscular EMG?,"""For adults, no special preparation is needed. For infants and children, the physical and psychological preparation depends on the child's age, behavior, and prior experience. (For instance, has the child been traumatized by another medical or dental procedure?)"" "
What other test is done during an intramuscular EMG?,"""A nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test is often done at the same time as an EMG. In this test, the nerve is electrically stimulated while a second electrode detects the electrical impulse 'down-stream' from the first. This is usually done with surface patch electrodes (they are similar to those used for an ""'electrocardiogram'') that are placed on the skin over the nerve at various locations. One electrode stimulates the nerve with a very mild electrical impulse. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to calculate the speed of impulse transmission (nerve conduction velocity). A decreased speed of transmission indicates nerve disease.''The NCV test can be used to detect true nerve disorders (such as neuropathy) or conditions whereby muscles are affected by nerve injury (such as ''carpal tunnel syndrome''). Normal body temperature must be maintained for the NCV test, because low body temperatures slow nerve conduction.''Previous contributing authors and editors: Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor: Barbara K.

"Intraocular melanoma is a 
disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.","'Intraocular melanoma begins in the middle of three layers of the wall of the eye. The outer layer includes the white sclera (the ""white of the eye"") and the clear ''cornea'' at the front of the eye. The inner layer has a lining of nerve tissue, called the retina, which senses light and sends images along the ''optic nerve'' to the brain.''The middle layer, where intraocular melanoma forms, is called the uvea or uveal tract, and has three main parts:''The iris is the colored area at the front of the eye (the ""eye color""). It can be seen through the clear cornea. The pupil is in the center of the iris and it changes size to let more or less light into the eye. Intraocular melanoma of the iris is usually a small tumor that grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.''The ciliary body is a ring of tissue with muscle fibers that change the size of the pupil and the shape of the ''lens''. It is found behind the iris. Changes in the shape of the lens help the eye focus. The ciliary body also makes the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the iris. Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.''The choroid is a layer of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the eye. Most intraocular melanomas begin in the choroid. Intraocular melanoma of the choroid is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.''Intraocular melanoma is a rare ''cancer'' that forms from cells that make melanin in the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. It is the most common eye ''cancer'' in adults.' "
"Being older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular 
melanoma.","""Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.""'Risk factors for intraocular melanoma include the following:' Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.Blue or green or other light-colored eyes. Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly. Blue or green or other light-colored eyes. Older age. Being white."
Signs of intraocular melanoma include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris.,'Intraocular melanoma may not cause early signs or symptoms. It is sometimes found during a regular eye exam when the doctor dilates the pupil and looks into the eye. Signs and symptoms may be caused by intraocular melanoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'  Blurred vision or other change in vision. Floaters (spots that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light. A dark spot on the iris. A change in the size or shape of the pupil. A change in the position of the eyeball in the eye socket.
"Tests that examine the eye are used to help detect (find) and diagnose 
intraocular melanoma.","'The following tests and procedures may be used:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Eye exam with dilated pupil: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the lens and pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor. There are several types of eye exams:Ophthalmoscopy: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.Slit-lamp biomicroscopy: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope.Gonioscopy: An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris. A special instrument is used to see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked. Ophthalmoscopy: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope. Gonioscopy: An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris. A special instrument is used to see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked. Ultrasound exam of the eye: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. The picture, called a sonogram, shows on the screen of the ultrasound monitor. High-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a more detailed picture of the inside of the eye than a regular ultrasound. The tumor is checked for its size, shape, and thickness, and for signs that the tumor has spread to nearby tissue. Transillumination of the globe and iris: An exam of the iris, cornea, lens, and ciliary body with a light placed on either the upper or lower lid. Fluorescein angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye. An orange fluorescent dye (fluorescein) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. Indocyanine green angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. A green dye (indocyanine green) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. Ocular coherence tomography: An imaging test that uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina, and sometimes the choroid, to see if there is swelling or fluid beneath the retina."
A biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.,"'A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. Rarely, a biopsy of the tumor is needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma. Tissue that is removed during a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor may be tested to get more information about prognosis and which treatment options are best.''The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue:''A biopsy may result in ''retinal detachment'' (the retina separates from other tissues in the eye). This can be repaired by surgery.' Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Gene expression profiling: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are checked for certain types of RNA."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:' How the melanoma cells look under a microscope. The size and thickness of the tumor. The part of the eye the tumor is in (the iris, ciliary body, or choroid). Whether the tumor has spread within the eye or to other places in the body. Whether there are certain changes in the genes linked to intraocular melanoma. The patient's age and general health. Whether the tumor has recurred (come back) after treatment."
"After intraocular 
melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have 
spread to other parts of the body.","'The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.''The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:''The following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma:''Small''The tumor is 5 to 16 millimeters in diameter and from 1 to 3 millimeters thick.''Medium''The tumor is 16 millimeters or smaller in diameter and from 3.1 to 8 millimeters thick.''Large''The tumor is:''Though most intraocular melanoma tumors are raised, some are flat. These diffuse tumors grow widely across the uvea.' Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Liver function tests: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found. more than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or at least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter."
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
"Cancer may 
spread from where it began to other parts of the body.","'When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not ''liver cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
"There are 
two staging systems for intraocular melanoma.","'Intraocular melanoma has two staging systems.

Recurrent intraocular (uveal) melanoma,'Recurrent intraocular melanoma is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The melanoma may come back in the eye or in other parts of the body.' 
There are different types of treatments for patients with intraocular melanoma.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with intraocular melanoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Five types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery is the most common treatment for intraocular melanoma. The following types of surgery may be used:'""Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient's condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Pictures are taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor and how fast it is growing.""'Watchful waiting is used for patients who do not have signs or symptoms and the tumor is not growing. It is also used when the tumor is in the only eye with useful vision.''Radiation'' therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat intraocular melanoma.''Photocoagulation is a procedure that uses laser light to destroy blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor, causing the tumor cells to die. Photocoagulation may be used to treat small tumors. This is also called light coagulation.''Thermotherapy is the use of heat from a laser to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor.'  Resection: Surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of healthy tissue around it. Enucleation: Surgery to remove the eye and part of the optic nerve. This is done if vision cannot be saved and the tumor is large, has spread to the optic nerve, or causes high pressure inside the eye. After surgery, the patient is usually fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye. Exenteration: Surgery to remove the eye and eyelid, and muscles, nerves, and fat in the eye socket. After surgery, the patient may be fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye or a facial prosthesis. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:Charged-particle external beam radiation therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy. A special radiation therapy machine aims tiny, invisible particles, called protons or helium ions, at the cancer cells to kill them with little damage to nearby normal tissues. Charged-particle radiation therapy uses a different type of radiation than the x-ray type of radiation therapy.Gamma Knife therapy is a type of stereotactic radiosurgery used for some melanomas. This treatment can be given in one treatment. It aims tightly focused gamma rays directly at the tumor so there is little damage to healthy tissue. Gamma Knife therapy does not use a knife to remove the tumor and is not an operation. Charged-particle external beam radiation therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy.

Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:Localized plaque radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used for tumors of the eye. Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the eye near the tumor. The side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming radiation at the tumor. The plaque helps protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.

Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.' "
"Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their 
cancer treatment.",'Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' 
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "

What is intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring?,"'Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is a procedure to continuously monitor the nervous system’s functional integrity during operations involving the brain and spinal cord. Electrodes or needles attached to the patient’s relevant anatomy continuously transmit information, which can be viewed on a monitor. A neurophysiologist analyzes and interprets the data transmitted and alerts the surgeon to any abnormal reading.' "
What are intraoperative neurophysical monitoring techniques?,"'Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is performed using any of the following modalities:''Electromyography is a procedure to continuously monitor and record the muscle’s electrical activity using needle electrodes.\xa0''Technique''Clinical Uses''Electroencephalography monitoring is performed during surgeries in the brain or major vascular surgeries.''Technique''Clinical Uses''Electroencephalography reveals changes in blood flow in the brain and the surgeon can take immediate corrective action if there is a problem. The procedure is used during surgeries such as:''Electrocorticography monitoring is performed by placing the electrodes inside the cortex region of the brain. This method of monitoring is used during surgeries for epileptic ''seizures'' to:''Cortical electrical stimulation involves stimulating the cortical region of the brain. This procedure is useful in mapping the functional part of the nerve tissues in lesion removal surgeries for epileptic seizures.''Evaluation of evoked potentials is a procedure to assess the response time taken by the brain to stimulus through touch, sight or sound.

This method of monitoring has been used for ''tumor'' removal surgeries performed close to the visual nerves.' The neurologist places needle electrodes into the muscle and monitors its spontaneous activity continuously. To test the muscle’s functional integrity, the associated nerve can be stimulated, which results in muscle contraction. Facial and cranial nerve monitoring: For nerve stimulation during surgeries involving the brain and face. Selective dorsal rhizotomy: To identify and selectively sever affected nerves to treat cerebral palsy. Tethered spinal cord release procedure: To identify and remove scar tissues that are attached to the spinal cord limiting its movement. Pedicle screw placement: For correct placement of surgical screws during spinal fusion surgery. The neurologist places electrodes in the scalp and monitors the brain’s electrical activity with the EEG. Carotid endarterectomy (removal of plaque from carotid artery) Cerebral aneurysm repair Aortic cross-clamping for repair of narrowed aorta Cardiac surgery with blood circulation arrest Identify the origin of seizures in the cortex Complete removal of the affected tissue accurately Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP) Somatosensory function is the brain’s ability to interpret bodily sensations such as touch, pain, itch, temperature, vibration and pressure.

Placing electrodes in the scalp Flashing strobe lights or light-emitting diodes (LED) in the patient’s visual field."
What are the challenges in intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring?,"'The challenges in the intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring are:' Electromagnetic interference: Typically, operating rooms are full of monitoring devices that emit electromagnetic waves. Adequate filtering and shielding from signal interference are essential to prevent incorrect recording of signals. Anesthetic effects: Anesthetic agents work by suppressing the brain’s metabolism. This can alter evoked responses in the brain and the EEG recordings. The anesthesia needs to be light enough to produce responses while deep enough to block pain."
How much does intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring cost?,"'Actual costs of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring are difficult to assess as it involves personnel, electronic devices and disposable material. Intraoperative monitoring reduces the likelihood of permanent impairment but does not eliminate the risk. The procedure is still cost-effective, considering the health care costs of avoidable permanent brain disability caused by a lack of real-time intraoperative data on nerve function.' "
What is an IUD (intrauterine device)?,"'The intrauterine device (IUD) is a small T-shaped device that is used as a method of ''birth control'"" designed for insertion into a woman's uterus. Having an IUD means that changes occur in the uterus that make it difficult for ""'fertilization'' and implantation of an egg. IUDs also have been referred to as ""intrauterine ''contraception''"" (IUC). Some IUDs approved for use in the United States contain medications that are released over time to facilitate the ''contraceptive'' effect. An IUD is a type of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).''IUDs have been shown to be over 99% effective in preventing ''pregnancy''. Although IUDs are highly effective, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
How does an IUD work?,"'It is not fully understood how IUDs work. They are thought to prevent ''conception'' by causing a brief localized inflammation that begins about 24 hours after insertion. The inflammatory reaction inside the uterus attracts white blood cells, which produce substances that are toxic or poisonous to sperm. The ''progesterone''-releasing IUDs also cause a subtle change in the lining of the uterus that impairs the implantation of the egg in the uterine wall. This type of IUD also alters the cervical ''mucus'', which, in turn, inhibits sperm from passing through the cervix.' "
What are the side effects of an IUD?,"'Side effects of the IUD are limited primarily to the uterus and depend upon the type of IUD that is inserted. The copper IUD may cause worsening of ''menstrual cramps'' and heavier menstrual bleeding, although hormonal IUDs usually reduce menstrual flow. Women with hormonal IUDs may have irregular periods and ''spotting'', particularly in the first three to six months.''It is also possible for the IUD to pass through (perforate) the uterine wall and enter the abdominal ''cavity'', where it must be retrieved surgically. Perforation of or ''trauma'' to the uterus by the IUD occurs in one to three per 1,000 insertions.'  "
Does an IUD cause pain?,"'An IUD does not cause ''pain'"". The insertion procedure is done in a doctor's office and may cause a brief discomfort similar to menstrual cramping. An anesthetic can be injected into the cervix prior to the insertion procedure."" "
What are warning signs and symptoms of possible complications from an IUD?,"'Warning signs of possible complications from an IUD include''If a woman experiences any of these signs, she should contact a health-care professional.' abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, abnormal spotting or bleeding, a smelly vaginal discharge."
What are the advantages of an IUD? How effective is an IUD?,"'The advantages of the IUD include the fact that it is highly effective in preventing conception, is reversible, and starts working almost immediately. Once the IUD is removed, there is a quick return to ''fertility''. The ''Mirena' "
"What are the types of IUDs (ParaGard, Mirena, Skyla)?","'Intrauterine devices (IUDs) that are available in the U.S. come in two different types: 1) copper-releasing, or 2) progesterone-releasing.'   TCu380A (ParaGard) is a copper-containing IUD: It releases copper from a copper wire that is wrapped around the base. The released copper contributes to an inflammatory reaction in the uterus that helps prevent fertilization of the egg. It is approved to remain in place for up to 10 years. Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (Mirena or Skyla): This form of IUD releases a progestin hormone from the vertical part of the T. Progestin acts to thicken cervical mucus, creating a barrier to sperm, as well as renders the lining of the uterus inhospitable to implantation of an egg. The two brand-named IUDs in this category contain different amounts of the hormone. Mirena is approved for up to five years of use and Skyla for up to three years."
Who can use an IUD?,"'Most healthy women are be able to use an IUD. They are not right for every woman, however, and some women should not use an IUD for contraception. Before an IUD is inserted, a woman will have a ''pregnancy test'' to ensure she is not ''pregnant'' and will be tested for sexually transmitted diseases (''STD'').''The following are reasons that a woman should not use an IUD:''A woman who is ''allergic'"" to copper or who has Wilson's disease should not use the copper-containing IUD."" Ongoing pelvic infection, such as an STD or a recent STD Cancer of the uterus or cervix Unexplained vaginal bleeding Abnormal or distorted uterine anatomy"
How is an IUD inserted?,"'IUDs are only available by prescription and must be properly inserted by a health-care professional. A ''pelvic exam'' is required to insert an IUD, similar to the procedure for having a ''Pap test''. The IUD is inserted into the uterus long as the woman is not pregnant.''The IUD is a small ""T""-shaped device with a monofilament tail that is inserted into the uterus by a health-care practitioner in the office setting. When inserted into the uterus, the arms of the ""T"" are folded down, but they then open out to form the top of the ""T."" The device rests inside the uterus with the base of the T just above the cervix and the arms of the T extending horizontally across the uterus. A short piece of monofilament string attached to the IUD extends through the cervix into the vagina. This string makes it possible to be sure that the IUD is still in the uterus.' "
How soon does an IUD start working?,"'The IUD begins working to prevent pregnancy as soon as it is inserted, but full protection is believed to take about seven days in some cases, depending on when in the ''menstrual cycle'' it is inserted. If you have an IUD inserted within seven days of ending your ''menstrual period'', it should be effective right away. At any other time in the menstrual cycle, you should use another method of birth control for the first week after insertion.' "
How long does an  IUD last?,"'The copper-containing IUD can be left in place for up to 10 years, and the hormonal IUDs can remain for three or five years, depending upon the type of IUD.' "
How is an IUD removed?,"'An IUD must be removed by a health-care professional. It is very important that a woman not attempt to remove an IUD on her own, as serious problems may result. IUD removal is carried out by determining the position of the uterus, then locating and grasping the stings of the IUD with a special forceps or clamp. A health-care professional will then remove the IUD by gentle traction on the strings.'""Occasionally, the strings of the IUD will not be located. In these situations, the strings have often slipped higher into the cervical canal. A health-care professional can use special instruments to locate the strings and/or remove the IUD. Complications of IUD removal are rare, and removal can take place at any time. Some studies have shown that removal is easier during the menstrual period, when a woman's cervix is typically softer than during other times in the menstrual cycle."" "
Will an IUD affect my periods?,"'The woman must check her IUD every month to be sure that it is still in place. The woman with an IUD in place will still have normal menstrual periods, although some women notice that flow is heavier. Other women, especially those with a hormone-releasing IUD, may have a lighter menstrual flow. Sometimes, the uterus expels (pushes out) the IUD. Expulsions may not cause any specific symptoms and can be overlooked. In addition to the woman checking the IUD, the device must also be checked periodically by a health-care professional.' "
Will my partner feel my IUD?,"'You and your partner should not be able to feel the IUD itself. However, you may feel the strings of the IUD at the upper end of the vagina.' "
What are the risks and complications of IUDs?," An IUD may not be appropriate for women who have heavy menstrual bleeding, had previous pelvic infections, have more than one sexual partner, or plan on getting pregnant. This is because IUDs do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STDs) and should not be in place if a woman intends to become pregnant. If women become pregnant with their IUDs in place, 50% of the pregnancies end in miscarriage. Any woman with an IUD who develops signs or symptoms of pregnancy, or has a positive pregnancy test, should see a health-care professional soon. Women who use non-progesterone types of IUDs are less likely to have an ectopic pregnancy compared to women using no contraception. When a woman using an IUD does become pregnant, the pregnancy is more likely to be ectopic. Nevertheless, ectopic pregnancy in a user of an IUD is a rare occurrence. Serious complications due to infection (pelvic inflammatory disease) associated with an IUD may prevent a woman from being able to become pregnant in the future. Also, with the progesterone-releasing IUDs (levonorgestrel IUDs), a reduction in menstrual flow and a decrease in painful menstrual cramping are often observed with continued use. This is because the progesterone hormone can cause thinning of the lining of the uterus. These menstrual changes are not dangerous in any way and do not mean that the contraceptive action of the IUD is diminished."
Does an IUD protect a woman from sexually transmitted infections (STDs)?,"'No, the IUD does not provide protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
What is an intravenous cholangiogram (IVC)?,"'    The intravenous cholangiogram or IVC is a radiologic (x-ray) procedure that is used primarily to look at the larger bile ducts within the ''liver'' and the bile ducts outside the liver. The procedure can be used to locate ''gallstones'' within these bile ducts.  IVC also can be used to identify other causes of obstruction to the flow of bile, for example, narrowings (strictures) of the bile ducts and ''cancers'' that may impair the normal flow of bile.' "
How is an intravenous cholangiogram done?,"'    To do an IVC, an ''iodine''-containing dye is injected intravenously into the blood.  The dye is then removed from blood by the liver which excretes it into the bile. The iodine is concentrated enough just as it is secreted into bile that it does not need to be further concentrated by the gallbladder in order to outlinethe bile ducts and any ''gallstones'' that may be within them.  The gallbladder is not always seen on an IVC since the iodine-containing bile may bypass the gallbladder entirely and empty directly into the small intestine.' "
What are the risks of an intravenous cholangiogram?,'    Occasional serious ''allergic'' reactions can occur to any iodine-containing dye. These reactions can usually be treated but they rarely may result in the death of the patient.' 
When is an intravenous cholangiogram useful?, 
What is endotracheal intubation?,"'Endotracheal intubation is a procedure by which a tube is inserted through the mouth down into the trachea (the large ''airway'' from the mouth to the ''lungs''). Before surgery, this is often done under deep sedation. In emergency situations, the patient is often unconscious at the time of this procedure.' "
What kind of tube is used?,'The tube that is used today is usually a flexible ''plastic'' tube. It is called an endotracheal tube because it is slipped within the trachea.' 
How do they put the tube down into the trachea?,"""The doctor often inserts the tube with the help of a laryngoscope, an instrument that permits the doctor to see the upper portion of the trachea, just below the vocal cords. During the procedure the laryngoscope is used to hold the tongue aside while inserting the tube into the trachea. It is important that the head be positioned in the appropriate manner to allow for proper visualization. Pressure is often applied to the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) to help with visualization and prevent possible aspiration of stomach contents."" "
What is the purpose of endotracheal intubation?,"'The endotracheal tube serves as an open passage through the upper airway. The purpose of endotracheal intubation is to permit air to pass freely to and from the lungs in order to ventilate the lungs. Endotracheal tubes can be connected to ventilator machines to provide artificial ''respiration''. This can help when a patient is unconscious and by maintaining a patent airway, especially during surgery. It is often used when patients are critically ill and cannot maintain adequate respiratory function to meet their needs. The endotracheal tube facilitates the use of a mechanical ventilator in these critical situations.'  "
Is endotracheal intubation used for COVID-19 coronavirus patients?,"'Endotracheal intubation is the approved way of providing ''breathing'' support to ''COVID-19'"" coronavirus disease patients as of this article's update in early April, 2020.\xa0""'Non-invasive mechanical ventilation\xa0like ''CPAP'' (continuous positive airway pressure) machines used for ''sleep apnea'' are not good for ''COVID-19'"" patients, according to clinical guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists. In some cases, CPAP\xa0masks or\xa0nasal pillows\xa0may provide adequate oxygen, but current devices aerosolize\xa0virus particles in the patient's breath and spread them around wherever\xa0the patient is housed, potentially infecting\xa0more people in the area.""'Endotracheal intubation and ventilation supports a ''COVID-19'"" patient's breathing so the body can survive as\xa0the immune system fights the virus. This means a better chance of\xa0fighting off the virus, but ventilators can't cure COVID-19."" "
What are the complications of endotracheal intubation?,"'If the tube is inadvertently placed in the ''esophagus'' (right behind the trachea), adequate respirations will not occur. ''Brain damage'', ''cardiac arrest'', and death can occur. Aspiration of stomach contents can result in ''pneumonia'' and ''ARDS''. Placement of the tube too deep can result in only one lung being ventilated and can result in a ''pneumothorax'' as well as inadequate ventilation. During endotracheal tube placement, damage can also occur to the ''teeth'', the soft tissues in the back of the throat, as well as the vocal cords.''This procedure should be performed by a physician with experience in intubation. In the vast majority of cases of intubation, no significant complications occur.'  "
What is intussusception?,"'Intussusception is the telescoping of one segment of intestine into another adjacent distal (""downstream"") segment of the intestine. (The term ""intussusception"" is pronounced ""in-tuh-suh-sep-shun"" with the accent on the ""in."" It comes from the Latin ""intus"", within + ""suscipere"", to receive = to receive within). Common mispellings of intussusception include: intususception, intussuseption, intersusception.''Intussusception is the most common cause of ''intestinal obstruction'' in children between 3 months and five years of age. It is extremely rare in children under 3 months of age or in older children and adults.'  "
What happens during intussusception?,"'\tDuring intussusception, a segment of bowel (intussusceptum) telescopes into a more distal segment (intussuscipiens), and drags the associated mesentery, vessels, and nerves with it. This results in compression of the veins, followed by swelling of the region leading to obstruction and a subsequent decrease in blood flow to the affected part of the intestine. Most cases affect the ileocolic region of the intestine (where the small intestine meets the ''large intestine'').''\tThe compression of blood vessels in the involved intestine reduces the supply of blood to the affected intestine. If the blood supply is greatly reduced, the involved intestine may swell, causing an obstruction, or even die (become gangrenous) and bleed. It also may rupture and lead to abdominal infection and ''shock''.' "
Is intussusception an urgent problem?,'Intussusception is an emergency and requires immediate attention.' 
Who is at greatest risk for intussusception?,"'Most cases of intussusception occur in children between 5 months and 1 year of age. Boys develop the condition two times more often than girls. Intussusception can also occur in adults and older children, although it is uncommon.' "
What causes intussusception?,"'The causes of intussusception are not fully known. Most cases in young children are idiopathic, (meaning the cause is unknown), although some viral and  ''bacterial infections'' of the intestine may possibly contribute to intussusception in infancy. ''Intussusception is very rare in older children and adults. In this population, the causes are believed to be due to polyps or tumors, which are often referred to as the ""lead point"" of the intussusception.' "
Why is rapid diagnosis of intussusception important?,"'Early diagnosis and treatment of intussusception is essential in order to prevent injury to the intestine and the associated sequelae, including surgical removal of the bowel, ''sepsis'', and even death.' "
What are the symptoms of intussusception?,"'Most describe the symptoms of intussusception as a triad of colicky ''abdominal pain'', bilious ''vomiting'', and ""currant jelly"" ''stool''.''The primary symptom of intussusception is described as intermittent crampy ''abdominal pain''. This is often called ""colicky ''pain''."" Intussusception in an infant usually starts with the infant suddenly crying very loudly, as if in great ''pain''. The infant intermittently draws the knees up to the chest while crying. This reaction is caused by the abdominal pain which recurs frequently and increases in intensity and duration. These intermittent painful episodes are believed to be caused by the telescoping of the bowel and resultant compression of blood vessels and nerves.''In addition to the abdominal pain, most children will also have episodes of vomiting associated with the pain. This vomiting is usually not associated with eating and may be bilious (yellow-green colored)''Some affected individuals who do not seek early medical attention may pass ""currant jelly ''stool''"". This is stool that is bloody and mucousy and may be a sign that the affected bowel has lost its blood supply and that the bowel may be necrotic (non-viable).''As the condition progresses, the infant becomes may become weaker and develop additional symptoms, including those associated with shock, such as paleness, lethargy, and even ''fever'', though these are not an integral part of the associated ""triad.""''Thankfully, most cases are diagnosed early.'  "
How is intussusception diagnosed?,"'The history of abdominal pain and vomiting as described above, may suggest the diagnosis of intussusception. Additionally, the examining doctor may feel an abdominal ""sausage-shaped"" mass (the intussusception itself) or upon auscultation with a stethoscope, may hear diminished or absent ''bowel sounds''. Lab tests are usually not helpful, although plain abdominal ''X-rays'' can reveal signs of an intestinal obstruction, including air-fluid levels, decreased ''gas'', and unexplained masses, usually seen in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. ''Ultrasound'' and ''CT scans'' are generally not required to make the diagnosis.''A barium, water-soluble contrast or air enema is considered both diagnostic and therapeutic in the management of intussusception. This radiologic procedure involves the introduction of the contrast into the lower intestine. If an intussusception is present, it will be seen during the imaging. Often just the introduction of the contrast will reduce the telescoped bowel to its normal position and shape. In these cases there is a high risk of for re-intussusception in the first 24 hours following the enema, though, less commonly, recurrence may be seen several days and even months later.' "
Is it necessary to operate when there is intussusception?,"""The treatment of intussusception may or may not require surgery. In some cases, the intestinal obstruction can be reversed with an enema. The enema carries a risk of intestinal rupture and cannot be done if the bowel has already perforated. The procedure also requires the availability of a surgeon, in case the patient's bowel ruptures or the intussusception cannot be reduced.""'If the intestinal obstruction cannot be reversed by an enema, surgery is necessary to reverse the intussusception and relieve the obstruction. If a portion of the intestine has become gangrenous, it must be removed. After surgery, intravenous feeding and fluids are continued until normal bowel movements resume. Because of the risk of recurrence, patients who are successfully reduced by enema usually are admitted for observation during the first 24 hours post procedure, and have no ill effects. Recently, research has suggested that a select population of the children may be observed for shorter periods of time (6 hours) after undergoing reduction of the intussesception by enema, but currently, most patients stay the full 24 hours.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for patients with intussusception?,'The outlook for intussusception is usually good with early diagnosis and treatment. Early detection and treatment are paramount.' 
What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.
	"
"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: These are rare tumors that have both solid and cystic components and are found mainly in young Asian and black women. They may reach a large size and can become malignant. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical resection of these tumors."
How do medical professionals diagnose pancreatic cysts?,"'Since the majority of pancreatic cysts are small and produce no symptoms, they often are discovered incidentally when abdominal scans (''ultrasound'' [US], ''computerized tomography'' or CT, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or ''MRI'') are performed to investigate unrelated symptoms. Unfortunately, ultrasound, CT, and MRI cannot reliably distinguish benign cysts (cysts that usually need no treatment) from precancerous and cancerous cysts (cysts that usually require surgical removal).''Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is becoming increasingly useful in determining whether a pancreatic cyst is likely to be benign, precancerous, or cancerous. During endoscopic ultrasound, an endoscope with a small ultrasound transducer at its tip is inserted into the mouth and is passed through the\xa0''esophagus''\xa0and stomach into the duodenum. From this location, which is very close to the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, accurate and detailed images can be obtained of the liver, pancreas and the gallbladder.''During endoscopic ultrasound, fluid from cysts and samples of tissue also can be obtained by passing special needles through the endoscope and into the cysts. The process of obtaining tissue or fluid with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).''The fluid obtained by FNA can be analyzed for cancerous cells (cytology), amylase content, and for tumor markers. Tumor markers, such as CEA (''carcinoembryonic antigen''), are proteins produced in large quantities by cancer cells. For example, pancreatic pseudocyst fluid will typically have high amylase levels but low CEA levels. A benign serous cyst adenoma will have low amylase and low CEA levels, whereas a precancerous or cancerous mucinous cyst adenoma will have low amylase levels but high CEA levels. Most recently, DNA from cells that are aspirated from the cyst has been analyzed for changes suggestive of cancer.''The risks of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration are small and consist of a very small incidence of bleeding and infection.''Occasionally, it is difficult even with the diagnostic tools of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to determine if a pancreatic cyst is cancerous or precancerous. If the answer is not clear, sometimes repeated endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration are done if the suspicion for cancer or precancer is high. In other cases, the cyst is reexamined by CT, MRI, or even endoscopic ultrasound after a few months to detect changes that more strongly suggest that cancer has developed. In still others, surgery is recommended.'  "
What is the treatment for pancreatic cysts?,"'The most important aspect of management of pancreatic cysts is the determination of whether a cyst is benign (and usually needs no treatment) or if it is precancerous or cancerous and must be removed.''The second most important aspect of management is to determine whether a patient with a precancerous or cancerous pancreatic cyst is a suitable surgical candidate. In medical centers experienced in performing pancreatic surgery, surgical removal of precancerous or cancerous cysts results in a high rate of cure.'""Very small cysts can be followed to detect an increase in size that may indicate cancer or an increased risk of developing cancer.\xa0Management decisions must be individualized for each patient after discussions with a doctor familiar with the patient's health status. The following are examples of how a doctor might manage pancreatic cysts.""   Pancreatic pseudocysts need treatment if they persist beyond six weeks after acute pancreatitis, especially if they reach a large size and cause symptoms such as obstruction of the stomach or common bile duct, abdominal pain, or become infected. Small pancreatic cysts (for example, cysts smaller than one cm) will have little chance of being cancerous. Nevertheless, even these small cysts can grow in size and turn cancerous in the future. Thus, these patients are monitored with yearly scans (for example, yearly ultrasound or MRI). The cysts do not have to be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If the cysts grow in size and/or cause symptoms, the patient will be evaluated further using endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm can be studied with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If fluid cytology, CEA measurements or analysis of DNA suggest cancerous or precancerous changes, the patients can be evaluated for pancreatic surgery."
What is insulin resistance?,"'Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas. These cells are scattered throughout the pancreas in small clusters known as the islets of Langerhans. The insulin produced is released into the blood stream and travels throughout the body. Insulin is an essential hormone that has many actions within the body. Most actions of insulin are directed at metabolism (control) of carbohydrates (sugars and starches), ''lipids'' (''fats'""), and proteins. Insulin also regulates the functions of the body's cells, including their growth. Insulin is critical for the body's use of glucose as energy.""""Insulin resistance (IR) is a condition in which the body's cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. That is, the normal response to a given amount of insulin is reduced. As a result, higher levels of insulin are needed in order for insulin to have its proper effects, and the pancreas compensates by trying to produce more insulin. This resistance occurs in response to the body's own insulin (endogenous) or when insulin is administered by injection (exogenous).""""With insulin resistance, the pancreas produces more and more insulin until the pancreas can no longer produce sufficient insulin for the body's demands, and then blood ""'sugar'' rises. Insulin resistance is a risk factor for development of ''diabetes'' and ''heart disease''.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of insulin resistance?,'There are no specific signs and symptoms of insulin resistance.' 
What causes insulin resistance?,"'There are several causes for insulin resistance, and genetic factors (inherited component) are usually significant. Some medications can contribute to insulin resistance. In addition, insulin resistance is often seen with the following conditions:''Other causes of or factors that may worsen insulin resistance can include:'   The metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions involving excess weight (particularly around the waist), high blood pressure, and elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Obesity Pregnancy Infection or severe illness Stress Inactivity and excess weight During steroid use Taking certain medications Older age Sleep problems (especially sleep apnea) Cigarette smoking"
Is insulin resistance prediabetes?,"'Type 2 ''diabetes mellitus'' (T2D) is the type of ''diabetes'' that occurs later in life or with obesity at any age. Insulin resistance precedes the development of ''type 2 diabetes'', sometimes by years. In individuals who will ultimately develop ''type 2 diabetes'', research shows that blood glucose and insulin levels are normal for many years, until at some point in time, insulin resistance develops.''High insulin levels are often associated with central obesity, cholesterol abnormalities, and/or ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''). When these disease processes occur together, it is called the metabolic syndrome.''One action of insulin is to cause the body\'s cells (particularly the muscle and fat cells) to remove and use glucose from the blood. This is one way by which insulin controls the level of glucose in blood. Insulin has this effect on the cells by binding to insulin receptors on the surface of the cells. You can think of it as insulin ""knocking on the doors"" of muscle and fat cells. The cells hear the knock, open up, and let glucose in to be used. With insulin resistance, the muscles don\'t hear the knock (they are resistant). So the pancreas is notified it needs to make more insulin, which increases the level of insulin in the blood and causes a louder knock.''The resistance of the cells continues to increase over time. As long as the pancreas is able to produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance, blood glucose levels remain normal. When the pancreas can no longer produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels begin to rise. Initially, this happens after meals -- when glucose levels are at their highest and more insulin is needed -- but eventually while fasting too (for example, upon waking in the morning). When blood ''sugar'' rises abnormally above certain levels, type 2 ''diabetes'' is present.' "
What are normal insulin levels?,"'The exact values for normal or high insulin levels vary according to the laboratory and the type of test performed. With insulin resistance, there is a high fasting insulin level and a normal to high fasting blood glucose level. High or elevated insulin levels can be seen with other medical conditions as well, including insulin-producing tumors (insulinomas), Cushing syndrome, and fructose or galactose intolerance.' "
What conditions are associated with insulin resistance?,"'While the metabolic syndrome links insulin resistance with abdominal obesity, elevated cholesterol, and ''high blood pressure'', several other medical conditions are specifically associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may contribute to the following conditions:''Type 2 diabetes:'' Overt diabetes may be the first sign insulin resistance is present. Insulin resistance can be noted long before type 2 diabetes develops. Individuals reluctant or unable to see a health care professional often seek medical attention when they have already developed type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.''Fatty ''liver'':'' Fatty liver is strongly associated with insulin resistance. Accumulation of fat in the liver is a manifestation of the disordered control of lipids that occurs with insulin resistance. Fatty liver associated with insulin resistance may be mild or severe. Newer evidence suggests fatty liver may even lead to ''cirrhosis'' of the liver and, possibly, ''liver cancer''.''Arteriosclerosis:'' Arteriosclerosis (also known as ''atherosclerosis'') is a process of progressive thickening and hardening of the walls of medium-sized and large arteries. Arteriosclerosis is responsible for:''Other risk factors for arteriosclerosis include:''Skin lesions:'' Skin lesions include increased skin tags and a condition called acanthosis nigricans (AN). Acanthosis nigricans is a darkening and thickening of the skin, especially in folds such as the neck, under the arms, and in the groin. This condition is directly related to the insulin resistance, though the exact mechanism is not clear.''Polycystic ovary syndrome'' (''PCOS''):'' Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common hormonal problem which affects menstruating women. It is associated with irregular periods or no periods at all (''amenorrhea''), obesity, and increased body hair in a male pattern of distribution (called hirsutism; for example, moustache, sideburns, beard, mid-chest, and central belly hair).''Hyperandrogenism:'' With ''PCOS'', the ovaries can produce high levels of the hormone testosterone. This high testosterone level can be seen with insulin resistance and may play a role in causing PCOS. Why this association occurs is unclear, but it appears the insulin resistance somehow causes abnormal ovarian hormone production.''Growth abnormalities:'"" High levels of circulating insulin can affect growth. While insulin's effects on glucose metabolism may be impaired, its effects on other mechanisms may remain intact (or at least less impaired). Insulin is an anabolic hormone which promotes growth. Patients may actually grow larger with a noticeable coarsening of features. Children with open growth plates in their bones may actually grow faster than their peers. However, neither children nor adults with insulin resistance become taller than predicted by their familial growth pattern. Indeed, most adults simply appear larger with coarser features. The increased incidence of skin tags mentioned earlier may occur through this mechanism too.""'Reproductive abnormalities in women'   Coronary artery disease (leading to angina and heart attack) Strokes Peripheral vascular disease High levels of ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol High blood pressure (hypertension) Smoking Diabetes mellitus from any cause Family history of arteriosclerosis Acanthosis nigricans is a cosmetic condition strongly associated with insulin resistance in which the skin darkens and thickens in creased areas (for example, the neck, armpits, and groin). Skin tags occur more frequently in patients with insulin resistance. A skin tag is a common, benign condition where a bit of skin projects from the surrounding skin. Skin tags vary significantly in appearance. A skin tag may appear smooth or irregular, flesh-colored or darker than surrounding skin, and either be simply raised above surrounding skin or attached by a stalk (peduncle) so that it hangs from the skin."
Who is more likely to develop insulin resistance?,"'An individual is more likely to have or develop insulin resistance if he or she:' Is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) more than 25 kg/m2. You can calculate your BMI by taking your weight (in kilograms) and dividing twice by your height (in meters). Is a man with a waist more than 40 inches or a woman with a waist more than 35 inches Is over 40 years of age Is of Latino, African American, Native American, or Asian American ancestry Has close family members who have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or arteriosclerosis Has had gestational diabetes Has a history of high blood pressure, high blood triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, arteriosclerosis (or other components of the metabolic syndrome) Has polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Displays acanthosis nigricans"
Which specialties of doctors treat insulin resistance?,"'Insulin resistance may be treated by primary care professionals, including internists, family doctors, or pediatricians. Endocrinologists, specialists in hormonal disorders, also treat patients with insulin resistance.' "
Is there a test to diagnose insulin resistance?,"'A health care professional can identify individuals likely to have insulin resistance by taking a detailed history, performing a physical examination, and simple laboratory testing based on individual risk factors.''In general practice, the fasting blood glucose and insulin levels are usually adequate to determine whether insulin resistance and/or diabetes is present. The exact insulin level for diagnosis varies by assay (by laboratory). However, a fasting insulin level above the upper quartile in a non-diabetic patient is considered abnormal.' "
Can insulin resistance be reversed?,"'Management of insulin resistance is through lifestyle changes (such as ''diet'', exercise, and ''disease prevention'') and medications.\xa0''Weight loss'' may help reverse insulin resistance along with and taking small steps, such as exercising and eating healthier foods. It also\xa0can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with ''prediabetes''.' "
Is there a special diet meal plan to treat insulin resistance?,"'The need for insulin can be reduced by altering the diet, particularly the carbohydrates in the diet. Carbohydrates are absorbed into the body as they are broken up into their component sugars. Some carbohydrates break and absorb faster than others; these are referred to as having a high ''glycemic index''. These carbohydrates increase the blood glucose level more rapidly and require the secretion of more insulin to control the level of glucose in the blood.''Examples of carbohydrates with a ''high glycemic index'' that rapidly raise blood glucose levels include:''Examples of foods with a low glycemic index include:''Since foods are rarely eaten in isolation, one could argue that the glycemic index of each food is less important than the overall profile of the whole meal and associated ''drinks''.' Unrefined sugars (such as fruit juice and table sugar) White bread Unrefined corn and potato products (such as bagels, mashed potatoes, doughnuts, corn chips, and French fries) Foods with higher fiber content (such as whole grain breads and brown rice) Non-starchy vegetables (such as broccoli, green beans, asparagus, carrots, and greens). These are low in calories and in total carbohydrates, and contain vitamins and fiber."
What foods help prevent type 2 diabetes?,"'Foods that are particularly helpful for people trying to prevent type 2 diabetes and maintain a healthy weight are similar to the ''low glycemic index foods'' described above:''Several studies have confirmed that ''weight loss'' -- and even ''aerobic exercise'' without ''weight loss'' -- increases the rate at which muscle cells take glucose from the blood as a result of improved sensitivity.' Vegetables and fruits provide fiber and vitamins. Fat-free or low-fat dairy products provide calcium and strengthen bones. Avoid full-fat dairy products, as high-fat foods can worsen insulin resistance. Whole-grain products have a lower glycemic index than refined grains and are rich in fiber. Nuts contain fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, or sardines, is a source of ""good"" (heart-healthy) fats. Lean meats or beans are an excellent source of protein."
Can exercise reduce the development of type 2 diabetes?,'Multiple studies have shown that diet and exercise reduce the development of type 2 diabetes and can reduce insulin resistance.' 
What medications treat insulin resistance?,"'Metformin'' (''Glucophage'') is a medication used for treating type 2 diabetes. It exerts two actions that help control blood glucose levels. Metformin prevents the liver from releasing glucose into the blood, and it increases the sensitivity of muscle and fat cells to insulin, allowing them to remove more glucose from the blood. By these actions, metformin lowers blood insulin levels because lower blood sugar levels tell the pancreas to put out less insulin.''Metformin is a reasonably safe medication when used in the proper population. Although occasionally associated with gastrointestinal side effects, metformin is usually well tolerated. While there are no FDA-approved ''drugs'' to prevent type 2 diabetes or to treat pre-type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance), the American Diabetes Association has recommended that metformin be the only drug considered for the ''prevention'' of type 2 diabetes.' "
Can insulin resistance be prevented?,"'Insulin resistance cannot always be prevented, but there are ways to modify risk factors, such as keeping a healthy weight and getting regular exercise.' "
What is the prognosis for insulin resistance?,"'Insulin resistance is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes unless measures are taken to reverse the insulin resistance. Weight loss, eating a healthy diet, not ''smoking'', and exercise, as described previously, can all help reverse insulin resistance.' "
What new research is being conducted on insulin resistance?,"'Insulin resistance has gained awareness and significance, in its own right, as a contributor to the metabolic syndrome. Timely intervention can delay the onset of overt type 2 diabetes. Future studies must assess longer intervals than research to date in order to determine the duration for treatment to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and related complications.''Lifestyle changes (in ''nutrition'' and physical activity) are clearly important to delay the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals with insulin resistance and are the primary recommendation for ''prevention of diabetes'' in high-risk individuals. Metformin is the only drug recommended by guidelines, for those patients at highest risk. Education about these changes must be directed to all groups at risk for type 2 diabetes. ''Childhood obesity'' is epidemic and on the rise in the developed countries. Changes must be made in homes and school cafeterias to ensure healthier ''nutrition''.' "
What is iritis?,"'Iritis is an inflammation of the ''iris'', which is the colored portion of the eye surrounding the pupil. Iritis appears with varying degrees of redness of the affected eye, often with significant ''pain'', ''sensitivity to light'', tearing, and ''blurred vision''. It is usually unilateral, but with some underlying systemic disease processes, it may affect both eyes.'  "
Iritis vs. uveitis,"'The iris is one of three parts of a tissue in the eye called the uvea (the other two parts are the ciliary body located behind the iris, and the choroid at the back of the eye). Uveitis refers to any swelling along the uveal tract. Anterior uveitis and iridocyclitis are other names for iritis.' "
What causes iritis?,"""Iritis has many causes. Most of the time, the inflammation is idiopathic (that is, of unknown cause). In these cases, the acute iritis may occur only once in a person's life.""'Iritis can be associated with a variety of conditions, including several systemic diseases. In these cases, it is often recurrent.'   Infection such as herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster virus (shingles), tuberculosis, syphilis, and others Injury to the eye can result in traumatic iritis. Rarely, a history of previous trauma to the other eye can create a delayed onset iritis of the non-traumatized eye. Autoimmune disorders such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, HLA-B27-associated disease like ankylosing spondylitis and collagen vascular diseases such as lupus Inflammation following eye surgery Sarcoidosis Adamantiades-Behçet's disease, in which the inflammation is centered around the blood vessels in the uveal tissue Inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease Certain medications have been associated with iritis (for example, prostaglandin analog glaucoma medications) A more posterior uveitis (for example, intermediate uveitis and choroiditis) with inflammatory cells that spill over into the anterior chamber (front part of the eye) can mimic iritis. Similarly, a retinal detachment can create spillover of pigment and cells into the anterior chamber, which could also mimic an iritis."
What are symptoms iritis?,"   Eye pain Blurred vision, especially if a more extensive posterior uveitis is also present Sensitivity to light and often pain when exposed to bright light (photophobia)"
What are signs of iritis?," Redness Tearing Presence of inflammatory white blood cells in the anterior chamber (the space between the cornea and the lens in the front part of the eye) seen under the slit lamp microscope A hypopyon can form, as well. This is a collection of white blood cells that pool in the anterior chamber, typically settling in the bottom half. Sometimes one can see the hypopyon with the naked eye as a layer of white material visible in front of the inferior iris. A hyphema is a similarly located collection of red blood cells that sometimes appears with traumatic iritis. Possible change in eye pressure (low or high)"
How do health care professionals diagnose iritis?,"""An eye doctor will ask for a patient's complete medical and ""'ocular'' history and any family history of uveitis. The ophthalmologist will perform a complete eye exam to look for iritis, complications of iritis, and clues that help determine the cause of the iritis.''The physician will use a slit lamp microscope to confirm a diagnosis of iritis. The presence of white cells in the aqueous (liquid inside the eye) indicates there is inflammation. By performing a complete eye examination, including dilation to examine the back of the eye, the eye doctor can determine the extent of the inflammation (iritis versus a more extensive uveitis) and look for clues as to the cause.''If there is no obvious cause, and it is the first occurrence, no additional testing may be necessary. However, if the iritis is severe or recurring, or if posterior uveitis is also present, the doctor will order additional testing, including blood work and a ''chest X-ray'' to rule out an associated disease.''The eye pressure can be lower or higher than usual. If it is dangerously high, the eye doctor will need to address this together with the iritis.' "
What are iritis treatment options?,"'The mainstay of treatment is steroid eyedrops. With a severe case, a physician may need to inject steroids into the eye, or the patient may need to take steroid orally.''If an autoimmune disease is associated with iritis, newer ''drugs'' such as immunomodulatory therapy (for example, ''methotrexate'', ''azathioprine'', mycophenolate) and biologic response modifier drugs (for example, ''infliximab'', ''adalimumab'') used to treat the disease may help resolve the iritis, as well. If an infection causes the iritis, anti-infectives (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, antiparasitics, etc.) are necessary.''An eye doctor also will prescribe a cycloplegic (dilating drop) such as cyclopentolate, which can help relieve much of the pain symptoms. The dilation can also prevent the swollen iris from becoming scarred down and adherent to the lens of the eye, which lies behind the pupil. When portions of the iris become stuck to the lens, they form synechiae. If too many synechial attachments form, the eye pressure can rise to dangerous levels, producing glaucomatous ''vision loss''. If the eye pressure is high (due to the iritis itself or due to synechiae), an eye doctor will prescribe pressure-lowering eyedrops.'  "
How long does iritis last?,"'Usually, iritis clears in days, but it may last for months or become chronic and recurrent. It is very important that a physician recognizes and treats iritis immediately. Patients should continue treatment until the inflammation resolves completely to avoid complications associated with chronic iritis or uveitis.' "
What are complications of iritis?,"'Permanent vision loss is rare but may occur if the retina develops fluid collections called CME (cystoid macular ''edema'') or if high eye pressure leads to glaucomatous damage to the ''optic nerve''.''Scarring of the iris to the lens (synechiae) or to the drainage channels in the eye (peripheral anterior synechiae) can lead to acutely or chronically elevated eye pressures, which ultimately may result in ''glaucoma''.''Both the iritis itself and the side effects of the steroids used to treat iritis can lead to premature ''cataract'"" formation. A cataract is a clouding of the eye's lens.""'Patients with longstanding iritis sometimes have corneal mineral deposits (band keratopathy). This can lead to both blurred vision and ''dry eye'' symptoms. Corneal cloudiness can occur if chronically ''elevated eye pressure'' damages the corneal endothelial cells located on the back of the cornea.' "
What is the prognosis for iritis?,"'In most cases, iritis responds to a short course of steroid eyedrops and cycloplegics (dilation drops) with no problems. However, in untreated or recurring iritis and uveitis, the prognosis ultimately depends on the severity, frequency, and duration of the iritis and any resulting complications. Associated diseases or infections may also result in damage to the eye, resulting in ''chronic pain'' or vision loss.' "
What is the latest research on iritis?,"'The field of uveitis includes many inflammatory ''eye conditions'', as well as iritis, and major work is ongoing. Because iritis usually responds so well to treatment, the research primarily focuses on the management of cases that are more severe or involve the eye more extensively. This work benefits our understanding of the mechanism of iritis and the treatment of it. Besides looking for more effective medications, there is also research concerned with looking for the best way of delivering medications to the eye.' "

What is iron and why do we need it?,"'Iron is a mineral needed by our bodies. Iron is a part of all cells and does many things in our bodies. For example, iron (as part of the protein ''hemoglobin'') carries oxygen from our ''lungs'' throughout our bodies. Having too little ''hemoglobin'' is called ''anemia''. Iron also helps our muscles store and use oxygen.'""Iron is a part of many enzymes and is used in many cell functions. Enzymes help our bodies digest foods and also help with many other important reactions that occur within our bodies. When our bodies don't have enough iron, many parts of our bodies are affected."" "
What is iron deficiency and why is it a concern?,"'Iron deficiency is a condition resulting from too little iron in the body. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and the leading cause of ''anemia'' in the United States.''The terms ''anemia'', iron deficiency, and ''iron deficiency anemia'' often are used interchangeably but equivalent. Iron deficiency ranges from depleted iron stores without functional or health impairment to iron deficiency with anemia, which affects the functioning of several organ systems.''Iron deficiency is a concern because:' Iron deficiency can delay normal infant motor function (normal activity and movement) or mental function (normal thinking and processing skills). Iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy can increase risk for small or early (preterm) babies.  Small or early babies are more likely to have health problems or die in the first year of life than infants who are born full term and are not small. Iron deficiency can cause fatigue that impairs the ability to do physical work in adults. Iron deficiency may also affect memory or other mental function in teens."
Signs and Symptoms of Iron Deficiency,"'Too little iron can impair body functions, but most physical signs and symptoms do not show up unless iron deficiency anemia occurs. Someone with early stages of iron deficiency may have no signs or symptoms. This is why it is important to screen for too little iron among high risk groups.''Signs of iron deficiency anemia include'':'   Feeling tired and weak Decreased work and school performance Slow cognitive and social development during childhood Difficulty maintaining body temperature Decreased immune function, which increases susceptibility to infection Glossitis (an inflamed tongue)"
What causes iron deficiency?,"'Iron deficiency has many causes. (See table below for a summary). These causes fall into two main categories:''Many common conditions can cause people to need additional iron:''The amount of iron absorbed from the ''diet'' depends on many factors:' Increased iron needs Because of their rapid growth, infants and toddlers need more iron than older children. Sometimes it can be hard for them to get enough iron from their normal diet. Women who are pregnant have higher iron needs. To get enough, most women must take an iron supplement as recommended by their healthcare provider. When people lose blood, they also lose iron. They need extra iron to replace what they have lost. Increased blood loss can occur with heavy menstrual periods, frequent blood donation, as well as with some stomach and intestinal conditions (food sensitivity, hookworms.) Decreased iron intake or absorption (not enough iron taken into the body) Iron from meat, poultry, and fish (i.e., heme iron) is absorbed two to three times more efficiently than iron from plants (i.e., non-heme iron). The amount of iron absorbed from plant foods (non-heme iron) depends on the other types of foods eaten at the same meal. Foods containing heme iron (meat, poultry, and fish) enhance iron absorption from foods that contain non-heme iron (e.g., fortified cereals, some beans, and spinach). Foods containing vitamin C (see Dietary Sources of vitamin C) also enhance non-heme iron absorption when eaten at the same meal. Substances (such as polyphenols, phytates, or calcium) that are part of some foods or drinks such as tea, coffee, whole grains, legumes and milk or dairy products can decrease the amount of non-heme iron absorbed at a meal. Calcium can also decrease the amount heme-iron absorbed at a meal. However, for healthy individuals who consume a varied diet that conforms to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the amount of iron inhibition from these substances is usually not of concern.  Vegetarian diets are low in heme iron, but careful meal planning can help increase the amount of iron absorbed. Some other factors (such as taking antacids beyond the recommended dose or medicine used to treat peptic ulcer disease and acid reflux) can reduce the amount of acid in the stomach and the iron absorbed and cause iron deficiency. Rapid growth Pregnancy Blood loss
Heavy menstrual periods
Frequent blood donation
Some stomach and intestinal conditions (food sensitivity, hookworms)

 Heavy menstrual periods Frequent blood donation Some stomach and intestinal conditions (food sensitivity, hookworms) Lack of heme iron sources in the diet (e.g., vegetarian diets) Low absorption

 Taking antacids beyond the recommended dose or medicine used to treat peptic ulcer disease and acid reflux can reduce the amount of iron absorbed in the stomach."
Who is most at risk for iron deficiency?," Young children and pregnant women are at higher risk of iron deficiency because of rapid growth and higher iron needs.  Adolescent girls and women of childbearing age are at risk due to menstruation. Among children, iron deficiency is seen most often between six months and three years of age due to rapid growth and inadequate intake of dietary iron. Infants and children at highest risk are the following groups:
Babies who were born early or small.
Babies given cow's milk before age 12 months.
Breastfed babies who after age 6 months are not being given plain, iron-fortified cereals or another good source of iron from other foods.
Formula-fed babies who do not get iron-fortified formulas.
Children aged 1–5 years who get more than 24 ounces of cow, goat, or soymilk per day. Excess milk intake can decrease your child's desire for food items with greater iron content, such as meat or iron fortified cereal.
Children who have special health needs, for example, children with chronic infections or restricted diets.

How is iron deficiency detected?,"'Your doctor or healthcare provider will do blood tests to screen for iron deficiency. No single test is used to diagnose iron deficiency. The most common tests for screening are''These tests show how much iron is in your body. Hemoglobin and ''hematocrit'"" levels usually aren't decreased until the later stages of iron deficiency, i.e., anemia.""'Sometimes other blood tests are used to confirm that anemia is due to iron deficiency. These might include'    Hemoglobin test (a test that measures hemoglobin which is a protein in the blood that carries oxygen)  Hematocrit test (the percentage of red blood cells in your blood by volume)  Complete blood count (to look at the number and volume of the red blood cells) Serum ferritin (a measure of a stored form of iron) Serum iron (a measure of the iron in your blood) Transferrin saturation (a measure of the transported form of iron) Transferrin receptor (a measure of increased red blood cell production)"
How is iron deficiency treated?,"""Again, it is important to be diagnosed by your healthcare provider because iron deficiency can have causes that aren't related to your diet. Your healthcare provider's recommendations will be specific to your needs.""   If you are found to have an iron deficiency, it is important to see your healthcare provider for treatment. Your treatment will depend on factors such as your age, health, and cause of iron deficiency. If your doctor or health care provider thinks that you have iron deficiency she or he may prescribe iron supplements for you to take and then ask that you return after a period to have your hemoglobin or hematocrit tested. If your healthcare provider determines that the iron deficiency is due to a diet low in iron, you might be told to eat more iron-rich foods. Your health care provider may also prescribe an iron supplement for you."
What can I do to prevent iron deficiency?,"'In general, you can eat a healthful diet that includes good sources of iron. A healthful diet includes''In addition to a healthful diet that includes good sources of iron, you can also eat foods that help your body absorb iron better. For example, you can eat a fruit or vegetable that is a good source of vitamin C (see table on Dietary Sources of vitamin C) with a food or meal that contains non-heme iron (see table below for Dietary Sources of Iron). Vitamin C helps your body absorb the non-heme iron foods you eat, especially when the food containing non-heme iron and the vitamin-C rich food are eaten at the same meal.''The following recommendations are for specific groups who are at greater risk for iron deficiency.''It is recommended that pregnant women:' fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat free or nonfat milk and milk products, lean meats, fish, dry beans, eggs, nuts, and is low in saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, salt, and added sugars. If possible, breastfeed your baby for at least 12 months and starting at 4 to 6 months of age, give your baby plain, iron-fortified infant cereal and/or pureed meat. Just two or more servings a day can meet a baby's iron needs at this age. Meats should be home prepared or commercially prepared plain pureed (chopped until smooth in a blender) meats. When your baby is about 6 months of age, include a feeding per day of foods rich in vitamin C with foods that are rich in non-heme iron to improve iron absorption. If you can't breastfeed, use iron-fortified formula. Don't give low-iron milks (e.g. cow's milk, goat's milk, and soy milk) until your baby is at least 12 months old. If your baby was born early or small, talk to your doctor about giving iron drops to your baby. If your baby can't get two or more servings per day of iron rich foods (such as iron-fortified cereal or pureed meats), talk to your doctor about giving iron drops to your baby. After your child is one year old, give no more than three 8 ounce servings of whole cow, goat, or soy milk per day. After your child is 2 years old, low fat or nonfat milks should be used in place of whole milks. Vitamin D-fortified milk is a good source of calcium and vitamin D, but not iron. Give your child a diet with iron-rich foods such as iron-fortified breads and iron-fortified cereals and lean meats.

Iron Overload and Hemochromatosis, Iron overload is the accumulation of excess iron in body tissues. Hemochromatosis is the disease resulting from significant iron overload. Hemochromatosis can have genetic and non-genetic causes.
What is hereditary hemochromatosis?,"'Hereditary ''hemochromatosis'' is an ''inherited'' (genetic) disorder in which there is excessive accumulation of iron in the body (''iron overload''). It is a common ''genetic disorder'' among Caucasians in the United States, affecting approximately 1 million people in the United States. Individuals affected with hereditary hemochromatosis may have no symptoms or signs (and have normal longevity), or they can have severe symptoms and signs of iron overload that include sexual dysfunction, ''heart failure'', ''joint pains'', ''cirrhosis'' of the ''liver'', ''diabetes'', ''fatigue'', and darkening of the skin.''The normal iron content of the body is three to four grams. The total amount of iron in the body is carefully controlled. The body loses one mg of iron daily from sweat and cells that are shed from the skin and the inner lining of the ''intestines''. Women also lose one mg of iron daily on average from ''menstruation''. In normal adults, the intestines absorb one mg of iron daily from food to replace the lost iron, and therefore, there is no excess accumulation of iron in the body. When iron losses are greater, more iron is absorbed from food.''In individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, the daily absorption of iron from the intestines is greater than the amount needed to replace losses. Since the normal body cannot increase iron excretion, the absorbed iron accumulates in the body. At this rate of iron accumulation, a man with hemochromatosis can accumulate 20 grams of total body iron by age 40 to 50. This excess iron deposits in the joints, liver, testicles, and ''heart'', causing damage to these organs and signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. Women with hemochromatosis accumulate iron at a slower rate than men because they lose more iron than men due to iron loss from ''menstruation'' and ''breastfeeding''. Therefore, they typically develop signs and symptoms\xa0of organ damage due to excess iron 10 years later than men.' "
How is hereditary hemachromatosis inherited?,"'\tHereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means an individual has the possibility of developing iron overload only when a pair of abnormal genes are inherited from both parents. (An autosomal recessive disorder is different from autosomal dominant disorder in which individuals can develop disease by inheriting a single abnormal gene from only one parent.)''\tThe ''human body'' is composed of trillions of cells. Inside the inner core (nucleus) of each cell are chromosomes. Every human cell has two sets of 23 chromosomes (total of 46 chromosomes). Each set is inherited from one parent. Chromosomes contain DNA that carries genes that govern all bodily functions including cell metabolism, appearance, height, intelligence, hair and eye color, and other physical traits. Defects in DNA (also called mutations) are passed from one generation to the next, and sometimes can cause diseases.''\tThere are primarily two mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis; C282Y and H63D. The numbers 282 and 63 designate the location of the defects on the HFE gene located on chromosome number 6. An individual who inherits two C282Y mutations (one from each parent) is called a C282Y homozygote, and has a significant chance of developing hemochromatosis. In fact, C282Y homozygotes account for the majority of cases of hereditary hemochromatosis. Patients who inherit one C282Y mutation from one parent and another H63D mutation from another parent are called compound heterozygotes, accounting for a small number of the cases of hereditary hemochromatosis.'

What are the symptoms and signs of hemochromatosis?,"'\tPeople with early hemochromatosis have no symptoms and are unaware of their condition. The disease may then be suspected when elevated iron blood levels are noted by routine blood testing.' 
		In men, symptoms may not appear until 30-50 years of age. Iron deposits in the skin cause darkening of the skin. Since females lose iron through menstrual blood loss, nonmenstruating women develop symptoms 15 to 20 years later. 
		Iron deposits in the pituitary gland and testicles cause shrinkage of the testicles and impotence. 
		Iron deposits in the pancreas cause a decrease in insulin production resulting in diabetes. 
		Iron deposits in the heart muscle can cause cardiomyopathy and lead to heart failure as well as abnormal heart rhythms. 
		Iron accumulation in the liver causes scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and an increased risk of developing liver cancer."
How is hemochromatosis diagnosed?,"'Most patients with hemochromatosis are diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 50; and about 75% have no symptoms. Hemochromatosis is discovered when elevated levels of iron in the blood are found as part of routine blood testing; or when blood iron levels are measured as in screening studies in family members of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. Some patients are diagnosed as having hemochromatosis when their doctors perform blood iron levels as part of the evaluation for abnormal elevations in blood levels of ''liver enzymes'', AST and ALT. However, symptoms of skin bronzing or ''hyperpigmentation'' (about 70% eventually develop this symptom), ''diabetes'', ''liver disease'', arthropathy, hypogonadism, ''cardiomyopathy'', and ''impotence'' or no menstrual periods (''amenorrhea'') may be present and may suggest that additional screening tests such as transferrin saturation and other blood and ''liver tests'' be ordered.''There are several blood tests that reflect the amount of iron in the body;\xa0ferritin level, iron level, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation.''Ferritin is a blood protein whose levels correlate with the amount of iron stored in the body. Blood ferritin levels usually are low in patients with\xa0''iron deficiency anemia'', and are high in patients with hemochromatosis and other conditions that cause an increase in body iron levels. Since ferritin also can be elevated in certain infections like ''viral hepatitis'' and other inflammatory conditions in the body, an elevated ferritin level alone is not sufficient to accurately diagnose hemochromatosis.''Serum iron, TIBC, and transferrin saturation are often performed together. Serum iron is the measure of the amount of iron in serum (the liquid portion of the blood). TIBC is a measure of the total amount of iron that can be carried in serum by transferrin, a protein that carries iron in serum from one part of the body to another. Transferrin saturation is a number calculated by dividing serum iron by TIBC - it is a number that reflects what percentage of the transferrin that is being used to transport iron. In healthy individuals the transferrin saturation is between 20% and 45%. In patients with ''iron deficiency'' ''anemia'', the serum iron and transferrin saturation are abnormally low; and in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis the serum iron and transferrin saturation may be abnormally high. Consequently, if transferrin saturation is about 45% or higher, the presence of mutations C282Y or H63D should be examined to confirm the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis.''Since serum iron can be elevated by eating and can fluctuate during the day, serum iron measurements should be done fasting, usually in the morning before breakfast.''The most accurate test for diagnosing hemochromatosis\xa0used to be the measurement of the iron content of liver tissue obtained by a biopsy. A ''liver biopsy'' involves the removal of a sample of liver tissue for analysis and is usually performed with a needle under local anesthesia. After numbing the skin and the underlying tissues, the doctor inserts the needle into the liver through the right lower rib cage, sometimes under ''ultrasound'' guidance. The tissue obtained by the needle is studied under a microscope for signs of active ''liver disease'', fibrosis and cirrhosis (permanent scarring), and iron content (usually significantly elevated in hemochromatosis).''The liver biopsy also has prognostic value because it determines whether the patient already has irreversible advanced cirrhosis. Patients with hemochromatosis who have a normal liver biopsy have longevity similar to other healthy adults if adequately treated, while patients with cirrhosis as a result of hemochromatosis have significantly reduced longevity. Furthermore, the risks of cirrhotic patients developing liver ''cancer'' (hepatocellular ''carcinoma'') are substantially higher than normal subjects, even with adequate treatment of the iron overload with phlebotomy. However, with the newer genetic testing, this invasive technique should be used only under certain conditions and is used infrequently.''The gene for hereditary hemochromatosis was identified in 1996. The gene is referred to as the HFE gene. Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated in most patients with two mutations of the HFE gene; C282Y and H63D. Currently, most investigators consider detection of these genes as diagnosis of heriditary hemochromatosis.''A C282Y homozygote is a person who has inherited one mutated C282Y gene from each parent. A C282Y homozygote is considered at considerable risk for developing iron overload disease. However, not every C282Y homozygote develops iron overload.''A C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote is a person who has inherited one mutated C282Y gene from one parent and a second mutated H63D gene from the other parent. Most compound heterozygotes have normal iron levels though some can develop mild to moderate iron overload.''A C282Y heterozygote is a person who has inherited one mutated C282Y gene from one parent and a second normal HFE gene from the other parent. Children born of two C282Y heterozygotes have a 25% chance of being a C282Y homozygote and, therefore, will be at risk of developing hemochromatosis. A C282Y heterozygote does not develop iron overload.''An algorithm for diagnosing hereditary hemochromatosis is as follows:''Who should undergo liver biopsy?''Not all patients with hemochromatosis need to undergo liver biopsy. The purpose of liver biopsy is to identify those patients with cirrhosis and to exclude other possible liver diseases. (Patients with hemochromatosis and cirrhosis are at increased risk of complications, especially liver ''cancer''.)''Young patients (<40 years of age) who are C282Y homozygotes with normal\xa0''liver blood tests'' and\xa0serum ferritin levels <1000 ng/ml have a very low risk of having cirrhosis of the liver. Therefore, these patients can be treated with therapeutic phlebotomy without a liver biopsy. Their prognosis is excellent with adequate treatment.''Older patients (>40 years of age) who have serum ferritin levels >1000 ng/ml, and have abnormally elevated liver blood tests may already have developed cirrhosis. Doctors may recommend liver biopsies in these patients provided that it is safe for them to undergo liver biopsy.' Adults suspected of having hereditary hemochromatosis (for example, adult, first-degree relatives of a patient with hereditary hemochromatosis) are evaluated by measurements of fasting serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation and ferritin. Patients with elevated serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation of greater than 45% are evaluated by genetic testing Patients with transferrin saturation greater than 45% who are C282Y homozygotes have hemochromatosis and, therefore, should be treated with therapeutic phlebotomy (see below)."
How is hemochromatosis treated?,"'The most effective treatment for hemochromatosis is to reduce iron in the body by phlebotomy (withdrawal of blood from the arm veins). One unit of blood, which contains 250 mg of iron, usually is withdrawn every one to two weeks. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are checked every two to three months. Once ferritin levels are below 50 ng/ml and transferrin saturations are below 50%, the frequency of phlebotomies are reduced to every two to three months. When hemochromatosis is diagnosed early and is treated effectively, damage to the liver, heart, testicles, pancreas and joints can be prevented completely, and patients maintain normal health. In patients with established cirrhosis, effective treatment can improve the function of the heart, skin color, and diabetes. However, cirrhosis is irreversible and the risk of developing liver ''cancer'' remains.''The benefits of therapeutic phlebotomy in hemochromatosis are as follows:' It prevents the development of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer if the disease is discovered and treated early. It improves liver function partially in patients who have already developed advanced cirrhosis. It improves and/or completely resolves symptoms of weakness, liver pain, joint pain, and fatigue. It improves function of the heart in patients with mild and early heart disease."
What about diet recommendations for people with hemochromatosis?," 
		A normal balanced diet is recommended without avoidance of iron containing foods provided patients are undergoing effective therapeutic phlebotomy. 
Alcohol should be avoided since alcohol consumption increases the risk of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
		Ingestion of high doses of vitamin C in individuals with iron overload may lead to fatal abnormal heart rhythms. Therefore, it is reasonable to avoid vitamin C supplementation until patients are adequately treated. 
		Raw seafood should be avoided since people with hemochromatosis are at risk of acquiring bacterial infections that flourish in iron rich environment."
What are the recommendations for screening for liver cancer in hemochromatosis?,"'\tLiver ''cancers'' (hepatoma or hepatocellular cancer) mainly occur in patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, patients with hemochromatosis and cirrhosis should have abdominal ultrasound examinations and blood tests for alpha-fetal protein (a protein produced by liver cancer) every six months.' "
What is IBS?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the presence of a cluster of symptoms and signs in adults or children that include cramping, ''abdominal pain'', increased gas, altered bowel habits, food intolerance, and bloating (distention).''Irritable bowel'' syndrome is a ""functional"" disorder. This term refers to the changes in the functioning of the ''digestive system'' that results in the collection of symptoms referred to as IBS, meaning that it is a problem with the movement (motility) rather than any damage to the tissues of the digestive system.''In the past, ''irritable bowel'' syndrome was also called spastic colon or bowel, functional bowel disease, mucous ''colitis'', or nervous colon.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of IBS?,"'Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized mostly by abdominal ''pain'' and cramping. Other symptoms and signs include:''While not technically a symptom, nearly 70% of people with IBS also experience ''indigestion''.''Symptoms are often relieved by bowel movements. Women with IBS may have more symptoms during their menstrual periods.'   Diarrhea: IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) can come with sudden urges to have bowel movements and loose stools. Constipation: IBS with constipation (IBS-C) can be accompanied by straining during bowel movements and infrequent stools. Increased gas Abdominal swelling or bloating Abdominal pain or discomfort Cramping pain after eating certain foods Nausea Mucousy or foamy stool Unexplained weight loss Loss of appetite"
What causes IBS?,"'The exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome is unknown. It is believed to be due to a number of factors, including alteration in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract motility, abnormal nervous system signals, increased sensitivity to pain, and food intolerances. The following are risk factors thought to cause IBS:' Abnormal movements of the colon and small intestines (too fast or slow, or too strong) Hypersensitivity to pain from a full bowel or gas Food sensitivities, possibly caused by poor absorption of sugars or acids in food Gastroenteritis (""stomach flu"" or ""stomach bug""), a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and intestines, may trigger IBS symptoms Psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression are observed in many people with IBS, though these conditions have not been found to be a direct cause of IBS. Reproductive hormones or neurotransmitters may be off-balance in people with IBS. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) Genetics is thought to be a possible cause of IBS, but so far, this hereditary link has not been proven."
Is there an IBS diet? What foods trigger IBS?,"'What you eat and how you eat can affect symptom of this condition. While it may not be possible to completely prevent IBS symptoms, you may find that certain foods trigger IBS symptoms. To help figure out which foods cause you symptoms, a doctor may suggest keeping a food diary.''Some foods can help in the ''prevention'' of symptoms.'   Dietary fiber supplements Water Low-fat foods High-carbohydrate foods (such as whole wheat pasta, brown rice, and whole grain breads) Probiotics (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus a and Bifidobacterium) and prebiotics Some people report kefir or Aloe Vera juice helps symptoms. Talk to a doctor about these home remedies. A high-fiber diet may help relieve constipation in some cases of IBS, but it may also worsen some symptoms such as bloating and gas. The current recommended daily fiber intake is 20-35 grams daily. Most people fall short of this daily fiber intake and can benefit from a small increase in fiber, but it is best to increase the amount in your diet slowly to reduce gas. Dairy products, including milk and cheese (Lactose intolerance symptoms can be similar to IBS symptoms.) Certain vegetables that increase gas (such as cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts) and legumes (such as beans) Fatty or fried foods Alcohol, caffeine, or soda Foods high in sugars Artificial sweeteners Chewing gum Nuts"
What is a low FODMAP diet?,"'A ''low FODMAP diet'' may also help relieve ''symptoms of IBS''. ''FODMAP'' refers to a group of short-chain carbohydrates (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) that are not well absorbed in the small intestine and are rapidly fermented by bacteria in the gut. These bacteria produce gas, which can contribute to IBS symptoms.''The lists of foods both high and low in ''FODMAPs'' are extensive. The International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, Inc. (IFFGD) has suggestions of foods to eat and foods to avoid if you follow the FODMAP diet for IBS. Talk to your doctor for more information.' "
What are IBS-D (IBS with diarrhea) and IBS-C (IBS with constipation)?, IBS-D stands for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. The most common symptoms of IBS-D include:Frequent stoolsFeeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movementsNausea.People with IBS-D also may experience signs and symptoms of:GasAbdominal pain or discomfortSudden urges to have a bowel movementLoose stools Frequent stools Feeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movements Nausea. People with IBS-D also may experience signs and symptoms of:GasAbdominal pain or discomfortSudden urges to have a bowel movementLoose stools Gas Abdominal pain or discomfort Sudden urges to have a bowel movement Loose stools IBS-C stands for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. The most common symptoms of IBS-C include:Infrequent stoolsStraining during bowel movementsFeeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movementsFeeling as if you need to have a bowel movement but are unableAbdominal painBloatingGas Infrequent stools Straining during bowel movements Feeling as if you are unable to completely empty your bowels during bowel movements Feeling as if you need to have a bowel movement but are unable Abdominal pain Bloating Gas
IBS vs. IBD are the same bowel disease?,"'While both irritable bowel syndrome and ''inflammatory bowel disease'' can have similar symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and urgent bowel movements; however, IBS is not the same as ''IBD''.' IBD is a group of separate diseases that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and is a more severe condition. Irritable bowel syndrome is considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder because there is abnormal bowel function. IBS is a group of symptoms and not a disease in itself, which is why it’s called a ‘syndrome,’ and it is considered less serious than IBD. Irritable bowel syndrome does not cause inflammation like inflammatory bowel disease, and it does not result in permanent damage to the intestines, intestinal bleeding, rectal bleeding, ulcers, or the harmful complications that are often seen with IBD."
IBS vs. SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)? Are they the same disease?,"'Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is considered one of the factors that may produce signs and ''symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome'' (IBS). The medical data from studies done on SIBO are conflicting.''Some studies show an increase in gas production by intestinal bacteria as a cause of the pain and bloating associated with IBS. However, other studies done to determine if SIBO is the cause of IBS and if antibiotic treatment of SIBO is helpful in reducing or eliminating IBS symptoms have not been conclusive.' "
How is IBS diagnosed?,"'Irritable bowel syndrome is diagnosed by excluding other GI disorders that can cause similar symptoms. A complete history and physical is taken to determine the duration and frequency of symptoms. To be diagnosed with the condition, the duration of symptoms should be at least six months and should occur at least three times a month.''A doctor may order tests, including blood tests, ''stool'' tests, ''X-rays'', or ''CT scans''. There is no specific finding on these tests that can confirm the diagnosis of IBS, however, other problems can be ruled out by performing them.''Two relatively new blood tests may help diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. One test is for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), and the other is for irritable bowel syndrome with both diarrhea and constipation (irritable bowel syndrome mixed IBS-M). Neither test is able to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).''Both blood tests are for anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies. It is thought that these antibodies develop in some patients after an acute bout of gastroenteritis that is caused by several different, common types of bacteria. The overgrowth of these bacteria in the gut may trigger an immune attack on the patients’ own intestinal tissues (autoimmunity) with the ensuing inflammation and damage to the tissues causing the symptoms of IBS.''The tests may help distinguish between irritable bowel syndrome and ''inflammatory bowel disease'"" or IBD, a different type of intestinal inflammatory disease that includes Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''.''The antibody tests seems to be useful in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea IBS-D, but not IBS with constipation (IBS-C). The tests also appear to be specific, and if the antibodies are present, it is highly likely that IBS is present. However, the tests are insensitive, meaning if the antibodies are not present, the patient still may have IBS. Thus, these irritable bowel syndrome tests may be identifying only a subset of patients with IBS, those with post-infectious IBS. Both IBS blood tests have not undergone rigorous testing, and have not yet been approved by the FDA. It is expected to be an expensive test costing $500 to over $1,000.''A doctor also may send the patient to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the digestive system). Depending on the symptoms, an ''upper endoscopy'' and/or ''colonoscopy'' may be performed.'  "
What is the treatment for IBS?,"'Dietary modifications are the first treatments that should be tried to treat IBS. There are several types of foods in particular that often trigger characteristic symptoms and signs.''If dietary modifications and lifestyle changes do not adequately treat the symptoms and signs, a doctor may recommend medical therapies.'  "
What medications are used in the treat and manage IBS-D and IBS-D?,"   Antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide (Imodium), attapulgite (Kaopectate), and diphenoxylate and atropine (Lomotil) can be helpful if loose stools are one of the main signs. Eluxadoline (Viberzi) is a prescription for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). For females with IBS who experience severe diarrhea, alosetron (Lotronex) has been used. Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and IBS-related bloating. Bile acid binders including cholestyramine ( (Prevalite), colestipol (Colestid), or colesevelam (Welchol) can help some patients with IBS-D, but can also cause bloating. Over-the-counter laxatives such as polyethylene glycol 3350 ( (MiraLax), bisacodyl (Dulcolax), and psyllium seed husks (Metamucil) can help relieve constipation and keep bowel movements regular. Senna laxatives (Senokot, Ex-Lax Gentle Nature) may be taken short-term. Prescription laxatives such as lactulose (Constulose) may also be prescribed. Two drugs specifically used to treat IBS are lubiprostone (Amitiza), a laxative, and linaclotide (Linzess), a constipation medication. SSRI antidepressants fluoxetine (Prozac), citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), and escitalopram (Lexapro) may be helpful for those with constipation (IBS-C), but they can trigger IBS attacks in patients with diarrhea (IBS-D)."
What other drugs are used in the treatment of IBS symptoms and signs?," Antidepressants in low doses, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help relieve symptoms associated with IBS. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) and magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia). Antibiotics may be used when small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is suspected. Antianxiety medications such as diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and clonazepam (Klonopin) are occasionally prescribed short-term for people whose anxiety worsens their irritable bowel syndrome symptoms."
What medications treat IBS pain and cramping?," Antispasmodics, such as metoclopramide (Reglan), dicyclomine (Bentyl), and hyoscyamine (Levsin), decrease symptoms of pain and cramping. Antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil, Paregoric), doxepin ( (Silenor), desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Pamelor), and imipramine (Tofranil) may help with abdominal pain but due to side effects are usually reserved for severe cases."
What natural and home remedies or other lifestyle changes help IBS symptoms?,"'Some lifestyle changes that can also help relieve symptoms are:' Eat smaller, more frequent meals Quit smoking Exercise regularly Take probiotics Avoid caffeine Use stress management and relaxation techniques Mindfulness training Gut-directed hypnosis Biofeedback Pain-management techniques Cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy Regular exercise such as walking or yoga Get an adequate amount of sleep Try ginger or peppermint, which may help digestion Avoid laxatives unless prescribed by your health-care professional"
What are the complications of IBS?,"'In general, there are few complications associated with this functional disease other than the symptoms of the disease itself. If someone has ''hemorrhoids'', the diarrhea and constipation associated with IBS may irritate them. Moreover, a diet that is too strict limits nutrients that could cause problems related to lack of proper ''nutrition''.''The biggest complication of IBS may be on the quality of life. The ''stress'' and ''anxiety'' as well as the impact on daily activities the condition can cause may be troublesome for patients.''Irritable bowel syndrome does not lead to;' colon cancer, rectal bleeding, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis or UC."
Is there a cure for IBS?,"'There is no known cure for IBS, but there are many treatment options to reduce or eliminate symptoms. Good communication with a doctor is important to help manage this condition.' "
What is the prognosis for IBS? ,"""Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic disease with symptoms that tend to come and go. The overall prognosis for patients with IBS depends on the severity and frequency of symptoms, and the patient's ability to control these symptoms, whether by diet, lifestyle changes, or medications."" "
Can IBS be prevented?,"'It may not be possible to prevent developing IBS, but you can take steps to prevent symptoms for occurring or worsening. As discussed earlier, dietary and lifestyle changes can help you manage symptoms. To identify food triggers, your doctor may suggest that you keep a food diary and avoid foods that cause symptoms. Manage ''stress'' and ''anxiety'', and try cognitive therapy or psychotherapy if needed.' "
Which types of doctors treat IBS?,"""A primary-care provider or family-medicine specialist or a child's pediatrician may first diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. You will likely be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in disorders of the digestive system) for further treatment."" "
What is IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome (''IBS'') is a chronic relapsing gastrointestinal (mainly the ''large intestine'' or colon) disorder with signs and symptoms that may include:''IBS'' is a chronic condition that can be triggered by ''diet'', medications and/or by other conditions such as ''stress''.''Some health care professionals categorize and term ''IBS'' into one of four categories:''Not all health care professionals recognize these four categories.' Abdominal cramping or pain Bloating Mucus in the stool Gassiness Altered bowel habits (alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation) IBS-D (predominant symptoms is diarrhea) IBS-C (predominant symptoms is constipation) IBS-M (mixed diarrhea and constipation) IBS-U (unclassified)"
Are stress and anxiety triggers for IBS?,"'Stress'' and ''anxiety'' may be triggers for IBS and the development of recurrent symptoms. Chronic stress experienced early in life (less than age 18) may increase the chances of developing the condition. Moreover, people diagnosed with IBS can have stress or ''anxiety'' trigger symptoms, such as:'   Diarrhea Constipation Abdominal bloating Mucus defecation Feelings of incomplete bowel movements"
Are menstrual pain and IBS related?,"'Some studies show that many women with IBS have worse symptoms during their menstrual periods. Although the mechanism is not clear, some gastrointestinal cells have receptors for estrogen and ''progesterone'' so that changes in the hormone levels during the ''menstrual cycle'' may trigger increasing ''IBS symptoms''. Women are twice as likely to develop IBS as men.' "
What foods in the diet trigger constipation in IBS?,"'Any foods or fluids that tend to dehydrate a person are likely to trigger ''constipation'' in people with ''irritable bowel'' syndrome. Foods that may promote constipation should be avoided in an IBS ''diet'' and include:''Foods that help prevent constipation and should be included in an IBS ''diet'' include:'   Chocolate Dairy products such as milk and cheese (particularly those that contain lactose) Red meat Unripe bananas Items that contain caffeine if you are slightly dehydrated. Coffee, carbonated drinks and alcohol may lead to dehydration and constipation in IBS patients (and other people, too). Prunes Various types of beans Whole grain breads like rye bread Pears and fruits like kiwi Vegetables that will help boost fiber intake"
What foods in the diet trigger diarrhea in IBS?,"   Several foods may play a role in developing diarrhea in people with IBS. Major categories of foods that may trigger IBS are those that contain fats (fatty meats, fatty dairy products, for example). Each individual is slightly different and may respond differently to food types. Consequently, dietitians and health care professionals who treat people with IBS often suggest that they keep a journal or diary to track those foods that cause diarrhea. Some foods that trigger diarrhea do so because they are ingested in large quantities; for example, a bite of a banana may not cause diarrhea, but eating a whole banana may trigger diarrhea in some people with IBS. Other foods that contain high levels of fructose, artificial sweeteners, high FODMAP foods, and fried foods may also trigger diarrhea. Broccoli, onions, cabbage and large helpings of beans may produce gas and increase the discomfort of diarrhea. Probiotics may help reduce the symptoms of diarrhea and gas in some individuals."
What prescription or OTC drugs trigger IBS?,"'Some ''drugs'' can trigger ''IBS symptoms'' resulting in colonic spasms, constipation and/or diarrhea. Such drugs include antibiotics (especially those administered over a long period of time), ''tricyclic antidepressants'', for example, ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep''), ''nortriptyline'' (''Pamelor''), and ''doxepin'', and medicines containing ''sorbitol'' (for example, some ''cough'' syrup preparations and common ''pain'' medicines like ''Advil'' gel capsules). Consequently, patients with the condition should check the ingredients, both active and inactive, for the presence of sorbitol as sorbitol is often listed as an ""inactive"" ingredient.' "
What are the other IBS triggers?,"'Other triggers of IBS are variable and differ from person to person. However, some other common triggers include:''Keep a journal and record the symptoms and the activities you are doing when symptoms develop. This can help you determine your personal triggers for any symptoms. Researchers also suggest that changes in hormone levels and/or other acute illnesses such as infectious diarrhea may also trigger symptoms.'""Although a patient's primary care physician may care for IBS patients, specialists in gastroenterology, immunology, psychiatry and dietary professionals may be consulted to help patients manage the condition.""   Lack of exercise Eating foods too quickly Eating while under some other stress such as driving or working Eating foods that are very hot or cold Chewing gum"
How can I prevent IBS triggers?,"'There are many different ways to help prevent triggering IBS symptoms such as:' Eat a balanced diet with a moderate amount of fiber. Avoid extremes of food temperatures (very hot or cold foods). Do not eat while experiencing anxiety or under stressful conditions (for example, while working or driving). Avoid foods and drinks that may cause dehydration or diarrhea. Keep a journal to help identify those foods that do or do not trigger symptoms. Try biofeedback, exercise, meditation, or yoga to reduce anxiety. Discuss medications you are taking that may be triggering symptoms with your doctor. Avoid those foods and drinks that are likely to increase or trigger symptoms. Avoid foods that increase intestinal gas (some legumes and vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts). Talk to your doctor or health care professional about taking probiotics."
What foods trigger IBS?,"'Diet'' modification is crucial for managing ''IBS symptoms''. Different foods may trigger ''IBS'' in different people. Some common food triggers include:''Foods triggering ''diarrhea'' in people with ''IBS'':' Foods triggering constipation in people with IBS: Food products such as cereals and bread made with refined (not whole) grains Processed foods such as chips and cookies Carbonated drinks Caffeine Alcohol A high protein diet Dairy products, particularly cheese Fried and fatty foods A diet with too much fiber especially the insoluble fiber present in the skin of fruits and vegetables Chocolate Caffeine Alcohol Fructose (a type of sugar) Sorbitol (a type of sugar alcohol used as a sweetener) Carbonated drinks Large or heavy meals Dairy products  Foods containing gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye) such as most cereal, grains, pasta and many processed foods."
What causes IBS?,"'The exact triggers of ''inflammatory bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') are not known. Research suggests that the condition is caused by a combination of problems. Different people may get IBS due to different triggers.\xa0''IBS is a type of functional bowel or gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. This means that although it causes disturbing symptoms, it does not cause any structural damage to the bowel. Functional GI disorders are caused by problems with how the brain and\xa0gut\xa0work together (brain-gut interaction). Thus, a faulty brain-gut interaction in some people with IBS may cause the food to move too slowly or too quickly through the gut. This causes changes in bowel movements.\xa0''Certain factors are associated with IBS. These include:' Family history of IBS (genetic factors) Stressful or problematic early life events, such as emotional, sexual or physical abuse Some mental disorders including depression, anxiety and somatic symptom disorder (a condition in which  a person feels extreme, exaggerated anxiety about physical symptoms such as pains and aches)  Bacterial infections in the digestive tract Small bowel bacterial overgrowth, an increase in the number or a change in the type of bacteria in the small bowel  Certain food intolerances or sensitivities such as sensitivity to processed or junk foods, carbonated drinks, caffeine and alcohol."
What is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"'Irritable bowel syndrome'' or IBS is a medical condition affecting the large bowel. \xa0It is a group of symptoms occurring together, including repeated ''pain'' in the abdomen, cramping, ''bloating'' and changes in the bowel movements, which may be ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'' or both. The typical feature of IBS is that these symptoms occur without any visible signs of damage or disease in the gut. IBS can cause a huge amount of discomfort, however, it does not damage the ''intestines''.''It is a common condition affecting about twice as many women as men. IBS is most often reported in people younger than 45 years of age. The exact cause of IBS is not known. The condition does not have any specific test for it. Tests may be done to exclude other conditions such as Crohn’s disease, ''ulcerative colitis'' and certain ''cancers''. Most cases of IBS are effectively managed with diet, ''stress management'', ''probiotics'' and medicine.' "
What is a low FODMAP diet for IBS?,"'A ''low FODMAP diet'' is a special type of diet that may help manage IBS. In this diet certain foods that contain\xa0difficult to digest carbohydrates (''FODMAPs'') are avoided or reduced.\xa0''Some of the foods containing FODMAPs are:' Certain fruits and their juices including apples, mango, apricots, blackberries, cherries, nectarines, pears, plums and watermelon Vegetables such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, artichokes, asparagus, garlic and garlic salts, lentils, mushrooms, onions and sugar snap or snow peas Dairy products such as milk, soft cheeses, yogurt, custard, and ice cream Wheat and rye products Honey  Foods containing high-fructose corn syrup Food products including candy and gum, with sweeteners ending in “–ol,” (sugar alcohols) including sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and maltitol"
What is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, meaning it is a problem caused by changes in how the GI tract works. Children with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, but the GI tract does not become damaged. IBS is not a disease; it is a group of symptoms that occur together. The most common symptoms of IBS are ''abdominal pain'' or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'', or both. In the past, IBS was called ''colitis'', mucous colitis, ''spastic colon'"", nervous colon, and spastic bowel. The name was changed to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and is not a product of a person's imagination.""'IBS is diagnosed when a child who is growing as expected has ''abdominal pain'' or discomfort once per week for at least 2 months without other disease or injury that could explain the ''pain''. The ''pain'' or discomfort of IBS may occur with a change in ''stool'' frequency or consistency or may be relieved by a bowel movement.' "
What is the GI tract?,"'The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the ''digestion'' of food. Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, ''esophagus'', stomach, small intestine, ''large intestine'' - which includes the ''appendix'', cecum, colon, and - rectum - and anus. The ''intestines'' are sometimes called the bowel. The last part of the GI tract - called the ''lower GI'' tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.''The large intestine absorbs water and any remaining nutrients from partially digested food passed from the small intestine. The large intestine then changes waste from liquid to a solid matter called stool. Stool passes from the colon to the rectum. The rectum is located between the last part of the colon - called the sigmoid colon - and the anus. The rectum stores stool prior to a bowel movement. During a bowel movement, stool moves from the rectum to the anus, the opening through which stool leaves the body.' "
How common is IBS in children?,"'Limited information is available about the number of children with IBS. Older studies have reported prevalence rates for recurrent ''abdominal pain in children'' of 10 to 20 percent.¹ However, these studies did not differentiate IBS from functional abdominal pain, ''indigestion'', and abdominal ''migraine''. One study of children in North America found that 14 percent of high school students and 6 percent of middle school students have IBS. The study also found that IBS affects boys and girls equally.²' "
What are the symptoms of IBS in children?,"'The symptoms of IBS include abdominal pain or discomfort and changes in bowel habits. To meet the definition of IBS, the pain or discomfort should be associated with two of the following three symptoms:''Other symptoms of IBS may include:''Symptoms may often occur after eating a meal. To meet the definition of IBS, symptoms must occur at least once per week for at least 2 months.'   
	Start with bowel movements that occur more or less often than usual 
	Start with stool that appears looser and more watery or harder and more lumpy than usual 
	Improve with a bowel movement 
Diarrhea - having loose, watery stools three or more times a day and feeling urgency to have a bowel movement 
Constipation - having hard, dry stools; two or fewer bowel movements in a week; or straining to have a bowel movement 
	Feeling that a bowel movement is incomplete Passing mucus, a clear liquid made by the intestines that coats and protects tissues in the GI tract 
	Abdominal bloating"
What causes IBS in children?,"'The causes of IBS are not well understood. Researchers believe a combination of physical and mental health problems can lead to IBS. The possible causes of IBS in children include the following:'  Brain-gut signal problems. Signals between the brain and nerves of the small and large intestines, also called the gut, control how the intestines work. Problems with brain-gut signals may cause IBS symptoms, such as changes in bowel habits and pain or discomfort. GI motor problems. Normal motility, or movement, may not be present in the colon of a child who has IBS. Slow motility can lead to constipation and fast motility can lead to diarrhea. Spasms, or sudden strong muscle contractions that come and go, can cause abdominal pain. Some children with IBS also experience hyperreactivity, which is an excessive increase in contractions of the bowel in response to stress or eating. Hypersensitivity. Children with IBS have greater sensitivity to abdominal pain than children without IBS. Affected children have been found to have different rectal tone and rectal motor response after eating a meal. Mental health problems. IBS has been linked to mental health, or psychological, problems such as anxiety and depression in children. Bacterial gastroenteritis. Some children who have bacterial gastroenteritis - an infection or irritation of the stomach and intestines caused by bacteria - develop IBS. Research has shown a connection between gastroenteritis and IBS in adults but not in children. But researchers believe postinfectious IBS does occur in children. Researchers do not know why gastroenteritis leads to IBS in some people and not others. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine. SIBO is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. Some researchers believe that SIBO may lead to IBS, and some studies have shown antibiotics to be effective in treating IBS. However, the studies were weak and more research is needed to show a link between SIBO and IBS. Genetics. Whether IBS has a genetic cause, meaning it runs in families, is unclear. Studies have shown that IBS is more common in people with family members who have a history of GI problems. However, the cause could be environmental or the result of heightened awareness of GI symptoms."
How is IBS in children diagnosed?,"""To diagnose IBS, a health care provider will conduct a physical exam and take a complete medical history. The medical history will include questions about the child's symptoms, family members with GI disorders, recent infections, medications, and stressful events related to the onset of symptoms. IBS is diagnosed when the physical exam does not show any cause for the child's symptoms and the child meets all of the following criteria:""'Further testing is not usually needed, though the health care provider may do a blood test to screen for other problems. Additional diagnostic tests may be needed based on the results of the screening blood test and for children who also have signs such as:''Further diagnostic tests may also be needed for children with a family history of:''Additional diagnostic tests may include a stool test, ultrasound, and flexible ''sigmoidoscopy'' or colonoscopy.''Stool tests.'"" A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the child's caretaker a container for catching and storing the child's stool. The sample is returned to the health care provider or a commercial facility and sent to a lab for analysis. The health care provider may also do a rectal exam, sometimes during the physical exam, to check for ""'blood in the stool''. Stool tests can show the presence of parasites or blood.''Ultrasound.'"" Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider's office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist - a doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show problems in the GI tract causing pain or other symptoms.""'Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. ''The tests are similar, but a colonoscopy is used to view the rectum and entire colon, while a flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the rectum and lower colon. These tests are performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a ''gastroenterologist'' - a doctor who specializes in ''digestive diseases''. For both tests, a health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. The child may be asked to follow a clear ''liquid diet'' for 1 to 3 days before either test. The night before the test, the child may need to take a ''laxative''. One or more enemas may also be required the night before and about 2 hours before the test.''In most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps the child relax. For either test, the child will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The test can show signs of problems in the lower GI tract.''The gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of intestinal lining for examination with a microscope. The child will not feel the biopsy. A pathologist - a doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases - examines the tissue in a lab.''Cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after the test. Full recovery is expected by the next day.'

Peptic ulcer disease - a sore in the lining of the esophagus or stomach"
How is IBS in children treated?,"'Though there is no cure for IBS, the symptoms can be treated with a combination of the following:'  
	Changes in eating, diet, and nutrition 
	Medications 
Probiotics Therapies for mental health problems"
"Eating, diet, and nutrition","'Large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often, or eating smaller portions, may help IBS symptoms. Eating meals that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables may help.''Certain foods and ''drinks'' may cause IBS symptoms in some children, such as:''Children with IBS may want to limit or avoid these foods. Keeping a food diary is a good way to track which foods cause symptoms so they can be excluded from or reduced in the diet.''Dietary ''fiber'' may lessen constipation in children with IBS, but it may not help with lowering pain. Fiber helps keep stool soft so it moves smoothly through the colon. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends children consume ""age plus 5"" grams of fiber daily. A 7-year-old child, for example, should get ""7 plus 5,"" or 12 grams, of fiber a day.³ Fiber may cause gas and trigger symptoms in some children with IBS. Increasing fiber intake by 2 to 3 grams per day may help reduce the risk of increased gas and bloating.'  
	Foods high in fat Milk products Drinks with caffeine 
	Drinks with large amounts of artificial sweeteners, which are substances used in place of sugar 
	Foods that may cause gas, such as beans and cabbage"
Medications,"""The health care provider will select medications based on the child's symptoms. Caregivers should not give children any medications unless told to do so by a health care provider."" Fiber supplements. Fiber supplements may be recommended to relieve constipation when increasing dietary fiber is ineffective. Laxatives. Constipation can be treated with laxative medications. Laxatives work in different ways, and a health care provider can provide information about which type is best. Caregivers should not give children laxatives unless told to do so by a health care provider. Antidiarrheals. Loperamide has been found to reduce diarrhea in children with IBS, though it does not reduce pain, bloating, or other symptoms. Loperamide reduces stool frequency and improves stool consistency by slowing the movement of stool through the colon. Medications to treat diarrhea in adults can be dangerous for infants and children and should only be given if told to do so by a health care provider. Antispasmodics. Antispasmodics, such as hyoscine, cimetropium, and pinaverium, help to control colon muscle spasms and reduce abdominal pain. Antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in low doses can help relieve IBS symptoms including abdominal pain. These medications are thought to reduce the perception of pain, improve mood and sleep patterns, and adjust the activity of the GI tract."
Probiotics,"'Probiotics are live microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the GI tract. Studies have found that probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain ''probiotic'' combinations, improve symptoms of IBS when taken in large enough amounts. But more research is needed. Probiotics can be found in ''dietary supplements'', such as capsules, tablets, and powders, and in some foods, such as yogurt. A health care provider can give information about the right kind and right amount of probiotics to take to improve IBS symptoms.' "
Therapies for Mental Health Problems,"'The following therapies can help improve IBS symptoms due to mental health problems:'  Talk therapy. Talking with a therapist may reduce stress and improve IBS symptoms. Two types of talk therapy used to treat IBS are cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic, or interpersonal, therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the child's thoughts and actions. Psychodynamic therapy focuses on how emotions affect IBS symptoms. This type of therapy often involves relaxation and stress management techniques. Hypnotherapy. In hypnotherapy, the therapist uses hypnosis to help the child relax into a trancelike state. This type of therapy may help the child relax the muscles in the colon."
Is a colon resection a major surgery?,'Colon resection'' (colectomy) is the surgical removal of part or the entire colon. Colectomy is a major surgery and may take up to four hours for completion. Colectomy is performed under general anesthesia and may require hospitalization for up to a week or more.' 
How is a colon resection done?,"'A ''colorectal'' surgeon performs the colon resection in an operation room in the hospital. The surgery may be performed as''The advantages of laparoscopic resection over an open resection include:''Laparoscopy'', however, may not be suitable for all patients, and the surgeon will make an informed decision based on individual needs.''Prior to a colon resection the patient needs to' Open resection Laparoscopic resection Robot-assisted laparoscopic resection Shorter hospital stays Less invasive procedure with smaller incisions and scars Decreased formation of adhesions Reduced bleeding Quicker healing and less need for painkillers Faster recovery and return to normal daily activities Undergo blood and imaging tests, and colonoscopy if necessary. Go through bowel preparation by taking laxatives to make sure the colon is clear of stool. Go on a clear liquid diet for a day prior to the surgery. Avoid eating or drinking anything for 8 hours prior to the surgery. Inform the doctor of any allergies. Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Stop taking blood thinners days prior, according to the surgeon’s advice. Start an antibiotic course to prevent infection. Have an enema to clear the colon of any residual fecal content. The doctor attaches an IV line for administering medications. An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the surgery. The anesthesiologist also intubates the patient to ensure adequate oxygen supply. The surgeon makes one large or many tiny incisions in the abdominal wall, depending on the type of surgery. The surgeon cuts and removes the diseased part or the entire colon as required. The surgeon may also remove the surrounding lymph nodes in certain cancers. The surgeon connects the ends of the remaining healthy colon with staples or sutures in a procedure known as anastomosis. In a total colectomy the surgeon connects the ileum, the terminal part of the small intestine, to the rectum. In some resections the surgeon may also create an opening in the stomach wall (stoma). Through the stoma, the surgeon connects the resected end of the healthy colon (colostomy) or the small intestine (ileostomy), to a bag to collect the feces. The surgeon may place a drain before closing the incision with sutures. The surgeon may also place a urinary catheter which normally remains in place for a day or two. The doctor withdraws the anesthesia and administers painkillers for post-operative pain management. The patient is monitored for several hours in the recovery room until the vital functions stabilize. Some patients with temporary colostomy or ileostomy undergo a revision surgery after 12 weeks. For some it may be permanent."
How long does it take to recover from a colon resection?,"'Most people recover fully from a colon resection and return to normal activities in about six weeks; however, recovery time will depend on the severity of the underlying disease.''Patients with chronic conditions such as ''cancer'', Crohn’s disease or ''ulcerative colitis'' may need ongoing treatment.' "
Is colon resection surgery painful?,"'Colon resection surgery is performed under general anesthesia and the patient will feel no ''pain'' during the procedure. During recovery, abdominal and incision ''pain'' are likely, which can be managed with pain medication.' "
What are the side effects of a colon resection?,'The side effects of colon resection may include:' Anesthetic side effects such asHeadacheNauseaConfusion Headache Nausea Confusion Abdominal pain from the surgeryFatigueConstipation and/or diarrhea Fatigue Constipation and/or diarrhea Inconvenience of the attached ostomy bag
What are the risks and complications of a colon resection?,"'Colon resection is a relatively safe surgery for most people. The risks may be higher in certain patients, depending on their underlying conditions. The risks and complications include:' Hemorrhage or uncontrolled bleeding Blood clots Wound infection Pneumonia Reaction to medication Paralyzed intestine (paralytic ileus) Damage to nearby organs, blood vessels or nerves Bowel obstruction from scar tissue formed after resection Leakage from the connection of the resected colon ends (anastomotic leak) Inflammation of the stomach lining (peritonitis) Bladder control problems Sexual problems Problems with colostomy Hernia at the surgical incision Sepsis and death"
What is a cough?,"'A ''cough'' is defined as the act of forcing air through your throat, often followed by a short loud noise. ''Coughing'' can be a reflexive action to keep respiratory passages free of irritating substances (such as dust, mucous, ''phlegm'', nasal drainage, and foreign bodies). Consequently, a ''cough'' reflex can be a protective mechanism for the individual. There are many types of ''coughs'' including:'  Dry cough: a cough that doesn't produce mucus (also termed a non-productive cough) Wet cough: a cough that produces mucus or sputum (also termed a productive cough) Barking cough: a cough associated with viral illnesses and/or croup especially in young children usually (croup cough) Whooping cough: a cough associated with infection (pertussis); individuals (usually children) produce a whooping sound when they cough Stress cough: a reflexive, nonproductive cough that occurs when an individual is under stress Acute cough: a cough that has just begun or has been intermittent, often resulting within a week or so. Chronic cough: a cough that is persistent over time (more than 1 to 8 or more weeks); the timeframe is controversial as health-care professionals and researchers list a variety of time frames to define a chronic cough"
Is a cough contagious?,"'A cough itself is not ''contagious''. Of note, a cough can be a sign of something irritating, impeding, or blocking an ''airway''. But a cough also can be a method of spreading a viral or bacterial infectious disease if the disease is transmitted by airborne droplets. Consequently, people are understandably concerned that ''coughing'' is ""''contagious''"". However, what is actually contagious is the infecting pathogen, not the cough itself. The transmitted infecting agent may produce the same symptoms, including a cough, in another individual.''Coughing can induce a gagging reflex that, in turn, can produce ''vomiting''. This situation of coughing with ''vomiting'' occasionally occurs. ''Vomiting'' can be reflexive and is a means to remove irritating material from the body, specifically the contents of the stomach.'  "
How will I know what type of cough I have?,"'Knowing the type of cough can provide some insight into the underlying cause of the cough.''The underlying cause of chronic coughs should be investigated by a doctor.'   In general, dry coughs and stress coughs are often caused by noninfectious irritants. Some chronic coughs are due to long-term mucus production and/or irritating agents like cigarette smoke. Other coughs are caused by allergies bothering underlying lung disease. Some, but not all, productive coughs are caused by infectious agents as are whooping cough and croup. Coughing up blood or blood mixed with sputum is best evaluated by a health-care professional to determine the underlying cause(s). This combination is usually considered a medical emergency."
When is a cough no longer contagious?,"'The answer to this question is tricky. Coughs are not contagious, but certain underlying diseases that produce a cough are contagious, and can be spread by droplets formed during coughing. Correspondingly, when the underlying disease process is no longer contagious, the cough no longer produces infectious droplets.''The key is that coughs are signs or symptoms of underlying problems, and the cough itself is not contagious.' "
How are coughs spread?,"'Coughs associated with non-infectious causes (such as dust, chemical irritants and ''smoking''), and are not spread from person-to-person.''Coughs due to infectious diseases may ''seem'' like they are contagious and spread to others by person-to-person contact. However, the cough itself may or may not occur in another person with the same infection. If the infection causes cough and other symptoms in another person then, it will ''seem'' as though the cough was ""spread,"" but the actual spread of symptoms including cough would be due to the spread of the underlying infection, not the cough itself. So, microbes can be transmitted from one person to another by coughing to produce droplets that carry pass them on.' "
When should I seek medical care for cough?,"'In many instances, short-term cough (less than seven days duration) usually requires no medical care. However, the following list of problems associated with a cough should be investigated by a health-care professional:''Emergency care should be sought if the coughing includes any one or more of the following:''Coughs can be irritating no matter what type of cough they are. Consequently, people want them to either stop or be markedly reduced. There are many ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) ''drugs'' and home remedies that can suppress or stop cough, and usually are relatively safe to use to treat acute coughs.''However, individuals that are ''pregnant'' and other individuals that have ''high blood pressure'' should consult their health-care professional before using coughs treatments. Some treatments may not be advisable or safe.''Individuals that try OTC ''drugs'' and home remedies that provide no cough relief should contact their health-care professional to determine if there is an underlying cause that needs treatment before trying to diminish the symptoms of coughing.'  a cough lasting at least a week without improving chills and/or nighttime coughing fits a fever and a cough that lasts at least three or more days a deep cough that produces a lot of mucus and/or bloody mucus significant wheezing shortness of breath chest tightness coughing up and/or vomiting blood (possible signs of internal bleeding due to bleeding ulcers or other significant causes)"
What is flexible sigmoidoscopy?,'Flexible sigmoidoscopy'' is a diagnostic procedure to examine the walls of the rectum and the lowermost part of the colon (sigmoid). ''Sigmoidoscopy'' is performed with a 60 cm-long flexible tube (sigmoidoscope) with a light and a miniature camera that transmits images of the rectum and sigmoid colon.' 
Alternatives to sigmoidoscopy in evaluating the status of the colon and rectum, Colonoscopy Fecal occult blood testing (for colorectal cancer screening) Barium enema for finding large polyps and cancer lesions Colonography performed with CT imaging
What is the difference between a sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy?,"'Both colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are screening tests performed with a flexible, lighted tube with a camera. A colonoscopy is examination of the entire colon, while a sigmoidoscopy scopes only the sigmoid colon and rectum.' "
What is the purpose of a flexible sigmoidoscopy?,'A flexible sigmoidoscopy is performed to assess the health of the lower colon and rectum. A sigmoidoscopy may be performed\xa0''Flexible sigmoidoscopy may not be performed in the following situations:' To find the cause forRectal bleedingChanges in bowel habitsAbdominal painDiarrheaUnexplained weight loss Rectal bleeding Changes in bowel habits Abdominal pain Diarrhea Unexplained weight loss To screen for colorectal cancer As preoperative evaluation before anorectal surgery To monitor previously diagnosed malignancy in the sigmoid To treat inflammation (proctitis) from radiation To remove tissue for biopsy To remove foreign body from the rectum To dilate or place stent for strictures To stop or prevent bleeding Bowel perforation Acute diverticulitis -- inflammation of pouches that may form in the colon Active peritonitis -- inflammation of the membrane covering the abdomen Severe colitis -- inflammation of the colon Cardiac or pulmonary diseases
What can the flexible sigmoidoscopy detect?,'Flexible sigmoidoscopy can detect abnormalities in the rectum and sigmoid colon such as' Ulcers Polyps Abnormal cells Tumors and cancer
Do you need sedation for a flexible sigmoidoscopy?,'Sedation is not usually required for flexible sigmoidoscopy. It is a minimally invasive procedure that typically takes about 10 to 20 minutes. Some patients might require a calming medication.' 
How is a flexible sigmoidoscopy performed?,"'A ''gastroenterologist'' usually performs flexible sigmoidoscopy as an outpatient procedure.''A sigmoidoscopy does not usually need as much colon preparation as a colonoscopy. The patient must, however, ensure that the colon and rectum are completely clear of any gastric content so that there is no obstruction in viewing the rectum and sigmoid. The patient may need to' Go on a clear liquid diet for one to three days as instructed by the doctor. Avoid red and purple foods like beets, which might look like bleeding. Take a laxative in case of constipation. Avoid eating or drinking anything but water from the night before the procedure. Check with the doctor before taking any medications. Inform the doctor of pre-existing conditions, diseases or allergies. Have an enema before the procedure. The patient lies on their side with knees drawn to their chest. The doctor inserts the lubricated sigmoidoscope through the anus and guides it slowly through the rectum and sigmoid colon while checking the images in the monitor for abnormalities. The doctor may inflate the colon with air to get a better view. The doctor will remove polyps if found, extract tissue for a biopsy, and stop any bleeding. The doctor then gently withdraws the tube. The patient should be able to leave soon after the procedure. The results of the sigmoidoscopy helps the doctor decide on future course of treatment."
Is a flexible sigmoidoscopy painful?,"'A flexible sigmoidoscopy is generally not painful, though may be mildly uncomfortable. There might be a slight pinch if the doctor removes tissue for biopsy. Most people will be able to resume normal ''diet'' and activities immediately after the procedure.' "
What are the risks and complications of a flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'A flexible sigmoidoscopy is a relatively safe procedure with rarely any complications. The side effects, which usually resolve in a short while, may include''Possible complications include' Gas and bloating Abdominal cramps Light bleeding Perforation of the colon Persistent rectal bleeding Infection and fever Abdominal or anal/rectal pain"
What is a colostomy?,"'A ''colostomy'' is a surgical procedure to create a ''stoma'' in the large bowel (colon) through the abdomen.\xa0''Surgical stomas'' are openings made in a hollow organ (e.g. bowel) to connect it to the outside and are named according to their anatomic location, for example, colostomy, ''ileostomy'', or urostomy. It is usually done after an injury or surgery to create a passage for the waste produced in the bowel to be removed from the stoma (opening) on the abdomen.''A colostomy may be temporary or permanent ''depending upon the reason for which it is performed; for example, some infections or injuries may require giving the bowel a temporary rest, then reattaching it. A permanent colostomy may be required for a long-term or irreversible problem, such as ''cancer'' that requires the removal of the rectum or failure of the muscles that control bowel emptying or ''stool'' elimination.''A colostomy can be constructed as a'' ''loop colostomy or as an end colostomy.' A loop colostomy is a stoma in which the entire loop of the colon is turned outward such that both the limbs of the loop have a common opening and are not completely separated from each other. An end colostomy, however, is created by bringing one end of the colon out through the abdominal wall, where it may be turned under, such as a cuff. The edges of the colon are then stitched to the skin on the abdomen to form an opening (stoma)."
Is a loop colostomy permanent?,"'Loop colostomies are usually temporary and generally preferred over end colostomies if the intention is to reverse it at a later date. The closure of a loop colostomy is associated with a shorter average hospital stay, less intraoperative blood loss, and a lower complication rate.\xa0' "
What are the reasons for a colostomy?,"'The indications for a colostomy are:' Inflammatory bowel disease  Imperforate anus (a blocked or missing anal opening) Serious bowel infections Injury to the colon or rectum Bowel obstruction Rectal or colon cancer Wounds or fistulas in the perineum (a woman’s perineum is the area between her anus and vulva; a man’s perineum lies between his anus and scrotum). Fistulas are abnormal connections between internal parts of the body, or between an internal organ and the skin. "
What is the difference between an end colostomy and a loop colostomy?,"'The differences between an end colostomy and a loop colostomy are as follows:' A loop colostomy is done by taking out a loop of the colon through the abdominal wall such that both the limbs of the loop have a common stoma opening, whereas an end colostomy is done by taking out the proximal end (upper part, closer to the small bowel) of the colon on the abdomen and closing the other end or taking it out through a separate opening. Two openings can be observed in case of a loop colostomy, whereas only one opening is observed in case of an end colostomy. A loop colostomy rests on the abdomen with the help of a support rod, whereas an end colostomy is held on the abdomen by stitching it to the abdominal wall. A loop colostomy is easier and safer to reverse compared with an end colostomy. A loop colostomy is generally a temporary colostomy for reasons such as infections or injuries, which may require giving the bowel a temporary rest. End colostomies are generally permanent colostomies required for long-term or irreversible problems, such as cancer that requires the removal of the rectum or failure of the muscles that control bowel emptying or stool elimination."
When is a lumpectomy not done?,"'A lumpectomy may be contraindicated in the following cases:' Multiple tumors in the breast that cannot be removed with a lumpectomy, which could affect the appearance of your breast Radiation therapy to the breast before surgery Cancer that has spread throughout the breast or opposite breast and involving the overlying skin Having a large tumor with small breasts, which may cause a poor cosmetic result If there is no access to radiation therapy because radiation therapy may be required for cancerous growths after a lumpectomy  History of scleroderma (a condition that causes hardening of the skin and other tissues), making healing difficult after surgery History of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune, chronic inflammatory disease"
How is a lumpectomy performed?,"'During the procedure:''A lumpectomy is usually performed under general anesthesia, so there will be no ''pain'' or discomfort during the procedure. The surgeon makes a cut over the tumor or area of abnormal tissue. The tumor is completely removed along with a margin of the surrounding healthy tissue and then sent to the lab for analysis by the pathologist.''The surgeon then closes the incisions with ''stitches'' (''sutures'') that may be absorbable and dissolve on their own or removed later by the surgeon.''After the procedure:' Painkillers and antibiotics would be administered The dressing may be removed after 48 hours Patients may be discharged the same day or 24 hours after the surgery Postoperative pain, swelling, and bruising is normal and usually resolves in a week Patients can resume daily activities after 24-72 hours of surgery Complete recovery may take around two to four weeks"
What are the complications of a lumpectomy?,"'Some possible complications include:' Bleeding Hematoma (blood clot formation) Infection Pain Swelling  Bruising  Reaction to anesthesia  Decreased sensation or numbness around the surgical site, which is usually transient  Formation of unsightly hard scar tissue or a keloid at the surgical site Change in the shape, symmetry, and appearance of the breast Recurrence of a tumor if tumor cells are left behind "
What is a mastectomy?,"'Mastectomy is a surgical procedure that involves either partial or total removal of breast tissue to treat or prevent ''breast cancer'' and reduce the chances of developing ''breast cancer''. ''Breast reconstruction'' may be done along with this surgery.''There are different types of mastectomy techniques and they are:' Total mastectomy: In this surgery, the entire breast is removed, but not the lymph nodes under the arm or the muscle tissue beneath the breast. Sometimes both breasts are removed, especially when mastectomy is done to try to prevent cancer. Partial mastectomy: Where your doctor removes only the part of the breast that has turned cancerous along with some surrounding tissue. Tissue- and nipple-sparing mastectomy: For women who are planning on having reconstruction right away, a skin/tissue-sparing mastectomy can be done. With this procedure, most of the skin over the breast (other than the nipple and areola) is left intact. This can work as good as a simple mastectomy. The amount of breast tissue removed is the same as with a simple mastectomy. Women usually prefer it because there is less scar tissue, and the reconstructed breast seems more natural. Nipple-sparing mastectomy: This is like a skin-sparing mastectomy, but the nipple and areola are left behind. This procedure is more often an option for women who have a small, early-stage cancer near the outer part of the breast, with no signs of cancer in the skin or near the nipple. Radical mastectomy: In this procedure, the surgeon removes the entire breast, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, and the muscles of the chest wall under the breast. This procedure is usually done if cancer is growing into the muscles under the breast. Modified radical mastectomy: In this surgery, the entire breast is removed along with lymph nodes under the arm or axillary lymph node dissection."
When is mastectomy recommended?,"'Doctors may recommend a mastectomy if a patient has:' People suffering from breast cancer that cannot be treated with other options Two or more tumors located in different areas of the breast The tumor is big, relative to the size of your breast Multiple calcium deposits that have tested positive for cancer A gene mutation that puts the patient at high risk A connective tissue disorder that limits the body’s tolerance for radiation Lumpectomy's failure in removing tissue entirely"
What are the common side effects of mastectomy?,"'Patients who have had a mastectomy may stay in the hospital for a few days depending on the type of surgery. Patients who have immediate reconstruction following their mastectomy may stay a little longer. Following a mastectomy, many women go home with drains in their chests. The surgeon may remove the drains during a follow-up office visit. Other side effects may include:' Fatigue Numbness and tingling Stiffness in the shoulder A buildup of fluid around the scar (seroma) Changes in sensation in the breast, nipple, or arm Fluid buildup and arm swelling after lymph node removal (lymphoedema) Infection Bleeding Pain and stiffness of the shoulder Swelling Pain Skin loss at the site of the surgery Buildup of blood Hard scar at the site of the surgery"
What is the outlook of the patients after mastectomy?,"'Most people who have a mastectomy recover well. The patient may probably feel sore for a few days and maybe on painkillers or antibiotics for a few days. Wounds may take around 2 to 3 weeks to heal, but it may take several months to fully recover chest and arm areas. As per research, the success rate of mastectomy is under 85%; however, cancer recurrence cannot be ruled out. It is most effective in treating early-stage breast cancer. Overall recurrence rates are decreasing and survival rates are holding strong.' "
Will a mouthguard protect the teeth from grinding?,"'Mouthguards are helpful for people who grind their teeth in ''sleep''. Adults and children who grind teeth in ''sleep'' can wear a mouthguard before going to bed. Mouthguards lower the pressure across the jaw and create a physical barrier between the teeth on the upper and lower jaw. Apart from protecting the teeth from damage during grinding, mouthguards also reduce the grinding noises made during sleep.' "
What are mouthguards used for?,"'Mouthguards can be worn by people, both adults and children, who are at risk of ''dental injuries''. They must be worn by people who play contact sports such as boxing, football, hockey, soccer, and basketball. Wearing a mouthguard will also prevent dental injuries in people who participate in non-contact activities such as gymnastics, mountain biking, and skating.''Mouthguards are also helpful for people who grind their teeth in sleep. Adults and children who grind teeth in sleep can wear a mouthguard before going to bed. They lower the impact of grinding by distributing the pressure across the jaw. They create a physical barrier between the teeth on the upper and lower jaw. Apart from protecting the teeth from damage during grinding, mouthguards also reduce the grinding noises made during sleep.' "
What are the different types of mouthguards?,"'There are various types of mouthguards available in the market. They are generally made from rubber or ''plastic''. A mouthguard can be bought from a pharmacist; however, you must get it custom-made from your dentist for a proper fit inside your mouth.\xa0''The different types of mouthguards are as follows:' Custom-made mouthguards: These types of mouthguards are customized by the dentist for individual patients. They may cost more than a non-customized mouthguard available in the market. They, however, provide the best fit and comfort because they are individually created.  Stock mouthguards: These types of mouth protectors cost less than the custom-made ones. They come in pre-formed and ready-to-wear packages. They are, however, quite bulky and may make talking and breathing difficult. They also do not fit well and provide little protection. Boil and bite mouthguards: They cost less than a customized mouthguard. They can be purchased from several chemist shops and sporting goods stores. Boil and bite mouthguards may provide a better fit than stock mouthguards. As the name suggests, they need to be first boiled in water to make them soft. Thereafter, they are inserted in the mouth and allowed to adapt to the shape of the mouth. Before using them, you must read the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. You must prefer buying the mouth protectors that have been approved by the American Dental Association (ADA)."
What is the outlook of patients after myomectomy surgery?,"'Myomectomy spares the uterus and all reproductive organs, which is one of the best advantages of the procedure. Myomectomy is the preferred treatment for fibroids for women who are looking to become ''pregnant'' because it leaves the uterus mostly intact.\xa0It usually takes 3 months for the uterus to heal completely. Once healed, there may be no effects on sexual activity, and patients are able to conceive. Depending on the depth of the scar in the uterus, the patient may require an elective cesarean delivery at 38 weeks to safely give birth. If myomectomy is preferred as a remedy to excessive menstrual bleeding, it is important to know that the operation is unsuccessful in around 20% of cases. However, myomectomy is usually very effective for treating fibroids and relieving the symptoms associated with them, but fibroids may grow back. This is less common in women with fewer fibroids than women who had multiple.' "
Are PEG tubes and J tubes the same?,"'A ''percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy'' (''PEG'') tube is a\xa0soft, ''plastic'' tube placed in the stomach through the skin (percutaneously) with the help of an endoscope.\xa0The J tube (jejunostomy tube), on the other hand, is a soft, plastic tube placed through the skin of the abdomen into the mid-section of the small intestine (the jejunum). The endoscopic approach to place a J tube is similar to the one used for the PEG tube. The difference is that the doctor uses a longer endoscope to enter into the small bowel for J tube placement.\xa0' "
How should I care for my percutaneous gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube at home?,"'You must learn to take good care of the skin around the tube to avoid getting an infection or skin irritation. Your doctor/nurse will teach you how to change the dressing around the tube every day.''You must inform your doctor if:' Keep the tube protected by taping it to the skin. Keep the skin clean and dry; you will need to change the bandages once a day or more if the area becomes wet or dirty. To keep the skin clean: Wash your hands well with soap and water. Remove dressings or bandages on the skin. Throw away the bandages/dressings in a plastic bag. Look for any redness, odor, pain, pus, or swelling on the skin. Make sure the stitches are in place. Clean the skin around the tube one to three times a day using a clean towel and mild soap and water. Gently try to remove any discharge or crusting on the skin and tube.  Pat dry the skin well with a clean towel. Place a small piece of gauze under the disc around the tube if there is discharge. Do not rotate the tube. Place the new bandages or gauze around the tube and tape it securely to the abdomen.  Never use creams, powders, or sprays near the site unless your nurse or doctor advises you to do so. Flush the tube with a syringe and warm water as instructed by your nurse/doctor. The syringe may be reused after rinsing and drying.  The tube gets pulled out. The stitches come off. There is redness, swelling, odor, or pus at the tube site. There is bleeding around the tube. There is leaking around the tube. There is excessive scarring or skin growth around the tube. You have vomiting episodes. Your stomach is bloated."
What things can affect your resting heart rate?,"'A resting heart rate depends upon various factors such as your age, habits (''diet'' and ''addiction''), and the type of physical work you do. Older people generally have a lower resting heart rate (generally below 70 beats per minute [bpm]).''Factors that affect your heart rate temporarily (increase or decrease your heart rate by a few to several beats) are as follows:''Variations during the day (due to hormonal fluctuations)''Health issues that affect your resting heart rate:' Cold weather (heart rate increases) Body position (heart rate becomes low after you lie down) Body size (obese people have higher heart rates) Caffeinated drinks such as coffee (increase your heart rate for a few hours) Smoking (heart rate increases) Emotions such as anxiety and fear (heart rate becomes high)  Certain medications such as for Hypertension (medications such as beta-blockers reduce your heart rate)Cough and cold (medicines containing phenyl ephedrine increase your heart rate) Hypertension (medications such as beta-blockers reduce your heart rate) Cough and cold (medicines containing phenyl ephedrine increase your heart rate) Exercise (heart rate can stay increased till one hour after the activity) Problems with your thyroidHypothyroidism (decreased heart rate)Hyperthyroidism (increased heart rate) Hypothyroidism (decreased heart rate) Hyperthyroidism (increased heart rate) Arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm)"
Which is the best way to measure your resting heart rate?,"'You can measure your heart rate manually, and the procedure is very simple. The most convenient place to measure it is on your wrist. First, you have to locate the pulse or beat by pressing the side of your wrist below the thumb. Press gently on that place for exactly 30 seconds and double the beats. This gives you your heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). If you feel your beat is a bit irregular, count it till 60 seconds.''The best time to measure your resting heart rate is as soon as you get up in the morning, preferably after a good night’s ''sleep''.' "
How to achieve a heart-healthy lower heart rate?,"'Exercising is the best way to get a heart-healthy lower heart rate. Increased ''cholesterol levels'' can also increase your heart rate, and ''exercise'' can also help lower them. The American Heart Association recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise spread throughout the week.\xa0''There is another value known as the target heart rate that gives you an idea about how intensely you should exercise. It is recommended to exercise in your target heart rate zone, which is typically a range, expressed as a percentage of your maximum heart rate. Here is how you can calculate your maximum heart rate.''Subtract your age from the number 220, and you get your maximum heart rate. For example, if your age is 40 years, your maximum heart rate is 220 minus 40, which equals 180 beats per minute (bpm). The American Heart Association recommends exercising till you get your heart rate to 50% of your maximum heart rate. You can gradually build up till you exercise at 85% of your maximum heart rate. Therefore, at 40 years, if you want to get maximum benefits from your exercise, you should aim to exercise at 50-85% of your maximum heart rate of 180 bpm and that equals to 90-153 bpm. You can consult a ''fitness'' expert to know what types of exercises are most appropriate for you.''With gadgets such as ''fitness'' trackers or bands, it has become much easier to know the heart rate during the workouts than halting in between to calculate the heart rate manually.'

Chronic sinusitis lasts about 8 weeks or longer. Usually, sinus infections are caused by viruses or bacterium that inhabit a person’s body. Acute sinusitis goes away after about 3 weeks. Chronic sinusitis usually lasts 8 weeks or more and can be recurrent. Usually, acute sinusitis is self-limiting. Chronic sinusitis may require more complex treatments. Treatments to help relieve signs and symptoms and cure of a sinus infection include:DecongestantsSaline water nasal spraysHumidified air and less frequentlyAntibiotics for bacterial sinus infectionsSurgery (for example, nasal polyp removal)Natural home remedies Decongestants Saline water nasal sprays Humidified air and less frequently Antibiotics for bacterial sinus infections Surgery (for example, nasal polyp removal) Natural home remedies Contact your doctor if you have signs and symptoms of: Severe headaches A swollen face and/or eyes Short of breath Stiff neck Confusion"
Is a sinus infection contagious?,"'Experts disagree about the contagiousness of ''sinus infections'' (also termed sinusitis and rhinosinusitis). Because bacteria and ''viruses'' (and occasionally, fungi) are the cause of most ''sinus infections'"", some experts say that the bacteria, viruses, or fungi can be transferred from person-to–person, and occasionally cause sinus infections. Other experts say that sinus infections, although caused by bacteria and viruses, occur because the conditions in the individual's sinuses are optimal for infection. Moreover, infection can be caused bacteria, viruses, or fungi that are already present in a person so that person-to-person transfer is not required for them to develop. ""'However, the majority of doctors think that most people do not transmit sinus infections except in rare instances, and conclude that sinus infections are not ''contagious''. '""Still, there is widespread agreement that bacteria, fungi and/or viruses are transmitted from person-to-person (contagious) even if the disease, sinusitis, is not. It's recommended that individuals with sinus infections avoid direct contact (for example, through kissing) with those who are more prone to infection, for example: infants, the elderly, and those who have weakened immune systems to reduce the chance of transferring bacteria, fungi, and viruses to other people as they may cause problems other than sinus infections. Viral or bacterial organisms that reside in the person's body are major causes of sinusitis.""'Since the majority of doctors consider sinus infections to be non-contagious, the only spread of sinusitis would consist of the bacteria to the various sinuses within each person.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of a sinus infection?,"'Sinus infections usually begin with the symptoms of a ''cold'' (for example, a ''runny nose'', occasional ''cough'' and/or mild ''fever''), and then develop into ''pain'' and pressure in the sinus ''cavities''. About 7 to 10 days after initial ''cold-like symptoms'' other symptoms develop that suggest you may have a ''sinus infection''. ''Sinus infection symptoms'' include:''Many people with a sinus infection or sinusitis may develop signs and symptoms that include:'""Definitive diagnosis of a sinus infection is based on the patient's history, physical exam, and evidence of sinus inflammation that may be seen with ""'X-rays'' or ''CT scan'' of the sinuses.'  A yellowish-greenish nasal discharge that may have an odor Bad breath Puffiness around the eyes Sinus headaches Pressure in the sinuses Coughing Fatigue Earaches Sore throat"
What natural or home remedies help relieve sore throat symptoms and signs?,"'Natural home remedies that relieve and soothe ''sore throat'' symptoms include:''Symptoms, especially those caused by viruses, usually are treated with OTC ''drugs'' that reduce inflammation and swelling, for example:'  OTC decongestants Steam vaporizers Warm compresses Pain relievers, for example, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for example, ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) Decongestant nasal sprays Saline sprays Salt-water sprays Neti-Pots with distilled water"
How long do the signs and symptoms of sinusitis and sinus infections last?," Acute sinusitis or sinus infections symptoms and signs last about three weeks if the signs and symptoms go away. Chronic sinusitis or sinus infections usually last about eight weeks or longer. Recurrent sinusitis is acute sinusitis that occurs several times over one year, which may develop into chronic sinusitis."
How long does it take for a sinus infection to go away? Can they be cured?,"'A person may be ""cured"" of a sinus infection when the symptoms stop, usually after about 3 weeks. However, a ""cure"" often is temporary in some people that either have chronic or recurrent sinus infections. Bacterial sinus infections may benefit from antibiotics (sometimes long-term antibiotic treatment is required before the patient is ""cured"" of a bacterial sinusitis), but there is no antibiotic treatment for viral sinusitis.' "
What medications help relieve and soothe pain and other symptoms? When is surgery necessary?,"'''Pain'' relievers to manage ''pain'' and other symptoms of sinus infections or sinusitis include''Some people have sinus infections because of other conditions or diseases. For example, people with ''asthma'' have ''airway'' narrowing and are at a higher risk of developing sinusitis.''Prescription medications to reduce ''asthma symptoms'' may reduce the tendency to develop sinusitis.''Surgery for sinusitis and sinus infections''Some people may need to have surgery or other procedures to open up narrowed or obstructed nasal or sinus passages in people with the following conditions:' acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (for example, ibuprofen [Advil and Motrin] and naproxen [Aleve]).

What is staph?,"'Staph'' is a term that is used to substitute for the genus name ''Staphylococcus''; it is a general term that refers to all the various species and subtypes of these gram-positive, coccal-shaped (round) bacteria. The organisms, depending on the species, cause skin infections, (for example, ''cellulitis'', ''boils'', and ''wound'' infections), ''pneumonia'', ''food poisoning'', ''endocarditis'', ''toxic shock syndrome'', and many other illnesses. ''MRSA'' (methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'') can be difficult to treat since it is resistant to several antibiotics.'  "
Is staph contagious?,"'Because many people carry several types and/or species of ''staph'' on their bodies, some researchers question whether or not some staph infections are truly ''contagious'"" or if they arise from overgrowth of these organisms usually present on a person's skin and/or mucous membranes. However, it is known that given the right circumstances, even if the ""'staph infection'"" arises from organisms present on one's body, if another person has direct contact with the infectious staph bacteria and has a break in the skin or mucous membranes, the organisms and potentially the disease can be ""'contagious''. Casual contact, such as hugging or kissing an infected person, usually does not transfer the organisms. However, those staph organisms that cause ''food poisoning'' do so by producing a toxin; the toxin is not contagious but may occur in groups of people who eat the same contaminated food. Similarly, individuals who develop ''toxic shock syndrome'' have staph-produced toxins that are secreted from the infection site into the body.' "
What is the incubation period for a staph infection?,"'The incubation period for staph infections unfortunately is variable and considered to be indefinite. This is because many staph infections arise from bacteria that are already present on the skin and/or mucous membranes. However, for most staph infections, the incubation period commonly ranges from about four to 10 days.' "
How will I know if I have a staph infection?,"'The most common staph infections (for example, ''boils'', ''impetigo'', and ''MRSA'') occur in the skin.''Staphylococcal ''food poisoning'' produces symptoms of''These symptoms usually come on quickly (from about one to six hours after eating the contaminated food) and usually resolve in one to three days.''Toxic shock syndrome'', originally described in menstruating women using tampons, occurs rapidly with''Although the majority of staph infections are fairly benign in the skin, some can become severe. Although usually a physician will not need to run laboratory tests for a diagnosis, if ''MRSA'', ''food poisoning'', or toxic shock syndrome is suspected, samples from blood and tissue can be examined and cultures may be performed to identify the specific type of staph.' Common features include redness and swelling of the skin; there may be abscess formation and/or pus production. More serious infections may develop if staph infections spread (pneumonia, heart failure, organ infections, and sepsis); serious infections can causehigh fever,chills,low blood pressure,shock, andeven death. high fever, chills, low blood pressure, shock, and even death. Staph infections may occur in individuals of any age group. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle aches. Patients often develop a skin rash and peeling skin with this syndrome. Patients can also develop hypotension (low blood pressure) and shock and may even die."
What is the mode of transmission for staph infections?," Most staph infections are spread by direct person-to-person contact, usually requiring some break in the skin or mucous membranes to allow transfer of the bacteria. This can occur in direct contact like wrestling, through gym clothing, or depending on the activity, through sexual contact. Staph spread by other mechanisms, such as droplets or indirect contact such as clothing or other objects, is less frequent. The toxins that cause food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome are not spread from person to person. Staph infections are infrequently or rarely spread by airborne droplets, in swimming pools or by saliva, although it is possible."
When will I know I am cured of a staph infection? How long is the contagious period for a staph infection?," Most staph skin infections are cured with antibiotics; with antibiotic treatment, many skin infections are no longer contagious after about 24-48 hours of appropriate therapy. Some skin infections, such as those due to MRSA, may require longer treatment. For more complicated infections caused by staph, in general, when the symptoms resolve, the patient is usually cured of staph infection."
When should I contact a medical caregiver about a staph infection?,"'Although many minor staph infections, especially on the skin, may not require a physician to treat, there are other instances in which it is advisable to contact a physician about possible staph infections. A person should contact a physician if they develop the following:''If any of the above symptoms or signs are severe, the person should be brought to an emergency department.'   An area of red, irritated, and/or painful skin Pus-filled structures like blisters, boils, abscesses, or wounds that leak pus Skin infections that fail to respond to topical antibiotics Fever Reddish skin areas that are peeling Skin infections or other infections after close association with someone infected with MRSA Infections associated with tampon use or surgical or other wounds that require treatment with gauze packing Dehydration associated with food poisoning"
What is a sty?,"'A ''sty'' is a localized infection with inflammation of the ''eyelid'' margin, usually involving eyelash hair follicles or ''eyelid'' glands (meibomian glands). A ''sty'' (also spelled ''stye'' and also termed a ''hordeolum'') is usually a painful, reddish, and swollen area on the eyelid margin and is caused most often by the bacterium ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ''(about 90%-95% of cases).' "
How will I know if I have a sty?,"'Most people know when they develop a ''sty'' because of the symptoms and signs that are as follows:''Sometimes a ''sty'' is confused with a ''chalazion'', which is a blockage of a small oil gland behind the eyelashes. It differs from a ''sty'' because it is usually not painful and is most prominent on the inner side of the eyelid. However, the treatment for both conditions is essentially the same.''Most doctors diagnose a sty simply by observation; no tests are needed.' A red lump or bump begins to occur on an eyelid margin that resembles a boil or a pimple. Almost always there will be eyelid discomfort or pain. Some individuals will develop eyelid swelling. Some individuals will have increased tear formation."
Is a sty contagious?,"'There is some disagreement among experts about the contagiousness of a ''sty''. In most individuals, a sty develops when some normal occurring and/or transient bacteria multiply in the eyelid margin. Because these bacteria are not necessarily transferred from one person to another, some investigators consider a sty to be noncontagious. Others, however, feel that if another person contacts the causative bacterium and they touched their eyes, it is possible to transfer the infection, but this happens very infrequently; nonetheless, these experts consider this to be a ''contagious'' disease. The compromise position would be that, in most instances, a sty is not ''contagious'' unless certain circumstances are met, such as touching a sty and then transferring the causative organism to another person, where it may or may not cause a sty or other infection to develop.' "
How is a sty spread?,"'Most of the time a sty is not spread from person to person except under unusual circumstances. However, in the same person, the infection responsible for a sty can spread to other areas of the eyelid and eventually to other components in the eye to produce an emergency condition termed orbital ''cellulitis''. This type of spread of a sty is very infrequent.' "
When will I know I am cured of a sty?,"'The majority of people who get a sty usually see it resolve in about seven days; the symptoms gradually disappear. Also, many people self-treat by utilizing warm compresses that eventually cause the sty to discharge or drain a small amount of pus. This simple treatment can hasten recovery. However, people who develop a sty are more likely to form another one in the future. There are no tests indicated for diagnosis of a sty.' "
When should I contact a health care professional about a sty?,"'Most individuals who develop a sty do not need to contact a health care professional since most infections are either self-limiting or can be easily treated by warm compresses at home. However, if the eyelid begins to develop generalized redness and swelling, you should contact your physician and/or ophthalmologist urgently. Some of the infections will not drain (even after warm compression treatments have been done for two to three days) and require small incisions or removal of an eyelash to drain the pus from a sty; this should be done by a trained health care professional or an ophthalmologist.' "
Are urinary tract infections (UTIs) contagious?,"'The answer depends upon what microbe is infecting the urinary tract. The urinary tract consists of the urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys, each of which can become infected with different microbes. ''Urinary tract infections'"" usually arise from organisms that are normally present in (colonizing) the person's gut and/or urethral opening. These organisms (for example, bacteria such as ""'E. coli'' or ''Pseudomonas'' infect the urinary tract by relocating against the flow of urine (retrograde) toward the kidneys.''Lower ''urinary tract infections'' do not involve the kidneys while upper ''urinary tract infections'' involve the kidneys and are typically more severe. These types of infections of the urinary tract are almost never ''contagious'' to other individuals. This article will not consider ''STDs'' and the organisms that cause ''STDs'' as ''urinary tract infections'' as they are discussed in other articles. However, ''STDs'' are often ''contagious'' and are transferred to others during intercourse, while ''UTIs'' are not usually transmitted by intercourse, so ''UTIs'' are rarely contagious to a partner. In addition, women who are sexually active and those individuals (males and females) who have anal intercourse have an increased chance to develop a ''UTI''.''It is unlikely for anyone to get a ''UTI'' or ''STD'"" from a toilet seat, as the urethra in males and females typically wouldn't touch the toilet seat. It is theoretically possible to transfer infectious organisms from a toilet seat to a buttock or thigh cut or sore and then have the organisms spread to the urethra or genitals. Nevertheless, such transmission of UTIs and/or ""'STDs'' are highly unlikely.'  "
How long before I know I have an infection of the urinary tract?,"'The incubation period (time of exposure to time symptoms begin) varies with the microbe. In general, common urinary tract infections with colonizing bacteria, like ''E. coli'', varies from about three to eight days.' "
How are urinary tract infections spread?,"'Bacterial infections'' of the urinary tract are almost never spread to others if the infecting organisms originate from the bacteria normally colonizing the individual (for example, ''E. coli'').' "
When should I seek medical care for a urinary tract infection (UTI)?,"'For symptoms of ''itching'' and/or ''burning on urination'' or discomfort with urination, people should seek help within 24 hours. Individuals who may develop an upper ''urinary tract infection'' (kidney involvement with flank ''pain'', for example) should seek medical help immediately.'  "
When are urinary tract infections no longer contagious?,'Simple lower and upper urinary tract infections caused by bacteria residing in the patient are not considered to be contagious. Clinicians suggest people are cleared of lower urinary tract infections after about three to seven days of antibiotic treatment and upper urinary tract (kidneys) infections by about 10-14 days after treatment. Some individuals with ''kidney infection'' may benefit from an initial IV dose of antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics.' 
What is yeast? What is a yeast infection?,"""Yeast are microscopic fungi consisting of oval cells that reproduce by forming buds. There are many types of yeast. Some yeast types are important in baking and brewing (baker's yeast, brewer's yeast). Thus, most yeast are harmless to humans. However, ""'Candida albicans'', or ''Candida'', is a yeast that can infect humans and cause illness.''Most commonly, yeast can cause infection of skin and mucous membranes. Such infections are called mucocutaneous ''candidiasis''. They occur mainly in warm, moist areas of the body where the skin is often folded together (groin, armpits, underneath the breasts and occasionally, fingernails). ''Candida'' infections are the major cause of ''diaper rash'' in children.''Candida'' also can infect:' the mouth (oral thrush), the vagina (yeast vaginitis), and infect or inflame of the male head of the penis and/or the foreskin (balanitis)."
Is a yeast infection contagious?,"'Most yeast infections are not ''contagious''. Usually, infections occur when conditions on the skin, mouth (mucosal surface), vagina and penis/foreskin develop extra moisture and warmth, often associated with a suppressed immune system. It is in these situations where ''Candida'' can ideally grow and multiply. Infrequently, the ''yeast infection'' can be transferred between men and women during sex. However, since most yeast infections are not transferred from person to person, a ''yeast infection'' in the vagina, or penis/foreskin is not considered a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of a yeast infection?,"'Symptoms of a ''yeast infection'' in skin folds include:''Symptoms of a ''yeast infection'' also may be specific to the area infected.'   Reddish rash Itching or burning of the skin Skin bumps or pimple-like structures Skin patches that ooze a clear or slightly yellowish fluid Symptoms of yeast infection of the mouth (thrush) include thick, whitish patches on the tongue and/or inside of the cheeks and pain, especially when eating or drinking. Thrush may be a sign that the patient may be immune depressed. Vaginal or penile yeast infection produce symptoms similar to those seen on the skin and can include burning with urination. Infrequently, yeast infections can occur almost anywhere inside the body's organs, especially the gastrointestinal tract. These infections are seen mainly in persons with suppressed immune systems (such as patients with HIV infections, cancer, and chemotherapy). Some people on long-term antibiotic therapy may also develop yeast or other fungal infections."
What treatments and home remedies cure yeast infections?,"'Once the symptoms disappear, most people are cured of the infection. However, yeast infections can recur.''Medications to treat a yeast infection'""Symptoms usually decrease or are gone in about 2 to 4 days after treatment is started. In more severe infections, systemic therapy (intravenous therapy) may last for about 14 to 21 days. Other treatments may last longer depending on the extent of infection and the patient's response to treatment. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is often recommended for severe infections.""'Home remedies for treatment of yeast infections are numerous, but it is recommended that you consult with your physician before trying these home remedies. Examples include:'   Skin yeast infections are usually treated with medicated creams containing antifungals such as clotrimazole, miconazole, nystatin or many others. Oral infections (thrush) are usually treated with medicated mouthwash or lozenges that dissolve. Medicated suppositories or creams are used to treat vaginal infections. These agents contain similar antifungals as described above for skin infections. However, some patients may require systemic therapy with antifungal agent, such as Itraconazole (Sporanox). garlic, tea tree oil, douching with vinegar, and many others."
When should you call a doctor for a yeast infection?,"'The majority of yeast infections can be treated without medical care (''diaper rash'', vaginal yeast infection); however, if OTC (''over-the-counter'' treatments) fail (no improvement in symptoms within 2 to 3 days), individuals should seek medical care. Some healthcare professionals\xa0recommend that individuals seek medical care for any type of yeast infection to be sure they are not suffering from some underlying disease. Individuals that develop any white patches on their mouth lining should seek medical care because they may have additional medical problems.''If you have a known medical condition that results in immunity suppression (for example, ''diabetes'', ''chemotherapy'', ''cancer'') and develop whitish patches on your mouth lining, you should seek medical care quickly.''In general, ''pregnant'"" women that develop a skin or vaginal yeast infection usually can use OTC medical treatment for the infection. However, it is always best to check with your OB/GYN physician before using any medication while you're ""'pregnant''.' "
What is abdominoplasty?,"'Abdominoplasty'' (''tummy tuck'') is a procedure to correct abdominal deformity due to excess skin, subcutaneous tissue and laxity of the abdominal wall musculature. Abdominoplasty is one of the most performed cosmetic surgical procedures. It is usually performed by a ''plastic surgeon''.' "
What are the causes of abdominal deformity?," Pregnancy: Pregnancy can stretch the skin beyond its biomechanical capability to spring back and stretches the muscular structures of the abdominal wall. The result is stretching skin and thinning of the abdominal muscle. Massive weight loss from dieting, exercise gastric bypass surgery or after pregnancy causes excess skin and laxity of the abdominal wall."
Is abdominoplasty a major surgery?,'Abdominoplasty is performed under spinal or general anesthesia and it is a major surgery.' 
What is abdominoplasty done for?, Abdominal wall laxity Excess skin Striae (stretch marks) Diastasis (separation) of the abdominal muscles Body contouring
Am I a candidate for abdominoplasty?," You would be an ideal patient if your body mass index (BMI) is within normal limits, have no plans for future pregnancies and only seek body contouring after weight loss. Moderate amount of excess of skin and fat can be treated. You need to be close to your ideal body weight prior to the surgery. If you are planning another pregnancy or planning to lose more than 10 lb, it is advised to postpone the procedure. The most accepted criterion for measuring obesity is BMI. Calculated by weight in kg divided by height in meters squared. The BMI categories are:20-25 - healthy26-29 - overweight30-34.9 - obese (category I)35-39.9 - obese (category II)>40 - morbidly obese (category III) 20-25 - healthy 26-29 - overweight 30-34.9 - obese (category I) 35-39.9 - obese (category II) >40 - morbidly obese (category III) It is important to have realistic expectations and aesthetic goals. The excision of excess skin and fat does not flatten an abdominal wall distended from inside. If you have had multiple pregnancies with striae, results would not be like in the magazines."
What happens during the abdominoplasty procedure?,"'The surgeon will' Advise the patient to stop smoking and start exercising before the surgery for overall well-being and to speed the healing process. Advise the patient to lose enough weight they will be close to their goal weight. Perform a physical examination, blood and radiological investigations. Surgery is performed under anesthesia. Various types and sizes of incisions exist which the surgeon picks based on the patient's body shape and/ or choice of clothing. In most abdominoplasty procedures, the incision is low on the abdomen and hidden by underwear. Absorbable sutures can help reduce scarring. Endoscopic abdominoplasty (incision size is 2 1/2 inches) may be done in slim patients who just have a “pot belly” A surgical drain may be inserted to prevent blood and fluid accumulation in the operated area.The drain is a clear tube inserted through a small incision below the main incision. The drain is a clear tube inserted through a small incision below the main incision. Pain killers and antibiotics may be administered. The surgical site is dressed for up to 48 hours. The drain may be removed the same day or within 24-48 hours. Removal is not typically painful. The patient can be discharged the same day or after drain removal. The patient should not shower for 48 hours. Feeling abdominal tightness, swelling and bruising is normal and usually resolves without further problems. Absorbable sutures take a few weeks to dissolve. Patients may experience pain for 10 to 20 days which may need pain killers. The patient can resume normal activities after 48 to72 hours. Avoid lifting heavy objects, rigorous exercise, swimming and other sports for six to eight weeks. The patient may resume moderate walking after 10 to 14 days. The patient can return to work, depending on their own comfort level, nature of work, physical activity required, travel distance and approval from the surgeon."
Who should not get abdominoplasty?,'People with the following issues should not receive abdominoplasty surgery:' Other abdominal scars Severe comorbid conditions such asheart disease diabetesobesitytobacco addiction heart disease  diabetes obesity tobacco addiction Planning pregnancy Bleeding or blood vessel disorders Morbid obesity (BMI >40) Unrealistic expectations Tendency to form keloids or thick scars
How dangerous is abdominoplasty?,"'Abdominoplasty is a relatively safe and commonly performed surgery. It is important to be mindful of the contraindications, follow advice and have realistic aesthetic goals. But as with any major surgery, there are complications, which include:' Poor wound healing Dehiscence (cut made during a surgical procedure separates or ruptures after it has been sutured) Bleeding Blood clot formation Infection Hypertrophic scarring (formation of raised scars) Residual deformity Blood clots in the vessels Wide umbilical scars Intra-abdominal hypertension Acid reflux Temporary or permanent numbness around the incision site"
What is adenocarcinoma?,"'Adenocarcinoma'' is a type of ''cancer'' that starts in the glands that line the organs.\xa0 Glands secrete substances like saliva, stomach acid, or hormones that help the body function.' "
What can cause adenocarcinoma?,"'Though the exact cause of adenocarcinoma is not fully understood, researchers have identified a variety of risk factors that are associated with this type of ''cancer'':''Smoking'' is the most common risk factor associated with all types of ''cancers''.\xa0It is important to note that these risk factors will not necessarily lead to ''lung cancer''. Similarly, an individual may develop ''lung cancer'' without having any of these risk factors.' Family history of cancer (twins, siblings, first-degree relatives) Environmental toxins Secondhand smoke  Alcohol Radon exposure Asbestos exposure Silica exposure Diesel exhaust Exposure to air pollution and other chemicals  Prior radiation exposure Beta carotene supplements "
Is adenocarcinoma an aggressive cancer?,"'Adenocarcinoma happens when cells in the glands that line organs grow out of control. They may spread to other places and harm healthy organs.\xa0 Adenocarcinoma in different organs manifests differently.\xa0''Adenocarcinoma can start in:' Colon and rectumAdenocarcinoma is the most common type of colon cancer. It starts out as a small bump, or growth, that can turn into cancer. The disease can also start in your anal region and then migrate to the large intestine. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of colon cancer.  It starts out as a small bump, or growth, that can turn into cancer.  The disease can also start in your anal region and then migrate to the large intestine.

This is a gland in men situated below the urine bladder.  Prostate gland cancers are mostly adenocarcinomas."
How is adenocarcinoma diagnosed?,"'Initially, an individual does not experience any symptoms. Adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed in late stages, and it already spreads by the time symptoms are obvious. Symptoms may include ''pain'', ''weight loss'' swelling, ''diarrhea'', bleeding and ''weakness''.\xa0 Below are few common tests to confirm adenocarcinoma:' Colonoscopy checks intestines for masses which might be adenocarcinomas (polyps).  Blood tests check for anemia (blood loss) as it is an important indication for possible cancer.  Imaging tests (CT, MRI) are helpful to see if any of the tissues in organs appear abnormal. Imaging tests also help the doctor monitor a  cancer treatment’s effectiveness."
How is adenocarcinoma treated?,"'Treatment of adenocarcinoma depends on the anatomical site and its manifestations. Below are treatment options for adenocarcinoma.''Cancer treatment\xa0can have side effects which include ''vomiting'' and weakness; doctors usually treat these side effects with medications.' Surgery: The primary treatment after diagnosis is usually to remove the tumor and the tissue around it. Usually, the tissue is sent to pathology lab to determine the aggressiveness of the cancer. Depending on the pathology result, an individual might need to combine other treatments with surgery.  Chemotherapy: Drugs used in chemotherapy can kill adenocarcinoma cells, slow their growth, or even cure the disease. Radiation: Generally, high-energy X-rays or other types of rays are exposed to the cancerous site to kill the cancer cells."
What is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?,"'Acute flaccid myelitis'' (AFM) is rare but a serious medical condition that affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord. Most acute flaccid myelitis cases have been in young children (the average age is 3-15 years). This condition usually affects the ''gray matter'' in the spinal cord, which weakens the body’s muscles and reflexes. This can lead to ''paralysis'' that is sometimes permanent. The common signs and symptoms include:' Stiff neck Fever Sudden arm or leg weakness with or without pain Difficulty swallowing Slurred speech Facial weakness or drooping of eyelids Loss of or weakened reflexes Headache Neck or back pain Bowel/bladder changes Respiratory symptoms (difficulty breathing) Difficulty moving the eyes or drooping eyelids Difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech Bowel or bladder control problems"
How is AFM diagnosed?,"'AFM can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to other neurological diseases. AFM may be diagnosed by:' Physical examination: Looking at the location of the weakness, muscle tone, and reflexes Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Laboratory tests: Biological specimens, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, and stool"
Is there a treatment for AFM?,"'Unfortunately, there is no available treatment for AFM; however, a few options may help in relieving the symptoms:' Initially, patients are treated with supportive care, physical therapy (PT), and occupational therapy (OT). Early intervention may begin to restore functions of the affected limbs and improve daily functioning, even if it is not possible to regain full muscle function. Patients can continue to improve with PT and OT for months to years following their initial illness. Certain therapies that have been tried, such as immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and antiviral therapy. The main purpose of utilizing these therapies is to decrease the inflammation and halt the body’s immune system from initiating further attacks. However, there is no concrete evidence that immune-modulating therapies have remarkable effects on AFM patients. Occasionally, mechanical ventilation is required to support breathing. If muscle movement does not come back, a surgical procedure can be performed to help. These are called nerve transfers. A nerve transfer involves finding a healthy working nerve and connecting it to a nonworking muscle. In time, the working nerve grows into the muscle, and then over time (9-12 months) movement can happen. This helps to rewire the nerves to give the patient better movement and strength in their limbs."
What is the outlook of patients with AFM?,"'The outlook is poor for AFM due to the lack of definite causative agents. The recovery is unpredictable and may range from full recovery in a matter of days to long-term limb weakness. As per research, patients regain some strength over time, many do not recover to gain full function. The most involved extremity (arm/leg) is generally least likely to recover.' "
What are the best ways to prevent acute flaccid myelitis?,"'The following measures may be taken to protect an individual from contracting an infection:' Getting the required vaccinations on time Minimizing exposure to mosquitoes may help prevent the infection Following certain basic hygiene procedures, such as washing the hands with soap and water, disinfecting touched items, and avoiding contact with contagious people, may help reduce the chances of acquiring an infection."
What does amniocentesis mean?,'Amniocentesis is a medical procedure used primarily for testing and diagnosing genetic (hereditary) abnormalities or infection in an unborn baby inside the mother’s womb and for sex determination.''It involves taking a small sample of the fluid that surrounds the unborn baby in the womb (amniotic fluid) so that the baby’s skin cells in the fluid can be tested.' 
When will your doctor suggest amniocentesis?,"'Your doctor or obstetrician may usually perform amniocentesis in 15 weeks of your ''pregnancy'' (rarely after 28 weeks) if you''This test may be suggested by your doctor to detect some of the defects in your unborn baby such as follows:' Are an older mother (aged ≥35 years). Or your partner has a hereditary (running in your family) condition or birth defects that may be passed on to the baby. Have a previous child born with a defect. Have received abnormal results from other tests such as an ultrasound, a nuchal translucency scan, a genetic test, or a blood test. Down syndrome (a hereditary disease that causes developmental and intellectual delays) Sickle cell disease (a blood disorder) Cystic fibrosis (a hereditary disease that affects the lungs and digestive system) Muscular dystrophy (a hereditary disease that causes muscle damage) Spina bifida (spine and spinal cord defect) Anencephaly (a baby born with an underdeveloped brain or incomplete skull) Splits in the roof of the mouth and lip Heart defects Tay-Sachs (a rare, inherited disorder that destroys the brain nerve cells) and similar diseases"
What happens during amniocentesis?,"'Before amniocentesis, your obstetrician will check the position of your baby and placenta in the womb with the help of an ultrasound scan.''During the procedure:''After the procedure:' The skin on your belly is cleaned with an antiseptic solution. Next, a fine needle is passed through your tummy into the womb, and the fluid is removed by using a syringe (about three teaspoonfuls). This fluid is then sent to a laboratory to check your unborn baby’s genes (a basic hereditary unit). Rarely, if your doctor is unable to get enough fluid at the first attempt, then they may reinsert the needle. You should take things easy for a couple of days after the test. You should avoid any heavy weight-lifting, strenuous physical activity, or exercise. If you experience any discomfort in your belly that lasts more than 24 hours or if you have a fever, unusual vaginal discharge, or bleeding, you must see your obstetrician."
Are there any risks?,"'Amniocentesis has a small risk for both the mother and baby. Only 1%, that is, up to 1 woman in 100 may have pregnancy loss or ''miscarriage'' after amniocentesis due to some unknown reasons. In extremely rare cases, it may cause injury to the baby or mother, infection, or preterm delivery.' "
What is an anoscopy procedure?,"'Anoscopy is a procedure to examine the walls of the anus and part of the rectum. It is performed with a rigid tube (anoscope) that is inserted a few inches into the anal canal. Anoscopy enables the doctor to visualize the anal canal and the lower part of the rectum.''The anoscope is also called an anal speculum. Anoscopes may have\xa0 lights, or the doctor may use a separate source of light for viewing. A specialist doctor may sometimes use a high-resolution anoscope with a microscope that offers a magnified view.' "
Is anoscopy a surgical procedure?,'Anoscopy is not a surgical procedure. It is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure done in a doctor’s office. The entire procedure may take 20-30 minutes.' 
Is an anoscopy painful?,"'Most people feel no ''pain'' during an anoscopy. The patient may feel a pressure like an urge for bowel movement, or a pinch if tissue is removed for biopsy. There usually is no requirement for any painkiller or sedation.''Rarely, sedation may be required:' For people who have a distortion in their anatomy and are unable to tolerate the procedure. When the doctor is unsuccessful in removing a foreign body found inside the anorectal canal."
Why is an anoscopy performed?,"'Anoscopy is performed to examine the anus and lower rectum, the lowermost parts of the gastrointestinal tract. The doctor usually performs a digital rectal examination (DRE) first.''In a DRE the doctor inserts a finger and feels the anal canal for abnormalities. Anoscopy is used to visually examine the anorectal region when a DRE does not yield sufficient information for diagnosis, or when a biopsy sample is required.''Anoscopy may be used to detect the cause of anal or rectal''Anoscopy may be required in the following situations:' pain bleeding itching foul smelling discharge Anal fissures: tears in the anal tissue which may be due toconstipationlarge and hard bowel movementspersistent diarrheachildbirth constipation large and hard bowel movements persistent diarrhea childbirth Crohn’s disease Abscesses: pus-filled pockets in the tissue, caused by infection. They may result fromblocked anal glandinfection of anal fissuressexually transmitted infectionsinflammatory bowel disease blocked anal gland infection of anal fissures sexually transmitted infections inflammatory bowel disease Hemorrhoids: inflamed and swollen veins which may be inside the anus or rectum or around the anal opening. Polyps: abnormal tissue growth that may be benign or precancerous. Proctitis: inflammation of the lining of the rectum. Tumors or cancer: less common than colon cancer and may warrant further investigation of the colon. Foreign objects in the anorectal canal: more invasive methods may be required if not removable via anoscopy."
How is an anoscopy performed?,"'An anoscopy is a minor outpatient procedure performed by a doctor to evaluate conditions of the anus and rectum.' The patient must empty the bladder and bowel, if necessary, with a laxative or enema. No colon cleansing or diet restriction is required. The patients typically lie on their side in a fetal position with knees drawn to the chest or may kneel and bend forward. The doctor inserts an analgesic jelly in the anal canal about 10 minutes before the procedure. The doctor first visually inspects the anal area. The doctor makes a digital rectal examination by inserting a finger to ensure there is no mass or obstruction that can be injured by the insertion of the anoscope. The doctor slowly inserts the lubricated anoscope while the patient bears down like pushing for a bowel movement. The doctor examines the anorectal canal through the anoscope with a light. The doctor may remove some tissue for biopsy. The doctor slowly withdraws the anoscope. Depending on the results the doctor will decide on further course of treatment. The patient will be able to leave immediately after the procedure and resume normal activities."
What are the side effects and risks of anoscopy?,'An anoscopy carries nearly no side effects or risks. Patients may experience\xa0' a slight discomfort  light bleeding for a short while if there are hemorrhoids a mild pain for a little while if any tissue was removed for biopsy
What is balanitis?,"'Balanitis'' is an inflammation of the head of the penis and/or foreskin that surrounds the head of the penis in uncircumcised men. However, not everyone agrees with this definition. For example, some consider balanitis as only inflammation of the penis head while inflammation of the foreskin is ''posthitis'' and when both structures are inflamed, the problem is referred to as ''balanoposthitis''. For the purpose of this article, balanitis will be considered an inflammation of the head of the penis and/or surrounding foreskin.'   Males who are predisposed to developing balanitis include those with:Congestive heart failureNephritisCirrhosisMorbid obesity Congestive heart failure Nephritis Cirrhosis Morbid obesity Males who are more likely to develop balanitis include those:With poor personal hygieneWho are sensitive to chemical irritants (for example, soaps and lubricants)That have drug allergies With poor personal hygiene Who are sensitive to chemical irritants (for example, soaps and lubricants) That have drug allergies Males with diabetes are at increased risk of developing balanitis and diabetes is a very common cause of balanitis. Glucose (sugar) on the skin encourages bacterial and fungal growth, particularly males:With uncontrolled diabetes (people with uncontrolled diabetes have high glucose levels in their urine), andThat have diabetes and take medications that causes more sugar to be excreted in the urine, for example dapagliflozin (Farxiga). With uncontrolled diabetes (people with uncontrolled diabetes have high glucose levels in their urine), and That have diabetes and take medications that causes more sugar to be excreted in the urine, for example dapagliflozin (Farxiga). Balanitis can be a distinct clinical feature in men with reactive arthritis. Balanitis can be caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)."
Is balanitis contagious?,"'The answer to this question is somewhat complex; not a simple yes or no.'   Balanitis caused by the normal skin bacteria on the penis or balanitis caused by a chemical skin irritant is generally considered non-contagious. Balanitis caused by certain fungi (yeast) and/or specific bacteria or viruses (including those that cause STDs such as gonorrhea) is transferable from one person directly to another person. Although the actual disease balanitis usually is not transferred to other males, the organisms causing balanitis may be transferred. Since some of the bacteria, fungi, or viruses that cause balanitis are contagious, balanitis could be considered ""contagious"" under special conditions (such as balanitis caused by STDs)."
How can you tell if you have balanitis? What its symptoms and signs?,"'If the male with whom one has had contact has balanitis caused by chemical or normal skin bacteria, it is unlikely that the disease is contagious. However, there is a significant risk of a person becoming infected if he or she has been exposed to a male who has balanitis caused by specific viruses, bacteria, or fungi such as:''The time required to develop symptoms after exposure (incubation period) differs with the different viruses, bacteria, or fungus. However, the first signs and ''symptoms of balanitis'' are:''Other symptoms may develop, depending upon the transmitted viruses or bacteria. For example, discharge from the urethra, ulcerations, and ''enlarged lymph nodes'' are symptoms that may develop with sexually transmitted diseases. Tests for ''STD'""'s and specific bacteria and viruses can help distinguish balanitis from other diseases that may mimic balanitis like ""'herpes'' and gonorrhea.'   Yeasts Neisseria gonorrhea Chlamydia Treponema Redness Itching Swelling Tenderness of the head of the penis and its surrounding foreskin"
How will I know if I am no longer contagious?,"'If you have, or have had the non-contagious type of balanitis, then you should have no concerns about being contagious. However, if balanitis was due to an infectious bacteria or virus, then you would be noncontagious after the bacteria or virus was ""treated and cured."" Antibiotics and topical creams are used to treat balanitis. The time frame for complete recovery varies according to the nature of the infectious agent.' "
What is the treatment for balanitis? How long does it take to go away?,"'Treatment for common yeast-caused balanitis is topical canesten 1% cream (''clotrimazole'', Lotrimin); recommended treatment time varies from about 2 weeks to 1 month. ''Lotrisone'' (combination of betamethasone and clotrimazole) has also been used.' "
When should you call a doctor for balanitis? Can it be cured?,"'Contact your doctor for any redness, swelling and/or irritation of the penis and/or foreskin. Healthcare professionals can help you with treatment of both noncontagious and contagious causes of balanitis, and determining the cause of the infection. Persistent symptoms of balanitis should be evaluated by a health-care professional.' Complications of balanitis include constriction of the opening of the urethra (phimosis) and severe urinary obstruction. These complications can require emergency treatment. Some with balanitis may require consultation with a urologist. Balanitis caused by bacteria, yeast or other organisms that are resistant to treatment may not be easily cured."

What is boric acid?,"'Boric acid is a pesticide found in nature and many other products. They are mainly used to kill mites, fungi, plants, and insects, including fleas, termites, cockroaches, and wood decay fungi.''Boric acid is mainly found in:' Antiseptics and astringents Enamels and glazes Medicated powders Skin lotions Some paints Glass fiber manufacturing Rodent and ant pesticides Photography chemicals Powders to kill roaches Some eyewash products"
How does boric acid act?,'Boric acid can disrupt the stomach and affect the nervous system of the insects. It can also scratch and damage the exterior of insects. The borax acts by:' Drying out the plants Stopping plants from producing the energy they need from the light Stopping the growth of fungi by preventing them from reproducing
What to do if you had boric acid poisoning?,"'If the skin is exposed to boric acid, wash the area immediately with plenty of ''running'' water.''If the chemical comes in contact with the eyes, rinse the eyes with cool water for 15 minutes.''If boric acid is swallowed, seek emergency medical treatment.' "
How does the physician treat boric acid poisoning?,"'At the emergency room, the person may receive:''In the case of skin exposure, the treatment includes:' Airway support, including oxygen, intubation, and ventilator Blood and urine tests Endoscopy to check for burns in the stomach and esophagus Chest X-ray Fluids through vein Electrocardiogram (ECG) Medications to subside the symptoms Hemodialysis may help to clear the boric acid from the blood and prevent damage to kidneys and gastrointestinal tract Gastric lavage (a tube inserted in the stomach to clear out its contents) with charcoal powder may help reduce absorption in the body. Debridement (surgical removal) of skin surfaces Irrigation (rinsing the skin), possibly every few hours for several days The physician may recommend surgery if the acid perforates the esophagus, stomach, or intestine."
What happens to boric acid in the environment?, 
What is a breech baby?,"'A breech baby means that the baby is in a bottom-down position inside the uterus. The baby generally has enough room inside the uterus to change position. By 36, most ''babies'' are in the head-down position (vertex presentation), which is the best and safest position for delivery. In around 4 out of 100 births, the baby stays in the breech position even after 36 weeks of ''pregnancy''. Non-vertex presentation in a baby means any position other than the head-down position inside the uterus. Non-vertex positions, including breech, are more common in twin ''pregnancies'' where one baby may be in a vertex presentation whereas the other baby is in a different presentation (such as breech or lying transversely in the uterus).''A breech presentation may be of different types. These include' Complete breech: In this breech position, the baby’s buttocks are down near the birth canal and the knees are bent so that the feet are near the buttocks. Frank breech: This is the common type of breech position. In this type of breech, the baby’s legs are stretched up so that the feet are near the head, whereas the buttocks are the presenting part and come out first during the delivery. Footling breech: This means that the baby has one leg or both legs stretched out below the buttocks. One or both the legs are in place to come out first during delivery."
What is a breech extraction delivery?,"'Breech extraction is a procedure in which the obstetrician grasps the baby’s feet so that the baby is delivered (extracted) from the womb through the vagina. This procedure is performed for the delivery of the ''second twin'' in a vertex (head-down) or non-vertex presentation (such as a breech baby or a baby lying obliquely in the uterus). It is not recommended for the delivery of a single fetus. After the delivery of the first twin, the second twin often changes its position. If the second twin is in a vertex presentation, the baby is allowed to descend through the pelvis. In a non-vertex position, however, breech extraction is preferred. The procedure is generally performed with adequate ''pain'' control (analgesia) under epidural anesthesia.\xa0' "
Is breech extraction safe?,"'The safety and success of the breech extraction procedure largely depend upon a well-trained and experienced obstetrician. Although several studies have revealed that breech extraction gives a good outcome, some complications can occur. These include' The head of the second twin may get entrapped if the cervix is not fully dilated or if the second twin is significantly larger than the first twin. Injuries to the baby Injury to the mother The baby’s hip socket and thigh bone may get separated during the delivery. Abruptio placentae (a condition in which the placenta separates from the womb before delivery) leading to excessive bleeding Postpartum hemorrhage or PPH (excessive blood loss after the delivery), which most commonly occurs due to uterine atony (inability of the uterus to sufficiently contract after delivery) There may be problems with the umbilical cord such as compression or flattening of the umbilical during delivery, which can cause nerve and brain damage in the baby due to lack of oxygen."
Is bright red blood in the stool serious?,"'The presence of ''blood in the stool'' needs to be evaluated by your doctor.''In most cases, the bright red blood in stools is not an immediate threat to life. The most common causes are ''piles'', anal polyps, anal fissures and ''colitis'' (inflammation of the large bowel). These conditions may cause recurrent episodes of blood loss and affect quality of life, but they are not fatal. Rarely, ''cancers'' arising from the rectum and anus can cause bright red blood in stools. Such cancers can also occur in people with a history of ''piles'' and colitis. Hence, it is important to pay attention to this symptom and contact your healthcare professional immediately.' "
What causes blood in stools?,"'Blood in stools is a symptom of injury to the gut (digestive tract). When fresh blood is seen in the ''stool'', it is called ''hematochezia''. It is a marker of rectal and anal disease. Dark tarry\xa0 ''stool'' is called melena. It points to bleeding from the small intestine or stomach.''The following conditions may cause blood in stools' Hemorrhoids: The painless, bright red blood that coats the stool or toilet paper may be due to hemorrhoids (piles). Piles are swollen veins present in the lower part of the rectum. Anal fissure: The bright red blood that covers the stools on one side and is accompanied by intense pain may be due to anal fissure. This is a small tear at the margin of the anus from where the stools are expelled. Colitis (infections): The infection of the large intestine by amoebas or bacteria (such as E. coli and Shigella) can also cause blood in stools. This is accompanied by diarrheas, fever and abdominal cramps. Ulcerative colitis (inflammatory bowel syndrome): This disease is due to the malfunctioning of the immune system. It causes ulcers in the colon. Other symptoms are diarrhea that lasts more than a week, stomach cramps, joint pain and weight loss. It has active episodes (periods of flares) and remissions (the phase when symptoms go away). Colon cancers: A cancerous growth in the rectum or anus may cause red blood in the stools. Other symptoms may include weight loss, loss of appetite and alternating diarrhea and constipation. Polyps: These are noncancerous masses found in the anus and rectum as you age. These may cause bleeding if they get twisted resulting in blood in stools. Diverticulitis: Diverticula are small pouches that form in the gut, typically the large bowel, of some people. When these diverticula get infected and swollen (diverticulitis), they may cause dark red blood in the stools. Angiodysplasia: Some people may have an abnormal blood vessel malformation in the small intestine. If it bursts due to pressure or trauma, there may be dark red blood in the stools. Ulcers: Ulcers in the upper gut, stomach  or esophagus may also cause blood in stool, but such blood is blackish and causes tar-colored stools."
How will my doctor diagnose the cause of blood in my stool?,"'The physician will conduct certain tests to find the site and cause of bleeding. The following tests are commonly done to assess ''blood in stool' Anoscopy: Done in clinic settings, it does not require anesthesia. An instrument is inserted inside the anus, and the doctor can check for piles, fistulas or polyps in the anus. Sigmoidoscopy: Done in clinic settings, it does not require anesthesia. A sigmoidoscope (an instrument) is inserted inside the anus. The lower gut and anus can be examined with this test. Colonoscopy: This study requires sedation. A colonoscope (pipe-like instrument with a camera and light source) is inserted through the anus and advanced upwards. The camera projects the image on a screen where the doctor can check inside the colon for any tumors or ulcers. Enteroscopy is a similar procedure that is done to visualize the inside of the small intestine. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD): This study requires sedation. A pipe-like instrument with a front camera is inserted through the mouth. As it moves through the esophagus and into the stomach and  into the small intestine, the camera projects images onto the screen where the doctor can see the insides of the upper gut and stomach to check for any tumors or ulcers. Barium studies: A series of X-rays are taken after drinking a solution of barium salt. This highlights any masses or ulcers or narrowing in the digestive tract. Laparotomy: If the above measures fail, open laparotomy is performed where the abdomen is opened surgically to find the cause of the bleeding. Angiography: This procedure is performed to find bleeding from an artery or any abnormal blood vessel (angiodysplasia). A dye is injected and its pathway is examined on computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans."
Health benefits of buckwheat,"'Health benefits include:' Improved blood sugar control: Buckwheat has a low to medium glycemic index (reduces the rise in blood sugar after meals), hence safe for diabetics to eat and is also beneficial to those who want to improve their blood sugar balance. Maintaining good blood sugar balance helps in maintaining good health. Good for heart health: Magnesium, copper, fiber, certain proteins, and plant compounds, such as rutin, help in maintaining good heart health. Buckwheat has the highest amount of rutin, an antioxidant amongst cereals and pseudocereals. Antioxidants protect the body tissues from oxidative stress and slow the process of aging. Rutin protects the heart, reduces the risk of formation of blood clots in the blood vessels, inflammation, and blood pressure. Buckwheat has also been found to reduce cholesterol, which is a risk factor for heart disease."
Is C. diff (Clostridium difficile) contagious?,"'Yes, ''C. diff'' is ''contagious''. Microorganisms can be spread from person-to-person by touch or by direct contact with contaminated objects and surfaces (for example, clothing, cell phones, door handles). Some individuals are carriers of this bacterium but have no symptoms of infection. However, these people are still infected with the bacteria can spread the infection to others.''In general, the bacteria have to increase in numbers rapidly to cause disease, so the bacteria can be transferred to people, but not cause significant infection immediately. Disease occurs when conditions favor growth of these organisms. Conditions that favor growth are''Avoiding direct and indirect physical contact with contaminated areas reduces the likelihood of contagion.' weakened immune systems, the elderly, and especially individuals that are hospitalized, and are being treated with antibiotics that suppress the normal bowel flora."
How do I know if I have an infection caused by C. diff?,"'Although the incubation period for ''Clostridium difficile'' is not precisely known, researchers suggest that the incubation period is about seven days if the conditions are favorable for bacterial proliferation. However, a person may acquire ''C. diff'' and develop no infection symptoms, but be colonized for extended time periods (years) until conditions develop that favor ''C. diff'' proliferation.''Symptoms of ''C. diff'' infection can be mild such as watery ''diarrhea'' three or more times a day with mild ''abdominal pain'' or tenderness or maybe more severe with diarrheal episodes reaching 15 times a day with severe ''abdominal pain'', blood or pus in the ''stool'', ''fever'', ''weight loss'' and ''loss of appetite''.''In most instances, the confirmatory diagnosis is made by detecting a cytotoxin produced by ''C. diff'"" in the patient's ""'stool'' sample.'  "
How does C. diff spread?,"'As described above, ''Clostridium difficile'' can be spread from person-to-person by direct contact and indirect contact with contaminated objects (clothing, eating utensils, and tabletops, for examples). ''C. diff'' spreads easily in hospitals because often the highest concentrations of these bacteria are in hospitalized patients treated with antibiotics. Strict hand washing techniques and patient isolation methods can reduce ''C. diff'' spread in hospitals and other areas.' "
How will I know if I am no longer contagious for C. diff?,"'People infected with ''C. diff'' who become ill usually are treated with special antibiotics (''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl''), ''vancomycin'' (''Vancocin''), ''rifaximin'' (''Xifaxan'') and/or fidaxomicin) for about 10 to 14 days. Severe infections may require intravenous antibiotics and even surgery.''A person with ''C. diff'' becomes less contagious as the symptoms decrease, and little or no toxin is detected in their stools. However, since the person previously infected is still capable of relapsing and/or becoming a carrier for ''Clostridium difficile,'' it is difficult to say if the they are no longer contagious. However, the person is less likely to transfer ''C. difficile'' to others when their symptoms resolve after treatment.'  "
When should I seek medical care for C. diff?," If you or someone you know develops mild to moderate watery diarrhea, cramping abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue and fever, especially after taking antibiotics, seek medical care. If you or someone you know is dehydrated, has a fever, decreased bowel sounds and/or abdominal rigidity, and possible perforation of the colon with a very tender abdomen, you or they should seek immediate emergency medical care. Hospitalized patients on antibiotics are monitored for signs and symptoms of C. diff infection including diarrhea and abdominal pain."
What is cancer?,'Cancer'' is a disease of uncontrolled multiplication of abnormal cells (''malignant'' cells). ''Cancer'' can affect any part of the body. The abnormal growth of cells often results in a mass (''tumor'') of ''malignant'' cells that causes further problems by occupying space used by normal tissues. ''Cancers'' cells can also move away from (''metastasize'') their initial site of development to invade other tissues of the body.' 
Is cancer contagious?,"'Cancer'' is not ''contagious''. Close personal contact with a ''cancer'' patient, sexual relationships, kissing, touching, and sharing meals and/or utensils cannot cause other people to have ''cancer''. Rarely, individuals who have received organ transplants from individuals that have ''cancer'' may also develop ''cancer'' from the transplant. However, currently a stricter screening procedure of organ donors has reduced the risk of transplants that cause ''cancer'' in organ recipients. Another very rare instance where ''cancer'' is transferred is from a ''pregnant'' mother to the fetus. A number of different ''viruses'' (human papilloma, Epstein-Barr, ''hepatitis B''), bacteria (''Helicobacter pylori'') and parasites are associated with various ''cancers''. However, although the ''viruses'' and other pathogens may be ''contagious'' or simply infectious, the cancers these organisms are associated with are not considered to be ''contagious''.' "
How will I know if I have cancer?,"'There are more than 100 types of cancers (including breast cancers, lung cancers, bowel cancers, metastatic cancers, and many more). If you have some of the following symptoms and signs, it would be reasonable to contact your physician and let the physician know you are concerned:''There are various tests your physician can perform to evaluate your particular symptoms.' Lumps, bumps, and/or masses underneath your skin Sores that do not heal on the skin Testicular changes (abnormal growths or masses) Breast lumps, bumps, or masses Nipple discharge and/or skin changes Changes in your bowel pattern such as pencil-thin stools and/or blood in the stools Sores that will not heal on any mucous membranes Persistent cough and/or shortness of breath Difficulty swallowing or speaking Unexplained weight loss Constant fatigue Persistent pain (constant headache, abdominal pains, chest discomfort) Abnormal vaginal bleeding or abnormal vaginal discharge Abnormal bloating and/or swelling Persistent indigestion, nausea, and/or vomiting."
How does cancer spread?,"'Cancer is not contagious. However, cancer can spread within the individual as the disease progresses. Cancer cells can disseminate from their original site and spread to other organs through blood and lymph vessels, and by direct extension of the ''tumor'' into other organs of the body.' "
When will I know I am cured of cancer?,"'Some cancers can be cured while others cannot. A cancer that is no longer evident by physical, radiology, and laboratory evaluations after certain periods of time may be considered by the doctor to be cured. Each form and stage of cancer is different in this regard.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about cancer?,"'Individuals should contact a medical ''caregiver'' if they have symptoms that make them suspect they might have cancer. Individuals who have a family history of certain types of cancer should be regularly checked by a physician. If you are a patient who has cancer, you should seek medical care immediately if you develop a high ''fever'', ''shortness of breath'', intense ''headaches'', ''vomiting blood'' or passing blood rectally, ''chest pain'' or moderate to severe ''weakness'', passing out (''fainting''), ''mental status changes'', or ''seizures''.' "
What is capsule endoscopy?,"'Video or wireless ''capsule endoscopy'' is a noninvasive diagnostic procedure for examining the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the small intestine.\xa0''Capsule ''endoscopy'' is performed with a capsule endoscope, which is a large capsule containing a micro-camera, a light bulb, a battery, and a radio transmitter.''The patient swallows the capsule endoscope which transmits images of high resolution and magnification as it passes through the digestive tract. These images are recorded and can be viewed on a computer to check for abnormalities.' "
Capsule endoscopy history and development,"'Traditional endoscopy and ''colonoscopy'' enable a doctor to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract (''esophagus'', stomach and duodenum) and the colon, respectively, but are not helpful in studying the entire small intestine.''Barium swallow'' tests with ''X-rays'' have been available for evaluating the small ''intestines'', but the radiological images are not accurate in identifying small tumors and subtle abnormalities.''Technical advances in imaging, optical design and light-emitting diodes enabled the development of capsule endoscopy in the late 1990s. Currently research is underway on the development of magnetically guided capsule endoscopy.' "
Why is capsule endoscopy done?,"'Capsule endoscopy is primarily performed to evaluate the small intestine’s health, though it is useful in diagnosing disease in any part of the digestive tract.\xa0''Currently, it is recommended after ''upper endoscopy'' and colonoscopy have not been successful in finding the cause for' blood in stool abdominal pain diarrhea or constipation change in bowel habits unexplained weight loss"
What conditions can be diagnosed with capsule endoscopy?,'Capsule endoscopy is especially useful in diagnosing conditions affecting the small intestines including:' Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding from lesions (angiodysplasia) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such asCrohn’s diseaseUlcerative colitis Crohn’s disease Ulcerative colitis Tumors and cancer Polyps Celiac disease (gluten intolerance) Henoch-Schonlein purpura (a disease that causes inflammation and bleeding of the small intestines)  Intestinal graft-versus-host disease (when immune cells in donor tissue attack the patient’s healthy cells) after small bowel transplant Capsule endoscopy may also be indicated in patients with HIV displaying gastrointestinal symptoms Malabsorptive syndromes other than celiac disease
How is a capsule endoscopy performed?,"'Capsule endoscopy is usually performed by a ''gastroenterologist'' as an outpatient procedure. It is noninvasive and requires no sedation.' The patient must not eat or drink anything for 12 hours prior to the procedure. The patient may have to take laxatives to ensure that the digestive tract is clear of gastric contents. The patient may go through imaging tests to ensure there are no strictures or obstructions in the bowel. The doctor attaches eight antennas to the abdominal skin, connected to a recorder worn around the patient’s waist. The patient swallows the capsule endoscope with a little water. The capsule sends two images per second as it passes through the gastrointestinal tract. The patient may drink liquids two hours after swallowing the capsule and eat after four hours. The batteries in the capsule endoscope last for eight hours and the antennas and recorder will be removed after that period. The patient will be able to go through normal daily activities during the period. The capsule will be excreted along with stools normally. The recorded images will be analyzed by the doctor for abnormalities."
How long does it take to pass a capsule endoscopy?,"'The time taken by the capsule endoscope to pass through the ''digestive system'' varies from individual to individual. It may take 8-72 hours, or in some cases, even a week or two.' "
What are the limitations of capsule endoscopy?,"'Capsule endoscopy has a few limitations such as' Slow transit, resulting in incomplete examination before battery failure Rapid transit resulting in blurred images Getting stuck in strictures or obstructions Unsuitability for therapeutic purposes such asremoving polypsextracting tissue for biopsytreating bleeding sites removing polyps extracting tissue for biopsy treating bleeding sites"
Is capsule endoscopy safe?,'Capsule endoscopy is a safe and well-tolerated procedure for most people. It is the safest non-invasive diagnostic tool currently available for examining the small intestine.' 
What are the complications of a capsule endoscopy?,"'Capsule endoscopy has few risks. It is safe for even children and the elderly. The procedure’s main risk is the capsule’s retention in the bowel, which may''Retention of the capsule is primarily due to existing stricture or obstruction of the bowel.\xa0''These conditions can be detected by having the patient first swallow a similar-sized capsule (patency capsule) that dissolves in 40 hours. The decision to perform capsule endoscopy can be made based on whether the patency capsule passes out or dissolves in 40 hours.' cause bleeding necessitate surgery for removal"
What is cervical cryosurgery?,"'Cervical cryotherapy is a medical procedure that uses extremely cold temperatures for freezing and destroying the abnormal tissue in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the womb (uterus) that opens in the birth canal or vagina. Cervical cryosurgery may be done for the removal of any abnormal tissue (such as ''precancerous'' areas or mass of abnormal cells in the cervix) or to control bleeding. Removing the pre-cancerous tissue from the cervix may help prevent ''cervical cancer''. Cervical cryosurgery may also be done to treat inflammation or swelling of the uterus called cervicitis. The procedure is relatively safe and ''pain''-free. Most women experience mild ''cramps'' or a sensation of cold in their vagina. There may, however, be some risks associated such as follows:''Severe scarring, although rare, may cause difficulty in ''getting pregnant''. Scarring may also cause cramps during menstrual periods.' Bleeding Infections Mild scarring"
How is cervical cryosurgery done?,"'How it is done:' Cryotherapy is usually done as an outpatient procedure in the doctor’s office, clinic, or outpatient settings of a hospital. The patient can generally go home the same day. Before the procedure, the doctor will explain to the patient the risks associated with the procedure. They will take their detailed medical history, do a physical examination, and order investigations as needed. Pain medications, such as ibuprofen, may be given an hour before the procedure to reduce pain. The patient will be asked to take off their clothes below their waist and covered in a drape. The patient lies in the lithotomy position (lies on their back on the examination table with their feet raised and supported by footrests or stirrups). The doctor may numb the area before starting the procedure. The doctor will then insert a lubricated tool called a speculum into the patient’s vagina to gently spread the vaginal walls and examine the cervix. They will then insert a device, called a cryoprobe, inside the patient’s vagina.  The cryoprobe is firmly placed on the abnormal tissue in the cervix. The probe has liquid nitrogen circulating through it. This makes it cold enough to freeze and destroy the abnormal tissue. Temperatures as low as −20°C may be used in the procedure. There is the formation of an “ice ball” on the cervix that kills the abnormal cells. The procedure involves cyclic freezing and thawing. The freezing phase lasts for around three minutes. This is followed by thawing the tissue for five minutes. Finally, freezing is repeated for another three minutes. "
What is cervical laminectomy?,"'A cervical laminectomy is a surgical procedure performed on the cervical (neck) region of the spine. The spinal canal is protected by a series of bones called vertebrae. A part of each vertebra bone called the lamina abuts the lamina of adjacent vertebrae to form a bony, flexible tube (spinal canal).''In a cervical laminectomy, the laminae of a cervical vertebra are removed to widen the spinal canal and relieve the pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.' "
Is cervical laminectomy a major surgery?,"'A cervical laminectomy can take1 to 3 hours to perform. It is a major spine surgery in a sensitive location on the backbone. It is usually performed only when symptoms are not relieved with non-invasive therapies such as:''It is generally considered a safe surgery, especially with the current technological advancements in the field of spinal surgery.' rest pain relievers physical therapy epidural or nerve sheath injections"
When is a cervical laminectomy performed?,"'The spinal cord and spinal nerves run through the spinal canal formed by the laminae. When this space narrows, it compresses the spinal cord and irritates the nerve roots. This may result in conditions known as ''radiculopathy'' or myelopathy, which cause:''A cervical laminectomy relieves ''nerve compression'' caused by\xa0 spinal canal narrowing. It may be useful for patients with:''Cigarette smoking'', frequent lifting, and diving are additional risk factors for cervical myelopathy.' pain weakness numbness tingling difficulty walking loss of bladder and bowel control degenerative disc disease arthritis spinal stenosis cervical spondylosis bulging or prolapsed disc bone spurs in the spine trauma to the spine"
How is a cervical laminectomy performed?,"'An orthopedic surgeon or neurosurgeon performs the cervical laminectomy under general anesthesia.\xa0' The patient undergoes blood and imaging tests prior to the surgery.  The patient must stop taking blood thinners, have nothing to eat or drink 8 hours prior to surgery, and check with the doctor before taking any regular medications.  The patient lies flat on their abdomen during the procedure. The anesthetist administers the anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the surgery. The surgeon makes an incision in the skin over the cervical vertebra that requires laminectomy. The surgeon removes a section of the vertebra called lamina. Where possible, they may just cut one side of the lamina to widen the space for spinal nervous tissue. The surgeon may also remove bone spur and damaged disc tissue. Sometimes the surgeon may also fuse two or more vertebrae to provide stability. The surgeon closes the incisions with sutures. The anesthesiologist brings the patient out of anesthesia and keeps them under observation until stable. The patient may be discharged in two or three days."
How long does it take to recover from a cervical laminectomy?,"'Post-surgery the patient is encouraged to walk within a day or two, and slowly increase activities as tolerated.\xa0''The patient may require a neck brace to support the neck while healing for two to six weeks, depending on the number of vertebrae operated upon.' Patients should avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities during recovery. Physical therapy and rehabilitation might be required after healing is complete. Patients should be able to resume normal activities in six to eight weeks."
What are the risks and complications of a cervical laminectomy?,"'Cervical laminectomy is generally a safe procedure and most people heal from it with no significant problem. As with any major surgical procedure, cervical laminectomy has risks that include:' anesthesia side effects like headache, nausea and confusion infection at the surgery site bleeding and blood clots injury to spinal cord, nerve roots or blood vessels leakage of cerebrospinal fluid failure of surgery to provide symptom relief aggravation of original symptoms kyphosis or excessive curve of the spine loss of bowel and bladder control, and impotence rarely, stroke and paralysis"
How dangerous is a cervical laminectomy?,"'Major complications from a cervical laminectomy are unusual, but do occur as listed above. Advancement in medical technology and surgical techniques have resulted in reducing risks to a great extent. About 90 percent of patients come out of the surgery with no complications.' "
What is the success rate of a cervical laminectomy?,'Studies indicate that a majority of patients have symptom relief after a cervical laminectomy. The success of the procedure also depends on the degree of the patient’s disease. The surgery decompresses the spinal canal and relieves the pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.\xa0 It is not a cure for underlying disease like arthritis or degenerative disc disease.' 
What is chickenpox?,"'Chickenpox'' is a disease is caused by a virus (''varicella zoster virus'', ''varicella'', or VZV) that results in a ''blister''-like ''rash'' with intense ''itching'', ''tiredness'', and ''fever''. In normal individuals without immune system problems, ''chickenpox'' usually will last about five to 10 days and then resolve. Before vaccination was available, about 4 million people (mainly children) were infected each year. Once infected, the virus can remain dormant in nerve cells and after many years (in adults about 50 years old or older) the virus can be reactivated to cause the condition known as zoster (''shingles'').' "
Is chickenpox contagious?,"'Chickenpox'' is highly ''contagious'' and easily passed from person to person by direct contact (saliva, kissing) and indirect contact with blister fluid that touches objects like toys or utensils. In addition, ''chickenpox'' can be transmitted by contaminated droplets produced during ''coughing'' and ''sneezing''. For those individuals who develop zoster (''shingles''), the fluid formed in ''blisters'' that arise during the disease is also ''contagious'' for ''chickenpox''.''Chickenpox is not contagious from humans to ''dogs'' or other pets; chickenpox is a disease mainly confined to humans.' "
How will someone know that he or she has chickenpox?,"'Although chickenpox is usually thought of as a childhood disease, anyone who has not been vaccinated or infected can get the disease. Even about 25%-30% of those vaccinated may still get a mild form of the disease if exposed. About one to two days before characteristic ''blisters'' develop, individuals usually have a high ''fever'', ''headache'', ''loss of appetite'', and are somewhat lethargic. The ''rash'' that develops quickly produces fluid-filled ''blisters'' that usually appear first on the chest and face and then spread to the rest of the body. This is when chickenpox is usually clinically diagnosed; lab tests are seldom used to diagnose the disease. Blisters usually last about one week before all of them form scabs.' "
How is chickenpox transmitted?,"'Chickenpox is spread easily through the air in contaminated droplets produced by ''coughing'' and ''sneezing''. Contact with secretions (''mucus'', blister fluid, for example) either directly by touching secretions or indirectly (if the secretions contaminate toys, utensils, and other objects) can result in spread of chickenpox. In addition, blister fluid produced in individuals who have ''shingles'' also can spread ''varicella'' virus, the cause of chickenpox, to anyone who is susceptible (unvaccinated individuals).' "
How will someone know when he or she is cured of chickenpox?,"'Once a person acquires the chickenpox infection, there is no cure because in most people, the virus remains in a dormant form within the nerve cells. These dormant ''viruses'' are responsible for the disease ''shingles'' (zoster).''However, the closest thing to a cure is the ''chickenpox vaccine'' that can render the vaccinated person immune to this virus for many years. If the immune system in an individual weakens, it is possible for the individual who was vaccinated in childhood to develop ''shingles'', but even ''shingles'' may be prevented by giving older adults a ''vaccine'' specifically designed to prevent ''shingles''.''A variation of the answer to knowing when someone is ""cured"" of chickenpox would be to ask when a person with chickenpox or ''shingles'' is no longer contagious. Individuals are contagious during the incubation period (one to two days before symptoms and signs develop) and then for about an additional seven to 10 days (when all of the blisters have crusted over). For shingles, the disease becomes contagious when the blisters begin to form and becomes noncontagious after all the blisters have developed crusts.' "
When should someone contact a medical provider about chickenpox?,"'Most children with chickenpox do well and recover on their own without specific treatment. However, a medical ''caregiver'' may need to be contacted if the symptoms are severe or if someone is at high risk for complications. For example, ''pregnant'' women, others who have weakened immune systems, and very young infants are at risk for complications. Complications of chickenpox may include the following:''Individuals with shingles may need to contact medical caregivers for treatment and ''pain'' control; if shingles appears on the face especially near the eye, a medical ''caregiver'' and/or ophthalmologist should be contacted immediately.'  Dehydration Pneumonia Bone and joint infections Toxic shock syndrome and/or sepsis Meningitis Secondary skin infections Bone and/or joint infections Bleeding problems"
Is chlamydia contagious?,"'Chlamydia'' is a ''contagious'' ''STD'' (''sexually transmitted disease''). ''Chlamydia'' bacteria cause the most common ''STD'' in United States. Approximately 3,000,000 women and men become infected every year. Chlamydia is most common among women and men under the age of 25. Chlamydia is caused by the gram-negative bacteria from the genus ''Chlamydia'' (''C. trachomatis''; there are several other species). The organisms are thought to have originated about 700 million years ago and coevolved with mammalian cells so that the genome of the organism could utilize the chemical reactions inside human cells.' "
What is the incubation period for chlamydia?,"'Unfortunately, the majority of men and women with chlamydia do not have symptoms. Therefore, they do not know they have the disease. The incubation period for chlamydia is quite variable and may range from days to months after the initial exposure. The average time from exposure to the development of symptoms is usually about one to three weeks after sexual contact with an infected person.' "
What are chlamydia symptoms and signs?,"'The signs and ''symptoms of chlamydia'' infections in women are usually irritation in the genital tract, ''vaginal discharge'', and ''pain'' with urination'' (cervicitis and urethritis). In men, chlamydia is characterized by pain with urination, ''urinary frequency'', and urethral discharge (urethritis). Other symptoms may develop, such as rectal irritation (proctitis), eye infections, and ''infertility''. Women can also develop chronic ''pelvic pain'', salpingitis, and ''endometritis''. ''Pregnant'' women infected with chlamydia can have ectopic ''pregnancies'', preterm ''labor'', preterm delivery, and their newborns can get ''conjunctivitis'', ''otitis media'', and ''pneumonia''.' "
How long is the contagious period for chlamydia?,"'Infection with chlamydia is relatively easy to cure with antibiotics. Treatment protocols for uncomplicated chlamydial infections include a single 1-gram dose of oral ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'', ''Zmax''). Another treatment option is 100 mg of ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox'', Acticlate, Doryx) orally twice a day for seven days. During ''pregnancy'', ''erythromycin'' (''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', ''E.E.S'', ''EryPed'', ''PCE'') or ''amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'', ''Trimox'', ''Moxatag'', ''Larotid'') is often used. After beginning treatment, most physicians suggest that patients with uncomplicated chlamydial infections (cervicitis, urethritis, and/or proctitis) are no longer contagious after about seven days. Tests that detect chlamydia in the urine and in other secretions are available.' "
How does chlamydia spread?,"'Chlamydia is transmitted by sexual contact with the penis, vagina, anus and/or rectal area, and mouth of the infected individual. Occasionally, if the eyes are infected, ''ocular'' secretions may contain transmissible bacteria. The organisms are simply transmitted by contact, usually by direct physical contact. Chlamydia bacteria are easily spread. They spread from females to males and vice versa through sexual contact.' "
When should someone seek medical care for chlamydia?,"'The most urgent time to seek medical care for a chlamydial infection is when an individual is pregnant and has had recent sexual exposure to an infected individual and/or has developed early symptoms of a chlamydial infection. Additionally, if individuals are experiencing any symptoms of chlamydial infections, they should seek medical care quickly. Sexual partners should be notified if they have had recent contact with an infected individual.''Patients with ''gonorrhea'' (''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'', causative agent of ''gonorrhea'') have a 30%-50% chance of being coinfected with chlamydia. However, the reverse is not true. Patients with chlamydial infections have a less than 1% chance of being coinfected with ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''.' "
What is cholera?,"'Cholera'' is an infectious disease caused by bacteria named ''Vibrio'' cholerae''. Cholera causes profuse ''diarrhea'' episodes and ''vomiting''. The cause of cholera are toxins secreted by the ''Vibrio cholerae'' bacteria. Microscopically, these bacteria appear curved (comma-shaped) and have a negative Gram stain. Cholera causes severe loss of fluid and ''electrolytes'' from the body due to ''vomiting'' and profuse ''diarrhea''. Less frequently, some people infected have few or no symptoms. If fluids and electrolytes are not restored to the individual, more severe symptoms, including ''dehydration'' and ''shock'', may occur quickly (about 12-48 hours). Death occurs in about 15%-20% of patients who develop severe symptoms and signs.' "
Is cholera contagious?,'Cholera is highly ''contagious''. Cholera can be transferred person to person by infected fecal matter entering a mouth or by water or food contaminated with ''Vibrio cholerae'' bacteria. The organisms can survive well in salty waters and can contaminate humans and other organisms that contact or swim in the water.' 
What is the incubation period for cholera?,"'The time period from exposure to the bacteria until the development of symptoms (incubation period) is relatively short for cholera, varying from about 12 hours to five days. Most people develop symptoms of watery ''diarrhea'' (termed ""rice-water stools"") with frequent stooling. More severe symptoms include frequent vomiting, rapid heart rate, dry mucous membranes, ''muscle cramps'', restlessness, ''thirst'', loss of skin elasticity, and ''low blood pressure''. As symptoms progress, some patients can develop ''kidney failure'' and/or hypovolemic shock. Detection of cholera is simple with testing of ''stool'' samples with a special dipstick. Examination of the watery diarrhea for characteristic ''Vibrio'' bacteria (comma-shaped bacteria) by microscopy can be helpful. Subsequent culture of the organisms from ''stool'' samples will confirm preliminary dipstick and microscopic identification.' "
How does cholera spread?,"'Cholera is spread many ways. Cholera bacteria can survive in areas outside the body and can easily contaminate water sources and food. In addition, individuals with the disease produce large numbers of ''Vibrio'' bacteria in their stools that can contaminate other people, as well as clothing, sheets, and many other items in the home. The usual spread of ''Vibrio cholerae'' bacteria is by infected fecal matter entering the mouth.' "
When does the contagious period for cholera end?,"'A person is no longer contagious for cholera when they have no cholera symptoms and no detectable ''Vibrio'' bacteria in their stools. Cholera, in general, usually lasts about one week, unless severe symptoms develop. Although a person may be no longer contagious for cholera, the infection does not provide enough immunity to prevent the person from coming down with cholera again if reexposed to the bacteria.' "
When should someone seek medical care for cholera?,"'Anyone who thinks they might have been exposed to cholera, especially if they have early symptoms of the disease, should seek medical care emergently. Do not wait until symptoms become more severe. The earlier fluids and electrolytes are replenished, the more likely the individual will not develop severe symptoms, have a prolonged hospital stay, or die.' "
Is circumcision good or bad?,"'The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) states that there is insufficient scientific evidence to justify ''circumcision'' in young boys. Many new parents are a little skeptical about whether to have their ''newborn'' son circumcised. This is often a sensitive debate in some cultures. It has been performed for 6,000 years in a religious context and is currently the most common operation performed in men in the United States, but it remains controversial.''In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Programme on ''Human Immunodeficiency virus''/''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''HIV/AIDS'') (UNAIDS) jointly recommended circumcision in men for protection against ''HIV'' infection.''In a 2012 report, AAP stated that the benefits of circumcision, such as the ''prevention'' of urinary infection that can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss, outweigh the risks. It states that any health benefits of circumcision are not great enough to recommend it as a routine procedure for all newborn boys.''Other claimed health benefits, including protection against ''HIV/AIDS'', ''genital herpes'', ''genital warts'' and ''penile cancer'', are still questionable. It does not represent convincing reasons for surgery before boys are old enough to decide for themselves.''Your doctor or pediatrician may inform you about the health benefits and risks of circumcision in newborns without bias. Sometimes, your doctor may advise you not to circumcise your newborn due to certain medical conditions such as hypospadias (urinary opening is at the wrong place) and prematurity (until the baby becomes healthy enough).''Circumcision before the age of consent is not a very appropriate health-promotion strategy when there are more effective and less ethically problematic alternatives. However, circumcision in older men shows a higher risk of complications.''Moreover, it is important for both circumcised and uncircumcised men to maintain good genital hygiene and for uncircumcised men to regularly and gently wash the area under their foreskin to prevent possible infections. Using ''condoms'' during sex can help both circumcised and uncircumcised men to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections.''Ultimately parents should make a decision on whether circumcision is in the best interest of their son. The decision should be totally personal and they should weigh medical information in the context of their religious, ethical and cultural beliefs.' "
What does circumcision mean?,"'At birth, boys are born with a hood of skin (foreskin/prepuce) that covers the tip of the penis (glans). In circumcision, this foreskin is surgically removed, exposing the tip of the penis.''Usually, circumcision is performed by doctors in the first few days of life. For circumcision, the infant must be stable and healthy. It may be riskier if done later in life.' "
Is circumcision painful?,"'Yes, circumcision is painful. However, some effective and safe ''pain'' relievers can make it tolerable. American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) has recommended some ''pain'' relievers to be used to reduce pain from circumcision.''Your doctor may use local anesthetics during the operation to make it less painful for the baby' A topical cream that is applied on the penis and left for at least 20 to 40 minutes before starting the procedure. An anesthetic injection that is immediately effective and works for a slightly longer period. Sometimes, your doctor may give acetaminophen in addition to anesthesia, which helps to lessen the discomfort during and several hours after the procedure."
What are the complications?,'See your pediatrician if' A botched circumcision Pain Inflammation Infection Your baby does not urinate normally within six to eight hours after the procedure. Bleeding does not stop. There is worsening of redness around the tip of the penis after three to five days. There is a yellowish discharge that lasts more than a week.
Should pregnant women stop consuming coffee?,"'American Dietetic Association (ADA) advises women to limit coffee consumption to less than 300 mg/day during pregnancy (one to two cups a day). Many gynecologists advise complete cessation of coffee intake during pregnancy and ''breastfeeding''. If this is not possible, they advise limiting coffee intake to one cup/day.''Consumption of coffee in ''pregnant'' women may cause the following complications:''There is insufficient evidence to support the belief that coffee causes developmental defects in the unborn.' A slightly increased risk of miscarriage Increased chances of premature delivery Low birth weight babies Increased blood pressure in susceptible women"
What are the ill effects of excess coffee consumption?,"'Individuals who consume four or more cups of coffee daily are considered heavy coffee users. They may report symptoms such as feeling jittery, anxious, and ''palpitations'' and may have ''hand tremors''.''Long-term heavy coffee usage causes the following health issues:' Poor bone health: Excess coffee can cause vitamin D deficiency in the body and adversely affect calcium absorption in the bones. It can increase fracture risk in older people. Heart problems: Some individuals are more susceptible to this effect of coffee than others. They experience skipped beats or rapid heartbeats on drinking coffee. The sudden increase in blood pressure after drinking coffee may be harmful in those with a weak heart. Studies have reported that some people develop arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats) due to excess coffee consumption (more than 400 mg per day or four cups a day). Most of these have an underlying cardiac disease. There have been reports of sudden cardiac deaths after drinking more than 10 cups of coffee per day. If coffee is taken with cream and sugar, this may add to excess fats and calories in the diet causing abnormally high lipid levels. Drug reactions: Coffee can reduce the efficiency of calcium and iron tablets in the body by hindering their absorption from the stomach. Asthma medicines such as acebrophylline and doxofylline can react with coffee and cause nausea and palpitations. A medicine called stiripentol (for convulsions) can have serious side effects if taken with coffee, and these patients must completely avoid coffee intake. Caffeine intake along with bupropion (antidepressant medicine), ciprofloxacin (antibiotic), linezolid (antibiotic), and tizanidine (muscle relaxant) can increase nervousness, sleeplessness, heart-pounding, and anxiety. Coffee and children: Pediatricians specifically prohibit caffeine consumption in children. Coffee has been linked to hyperactive behavior, irritability, sleep disturbances, and acid reflux in children. If a child complains of fatigue, it is important to visit a specialist and find out the cause of exhaustion at this age rather than giving them coffee to perk up. The exact effects of coffee on a developing brain are still being studied. Coffee consumption may also worsen problems such as urinary incontinence, insomnia, acidity, and tremors in adults. To conclude, moderation is the key to coffee consumption."
What is colitis?,"'This information serves only as an introduction and to classify the major types of colitis that are\xa0mainly ''contagious'' or as not ''contagious''.'  Colitis is a general term that can mean inflammation of the colon; however, more recently the term colitis has been used to includeenteritis,proctitis, andinflammatory bowel disease (IBD). enteritis, proctitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There are many different causes of colitis, so the best way to answer questions about colitis is to determine what type of colitis you want information about."
Is colitis contagious?,"'This list of some conditions that are often termed ""colitis,"" but have different underlying causes that make them classifiable as either contagious or non-contagious. Some terms related to colitis subsets, just like the term ""colitis,"" have multiple causes that result in the condition being either contagious or not contagious:' Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): subsets;Crohn's disease (not contagious)Ulcerative colitis (not contagious) Crohn's disease (not contagious) Ulcerative colitis (not contagious) Allergic colitis: not contagious Ischemic colitis: not contagious Immune deficiency disorders (many types): not contagious Necrotizing enterocolitis: not contagious Microscopic colitis: not contagious Pseudomembranous colitis: contagious Infectious colitis: Many bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic types, and most are contagious, but a few are not contagious. C. difficile colitis: contagious Bacterial colitis: contagious Indeterminate colitis: (not known)"
How do you know that you have colitis?,"'Although symptoms vary greatly depending on the type of colitis, almost every type of colitis has the symptoms of abdominal discomfort, ''diarrhea'' and/or ''pain''. Other symptoms may vary with the type of colitis and may include:''Individuals with some of these symptoms are likely to need a health-care professional to order tests (blood, fecal and/or imaging tests such as X-ray, ''CT scan'', and possibly other tests) to diagnose the type of colitis.''If a person has ''diarrhea'' that does not resolve in a few days, ''blood in the stool'', increasing abdominal discomfort and/or ''pain'' or early signs of ''dehydration'' they should seek medical care immediately or death can occur.''Symptoms of dehydration'' include'   nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, and severe abdominal cramping, low or no urine output (decreased urination), bloody diarrhea, tarry stools, severe abdominal pain, or constant nausea and vomiting."
How does colitis spread?,"   Contagious types of colitis are spread from person-to-person, but non-contagious types of colitis are not. Contagious types of colitis are usually spread by direct person-to-person contact, usually by the hands (fecal/oral), but others may be spread by contaminated food or fluids, and for some types, indirectly by contact with contaminated items like clothing, utensils, or toothbrushes."
Is there a cure for colitis?,"""Some types of colitis, like Crohn's disease or ""'microscopic colitis'', have no known cure to date. Other types of colitis\xa0like bacterial-caused ''enteritis'', can be ""cured"", often with the use of certain antibiotics.''You and your doctor need to first discuss the ''type of colitis you have'' (just saying that you have colitis is not specific enough of a diagnosis for a doctor), and then discuss your treatment and possible ""cure"" if any, for the specific type of colitis.'  "
Is colonoscopy painful?,"'Modern techniques of ''colonoscopy'' are not painful or uncomfortable. The person being examined is given sedation to make them relaxed and not feel any ''pain'' during the procedure. The modern-day colonoscopes are thin and flexible, which makes the procedure comfortable for the person being examined.''You may feel some pressure as the ''colonoscope'' moves inside the bowel. There may be brief ''cramps'' and ''gas'' pains when air is inserted or the colonoscope is advanced. This lasts for a short while and one can get relief by passing gas.' "
What is a colonoscopy?,"'Colonoscopy is a medical procedure to examine the inside of the large bowel (colon). It is done with the help of a long, thin, and flexible tube-like instrument that carries a camera and a light source at one end (colonoscope). A colonoscopy is a common procedure done on an outpatient basis. It helps to diagnose various bowel (gastrointestinal) conditions presenting as bleeding, ''abdominal pain'', or change in bowel habits. A piece of tissue (biopsy) can also be removed with the help of the colonoscope for diagnostic purposes. Removal of ''colorectal'' polyps (small clumps of tissue formed in the inner lining of the large bowel) can also be done with the help of colonoscopy. The removal of polyps is essential as they may later turn into ''colon cancer''.' "
How is a colonoscopy done?,"'Colonoscopy may be done at the doctor’s office or in the outpatient department of a medical center or hospital.''Before the procedure''Your doctor may:''During the test''After the procedure''You may feel mild\xa0cramps in the abdomen\xa0and pass a lot of gas. There may be some ''bloating'' or the feeling of being sick to your stomach. This will soon go away.''You will be able to go home about an hour after the test. You will need someone’s help to take you home due to the effect of ''sedatives''.' Order some blood tests and imaging studies (such as X-ray, CT scan, and MRI) Ask you about any chronic health conditions Ask you about any medications that you are on Ask about any allergies that you may have Explain the procedure in detail, including possible complications, and address your doubts and concerns related to it Obtain your written consent Explain to you the steps for bowel cleansing (bowel preparation). The steps for bowel preparation include: Using enemas Not eating solid foods for 1 to 3 days before the test Taking laxatives Ask you to drink plenty of clear liquids for 1 to 3 days before the test. Clear fluids include water, clear coffee or tea, gelatin, fat-free bouillon or broth, sports drinks without added color, and strained fruit juices You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. An intravenous line will be attached, and sedative will be administered. This will make you comfortable and pain-free during the procedure. You will lie on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. The doctor will gently insert the colonoscope through the anus. The colonoscope will be slowly advanced up to the lowest part of the small bowel. Air is inserted through the colonoscope for a better view of the inside. Suction may be done for removing fluid or stool. The scope will be slowly moved out as the doctor examines the inside of the bowel while withdrawing it. Your doctor may remove small tissue samples (biopsy) or polyps using tiny tools inserted through the colonoscope. Therapeutic procedures, such as laser therapy, may be done if needed during the procedure. Photographs of the inside of the bowel may be taken by the camera at the end of the colonoscope."
What is a craniotomy?,"'Craniotomy is a procedure in which a neurosurgeon surgically removes a section of the skull in order to gain access to the brain. The portion of skull removed is called a “bone flap,” which is often placed back in its original position after the operation is completed. The bone flap is typically fastened into place with low-profile titanium plates and screws. When the surgeon does not replace the bone flap for some reason, it is called a “craniectomy.”''A craniotomy guided by ''MRI''-based navigational software is called a “stereotactic craniotomy.” Stereotactic craniotomy is usually the standard procedure in planned surgeries. With improvement in navigational software accuracy and surgical techniques, surgeons choose to do minimally invasive keyhole craniotomies when possible.''A less invasive method is a “burr hole” craniotomy in which the surgeon drills a hole in the skull. This provides a limited view and may be used for draining cerebrospinal fluid, draining blood from a hemorrhage, and to relieve pressure on the brain (intracranial pressure). The burr hole may also be used as a port for an endoscope, so the surgeon is able to determine a further course of action during the procedure.' "
When is a craniotomy performed?,"'A neurosurgeon performs a craniotomy to access the brain for surgery. The surgery maybe involve the following:''A craniotomy maybe required for the following surgeries:''Biopsy or resection of abnormal brain tissue' brain tissue, blood vessels in the brain, meninges  (the membranes covering the brain) skull bone Clipping of a cerebral aneurysm Resection of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) Removal of brain abscess Resection of brain tumor Draining of hematoma Treatment of epilepsy Placing implants such as a shunt, brain stimulator or electrodes for seizure monitoring Removing pressure on tiny blood vessels for conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia Repair of skull fracture Relieving elevated intracranial pressure (craniectomy)"
How serious is crainotomy surgery?,"'Craniotomy, like any surgical operation, carries its particular risks. Craniotomy is primarily a means to an end, so the seriousness of complications may depend mostly on the location on the brain and the type of surgery performed. Despite potential complications, a craniotomy may save lives, and individuals with no other pre-existing conditions are likely to recover fully with good care and treatment.''The following are some of the risks with craniotomy that are common to any surgery:''Some of the specific complications that can arise post-craniotomy are:''Some individuals, depending on the location, site of surgery, and pre-existing medical conditions prior to surgery might encounter:''In patients with certain medical conditions the risks are higher, and the surgeon might decide on surgery only if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks. The following factors increase the risks involved in a craniotomy and brain surgery in some patients:''Many of the risks associated with a craniotomy have been minimized with pre-procedure blood tests, advanced imaging technologies, improved surgical techniques, postoperative care and medications.' bleeding infections blood clots reaction to anesthesia pneumonia unstable blood pressure myocardial infarction cerebral bleeding or hematoma at the surgical site seizures due to disruption of normal brain tissue stroke due to damage to a blood vessel cerebrospinal fluid leak brain swelling infection at the surgical site air within the cranium (pneumocephalus) introduced through the craniotomy site, which may cause confusion, lethargy, headache, seizures, and nausea/vomiting speech problems memory issues poor balance and coordination paralysis coma advanced age cardiopulmonary disease poor functional health systemic collapse due to sepsis or multi-organ failure"
What is Crohn's disease?,"""Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bowels, mainly involving the small and large ""'intestines'"". Additionally, Crohn's disease may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Crohn's disease has many subtypes depending on where it is in the body, such as Crohn's ""'colitis'"", Crohn's ""'ileitis'"", Crohn's enterocolitis, and others. The most common symptoms and signs of Crohn's disease of any type are ""'abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', ''vomiting'', ''fever'', and ''weight loss''.''The inflammation in the bowel can cause shallow erosions and ulcer-like lesions. Some individuals have deep large ulcers that can result in scarring, ''stiffness'', and narrowing of the bowel. Occasionally, these lesions can result in complications such as bowel obstruction or even infections in the abdominal ''cavity'' (''peritonitis'') if the ulcers penetrate the bowel wall.'""Individuals with Crohn's disease experience cycles of remission and relapse of their symptoms and signs.""""The exact cause of Crohn's disease is not known, but it is felt to be an autoimmune disease by some experts while other researchers suggest genetics may also have a role in triggering the disease.""  "
What are the early symptoms and signs of Crohn's disease?,"""Crohn's disease patients have symptoms of""""However, these symptoms and signs are not specific to Crohn's disease, so an evaluation by a physician with laboratory testing, imaging, and ""'colonoscopy'' are often used to diagnose the disease.'""It is not unusual for Crohn's disease patients to initially have blood tests, ""'stool'' studies, and abdominal ''X-rays'' done to begin to rule out other problems.''Other studies such as ''CT scans'' and ''MRI'"" imaging may show details of the bowel wall, such as thickening or ulceration that may suggest Crohn's disease. However, the endoscopic and/or colonoscopic visualization and biopsy of intestinal tissue is considered essential for ultimate diagnosis of Crohn's disease."" abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and weight loss."
Is Crohn's disease contagious?,"""Crohn's disease is not ""'contagious''. What causes the disease remains unknown, but investigators suspect there are genetic, immunologic, environmental, dietary, vascular, microbial, and even psychosocial factors that play roles in triggering or aggravating the disease.'""Risk factors for Crohn's disease include"" under 30 years of age, family history of the disease, white and/or Jewish ethnicity, cigarette smoking and living in a city with a “northern” climate, and eating a diet that includes fatty foods and refined or processed foods."
How does someone get Crohn's disease?,"'You cannot ""get"" Crohn\'s disease from another person. However, it may spread in an individual\'s gastrointestinal tract. The cause of the spread is usually due to whatever factors precipitated the ''inflammatory bowel disease''. The spread of the disease in the individual may be reduced by methods such as anti-inflammatory medications, medications to reduce ''diarrhea'', nutritional therapy to reduce exposure to possible food irritants, and even surgical intervention.' "
Can Crohn's disease be cured?,"""Unfortunately, to date, there is no cure for Crohn's disease. However, many individuals, with appropriate medications, ""'diet'"", and lifestyle can reduce the frequency and the intensity of Crohn's disease. Some individuals may do well and have no recurrent episodes of Crohn's disease for long periods, but they are not considered cured of the disease."" "
When should you call your doctor if you have Crohn's disease?,"""Any increase the severity and frequency of signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease should trigger a visit to a physician. Similarly, if someone starts to ""'lose weight'' and/or has ''diarrhea'' episodes for more than two weeks, he or she should contact a physician. Individuals who have the following symptoms or signs should see a physician urgently or go to an emergency department:'  No passage of gas Repeated vomiting and no bowel movements Severe abdominal pain and/or bloating Bloody stools and/or pus draining from the rectum Dehydration Fever and/or shaking chills Rapid heartbeat and/or dizziness or fainting"
What is croup?,"'Croup'' is infectious inflammation of the larynx and trachea usually in children. ''Croup'' typically interferes with ''breathing'' and causes a barking ''cough''. The individual may be without a ''fever'' or have a low-grade ''fever''. ''Viruses'' usually cause the inflammation of the larynx (voice box and vocal cords), trachea (windpipe), and/or bronchi that is characteristic of ''croup''. Common ''viruses'' involved include parainfluenza types 1, 2, 3, ''adenovirus'', and ''respiratory syncytial virus'' (or RSV) although many other viral types may also cause croup; even a bacterium, ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'', may occasionally cause the disease. Croup occurs mainly in children 6 months to 3 years of age, although older children and adults can be infected. Another type of croup is spasmodic croup. Spasmodic croup is almost identical to croup, but it is caused by an ''allergic reaction''. Spasmodic croup occurs far less frequently than ""croup"" and has the same features, except it is not ''contagious''.' "
Is croup contagious?,"'Croup is very ''contagious''. It is spread by airborne droplets usually from an infected child to another child or adult. Croup viruses can be transferred to ''pregnant'' women, but the viruses that cause croup should not affect the fetus. However, ''pregnant'' women may have more serious symptoms with croup than non-pregnant women.' "
How is croup transmitted?,"'Croup is a very common ailment in children (average age is about 2 years old) and is considered to be highly contagious to other children. The viruses that cause group are easily spread through the air by ''mucus'' droplets during ''sneezing'' or ''coughing'', through direct person-to-person contact, as well as by indirect contact when items such as toys, utensils, cups, and other objects have contaminated mucus on them from an infected child.' "
How long is croup contagious?,'Croup may be contagious during the incubation period and for about seven to 10 days after symptoms develop.' 
What is the incubation period for croup?,"'The incubation period for croup is relatively short. After exposure to the virus, symptoms of croup usually develop two to three days that may extend to seven days after exposure to viruses that cause the disease.' "
How will someone know if he or she is infected with croup?,"'Croup causes a ''cough'' that sounds like a bark of a seal or a dog. Children with croup often have some trouble ''breathing'' because the ''airway'' is narrowed in this disease and breathing produces a sound (stridor) as air passes back and forth. Fortunately, many children (and adults) who get croup have very mild symptoms, and the disease resembles more of a bad ''cold'' with ''congestion''. Croup is usually diagnosed simply by the doctor listening for the barking ''cough'"" and stridor. However, sometimes other conditions can lead to similar symptoms, and occasionally a physician will order an X-ray of the child's neck to determine ""'airway'' narrowing (steeple or pencil sign).' "
How long does croup last?,"""Care of a child with croup involves decreasing the child's symptoms. Croup symptoms usually last for about three to seven days with the most severe symptoms at days two and three. Gradually, the symptoms abate and the child is usually cured of the disease in about a week; some patients exhibit symptoms for two weeks. Treatment of croup involves ""'corticosteroids'' and nebulized epinephrine; antibiotics are not usually prescribed because croup infection is viral.' "
When should someone seek medical care for croup?,"'Although many individuals with croup can be effectively cared for at home, the following list of symptoms suggest that a child should be seen emergently if these symptoms develop:'  Difficult, labored, or very rapid breathing Bluish or pale coloration around the mouth Loud stridor Difficulty swallowing Increasing or excessive drooling Dehydration (decreased urination, few or no tears, dry mouth, sunken eyes) A fatigued and/or sick appearance"
How is the curettage and electrodesiccation procedure done?,"'The procedure is done under local anesthesia. After the area is numbed, the doctor may shave off a part of the mass or lesion and send it away for lab examination (biopsy).''Curettage: ''The surgeon then ''scrapes'' at the remaining ''tumor'' with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curette till all the abnormal tissue is gone. The typical “feel” of squamous cell or ''basal cell carcinoma'' guides the doctor as to how much to scrape.''Electrodesiccation:'' A cautery is a small probe with an electric current ''running'' through it. The cautery is used to ''burn'' or destroy the tissue and seal bleeding vessels in the area. This entire process is called electrodesiccation.''Once the tumor is curetted away, the surgeon uses electrocautery to ''burn'' and seal the base of the ''wound'' formed during the curetting. He will also curette a surrounding rim of healthy tissue. This prevents bleeding of the area and seals the margins of the healthy tissue.''Once done, the site is bandaged with gauze and petroleum jelly.\xa0''Post-procedure care: ''You must keep the wound bandaged and dry. Daily dressings with petroleum jelly and gauze may be needed for up to two weeks. The wound will take three to six weeks to heal completely and will leave a ''scar''.' "
What are the pros and cons of the procedure?,"'The main advantage of the procedure is that it can be done in an outpatient setting and takes less than one hour. Other advantages are that no ''stitches'' are needed, and it is relatively inexpensive.''The disadvantages of the procedure are as follows:' The procedure leaves a cigarette burn-like scar. The scar may sometimes pain and ooze for up to six weeks after the procedure. The tumor may recur at the site, needing additional procedures. The procedure cannot be performed if the cancer is in the hair follicles, head, scalp, or anywhere in the midline of the face. We also cannot use this procedure to treat large, poorly defined, or recurrent tumors."
What does cystocele mean?,"'Cystocele means a prolapsed or dropped/fallen bladder (urine pouch). It is the bulging or dropping of the bladder into the woman’s vagina (the tube that connects the womb to outside the woman’s body).''It mostly occurs when the wall between a woman’s bladder and her vagina weakens due to''Mild prolapse often may not show any symptoms. However, if you have severe bladder prolapse, then you may experience''Mild bladder prolapse can be treated with conservative therapies such as''Surgery is the last option for women who are bothered by prolapse.'

Weakened vaginal muscles during menopause. A bulge in the vagina. Heaviness or fullness in the pelvic (groin) area. Difficulty starting a urine stream. Frequent or urgent urination. Urine leakage during sneezing or coughing. Incomplete emptying of the bladder. Discomfort while walking and standing for a long time. Dietary changes and laxatives. Physical therapy with Kegel exercises (pelvic floor muscle exercises). Pessary (insertion of a device into the vagina)."
What does cystocele repair mean?,"'Cystocele repair is a surgical procedure that is performed to repair the sinking of the vaginal wall or bulging of the bladder into the vagina.''The surgery may help to restore the normal position of your bladder and may reduce the pressure caused due to the bulging bladder onto your vagina. These surgeries are generally recommended in severe prolapse cases when physical therapy and medications do not resolve the condition. Surgery is generally done by taking a cut on the vagina or belly with basic three methods:' Anterior colporrhaphy: In this, the prolapsed bladder is repaired by making a cut on the vaginal surface and stitching the internal surface to strengthen the area. Paravaginal repair: It repairs the prolapsed bladder by attaching it to the pelvic sidewalls. Anterior colporrhaphy with graft: In this, a tissue graft is placed (if the tissue lining is very thin) along with stitches on the internal surface of the vagina."
What happens during the procedure?,"'Before the surgery,''During the surgery,' Your gynecologist (women’s specialist)/urologist (urine specialist) will examine your condition and identify the fallen bladder. They may discuss the symptoms to confirm the exact reason and may order some additional tests to assess any more damage to the urinary system. Under general anesthesia, an incision is made in the vaginal wall. The tissue between the bladder wall and the vaginal wall is tightened with stitches to allow the strengthening of the muscles and ligaments. Sometimes, extra tissue may be removed, or tissue grafts are used (if the tissue lining is very thin)."
What to expect after the surgery?, You may be required to stay in the hospital for one to two days. You will be discharged with a catheter in place for some time. You will be able to pee normally after two to six weeks. You can resume your normal activities in about six weeks. You may be able to resume sexual intercourse in less than six weeks. You will be informed toAvoid strenuous activities such as lifting heavy weights and standing for long periods for at least the first three months.Increase your activity level gradually.Avoid straining during defecation. Avoid strenuous activities such as lifting heavy weights and standing for long periods for at least the first three months. Increase your activity level gradually. Avoid straining during defecation.
What are the possible complications?, Bladder infection Bladder injury Leakage of urine Inability to pass urine Painful sex Formation of an opening between the vagina and bladder Surgery failure
What is a cystogram?,"'A cystogram is a diagnostic procedure that uses ''X-rays'' to examine the urinary bladder and if there are any leakages to it. Still X-ray images or fluoroscopy (similar to an X-ray movie) may be used. A cystogram may indicate how well the bladder empties during urination and whether any urine backs up into the kidneys. Doctors may recommend cystogram to access:''Depending on the circumstances, the procedure may take around one hour to complete:''Post-procedure:''Risks:' The causes of hematuria (blood in the urine)  Recurring urinary tract infections The urinary system when there has been trauma to the bladder, or to assess the bladder for leaks after surgery Problems with bladder emptying and urinary incontinence Obstructions and strictures (narrowing) of the ureters or urethra Enlargement of the prostate gland Possible problems with the nerves leading to the bladder from the spine, before and/or after spinal surgery For a tear in the bladder wall following an accident The patient will be asked to empty your bladder prior to the examination. Then they will be brought into the fluoroscopy room and asked to lie on the X-ray table.  The genital area will be cleaned and draped with sterile towels.  Some local anesthetic jelly will be used to make the examination more comfortable.  A thin hollow tube called a catheter will be inserted into your urethra (the opening through which urine exits your body).  The catheter will gently be advanced into the bladder. The contrast will then be put into the bladder via the catheter. As the contrast flows into your bladder, X-ray images will be taken. After the contrast has been introduced, the catheter tubing will be clamped to prevent drainage from the bladder. The patient may be repositioned so that the doctor or radiologist can see the area from several angles.  The X-ray equipment may also move around you in order to gain the best possible images. Once all the X-ray images have been taken, the catheter will be removed. Patients may then be asked to pass urine while further X-ray images are taken.  If a patient is asked to urinate and additional X-rays are taken while the patient empties the bladder, the test is no longer just a cystogram. It’s instead referred to as avoiding cystogram.  If the study is to check for a leak after surgery and a leak is found, the catheter will be left in place. If no leak is seen, the tube will be removed at the end of the study. There is no special type of care required after a cystogram.  Patients may resume the usual diet and activities unless contraindicated by the doctor.  Patients may need to drink additional fluids for a day or so after the procedure to help eliminate the contrast from the system and to help prevent infection of the bladder.  Patients may experience some mild pain with urination or notice a pink tinge to the urine for a day or two after the procedure. There might be a very small risk of developing a urine infection. Patients may need to contact a doctor if they experience abdominal pain, shivers, or sweats, or if urine becomes discolored or smells offensive in the days after the procedure. There might be an allergic reaction to the contrast material. There might be excessive bleeding. Patients may feel discomfort during urination, which may last several hours. There might be an injury to the bladder or other organs. There is some exposure to radiation during the procedure because X-rays are used. However, as this is a low-dose examination, exposure to radiation is kept to a minimum. Generally, the amount of radiation you are exposed to during this procedure is equivalent to between a few days and a few years of exposure to natural radiation from the environment."
What is dandruff?,"'Dandruff'' (also known as ''seborrheic dermatitis'') is a ''scalp'' condition, usually chronic, in which skin on the scalp forms flakes that are then shed from the scalp. These flakes consist of dead cells, and while it is normal for dead cells to be shed, with ''dandruff'', a large number of these cells are shed at a faster rate than normal and become visible in the hair and on clothing. The cause of ''dandruff'' is not well known; some individuals consider it related to variations in hormone production.' "
Is dandruff contagious?,"'No, dandruff is not ''contagious'' or infectious. However, dandruff may get worse if certain yeasts and/or fungi that normally occur in small numbers on the scalp are increased in numbers. The increase in these microbes can contribute to increased flaking in dandruff. Because most of these organisms are already present on the skin, they are not considered to be contagious causes of dandruff.''However, another term that modifies the word dandruff is ''walking'' dandruff''. This skin condition is usually seen in dog skin infected with small mites. These mites can be transmitted to other animals, including humans; consequently, walking dandruff in ''dogs'', cats, and other animals can be contagious to humans. Walking dandruff in animals (and in humans) can be cured with topical medication to kill mites. This is in no way related to the dandruff that is commonly seen on the scalp of many individuals.' "
How will I know if I have dandruff?,"'A person will know they have dandruff if they see whitish, dry-appearing thin flakes in their hair, on their scalp, or on their clothing. ''Itching'' of the scalp may also be associated with dandruff. Some symptoms and signs of dandruff may improve after a reduction of ''stress''; others may have a reduction in symptoms and signs during the summer months. Usually, a person does not need a medical ''caregiver'' to diagnose dandruff.' "
What causes dandruff?,"""Because the cause of dandruff is unclear and dandruff is not considered to be contagious, the only spread of dandruff is usually on the person's body. In most individuals, dandruff is confined to the scalp. However, dandruff may spread in an individual by occurring all over the scalp and may occur in other areas on the skin (for example, nasal folds on the face)."" "
How to get rid of dandruff: remedies,"'Although there is no cure for dandruff, people can reduce and practically eliminate the symptoms and signs associated with dandruff; some obtain good results with over-the-counter dandruff shampoos that contain zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid or selenium sulfide. However, these shampoos are not a cure for dandruff because such shampoos only cause smaller and less visible flakes to be shed. Frequent washing even with regular shampoo may also reduce dandruff symptoms and signs.''If yeast/fungi that occur normally on skin or scalp are contributing to dandruff symptoms and signs, some doctors recommend 1% ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral'' shampoo) to reduce symptoms,\xa0although there is no credible evidence that this prescription shampoo works better than the over-the-counter variety.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about dandruff?,"'Most people do not need to contact a medical caregiver about dandruff. However, if ''itching'' is increasing and is associated with dandruff, if dandruff shampoo fails to reduce dandruff symptoms, or if inflammation (skin or scalp redness and swelling) and severe skin shedding occurs, contact a physician.' "
What does diabetes insipidus mean?,"'Diabetes'' ''insipidus'' (DI) is an uncommon disease that manifests as a frequent urge for urination and extreme thirst. It has nothing to do with blood ''sugar'' levels. Although in both ''diabetes mellitus'' and insipidus, patients experience a large volume of urine production, the causes in both cases are different.''DI is caused by less production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the body. This also named vasopressin. It is produced by your brain that instructs your kidneys to retain water. This hormone helps your kidneys to keep the correct amount of water in the body.''Normal people pass about one to two quarts of urine a day, whereas people with DI may pass 3-20 quarts of urine a day that makes them pee more often, sometimes every 15 minutes.''In DI, too much amount of water is pulled from the blood by the kidneys, which causes the body to create a lot of urine and lead to extreme thirst. Therefore, this condition is also named' "
What are the symptoms?,'Diabetes'' Insipidus may present with the following symptoms:' Polydipsia (severe thirst that can’t be satisfied) Polyuria (excessive peeing that is colorless) Dehydration Weight loss Failure to grow Getting up frequently in the night to pee Constipation Weak muscles Muscle pain  Irritability Bedwetting 
What are the different types and causes of diabetes insipidus?,"'Diabetes'' Insipidus has the following subtypes depending on the causative factor affecting ADH production:' Central diabetes insipidus (DI): It mostly occurs due to brain damage because ofBrain surgery.Infection such as tuberculosis.Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).Brain tumor.Radiation therapy.Blockage in the arteries leading to the brain.Autoimmune disease.Hereditary disease.A head or brain injury.

Brain surgery. Infection. Inflammation. Tumor. Head injury. Certain medications used in mental illness such as lithium. Gestational DI: This condition usually occurs in pregnancy and may resolve by itself."
How is diabetes insipidus diagnosed?,"'Your doctor may check your medical history and family health history. The doctor may ask you about your daily fluid intake, ''diet'', and bowel and bladder habits. After your physical examination, your doctor may order for' Urine sample test to diagnose this condition. Blood tests to measure sodium (salt) and other electrolyte levels in the blood. Water deprivation test to calculate the amount of urine passed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to check the details of brain damage and to look for problems with the pituitary gland (a gland inside the brain). Computed tomography (CT) scans."
What are the treatment options?,"'Treatment of diabetes insipidus (DI) usually depends on the cause of this condition. The following modalities may be tried:''In the nephrogenic DI, your doctor may prescribe a low-salt ''diet'"" to help reduce the amount of urine your kidneys make. You'll also need to drink enough water to avoid dehydration."" If you have mild DI, you may only need to increase your water intake. A man-made hormone called desmopressin (DDAVP, Minirin, others) may replace the missing antidiuretic hormone (ADH). You can take desmopressin as a nasal spray, oral tablets, or injection. Other medications may also be prescribed, such as Indocin and Tivorbex (indomethacin) and chlorpropamide may produce more ADH in the body."
What are the possible complications?,'Diabetes Insipidus may present with the following possible complications:' Mental disturbance Hyperactivity Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Poor growth Weight loss Frequent headaches Low blood pressure Fatigue Restlessness Brain damage Kidney damage
What is diverticulitis?,"'Diverticulitis'' is an inflammation of a ''diverticulum'' and/or diverticula (an abnormal pouch or sacs formed at a weak point in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract). Inflammation of a diverticulum causes ''pain'' and disturbance of bowel function. Signs and ''symptoms of diverticulitis'' include the following:''More severe symptoms include ''fever'', abdominal tenderness, swollen abdomen, and fistula formation.'   left lower abdominal pain (70%) constipation nausea vomiting diarrhea gas (flatulence) change in bowel habits bloating"
Is diverticulitis contagious?,"'Causes of ''diverticulitis'' are either infectious (bacteria causing inflammation) and/or noninfectious (foods or seeds causing erosion and inflammation when trapped inside a diverticulum). However, ''diverticulitis'' is not ''contagious''.''For diverticulitis to occur, an individual must have diverticula develop in their gastrointestinal tracts. There is no evidence that diverticula development is contagious. Medical treatments, for example, ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl''), ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'', ''Cipro XR'', Proquin XR), ''amoxicillin and clavulanic acid'' (''Augmentin''), and many others may cure some episodes of diverticulitis, but the diverticula can become re-infected and/or irritated with agents that cause inflammation. Unfortunately, diverticulitis can reoccur. Once the diverticula are formed they become life-long structures unless removed by surgery.''During an attack of diverticulitis, patients are instructed to only eat a clear ''liquid diet'' (broth, Jell-O, clear fluids without any pulp). To help prevent further problems, it is advised to eat a high-''fiber'' ''diet'' or a ''vegetarian'' ''diet'' as they are associated with lowering the risk of recurrent disease. Meals should include whole-grain breads, pastas, fresh fruit and vegetables. There is some controversy about which foods to avoid - popcorn, corn, foods with seeds in them and nuts have been recommended to avoid, but there is inadequate data to support this recommendation.' "
How will I know if I have diverticulitis?,"""The preliminary diagnosis is usually made by the person's history of symptoms and the physical exam. A ""'CT scan'' is considered one of the best methods to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis. Often blood tests are performed to help diagnose complications of the disease.'  "
How will I know if I am cured of diverticulitis?,"'Diverticulitis is cured (or brought into remission) when the symptoms described above resolve. This occurs after the causative factors of the inflammation are removed, so the ''pain'' of diverticulitis may last hours or days. Consequently, it is important to initiate antibiotic treatments early. Symptoms generally begin to remit in about 2 to 4 days.''However, other than infection from bacteria, there is another potential causative factor for the inflammation (food or seed blockage and/or irritation of the tissue in the diverticula). In this situation, remission of symptoms depends upon successful resolution of the inflammation. Surgery can also be required with severe infectious diverticulitis. Approximately 15% to 25% of patients that have their first episode of diverticulitis will need surgery to treat the disease.' "
When should I seek emergency medical care for diverticulitis?,  If a person develops symptoms of diverticulitis they should immediately seek medical care. Any person that develops severe abdominal pain with tenderness should go immediately to the nearest emergency center for evaluation. Medical care should be sought if a person develops blood in the stools or fever with abdominal pain that does not go away.
Is dystonia a form of Parkinson's?,"'Dystonia'' can be one of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD is a long-term neurological movement disorder with various symptoms ranging from slowness of movement (bradykinesia), rigidity of muscles, ''tremor'', loss of balance, memory impairment, personality changes and others. In young-onset PD, foot ''dystonia'' may be the first feature. Later, other symptoms such as personality changes and memory impairment become noticeable.\xa0''Dystonia may sometimes develop as an isolated symptom in individuals who do not have PD. It may be seen in people who suffer from Huntington’s chorea, birth injury, ''stroke'', brain infections, etc. Sometimes, a person with Parkinson’s may develop dystonia due to the drug Leva Dopa that is given as a part of PD treatment.''Dystonia is a neurological disorder that purely affects movement and is characterized by involuntary (not under conscious control) contractions of the muscles causing repetitive or twisting movements or abnormal postures. Dystonia can occur in isolation or as a symptom of PD. It, however, does not affect everyone with PD.''Both PD and dystonia seem to occur due to the involvement of a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. Thus, the symptoms of both can occur in the same person.' "
What is dystonia?,"'Dystonia is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary (not under conscious control) contractions of the muscles causing repetitive or twisting movements or abnormal postures. Movements in dystonia may be painful, interfering with everyday tasks. Besides the involuntary movements, some people with dystonia may have ''tremors'' or other neurologic features. Dystonia is one of the most common movement disorders affecting around 250,000 people in the United States. Dystonia can affect any part of the body including the face, jaw, eyelids, neck, torso or limbs. Dystonia has different names depending on which parts\xa0 of the body are affected' Generalized dystonia: This affects most or all of the body. Focal dystonia: This type of dystonia is localized to a specific part of the body. Multifocal dystonia: This affects two or more unrelated body parts. Segmental dystonia: This involves two or more adjacent parts of the body. Hemidystonia: In this type of dystonia, the arm and leg on the same side of the body are involved."
What are the symptoms of dystonia?,"'The symptoms of dystonia may vary from person to person. Various types of dystonia can affect only one muscle, groups of muscles or muscles throughout the body. In childhood or early-onset dystonia, the symptoms often start in the limbs and may progress to involve other parts of the body. Symptoms may occur after periods of exertion. They may fluctuate throughout the course of the day.''In adult-onset dystonia, the symptoms usually affect one or adjacent parts of the body, most often involving the neck and/or facial muscles.''Involuntary muscle contractions may affect a single area (focal dystonia) such as the leg, jaw or arm.' Symptoms may occur while performing a specific task such as playing a musical instrument (musician’s dystonia), typing (typist’s cramp) or writing (writer’s cramp). These are called task-specific dystonia.  Dystonia symptoms may get worse because of anxiety, fatigue or stress. In neck or cervical dystonia or torticollis, the neck may twist and turn to one side or pull forward or backward. This may cause pain. In blepharospasm, the eyelids are affected. There is rapid blinking or involuntary spasms that close the eyes. It may be severe in the presence of bright light, stress or public interactions. There is no pain, but the eyes may feel dry. Oromandibular dystonia involves the muscles of the jaw, lips and tongue. It can cause difficulties with opening and closing the jaw. It may affect speech and swallowing. There may be slurred speech, drooling and difficulty in chewing and swallowing.  Laryngeal or spasmodic dystonia affects the muscles of the vocal cords. It causes strained, whispering or breathy voice. "
What is E. coli?,"'E. coli'' is a species of bacteria that are gram-stain negative and rod shaped. ''E. coli'' commonly live in the ''intestines'' of healthy individuals. The complete scientific name of the bacteria is termed ''Escherichia coli''. Most ''E. coli'' are harmless to humans, but a few ''strains'' of the bacteria can cause symptoms of severe abdominal cramps, ''bloody diarrhea'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''dehydration'' and if not treated, can lead to ''shock'' and death. ''E. coli'' can cause ''urinary tract infections'', ''meningitis'', ''pneumonia'', abdominal infections as well as ''sinusitis'', ''osteomyelitis'', and ''sepsis''.'  "
Is E. coli contagious?,"'Some ''E. coli'' bacteria are ''contagious'' while others are not, depending on the ''E. coli'' strain and/or the infection type. Some strains that cause gastrointestinal problems (enteropathogenic ''E. coli'') can be transmitted person to person, usually by the oral/fecal route, and even indirectly by contaminated food or water. The ''E. coli'' organisms can survive on contaminated utensils and other household items for short time periods. Foods that are sources for ''diarrhea''-causing ''E. coli'' include:''In addition, water can be contaminated with ''E. coli''. This can be the source of infection through ''swimming'', drinking, consuming ice and eating any food washed with or exposed to contaminated water.''Other ''E. coli'' strains that may cause ''urinary tract infections'' (''UTIs''), for example, are not considered to be contagious. Casual contact (shaking hands, kissing) will not usually transmit ''E. coli'' person to person. However, some strains of ''E. coli'', including the ''diarrhea''-causing enteropathogenic strains, can be contagious.' contaminated meat (raw or undercooked), unpasteurized milk, and raw fruits and vegetables."
When will I know I'm infected with E. coli?,"'Symptoms depend on the age of the patient, the strain of ''E. coli'', and the organ system involved and may include''Some other infections outside the intestinal tract can be caused by ''E. coli'' infection. Examples are''E. coli'' infection can lead to shock and death if untreated.'   severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, vomiting and nausea, and dehydration. sinusitis, pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and sepsis."
How long does it take for symptoms and signs of an E. coli infection to occur?,'The time period from exposure to the ''E. coli'' to when disease symptoms and signs develop (incubation period) ranges from about 1 to 10 days and usually occurs in three to four days. The symptoms an individual may develop vary greatly.' 
How does E. coli spread?,"'E. coli'' is easily spread to other persons by fecal contamination of water and/or food, especially in raw meat, raw milk, and raw vegetables. Many outbreaks of diarrheal illness are spread this way. Moreover, person-to-person contact easily spreads the organisms. Also, indirect spread of ''E. coli'' can also occur since the organisms can survive outside the body on utensils and many other surfaces. The organisms can cause ''wound'' infections or even spread to the brain (meningitis). If the intestinal tract is injured by ''trauma'', ulceration, or other diseases, it may allow ''E. coli'' to cause infection of the abdomen (''peritonitis'') and/or sepsis.'  "
When will I know if I'm cured of E. coli?,"'Individuals can be cured of ''E. coli'' infections. The period of time it takes for antibiotics and/or supportive care (hydration, oxygenation, ''blood pressure'' support, for example) to cure ''E. coli'' infections varies with the severity of the infection. Some infections can be treated with only antibiotics and cures make take from about 5 to 21 days. Other infections may require surgical drainage and/or debridement. These infections (abscesses, organ infections such as ''cholecystitis'') may increase the time to be cured.' "
When should I contact a doctor about an E. coli infection?,"'Most people do not know they are infected by ''E. coli'' unless they are informed of an outbreak of ''E. coli''. ''E. coli'' can be suggested by their symptoms during an outbreak or if they have ingested contaminated food or fluids. The ultimate diagnosis of ''E. coli'' infection is based on the isolation of the organism from the infected site. Consequently,'' individuals that suspect they have been infected with ''E. coli'' should contact a health care professional urgently. Bloody diarrhea, dehydration, high ''fevers'', severe urinary problems, and ''mental status changes'' are conditions that could be due to various serious infections caused by ''E. coli'' and must be evaluated emergently.

What are the benefits of eating wheat?,"'Wheat has several health benefits, such as:''It has been found that 28 grams of whole grains daily can lower the risk of ''heart disease'' by 22%.''Eating whole grains every day has been found to lower the risk of ''stroke'' by 14%. than those eating the fewest.''Fiber-rich foods cause early satiety (feeling full), which prevents overeating. Hence, high-fiber diets are recommended for ''weight loss''.''Fiber-rich grains help with ''weight control'' and prevent obesity, which are risk factors for ''diabetes''. Magnesium, a mineral grain, helps the body metabolize carbs in the body.''The fiber in grains can support healthy digestion by adding bulk to stools, prevents ''constipation'', and helps eliminate bad gut bacteria.''Grains can help reduce inflammation and reduce the risk of complications occurring due to chronic inflammatory diseases.'

What is eczema?,"'Eczema'' is an inflammatory condition of the skin where patches of skin become rough and inflamed, often producing tiny fluid-filled ''bumps'' that can leak clear fluid. ''Eczema'' can occur at any age and is often chronic. The condition has a tendency to periodically worsen and then subside. ''Eczema'' is a general term that includes many different types of skin problems. ''Eczema'' is also referred to as ''atopic dermatitis''.'  "
Is eczema contagious?,"'The most common form of eczema (''dermatitis'') is ''atopic dermatitis'' and is not ''contagious''. However, if the raw, irritated skin of eczema becomes infected, the infecting agent may be contagious. The exact cause of ''atopic dermatitis'"" is not known, but because it often occurs in family members, it is felt that a person's ""'inherited'' genes may play a role in its development.' "
When does eczema appear? How will I know if I have eczema?,"'Some forms of ''atopic dermatitis'' start early in life (before 2 years of age) while others begin after 20 years of age. Rough, inflamed patches of skin may suggest eczema, particularly if the skin lesions intensify and then subside. The following criteria help physicians diagnose the disease:'""No specific test or blood markers exist for the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis so the diagnosis is made by skin's appearance."" Itchiness Skin changes that very with age Chronic and relapsing skin changes Xerosis (dry skin) Elevated immunoglobulin E activity History of asthma or hay fever History of close relatives with eczema Symptom onset younger than 2 years of age"
How does eczema spread?,"'Eczema does not spread from person to person. However, it can spread to various parts of the body (for example, the face, cheeks, and chin [of infants] and the neck, wrist, knees, and elbows [of adults]). Scratching the skin can make eczema worse.' "
Is there a cure for eczema?,"'Unfortunately, there is no known cure for atopic dermatitis. Topical steroids along with skin moisturization currently are the major treatments for eczema. Severe eczema treatment usually includes several ''drugs'' and is carefully monitored by a dermatologist.' "
When should someone seek medical care for eczema?,"'Eczema is usually not considered a medical emergency. People with eczema should contact a doctor if ''itching'' is interfering with daily activities and/or ''sleep'', the crusting and oozing is increasing, the ''rash'' is becoming more widespread on the body, and/or painful cracks develop in the skin of the extremities. If areas of eczema produce pus and/or ''red streaks are extending from the eczema skin lesions'', and/or there is ''fever'', medical care should be sought immediately as a secondary infection may be present.' "
What is electroconvulsive therapy?,'Electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'') is a treatment in which medical professionals apply an electric current to a patient’s brain for a short period to induce a ''seizure''. Patients with certain mental illnesses may benefit from this procedure when medications and psychiatric counselling have failed to help. ECT can be applied to just one hemisphere of the brain or across the whole brain. A typical course of ECT requires three sessions a week for a total of two to four weeks.' 
What is the history of ECT?,"'European researchers in the 1930s noticed people with ''mental illness'' who also suffered ''epilepsy'' had reduced mental symptoms after a ''seizure''. This gave birth to convulsive therapy, which was done using a chemical to induce seizure. This caused violent ''seizures'' resulting in spinal ''fractures'', however.''In the late 1930s, doctors used electricity for the first time to induce a seizure as a treatment in patient with ''schizophrenia''. It was originally called electroshock therapy and performed without anesthesia or muscle relaxants. Like the chemically induced ''seizures'', early electroshock therapy caused uncontrolled convulsions leading to fractures and other injuries in the patients.''Since the late 1950s, doctors started using general anesthesia for ECT, which minimized the risks greatly. Stories of injuries and complications associated with this therapy led to protests against it in the 1960s and 70s.' "
Is electroconvulsive therapy safe?,"'Doctors worldwide perform ECT under general anesthesia with minimal side effects. Today, it is deemed the most effective and safest treatment for patients with severe mental disorders once considered untreatable.' "
Can you get brain damage from ECT?,'There is no evidence for modern day ECT causing ''brain damage'' in any patient. It does not alter a person’s personality and is not used as treatment for personality disorders. It is the optimal treatment today for people with certain mental illnesses otherwise untreatable.' 
How is ECT performed?,"'The actual ECT procedure takes only about 5 to 10 minutes. It can be done while being hospitalized or as an outpatient. The doctor takes the following steps to prepare:' Psychiatric evaluation of the patient. Medical checkup, including blood tests and ECG. Instruction to avoid food and drink except water for 8 hours prior as pre-anesthesia preparation. The anesthetist inserts an IV line and injects a short-acting anesthetic and muscle relaxant. Once the patient is unconscious, the doctor applies electrodes to specific positions on the scalp. The doctor then stimulates the brain with finely controlled electric impulses to produce a seizure lasting for approximately a minute. Because the patient’s muscles are relaxed, the seizure activity is only in the brain, except for slight movements in the hands and feet. The doctor monitors the seizure activity which is recorded on an EEG (electroencephalogram). Within minutes after the ECT the anesthetic effects start to wear off and the patient is monitored during the recovery period."
Who benefits from ECT?,"'ECT is a beneficial psychiatric treatment in the following situations:' Severe depression that leads to refusal of food and suicidal thoughts or psychosis Severe depression that doesn’t respond to antidepressants Depression in patients who are unable to take antidepressants for medical reasons or due to side effects When a person has abnormal and violent movements or is unresponsive in a stupor, known as catatonia Bipolar disorder including mania and depression Schizophrenia with paranoia and hallucinations Dementia in patients who become violent or aggressive, and agitated Pregnant women who need rapid treatment and can’t take medications for fear of harming the fetus Patients in whom previous ECT has been effective"
What are the risks and side effects of ECT?,"'In general ECT is safe, though it does have a few risks and side effects. Almost all of these side effects resolve on their own in a short period.' The side effects of general anesthesia like headache, nausea, vomiting, irregular heart rate, etc. Confusion that may last for a few hours, more likely in elderly patients. Memory loss known as retrograde amnesia when a patient forgets events that occurred weeks or months before the treatment. Memory loss known as anterograde amnesia, when a person is unable to recall events of the recent past from around the time of treatment. The side effects of anesthesia resolve within hours. The memory loss and confusion resolve on their own in a couple of months at most. Some patients may experience more permanent memory loss or gaps in their memory."
Is ECT effective?,"'It is not fully clear how ECT works, but experts believe that the seizure somehow restores the chemical balance of the brain. ECT is most effective in people who undergo the full course of multiple treatments. Depression may still return, and the patient might need further treatments with ECT or ''psychotherapy''.\xa0' "
What makes you unfit for an external cephalic version?,'External cephalic version (ECV) will not be attempted in all women who have the baby in breech presentation. You will be deemed unfit for ECV if' You are carrying more than one baby. The baby suffers from some health issues. The amniotic fluid levels are too high or too low. Your reproductive system has certain abnormalities. The placenta is not in its normal position/place.
What is done before the external cephalic version?,'Ultrasonography'' of the pelvic region will be performed to confirm the breech position and size of the baby.''The doctor may give medications to relax your uterus.\xa0''Both you and your baby’s ''heart'' rate will be monitored before and after the procedure.' 
How is the external cephalic version performed?,"'The doctor feels for the parts of the baby by pressing on your lower abdomen. Then, they apply firm pressure to bring the rolled-up head toward the mouth of the uterus (cervix). The doctor may need an assistant to help them. An ultrasonography machine can be used during this process to monitor the turning of the baby.\xa0''There will be mild to moderate pain while doing an external cephalic version (ECV). Throughout the procedure, the doctor will keep asking you whether you can bear the pain. However, if the pain becomes excruciating, the doctor will right away stop ECV. If any problems occur, an emergency cesarean delivery may also be planned immediately.''The ECV procedure will usually take a few minutes, whereas the entire monitoring process before and after ECV can take one to three hours.' "
What are the possible complications of an external cephalic version?,"'External cephalic version (ECV) carries few risks that include:''The complications of ECV can manifest in the form of ''abdominal pain'', ''vaginal bleeding'', leaking of fluid from the vagina, increase in contractions, or decrease in the movements of the baby.' Increased risk of membrane rupture (water breaking) just before labor Increased or decreased heart rate of the baby Placental abruption (early separation of the placenta from the uterus) Preterm labor (labor that occurs a few weeks before the due date)"
What are the alternatives to external cephalic versions?,"'External cephalic version (ECV) turns out to be successful in more than 50% of women. It has certainly helped in reducing the persistence of breech presentation during a full-term pregnancy. However, in some cases, ''babies'' return to their previous breech presentation even after ECV. At such times, ECV can be attempted again, but the increasing size of the baby with the passage of time poses difficulty to carry a hassle-free ECV.''If ECV fails or cannot be tried in certain women, the only options that remain are''Your doctor will discuss which one of the two alternatives will be the most appropriate for you.' vaginal breech birth and cesarean section (90 out of 100 breech babies get delivered by planned cesarean delivery)."
What is an anal fissure?,'An ''anal fissure'' is a small tear around the lining of the anal canal. Anal fissures manifest with a painful ulcer at the end of the anal canal. The anal canal is a short tube surrounded by muscles at the end of the colon (the rectum).''Anal fissures can cause severe pain and bleeding during defecation and continue for several hours after defecation. An anal fissure should not be confused with ''hemorrhoids'' because the latter occurs due to an engorged vein in the anal canal.''Anal fissures can be caused because of the following factors:' Passing hard stools that results in tearing around the lining of the anal canal Increased muscle tone in the anal canal Decreased nitric oxide synthesis - which facilitates relaxation of the internal anal muscles
What is a sphincterotomy (fissure surgery)?,"'A sphincterotomy is a surgical procedure used for treating chronic anal fissures. Anal fissure management includes surgical and nonsurgical treatment. When nonsurgical methods fail to provide any relief, physicians prefer surgical methods to treat anal fissures.''Surgical methods used for treating anal fissures are as follows:''A lateral internal sphincterotomy is the most preferred choice for surgical treatment of anal fissures. More than 90% of patients heal after a lateral internal sphincterotomy.' Lateral internal sphincterotomy Fissurectomy V-Y advancement flap"
When is a sphincterotomy indicated?,'A sphincterotomy is indicated in the following conditions:' Chronic anal fissures Fissures associated with increased muscle tone Fissures complicated by underlying infected fistula (tunnel between skin and anus) Persistent pain and bleeding Lack of response to medical management
How is a sphincterotomy performed?,"'A sphincterotomy is generally performed under local anesthesia. The surgeon performs the surgery in two ways. In an open sphincterotomy, the surgeon makes a small cut in the skin to reach the sphincter muscle. Once the sphincter muscle is visible, the surgeon ''cuts'' into it. In this method, the incision may be left open to heal. In a closed sphincterotomy, the surgeon passes a blade under the skin to access the sphincter muscle.' "
What to expect after a sphincterotomy?," Pain is likely for 24-48 hours. Taking Tylenol (acetaminophen) can ease the pain in patients. Bleeding may be observed in patients for the first few weeks post the surgery. Constipation may be observed in patients for a few days; however, they should avoid straining while defecating. Patients should not lift anything heavy for 24-48 hours. Most patients can resume work and normal routine one to two weeks after the surgery. Patients should check out for the following symptoms:FeverChillsBlood in stoolsInability to pass urinePus discharge from the rectumPersistent painDizziness and faintingBlood clots Fever Chills Blood in stools Inability to pass urine Pus discharge from the rectum Persistent pain Dizziness and fainting Blood clots"
Is gallbladder cancer aggressive?,"'Gallbladder cancer'' (GBC)\xa0is one of the aggressive ''cancers'' of the biliary tract. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under the right lobe of the ''liver''. The gallbladder generates and concentrates bile that aids in the ''digestion'' of ''fats''. GBC is a rare, yet deadly ''cancer'' of the gastrointestinal tract. It is considered lethal because it is asymptomatic in a majority of patients. In others, symptoms are merely vague which is why the ''cancer'' is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, typically with an extremely bad outlook. GBC ranks fifth among gastrointestinal cancers. GBC usually spreads locally to the liver and adjacent organs.''The overall survival rate for patients with GBC is six months, if not treated. GBC staging includes' Stage 0: The cancer is small and found only in the epithelial (innermost) layer of the gallbladder. It has not spread to the lymph nodes or other places in the body. Stage I (stage 1 GBC): The cancer is still localized within the gallbladder, but the tumor has begun to penetrate into the lamina propria and muscle layer (the second and third layers of the gallbladder). Stage II (stage 2 GBC): The cancer is still localized within the gallbladder, but has now penetrated the deeper layer of the perimuscular fibrous tissue. It has not spread to the nearby lymph nodes or other organs. Stage III (stage 3 GBC): This stage is divided into two subcategoriesStage IIIA: The cancer has extended through the serosa (the outermost layer of the gallbladder) and/or may have extended into the liver or another nearby structures. However, it has not spread to the nearby lymph nodes or more distant organs.Stage IIIB: The cancer cells have spread to the nearby lymph nodes, but the tumor has not spread into the blood vessels leading to the liver or more than one nearby organ other than the liver. Cancer has also not reached the distant organs. Stage IIIA: The cancer has extended through the serosa (the outermost layer of the gallbladder) and/or may have extended into the liver or another nearby structures. However, it has not spread to the nearby lymph nodes or more distant organs. Stage IIIB: The cancer cells have spread to the nearby lymph nodes, but the tumor has not spread into the blood vessels leading to the liver or more than one nearby organ other than the liver. Cancer has also not reached the distant organs. Stage IV (stage 4 GBC): This stage is divided into two subcategoriesStage IVA: Cancer has spread into the blood vessels leading to the liver and/or has extended to a nearby organ other than the liver. Cancer cells may have reached the nearby lymph nodes, but they have not reached the distant organs.Stage IVB: Cancers at this stage are the most advanced. Cancer cells have either spread to the lymph nodes farther away from the gallbladder or they have spread to the distant organs. Stage IVA: Cancer has spread into the blood vessels leading to the liver and/or has extended to a nearby organ other than the liver. Cancer cells may have reached the nearby lymph nodes, but they have not reached the distant organs. Stage IVB: Cancers at this stage are the most advanced. Cancer cells have either spread to the lymph nodes farther away from the gallbladder or they have spread to the distant organs."
What are the common symptoms of gallbladder cancer?,"'The common symptoms of ''gallbladder cancer'' (GBC) include' Abdominal pain  Vomiting  Jaundice (yellow eyes, skin and urine)  Recurrent fevers Larger gallbladder Loss of appetite  Unexpected weight loss Swollen abdominal area Severe itching Black tarry stool"
What are the common risk factors for gallbladder cancer?,"'Common risk factors include' It is more common in people over the age of 75 years old Patients with a history of gallstones or cholecystitis (an inflamed gallbladder) have a high risk. Polyps are benign (noncancerous) tumors of the gallbladder that may later become malignant. People with calcium buildup in the wall of the gallbladder are at an increased risk of gallbladder cancer (GBC). Gallbladder cancer may be common in people born with abnormal bile ducts. People with unhealthy lifestyles such as those who smoking, those who have a poor diet and those who are obese have an increased risk of GBC. Close relatives (a parent, brother or sister) of people with gallbladder cancer have a high risk of GBC."
How is gallbladder cancer usually treated?,"'Treatment for gallbladder cancer may include' Surgery: It can be used to remove the gallbladder. If cancer has spread, then surgery can also be used to remove the surrounding tissue, lymph nodes and parts of other organs.Cancer found in the wall of the gallbladder can be completely removed by surgery.Unresectable cancer cannot be removed completely by surgery. Most patients with gallbladder cancer (GBC) have unresectable cancer.Recurrent cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. GBC may come back in the gallbladder or in other parts of the body. Cancer found in the wall of the gallbladder can be completely removed by surgery. Unresectable cancer cannot be removed completely by surgery. Most patients with gallbladder cancer (GBC) have unresectable cancer. Recurrent cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. GBC may come back in the gallbladder or in other parts of the body. Chemotherapy: This usually uses cytotoxic drugs to destroy the cancer cells.For gallbladder cancer, it may be used after surgery if the surgeon cannot remove all cancer.It may also be used if surgery is not possible or if cancer has come back after surgery.The chemotherapy drugs most commonly used are Gemzar (gemcitabine) and cisplatin. For gallbladder cancer, it may be used after surgery if the surgeon cannot remove all cancer. It may also be used if surgery is not possible or if cancer has come back after surgery. The chemotherapy drugs most commonly used are Gemzar (gemcitabine) and cisplatin. Radiotherapy: This uses high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells.It may be used to relieve symptoms if gallbladder cancer has spread. It may be used to relieve symptoms if gallbladder cancer has spread. Stents: If cancer is blocking the bile duct, this can often be treated with a flexible plastic or metal tube called a stent. The stent holds the duct open, so it is no longer blocked."
What is gastric banding?,"'Gastric banding'' is a bariatric surgery that involves placement of a silicone band in the top portion of the stomach. The silicone band squeezes the stomach into a pouch that can hold only about an ounce of food.\xa0 ''It is a restrictive surgery, as it reduces the size of the stomach. Gastric banding reduces hunger and prevents overeating, as the patient feels full faster and starts to ''lose weight''.' "
Who should undergo gastric banding?,"'Gastric banding is indicated in the patients:''However, gastric banding should be avoided in the patients:' Who have a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m2 Who have a BMI between 30 and 40 kg/m2 and have one medical condition associated with obesity Who have inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal system (e.g., Crohn’s disease, severe inflammation of the esophagus) Who have liver diseases Who have severe heart and lung disease Who have a birth defect in the digestive tract Who are using steroids or other immunosuppressant medications Who have autoimmune diseases Chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Unwilling to follow dietary restrictions post-surgery With a history of substance abuse With a history of active major psychiatric disorder"
How is gastric banding performed?,"'Gastric banding includes several steps. The following information can prepare you for a gastric banding procedure.''After the surgery, food intake must be restricted. For the first few days, a liquid ''diet'' should be taken.\xa0' The physician will enlist your medical and medication history, especially any medical condition associated with obesity. The physician provides nutritional counseling You need to undergo blood tests and complete physical examination You need to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, vitamin E, Coumadin (warfarin), and other blood thinner medicines or any herbal supplement for some time before the surgery. You should be on a liquid diet 24 hours before surgery. You have to fast for a minimum of 12 hours before surgery. You’ll be given antibiotics and unfractionated heparin 30 to 120 minutes before the surgery. A gastric band is fitted under general anesthesia. It is a minimally invasive procedure and is performed through a keyhole incision.  The patient is made to lie flat on the operating table and is secured to the operating table to prevent sliding.  The patient’s abdomen is sterilized and draped.  The surgeon makes three to five small surgical cuts in the abdomen.  The surgeon inserts a long narrow tube with a camera (laparoscope) through one of the incisions.  Through the other incision, the surgeon uses surgical instruments to place the band.  The gastric band is placed around the upper part of the stomach and secured with stitches. The port attached to the band is secured to the wall of the abdomen.  The procedure takes about 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The patients can resume a normal diet after six weeks.  The patients can resume a normal routine within two days.  The physician educates the patient about how much to eat, what to eat and exercise routine to achieve adequate weight loss."
Is gastric banding safe?,"'Normally patients survive this surgery. But, the risks increase after surgery. The risk of death due to gastric banding is less than one in 3,000. The most common complications of this procedure include:' Band erosion Band slippage Gastric band erosion Nausea and vomiting Wound infections Minor bleeding Perforations in the gastrointestinal tract Gastritis (inflammation of lining in the stomach) Poor nutrition Scarring inside the abdomen"
How long does a gastric band last?,'Gastric bands do not last forever. A gastric band can deteriorate over time and may need to be removed or replaced to prevent complications.' 
What is gingivitis (gum disease or periodontal disease)?,"'Gingivitis'' (''gum disease'' or periodontal disease) is inflammation of the ''gingiva'' (structures in the mouth including the gums, mucous membranes, and fibrous tissue that covers the tooth-containing edge of the jaw). ''Gingivitis'' is commonly termed gum disease and medically termed periodontal disease. ''Gingivitis'' is considered to be the early stage of periodontal disease by some investigators. The majority of individuals with gingivitis have bacteria under the gingival area, and these bacteria cause inflammation. Some bacteria that play a role in gingivitis also play a role in causing ''cavities''.'  "
Is gingivitis contagious?,"'The answer is controversial and depends on what experts you ask. For example, many factors that lead to the disease are due to actions taken by the individual (examples include poor ''dental hygiene'', no flossing of ''teeth'', ''stress'', hard to clean crooked teeth, ''smoking'', medications like steroids and some antiseizure medications, and a poor ''diet'' containing heavy amounts of ''sugar'' and carbohydrates). However, researchers have shown that gingivitis-causing bacteria (including ''Streptococcus'' mutans'', ''Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans'', ''Porphyromonas gingivalis'') can be passed from parents to children and exchanged between men and women living together by sharing silverware, utensils, saliva, drinking cups, and other items. Theoretically, it may be transmitted or spread by kissing.''Currently, the American Dental Association considers gingivitis to be ''contagious''. However, other factors such as those described above usually need to be present for an individual to develop gingivitis.''If one sides with those who consider gingivitis is mainly due to actions taken by an individual, then one sides with those who think gingivitis is not contagious. However, if one agree with the reasons established by the American Dental Association, then one sides with those who think gingivitis is contagious. There is a middle ground for some who think gingivitis occurs when certain factors are present in an individual (such as when the gingivitis-causing bacteria are present in an individual with poor dental hygiene, etc.).' "
How does gingivitis spread?,"'The American Dental Association suggests that initial spread of those gingivitis-causing bacteria (and many others) spread from mothers to their children. Children by the age of 3 are about 26 times more likely to have gingivitis-causing bacteria such as ''A. actinomycetemcomitans'' if their mothers have that strain of bacterium in their mouths. Similarly, cohabiting men and women develop similar bacterial populations. The spread of these organisms to other people occurs through sharing utensils, food, kissing, and other direct and indirect physical contacts.' "
How will one know if he or she has gingivitis?,"'For many people, there will be few if any symptoms, and these individuals will not know they have gingivitis for years. Once bacteria begin to cause inflammation, the symptoms of gingivitis may begin to appear as early as a week, but the incubation period is highly variable and depends on both colonization by bacteria that cause gingivitis and other factors that stimulate the growth of these bacteria. Consequently, it could take years for gingivitis to develop in certain individuals. Gingivitis is usually diagnosed during a dental checkup or tooth cleaning. However, some people may develop symptoms of ''bad breath'', swollen gums, receding gums, ''gums that bleed'' when an individual flosses or brushes their teeth, and/or develop a reddish coloration of the gums instead of the normal pinkish gum coloration. These are symptoms and signs that suggest that gingivitis is occurring.'  "
How will someone know when he or she no longer has gingivitis?,"'Fortunately, gingivitis is reversible in most individuals.''Dental care with tooth cleaning, plaque removal, and advice about how to avoid gingivitis is important. Dentists will advise people to avoid sugary ''drinks'' and food, stop ''smoking'', and to reduce ''stress''. Some individuals may require a change in their medications. Although it may be impossible to remove all of the bacteria that cause the gingivitis, gingivitis can be stopped and reversed. Consequently, gingivitis is reversible. When symptoms of gingivitis resolve, an individual should have relatively normal-appearing gum structures. This may take weeks or months with more than one dental visit.' "
When should someone seek medical care for gingivitis?,"'Although gingivitis is not a medical emergency, the following problems should cause an individual to seek dental care:''It is important to have a dentist or medical ''caregiver'' investigate these problems to distinguish between gingivitis and other even more severe conditions.' Red and/or swollen tender gums Gums that bleed easily with tooth brushing Persistent bad breath or a bad taste in the mouth Gums that have receded or pulled away from the teeth Changes in the way one's teeth or dentures fit when biting down Teeth that are becoming loose Any lesions that develop on or in the gums"
Is green poop a sign of infection?,"'Green poop may or may not be a sign of infection.''The normal color of poop is brown, due to the bile pigment present in it. Any other color (green, red, black) needs attention. Abnormal colored poop may be due to changes in food habits, medicines or underlying medical causes.''The most common causes of ''green stools'' are diets rich in green vegetables, such as spinach and kale, which can cause green ''stool''.''Sometimes during ''diarrhea'', the food moves through the intestine rapidly. There isn’t enough time for the bile to break it down completely. Such poop may appear greenish.' "
What other symptoms might occur with green stools?,"'The green ''stool'' may be accompanied by symptoms depending on the causes. The most common symptoms accompanying green stool are''Seek medical attention, if the following symptoms are observed' Diarrhea Gas or flatulence Abdominal pain Weight loss Nausea Vomiting Dehydration Flu-like symptoms Unexpected weight loss Bloating Poor appetite Rapid heart rate Irritability and confusion Severe nausea and vomiting Dizziness High fever Light-headedness Dark urine Severe diarrhea Weakness Severe abdominal pain"
Which other diseases cause green stools?,"'Diseases that may cause ''green stools'' are' Celiac disease (malabsorption syndrome) Bacterial infection Parasite infection Intestinal cancer Food poisoning Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Colon cancer Tumors in the intestine Viral gastroenteritis"
What food causes green stool?,"'Natural or artificial foods that are green in color may cause green-colored stool. Chlorophyll present in the green vegetables is a green pigment that allows plants to conduct photosynthesis. This pigment makes the stool green. However, if you still have green poop even 2 to 3 days after eating these foods, then it is a matter of concern. Foods that cause green stools include' Green vegetables, such as broccoli, kale, spinach, zucchini and celery Green food coloring in ice pops and candies Iron supplements Green herbs, basil, parsley or cilantro Green fruits, such as jalapeno, avocadoes, green grapes or green apple Pistachios  Hemp seeds Powdered green tea Blueberries or blackberries Red wine"
Can green stool be treated at home?,"'Temporary ''change in stool color'' may recover on its own. As a rule of thumb, any episode of green stool stained with blood or accompanied by ''fever'' must not be treated at home. Avoid dairy products and ''caffeine''. Make sure you drink plenty of water.''Certain low-''fiber'' foods may help green stools associated with diarrhea' White rice Potatoes Noodles Bananas White bread Fish Lean ground beef Applesauce"
When should I worry about green stool?, 
What is gripe water?,"'Gripe water is a herbal medication available in liquid form. It has been effective in treating ''colic'' in children. The main components of gripe water include:''When choosing gripe water, parents should check the label and avoid the product if it contains:''Colic is defined as excessive crying for more than 3 hours a day at least 3 days a week for 3 weeks or more in an otherwise healthy baby. One of the possible reasons could be stomach discomfort in children when unable to pass ''gas''. The exact cause of colic is unknown; hence, there is no accepted conventional treatment.\xa0Infantile colic is self-limiting because it resolves at about 3 months of age.''The herbs in gripe water are known to relieve digestive problems; hence, this formulation was recommended by the physician for the treatment of colic ''pain''.''Gripe water has also been used to treat:''As gripe water is a supplement and not a medication, it doesn’t come under the regulation of the US FDA, which means that there is no guarantee for the ingredients mentioned on the label.' Fennel Dill seed oil Ginger Chamomile Licorice Cinnamon Lemon balm Gluten Dairy products Alcohol Sucrose Infantile reflux Teething pain Hiccups"
What are the side effects of gripe water?,"'With the newer formulations of gripe water, it has been claimed that they are generally safe. However, it is important to monitor for any side effects that include:' Hives Itching Vomiting Watery eyes Swelling of the lips or tongue Change in breathing Indigestion Diarrhea Constipation Problems in teething Fever Fussiness"
What are the alternatives for gripe water?,"'If the pediatrician doesn’t feel gripe water is safe for your baby, they may recommend alternatives like:' Massaging the baby to soothe colic Applying pressure on the tummy by placing the child facing down and gently rubbing the back Wrapping the child in a warm, cuddly blanket, and holding them tight Changing the brand of formula milk to soy-based milk Exclusion of cow’s milk, eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts from the mother’s diet Prescription medications to soothe colic"
What is H. pylori?,"'H. pylori'' (''Helicobacter pylori'') are spiral shaped bacteria. ''H. pylori'"" bacteria are unique because they produce the enzyme urease that allows the bacteria to live in the harsh environment of the stomach. The urease enzyme it produces reacts with urea to form ammonia that neutralizes enough of the stomach's acid to allow the organisms to survive in the tissues."" "
Is H. pylori contagious?,"'H. pylori'' is considered to be ''contagious'' and ''passed from person to person'' by:'""Most investigators think that individuals become infected as children because the parents and the person's siblings are likely to transmit the organisms to them while they are young. The organisms are considered to be a major cause of both stomach and small intestine (duodenal) ulcers.""   saliva, fecal contamination (in food or water), and poor hygiene practices."
How long before I know I am infected with H. pylori?,"""About two thirds of the world's population is infected with ""'H. pylori''. A significant percentage of this population likely became infected as children and most show no signs of infection for many years. Consequently, individuals may realize that they are infected with ''H. pylori'' when they develop symptoms of stomach inflammation (''gastritis'') and/or ulcers, usually in their adult years.'  "
What are the symptoms of H. pylori?,"'The most common symptoms of ''H. pylori'' are:''About 30% to 35% of infected people do not have symptoms.'   A discomfort in the area of the stomach described as burning or gnawing or aches and pains This pain typically occurs when the stomach is empty and/or during the early morning hours. The pain may be reduced by antacids or food in the stomach. Burping Unintentional weight loss More severe symptoms can include:nausea,vomiting, andblood in the stools and/or in vomit. nausea, vomiting, and blood in the stools and/or in vomit."
How are H. pylori bacteria spread?,"'The ''H. pylori'' bacteria are likely spread from one individual to another by:''Researchers speculate that the majority of individuals that are colonized and/or infected with ''H. pylori'' are likely infected through the mouth (fecal – oral route) during their childhood.'   saliva, contaminated foods or fluids, and poor hygiene, for example, the lack of hand washing."
When should I seek medical care for an H. pylori infection?,"'People that develop any symptoms or signs of recurrent ''gastritis'' and/or ulcer disease should contact their doctor to determine if they are infected with ''H. pylori'' or have other medical problems. Those with known duodenal or stomach ulcers can be tested for an ''H. pylori'' infection. ''H. pylori'' infections can be detected by several methods including:''Individuals that have blood in either their stools or vomit should be seen by a doctor right away (emergently).' a blood test, a breath test, a biopsy urease test, stomach biopsy, and culture of biopsy specimens for H. pylori."
Are there home remedies or cures for H. pylori infection?,"'There is a wide range of ""home remedies"" available that claim to treat this problem, for example:''The effectiveness of these home remedies is questionable at best. Patients are advised to discuss these treatments with their doctors before they begin them.' beer, garlic, wine, mastic tree sap or gum, and many others."
How will I know if or others or I are no longer contagious for H. pylori?,"'H. pylori'' can be treated with antibiotic therapy (a triple therapy regimen) that, for best results, lasts 14 days. However, to be sure the infection is gone, the person needs to have the diagnostic test(s) repeated show that ''H. pylori'' is no longer present in the individuals gastrointestinal tract. Unfortunately, at least one study has shown that even after eradication of ''H. pylori'', individuals are re-infected at a rate of about 20% after three years.' "
What exactly is a hair transplant?,"'A hair transplant is a cosmetic procedure done to add more hair over the balding or thinning areas of the ''scalp''. It is generally done by taking the hair from another part of the scalp (donor site). This part of the scalp is not controlled by androgens (the male hormones contributing to ''hair loss''); hence, it does not go bald. Hair from other body parts may also be used.''Pre-procedure preparations:''The harvesting and transplant procedure:''The different techniques for hair transplants are as follows:''Post-procedure protocol:' The “donor area” needs to be trimmed short for the easy access and removal of the hair that is to be transplanted. Your plastic surgeon will inject a numbing agent into the scalp. Wounds in the donor site after recovering the harvest grafts will be stitched and closed. Punch grafts, mini-grafts, micro-grafts, slit grafts, and strip grafts are performed on patients who have small bald areas. Flaps, tissue-expansion, and scalp-reduction are procedures that are done for patients who have extensive balding. Strip harvesting: The surgeon cuts strips of the tissue from the donor areas of the scalp. These strips are punched into the bald parts. The new hair grows in the bald spot from these strips. Flap surgery: In this procedure, the surgeon can cover large bald patches. One flap has the ability of around 350 grafts. An area of the bald scalp is cut. A flap of the hair-bearing skin is lifted off another area of the scalp. The other end of this flap is still attached at its original blood supply. The hair-bearing flap is brought into the bald patch and sewn into place. This technique yields better results among other hair transplant techniques. Scalp reduction (also known as advancement flap surgery): In this technique, parts of the hair-bearing scalp are pulled forward or “advanced” to fill in a bald crown. The skin surrounding the cut-out area is loosened and pulled so that the hair-bearing scalp can be brought together and closed with stitches. Single hair (micro-grafting) and slit grafting: This method is used most often to recreate a frontal hairline. Slits are made in the scalp using a scalpel or needle. Thin strips of the tissue containing the hair follicles are then inserted into the slits. Dilation: Dilators are inserted directly into the scalp to push aside the scalp and allow the insertion of micro-grafts or mini-grafts. Holes may be punched into the thinned part where the graft needs to be inserted. The surgeon can also create a site for graft insertion with lasers. Follicular unit extraction (FUE): The surgeon takes individual hair follicles out of the scalp. He makes small holes in your scalp and grafts hair follicles into the holes. The surgeon bandages the transplanted area with sterile gauze and an antiseptic ointment. He may inject triamcinolone (steroid) into the scalp to bring down swelling. You will need to take antibiotics, painkillers, vitamins, and medicines to promote hair growth. No weightlifting, exercises, and sexual activity are permitted for one to three weeks after the procedure. You must not wash your hair for two weeks after the procedure."
Do hair transplants really work?,"'You can expect the hair growth of half-inch per month.''Results will be seen after three or four months and continue to improve over the year. In three to six weeks, the hair will fall off, and you may seem to have less hair than before. This is normal. That hair will grow back in the next few months. Medicines such as Propecia (''finasteride'') and Rogaine (''minoxidil'') may be given to stimulate inactive hair follicles.''In some cases, the grafts die out. Such individuals may need a repeat procedure.''Several surgical sessions may be needed to achieve satisfactory hair growth. An interval of several months is usually recommended between each session. An additional touch-up procedure to fill in the frontal hairline and a better look may be undertaken if needed.' "
"What is hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?","'Hand, foot, and mouth disease'' are caused by ''viruses'' called enteroviruses. Many different types of these ''viruses'' can cause the disease, but in the U.S., the most common cause is Coxsackievirus A16. The disease is called ''hand, foot, and mouth disease'' because a few days after the individual develops symptoms of a ''fever'', reduced appetite, ''sore throat'', and feeling weak, painful sores can develop on the palms of the hands, on soles of the ''feet'', and in the ''mouth''. Some individuals may also develop sores on the knees, elbows, buttocks, and genital area. The sores can ''blister'' and ulcerate. The disease is common and usually affects infants and children under 5 years of age (although it is possible for adults to get the disease).'  "
"Is hand, foot, and mouth disease contagious?","'Hand, foot, and mouth disease'' is highly ''contagious''. It is easily spread by nose and throat secretions (nasal ''mucus'', saliva, kissing, for example). For children, is common to transmit the disease by the fecal-oral route. In addition, these viruses can be transmitted in contaminated droplets developed during ''sneezing'' or ''coughing'' and if the droplets land on objects, uninfected people can be contaminated if they pick up the object and then put their hands in their mouth or touch their face. A person may be ''contagious'' before symptoms develop and is most contagious during the first week of illness. However, some individuals can be contagious for weeks after symptoms and signs remit. Some people, especially adults, develop no symptoms but still can be contagious.' "
"What is the incubation period for hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?",'The incubation period (time from initial exposure to development of symptoms) for ''HFMD'' ranges from about three to six days. ''Fever'' is usually the first or early symptom.' 
"How long is hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) contagious?",'Individuals with ''HFMD'' can be contagious during the incubation period (about three to six days) before symptoms develop and may remain contagious for days or weeks after the symptoms and signs abate. Even people with mild or no symptoms and signs during infection can be contagious. People are most contagious during the first week after symptoms and signs develop.' 
"How do I know someone has hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?","'In general, HFMD is diagnosed by the characteristic symptoms and signs of sores on the hands, ''feet'"", and mouth, along with patient's history, age, and probability of association with a child or other person with the disease. If the patient has a severe case of HFMD, throat and ""'stool'' samples for viral cultures can be used to identify the viral strain that is causing the disease. This test may diagnose the disease definitively and provide physicians with evidence of an outbreak in their area.' "
"How is hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) transmitted?","'HFMD is spread by nose and throat secretions, from the ''blisters'' or ulcers, and by feces. In addition, kissing, mucosal contact, and touching objects like toys or other items that have had contact with infected body fluids may spread HFMD. Occasionally, some individuals may get the disease from droplets that are spread in the air. Child care businesses often have outbreaks of this disease. In small wading pools that are inadequately chlorinated, children may transmit the disease to others (both children and adults) usually by fecal contamination of the pool water.' "
"How will I know someone is cured of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?","'After symptoms develop for HFMD, it takes about five to seven days with the symptoms to resolve. Although the individual is cured of HFMD when symptoms and signs stop, the individual may still shed viruses for a week or so. There are many viruses that cause HFMD. Resolution of one infection may not protect against subsequent different viral types that can cause HFMD; consequently, a person can get the disease again. However, as children get older, they are less likely to get HFMD.' "
"When should I contact medical caregiver about hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?","'For most children and adults, HFMD is a self-limiting disease that resolves with no therapy and does not require treatment by a medical ''caregiver''. However, if symptoms and signs become severe and especially if the individual becomes dehydrated (poor fluid intake, dry mucous membranes, and little or no urination) and/or is not acting normally, a medical ''caregiver'' should be contacted urgently or the individual should be seen at an emergency department.''Although there is no evidence that HFMD in a ''pregnant'' woman affects the fetus, the disease may be transferred to the neonate if the woman has HFMD at delivery. ''Pregnant'' women should contact their ''OB/GYN'' physician if they suspect they have HFMD during ''pregnancy''.'  "
What is open Heller myotomy?,"'Heller myotomy is a surgical procedure that corrects ''achalasia'', a condition that makes swallowing difficult (''dysphagia'').\xa0''Achalasia is a grave problem that affects your food pipe (''esophagus''). A ring-shaped muscle known as lower esophageal sphincter (LES)—present between the lower end of the esophagus and stomach—normally allows the food or liquid to pass through your esophagus into your stomach.\xa0''When the LES becomes tight, the food—instead of passing easily through your esophagus into your stomach—keeps getting stuck in the esophagus. As a result, you may have trouble swallowing and problems like ''heartburn''.''Open Heller myotomy involves cutting the outer muscles of the lower end of the esophagus through a large incision in the abdomen. This procedure relaxes the LES to improve your swallowing ability.' "
When is an open Heller myotomy performed?,"'Generally, Heller myotomy is done in patients with achalasia who:''Heller myotomy can be done in any of the two ways, open or laparoscopic. The laparoscopic method involves making few, small incisions in the abdomen and then a laparoscope, a long tube that has a camera at front, is inserted to locate the LES and perform the surgery.''Though the laparoscopic method is preferred over the open approach for Heller myotomy, the open procedure is performed when:' Fail to get relief from medicines Opt for surgery and are fit for it The patient has out-pouching of the esophagus above the LES (epiphrenic diverticula) The patient has a history of a previous failed Heller myotomy There is another abdominal problem that cannot be addressed with laparoscopy"
What is done before open Heller myotomy?," You will be asked to undergo a test that measures the muscle strength of your esophagus (manometry)before the surgery. You will be put on a clear liquid diet for 48 hours before the surgery. Heller myotomy is usually done early in the morning. Hence, you need to have an empty stomach for at least six to 12 hours before the surgery."
How is open Heller myotomy done?," General anesthesia makes you sleep throughout the surgery. A large incision will be made through the midline of your upper abdomen. The surgeon will retrieve the esophagus and cut it lengthwise starting above the LES and extending a little down onto the stomach.   Only the outer muscles of the esophagus will be cut, which will loosen the tight LES, thereby allowing its easy opening. The surgery usually takes two to four hours."
How long does it take to recover from open Heller myotomy?," You may be allowed to take liquids on the same day or a day later after a Heller myotomy.  You may start eating a soft food diet after two to three days.  You will be discharged within three to seven days after open Heller myotomy. Based on how well you tolerate foods, you can resume your normal diet, including raw fruits, within four to six weeks. You may have to take a month off work to recover from an open Heller myotomy .  You will be allowed to do heavy lifting only after six weeks or more."
Is Heller myotomy a major surgery?,'Open Heller myotomy is major surgery with\xa0 a long recovery period. It also carries a risk of esophagus rupture (perforation) during the surgery. Other possible complications of Heller myotomy include:' Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Food mixed with acidic juices gets pulled up in the esophagus from the stomach leading to heartburn Peptic strictures: Development of extreme narrow passages in the esophagus Persistent dysphagia: Persistent difficulty in swallowing
What is a rubber band ligation?,"'A rubber band ligation is a simple, painless, and highly effective procedure that involves placing a rubber band around ''hemorrhoids'' to cut off its blood supply. ''Hemorrhoids'', commonly known as ''piles'', are swollen veins located around the anus or in the lower rectum.''Hemorrhoids'' are either internal or external, depending on the location. Internal ''hemorrhoids'' are covered with a lining called mucosa that is resistant to touch, ''pain'', stretch, or temperature, whereas external hemorrhoids are covered by very sensitive skin.''Internal hemorrhoids may be graded as follows:' Grade I (primary): These slide below the toothed or jagged line present above the anal canal (dentate line) while straining but retract when strain is gone. Treatment includes increasing fiber intake. Grade II (secondary): These protrude below the anal opening but reduce spontaneously. Treatments include sclerotherapy and rubber band ligation. Grade III (tertiary): These protrude below the anal opening and need to be reduced manually. Treatments include sclerotherapy, rubber band ligation, or surgery. Grade IV (quarternary): These protrude below the anal opening and are not reducible. Surgical removal of hemorrhoids (hemorrhoidectomy) is indicated."
Who should have a rubber band ligation?,'A rubber band ligation is indicated in' Patients in whom other therapies have failed. Patients who are intolerant to the risk of anesthesia administered during the surgery. Patients with cirrhosis or uremia (a high blood urea level) as an alternative therapy.
Who should not have a rubber band ligation?,'A rubber band ligation is avoided in\xa0the following conditions:' Take anticoagulant medications Bleeding disorder Pregnancy Latex allergy Significant protruding of the rectum Rectal cancer Inflammatory bowel disease such as colitis Acute thrombosis (local blood clots) Suppressed immunity A perirectal abscess (pus formation near the anus) Large grade intravenous hemorrhoids
How is a rubber band ligation performed?,"'Before the procedure''During the procedure''After the procedure''Post-procedure ''pain'' is likely for 24-48 hours. Taking ''Tylenol'' (''acetaminophen'') can ease the pain.' You may have to stop taking blood thinners such as Coumadin (warfarin) and Aggrenox (aspirin and dipyridamole), four-five days before the procedure. You may be asked to sign an informed consent form that consists of the risk and benefits, alternatives, expectations, and length of the procedure. You may be given an enema on the previous night of the procedure. You may have to fast from midnight to the procedure. The physician performs a rubber band ligation either in a hospital or an office setting. Anesthesia may not be necessary while performing this procedure in an office setting. The physician inserts a small tool, known as a ligator, through a lighted tube (scope) in the anal canal and grabs hemorrhoids with forceps. The physician pushes the ligator’s cylinder to release the rubber band around the base of hemorrhoid. Bleeding may be observed for 7-10 days post the procedure. Avoid strenuous work for 24-48 hours after the procedure. Do not lift anything heavy for 24-48 hours. Avoid straining while defecating because it can lead to more hemorrhoids. Check out for the following symptoms:FeverChillsBlood in stoolsInability to pass urinePus discharge from the rectumPersistent painDizziness and faintingBlood clots Fever Chills Blood in stools Inability to pass urine Pus discharge from the rectum Persistent pain Dizziness and fainting Blood clots"
How long does it take for banded hemorrhoids to fall off?,"'The band causes the hemorrhoids to shrink, holding the hemorrhoids in place. The physician removes hemorrhoids in two-four settings, done six-eight weeks apart. However, some bleeding will be observed when the rubber band falls off.' "
Can a rubber band ligation be used for external hemorrhoids?,'A rubber band ligation mainly treats grades II and III internal hemorrhoids. It is not effective in treating external hemorrhoids or significantly protruding hemorrhoids.' 
What are hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids'', commonly known as ''piles'', are engorged veins located around the anus or in the lower rectum. ''Hemorrhoids'' occur as a result of excessive straining, usually during defecation.''Hemorrhoids'' are either internal or external, depending on the location. Internal ''hemorrhoids'' are covered with a lining called mucosa that is resistant to touch, ''pain'', stretch or temperature, whereas external hemorrhoids are covered by very sensitive skin.''Hemorrhoids may be graded as follows:' Grade I (primary): These slide below the toothed line or jagged line present above the anal canal (dentate line) while straining but pull back while relaxing.

Grade III (tertiary): These protrude below the anal opening and need to be reduced manually; Treatments include sclerotherapy, rubber band ligation or surgery. Grade IV (quaternary):These protrude below the anal opening and are not reducible. Surgical removal of hemorrhoids (hemorrhoidectomy) is indicated."
Why is hemorrhoid surgery done?,"'Surgery (hemorrhoidectomy) is indicated when all other approaches fail and in specific conditions such as:''Hemorrhoids can be managed either medically or with surgery, depending on the severity of the symptoms. For grade I and II hemorrhoids, dietary changes and medical treatment are indicated as the first-line treatments.''For grade I, II and III hemorrhoids unmanageable by medical treatment, the office-based procedure will be indicated. Office-based procedures include the following:' Hemorrhoids with significant bleeding Larger external hemorrhoids Protruding internal hemorrhoids Rubber band ligation: It involves placing rubber bands on the hemorrhoids. Infrared photocoagulation: Heat produced by the infrared light cuts of the blood supply to the hemorrhoids. Electrocoagulation: Electric currents cuts of the blood supply to the hemorrhoids. Sclerotherapy: Injecting a chemical solution into the area around the hemorrhoids. Cryotherapy: Involves freezing the hemorrhoids."
What is the best procedure to remove hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoid'' surgery (hemorrhoidectomy) is the most effective way to remove hemorrhoids. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is the gold standard in the treatment of hemorrhoids. Apart from excisional hemorrhoidectomy, other surgical procedures involve:''Hemorrhoidectomy involves complete removal of the layers (mucosa and submucosa) of hemorrhoids, without injuring the underlying muscle (sphincter muscle). Excisional hemorrhoidectomy can be open or closed. In the end, if the mucosa is closed with ''stitches'', the procedure is known as closed hemorrhoidectomy; if the mucosa is left open, the procedure is known as open hemorrhoidectomy.''Patients may feel soreness from the procedure for three to ten days. For managing ''pain'', doctors may prescribe oral painkillers or topical anesthetic cream.''Transanal hemorrhoidal artery ligation is a procedure that involves inserting a Doppler sensor in the anus to detect the arteries supplying blood to hemorrhoids. The hemorrhoidal arteries are identified and tied to cut the blood supply. The hemorrhoids shrink immediately and are unnoticeable within weeks.''This procedure uses a stapler-like device to relocate the hemorrhoids and cut their blood supply. Recovery is faster and there are fewer complications.' Transanal hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) Stapled hemorrhoidopexy"
Is hemorrhoid surgery painful?,"'Apart from open and closed hemorrhoidectomy, other procedures are relatively painless. As with any surgery, hemorrhoidectomies also have few complications that include:''Complications of stapled hemorrhoidopexy are:' Bleeding Inability to pass urine Lack of voluntary control over urinating or defecating Rectovaginal fistulas (formation of an abnormal connection between rectum and vagina) Bleeding Sepsis (A life-threatening infection)"
What is hepatitis A?,"'Hepatitis A'' is a type of ''liver'' infection caused by a virus termed ''hepatitis'' A (HAV). For clarity, the disease will be termed ''hepatitis'' A while the viral cause will be termed HAV. Hepatitis A is a self-limited disease that does not cause chronic disease in contrast to some other viral causes of hepatitis. Antibodies produced during infection give life-long protection against the disease; there is an effective ''vaccine'' against HAV. Rarely, hepatitis may lead to liver failure and death.' "
Is hepatitis A contagious?,"'Hepatitis A is very ''contagious''. People can be contagious even before symptoms appear. However, the numbers of individuals diagnosed with hepatitis A has been decreasing since the vaccine against HAV was introduced in 1995. The vaccine is effective in adults and children.' "
How will I know if I have hepatitis A?,"'Symptoms, if they occur, start about 2 to 6 weeks after exposure to HAV. About 80% of adults have symptoms (see below) while children seldom show symptoms. Symptoms of hepatitis A may include the following:''Symptoms develop over a few days and in mild infections, last about 4 to 6 weeks with more severe infections lasting about 6 months. Your physician can diagnose hepatitis A by your history, physical exam, and blood tests.'  Nausea and/or vomiting Fever Loss of appetite Abdominal pain Dark urine Clay-colored stools Jaundice (yellowish color to skin and/or eyes Joint pain"
How is hepatitis A spread?,"'Hepatitis A spreads person to person, and by indirect spread. Fecal - oral, sexual contact, and contaminated food or water can be sources of HAV that causes the disease. Common sources that have HAV contamination are''HAV ''viruses'' can live outside the ''human body'' for months in the environment.'  fruits, vegetables, ice, and untreated water."
How will I know if I am cured of hepatitis A?,"'In general, once symptoms of hepatitis A begin to abate, individuals are considered to be non-contagious; resolution of the infection results in a cure and life-long immunity to the disease. Appropriate vaccination (usually 2 shots 6 months apart), can also give long-term immunity to the disease.' "
When should I contact a doctor about hepatitis A?,"'If you have recently been exposed to a source of HAV and are unsure if you are vaccinated, contact your health-care professional, as it is possible to get vaccine or even immunoglobulin treatment to prevent the disease and/or its symptoms.''If you have the disease, contact your health-care professional for symptomatic treatment methods (for example, ''diet'' changes, avoiding alcohol, certain ''drugs'') to help prevent HAV spread to family and friends. Some individuals have more severe symptoms and may need to be hospitalized.' "
What is hepatitis B?,"   Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). To avoid confusion, the term hepatitis B will be used to indicate the liver disease and HBV will be used to designate the infecting virus. Hepatitis B can occur as an acute or short-term illness; in other individuals, it may become a chronic infection. Chronic infections occur mainly in infected infants (about 90%) while only about 2%-6% of adults become chronically infected; chronic infections may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer."
Is hepatitis B contagious?,"'The disease, ''hepatitis B'', is ''contagious''. HBV, the viral cause of ''hepatitis B'', is transmitted person-to-person by''Moreover, ''hepatitis B'' can be transferred through sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to baby at the time of birth.' blood, semen, or any other body fluid from the infected person."
How will I know if I'm infected with hepatitis B?,"'The signs and symptoms of ''hepatitis'' B vary with age; most children under 5 and immunosuppressed adults do not show symptoms with initial infection. However, individuals about 5 years and older have a 30%-50% chance of having initial signs and symptoms of the infection that may include the following:''The incubation period (from time of exposure to HBV to symptom development) is long for ''hepatitis'"" B - the average time to onset of symptoms is about 90, days but may range from 60-150 days. Acute hepatitis B symptoms may last from several weeks up to about 6 months. Your physician can confirm hepatitis B infection by studies of the blood; hepatitis B antigens (HBsAg) can be detected as well as antibodies (anti-HBs) that are developed against hepatitis B antigens. Other similar tests are used to determine the individual's infection status.""  abdominal discomfort nausea and/or vomiting fever jaundice (yellowish color to the skin and/or to the sclera of the eyes) loss of appetite clay-colored stools dark urine joint pain fatigue"
How is hepatitis B spread?,"'Hepatitis B is spread person-to-person by methods that usually involve skin puncture or mucosal contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. For example:''Fortunately, HBV is not spread through food or ''beverages'', ''breastfeeding'', casual contact like hugging, handholding, or ''sneezing'' (as long as no blood from an infected person accompanies these activities).'  Semen, saliva, sharing needles or syringes, and contact with open sores of an infected person can all facilitate person-to-person spread. Indirect spread from items such as razors, toothbrushes, or other items may cause hepatitis B. Unfortunately, HBV is very stable and can remain infective on items like razors or toothbrushes for about one week. An infected mother can transfer hepatitis B to her newborn during birth."
How will I know if an individual is cured of hepatitis B?,"'Not all patients with hepatitis B require treatment, which is generally used in more advanced disease. There are multiple anti-viral agents currently available that are effective in controlling the infection. Your physician will determine if you are a candidate for treatment, and if so, with which agent. Although a commercially available drug is not yet available to cure hepatitis B, researchers in Australia are currently studying an anticancer drug, birinapant. The drug is in ''clinical trials'' to determine its potential ability to cure hepatitis B.''However, ''vaccines'' against HBV are available; they contain no live virus and can be given to infants, children and ''pregnant'' females; the ''vaccines'' can protect most individuals from getting HBV infection.''Individuals that get infected with HBV and do not remain chronically infected can become HBsAg-negative about 15 weeks after onset of symptoms. However, patients are advised to consult their physician to interpret the results of HBV blood tests. The majority of adults recover from hepatitis B; after several months they become non-''contagious'' and are considered to be cured. Unfortunately, about 2% of adults and more than 90% of children under age 1 do not clear the infection and develop chronic hepatitis B infection. For this reason, HBV ''vaccine'' is urged for all infants and for individuals that are exposed to hepatitis B and have not been vaccinated.' "
When should I contact a health-care professional about hepatitis B?,"'Any infant, child, or adult that has not been vaccinated against HBV should be vaccinated; especially if they have had any close association with HBV-infected individuals.''An individual with chronic hepatitis B infection is advised to''Discuss ''diet'', lifestyle changes, and ways to prevent transmission of their disease to others with your health-care professional.' have follow-up every 6-12 months to maximize their health, get an annual flu shot (influenza vaccination), get vaccinated against hepatitis A, and"
What is hepatitis C (hep C)?,'Hepatitis'' (''hep C'') is a form of ''viral hepatitis''. ''Hepatitis C'' causes acute and chronic ''liver disease''. ''Hepatitis C'' is transmitted when the virus in infected blood from one person infects another person. ''Hepatitis C'' disease is caused by a virus termed ''HCV'' (a single strand RNA virus) that infects ''liver'' cells. ''Hepatitis'' C was referred to in older scientific publications as non-A or non-B ''hepatitis''.' 
Is hepatitis C contagious?,"'Hepatitis C'' is ''contagious''. It is mainly transmitted via blood-to-blood transfer. This transmission can occur by''Casual contact (including exposure to saliva and skin to skin such as with a handshake or) rarely, if ever, can transmit ''hepatitis C'' virus.' sharing needles, acupuncture, tattoo needles, surgical or diagnostic instruments, sexual contact, and organ transplants."
How long before I know I'm infected and have hepatitis C?,"'The incubation period (time from exposure to the virus to symptom development) for ''hep C'' is variable. The time period may vary from about 2 weeks to 6 months with 6-10 weeks being the average time span. However, about 80% of those infected may not develop acute symptoms.''Symptoms of hepatitis C'' develop slowly and include''About 70% to 90% of infected people do not clear the virus and become chronic carriers. Tests for diagnosing ''hepatitis C'' virus include detecting antibodies to the virus and a ''PCR'' test that detects virus antigens.'  anorexia, abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and occasionally jaundice."
How is hepatitis C spread?,"'Hepatitis'"" C is spread person-to-person usually by direct contact with another person's blood who is infected with hepatitis C virus. Individuals that share needles are at a high risk to become infected. Surgical and other instruments that are not properly decontaminated can also spread hepatitis C to others. Moreover, some patients that receive organ transplants from individuals that have the virus, but no symptoms, can transmit the disease to the organ transplant recipient."" "
How will you know when you are no longer contagious and cured of hepatitis C?,"'Treatments are usually long-term (for example, 12-24 weeks ) and a person is not considered ""''cured''"" until 6 months have passed with no virus detected in their blood samples. Treatments are varied according to the individual\'s disease.' "
When should you call a doctor if you think you may have hepatitis C?,"'If a person develops one or more of the following symptoms, they should seek medical care:''Let your doctor know if you shared needles with someone or you have had contact with anyone who has been diagnosed with hepatitis C.''If a person is known to have hepatitis C and develops severe ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''abdominal pain'', and/or ''mental status changes'' (''confusion'' or unresponsiveness, for example), they should be evaluated in an emergency department immediately.'  About 1-3 days of nausea and vomiting that is not improving Yellowish color to the skin and/or the eyes Dark urine Abdominal pain"
What is hepatitis?,"'Hepatitis'' is a disease characterized by inflammation of the ''liver''. ""''Hepatitis''"" is a general term that refers to any inflammation of the ''liver''.''Many illnesses and conditions that cause inflammation of the liver. In order to answer the question of whether or not ''hepatitis'' is ''contagious'', these illnesses will be broken into two categories; infectious and noninfectious ''hepatitis''.' "
Is hepatitis contagious?,"'Infectious causes of hepatitis usually are, but not always, ''contagious''. For example, hepatitis caused by ''viruses'' usually is contagious,'' although many types of hepatitis are transferred mainly from person to person by blood-to-blood transfer, for example, individual sharing needles, ''acupuncture'', sexual contact, and organ transplantation.''Some infectious ''parasites'' (such as ''Plasmodium spp, ''Schistosoma'' spp'') cause hepatitis in individuals, but are ''not contagious'' person to person.''Most noninfectious causes of hepatitis are not contagious. Hepatitis caused by ''alcohol'' poisoning, medications, or toxins or poisons are not transmitted from person to person.''Therefore, the answer to the question ""Is hepatitis contagious?"" depends upon the type of hepatitis.' "
How long does it take before symptoms of hepatitis begin?,"'In general, the incubation period from time of initial viral infection to development of symptoms ranges widely from about two weeks to six months.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of hepatitis?,"'Symptoms'' of hepatitis vary somewhat depending on the type of hepatitis. Most types of infectious hepatitis that are contagious may have slowly developing symptoms, for example:'""Symptoms of hepatitis that develop from noncontagious causes (such as alcoholic hepatitis) may have very similar symptoms described above. Noncontagious hepatitis also may cause increased abdominal size and fluid in the abdomen. The time to develop symptoms may take months to years, but may develop quickly (days) in some toxin-induced hepatitis. A health-care professional can order tests to help determine the underlying cause of a person's hepatitis symptoms.""'Serious or severe symptoms of hepatitis (for all types) may include:'  Abdominal discomfort Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite Fatigue Jaundice Confusion Increased bruising or bleeding Coma Death"
How is hepatitis spread?," Infectious causes of hepatitis that are contagious usually are spread person-to-person by direct contact with another person's blood that is infected. The classic example for infectious hepatitis spread is viral hepatitis C. Individuals that share needles are at high risk for developing viral hepatitis. Moreover, individuals that have been exposed to surgical or other instruments (for example, tattoo needles) can spread the infection to others. Infectious hepatitis that is contagious also may be spread by sexual contact. Other types of viral hepatitis like hepatitis A are spread by fecal/oral contamination, and contaminated food, water, or items touched by infected individuals. Noncontagious hepatitis due to specific infectious causes (such as from parasites) and chemical induced hepatitis (alcohol, medications) are not spread person-to-person. A health-care professional can help determine the underlying cause of a person's symptoms."
What is the treatment and cure for hepatitis?,"'Treatments for contagious hepatitis types vary according to the underlying cause and type of hepatitis. Most individuals are contagious about one to two weeks before symptoms appear. Depending upon the type of hepatitis, they can remain contagious for an extended length of time. For example, people with ''hepatitis A'' are contagious for at least two weeks after the onset of symptoms, but for ''hepatitis C'' and other types of hepatitis, individuals may not be cured of hepatitis and are contagious unless specific treatments occur.''In general, it takes about six months for the liver to recover from ""cured"" ''hepatitis A'' in most individuals. With other hepatitis types, patients may not be cured (or even know they have the disease) for many years.''With noncontagious hepatitis, again the ""cure"" is dependent upon treatment of the underlying cause. If the underlying cause is ""cured,"" the ''liver function'' may or may not improve.' "
When should you contact doctor if you think you have hepatitis?,"'Fortunately, for some types of hepatitis (for example, ''hepatitis A''), there are preventative treatments. Consequently, if a person suspects that they may have been recently exposed to any type of infectious hepatitis, they should contact their health-care professional quickly to prevent liver damage.''If a person has the following symptoms for days, they should seek medical care urgently.''If a person known to have infectious hepatitis develops severe ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' with ''abdominal pain'' and/or ''mental status changes'', they should be evaluated in an Emergency Department.' nausea and vomiting, yellowish color to the skin and/or the white area of the eyes (jaundice), dark urine and/or abdominal pain."
Why is hysteroscopy done?,"'Hysteroscopy gives the doctor information about the patient’s ''reproductive health''. It helps the doctor to closely study the reproductive organs of a woman for identifying abnormalities. A sample of abnormal tissues and lesions would usually be taken for testing; this procedure is called a biopsy. Sometimes an additional surgical procedure may be performed in certain conditions.''Hysteroscopy is indicated in the following:' To confirm the diagnosis of conditions that are suspected based on clinical assessment and other radiological tests, such as endometriosis, uterine adhesions Abnormal Pap smear Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding Dysmenorrhea (severe pain and cramping during periods) Intermenstrual bleeding (bleeding between periods) More than one miscarriage (loss of pregnancy) Difficulty getting pregnant Bleeding after menopause To evaluate the uterus prior to performing an abortion To diagnose and aid in the removal of urine fibroids, uterine polyps, and uterus scarring To undergo surgery for permanent sterilization When the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) displaces out of the uterus"
How is hysteroscopy performed?,"'During hysteroscopy:''The anesthesia used in hysterectomy depends on whether the procedure is done for diagnosis or to perform a procedure. It is done when you are not in your menses. If the procedure is only performed for diagnostic purposes, no anesthesia is required. Anxious patients may receive intravenous sedation. If the procedure is performed to take a biopsy or to perform more invasive procedures, intravenous sedation or general anesthesia would be administered.''The doctor inserts the hysteroscopy device through the vagina, the cervix, and then into the uterus. A saline solution or carbon dioxide ''gas'' is passed into the uterus through the device to widen the uterus and make the diagnosis or perform surgical procedures easier. The procedure may take 5-30 minutes, depending on the purpose of the procedure.''After hysteroscopy:''The purpose for which the hysteroscopy was done determines the recovery period. If patients have not received anesthesia or just local anesthesia, they would be able to go home in 1-2 hours. Those who receive intravenous sedation or general anesthesia would have to stay in the hospital till they recover from the anesthesia, which may either take a few hours or up to 24 hours. Pain killers and antibiotics may be administered. After the procedure, the patients may experience the following:' Pain and discomfort Cramps Vaginal bleeding (usually mild) or spotting for a 1-2 days Pain radiating to the shoulder (if carbon dioxide gas was used) Nausea Lightheadedness or giddiness"
What are the complications of hysteroscopy?,"'Hysteroscopy is a relatively safe procedure with minimal complications. Though complications are rare, like any procedure there are risks, which include:' Bleeding Infection Injury to the cervix or the uterus Scarring of the uterus Reaction to the liquid used to clean the uterus Reaction to anesthesia"
What is impetigo?,"'Impetigo'' (''impetigo'' contagiosa) is a superficial bacterial infection most frequently observed in children 2-5 years of age, although adults may become infected. Lesions begin as ''papules'' (small ''bumps'') and then progress to small vesicles (''blisters'') surrounded by redness of the skin (usually on the face near the mouth and on extremities). Vesicles become larger and leak fluid, producing a characteristic golden crust on the lesions.'""There are two major types of impetigo: nonbullous (the most common type described above) and bullous impetigo, which is characterized by enlarged vesicles filled with a clear yellow fluid that becomes darkened and, when ruptured, forms a brownish crust. The patient's body (trunk) is often infected in contrast to nonbullous impetigo.""'Unlike impetigo, ecthyma is a more serious infection that penetrates deeply into the skin; it produces fluid or pus-filled sores that are painful. These sores can produce ulcers in the skin. This subtype is not often seen.' "
Is impetigo contagious?,"'Impetigo is a highly ''contagious'' disease. Impetigo is easily spread from person to person by direct contact with the lesions and/or indirectly by touching items (clothing, sheets, or toys) that have been used by individuals with this skin disease. Indirect transmission is less frequent than direct person-to-person transmission. Bacteria cause impetigo; group A streptococci and staphylococci are the organisms that most frequently cause impetigo.' "
What does impetigo look like? What is the incubation period for impetigo?,"'A person infected with impetigo usually starts out with irritating, itchy ''blisters'' that can develop pus. The incubation period is about one to three days for streptococci and about four to 10 days for staphylococci. The individual may also develop local ''lymph node'"" enlargement. Diagnosis of impetigo is often made clinically without special testing by the patient's history and physical examination and the appearance of the characteristic crusting lesions. However, the diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation and identification of the bacteria from the skin lesions."" "
How does impetigo spread?,"'Impetigo is spread mainly by person-to-person contact; it is rapidly spread through direct transmission in day-care centers and schools. Less frequently, the disease may be spread indirectly by contact with sheets, clothing, or toys contaminated by infected individuals. Impetigo is mainly confined to humans. Contact sports may spread impetigo; wrestling is considered to be the most likely sport to spread it, followed by football and rugby.' "
How will I know when someone is cured of impetigo? How long is the contagious period for impetigo?,"'Some individuals can self-cure impetigo over about a two-week period. An infected individual becomes cured or noncontagious after the sores go away. However, this time span may be reduced with appropriate topical antibiotics. Some individuals may require more aggressive treatment with oral antibiotics or, in severe infections (rare), IV antibiotics. With effective antibiotics, the person is usually considered noncontagious after about 24-48 hours of treatment.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about impetigo?,"""Some individuals benefit from topical antibiotic treatment; if you or your child is involved in an outbreak of impetigo, you should contact your physician or your child's pediatrician. If ""'fever'' develops or if the condition persists after about two to three days of treatment with no improvement, you should contact a physician. If the ''rash'' and lesions develop rapidly and become red, warm, and tender and/or red streaks develop, contact a physician urgently or go to an emergency department.'  "
What is Invisalign?,"'Invisalign is a dental technology to straighten crooked ''teeth'' or reduce the inter-tooth spaces. Invisalign claims to be the first orthodontic treatment method to use only the three-dimensional (3D) digital technology to plan out a treatment plan for misaligned\xa0 ''teeth''. Unlike traditional ''braces'', Invisalign is transparent and removable. It does not have wires or elastic rubber bands, so it is an aesthetically better choice.' "
Is Invisalign worth getting?,"'Your orthodontist is the best person to guide you here. They will conduct a detailed dental examination and suggest if you are a good candidate for Invisalign. This decision will be based on the condition of your teeth and lifestyle goals. Though Invisalign claims to offer the same efficiency as ''braces'' with better aesthetics, there are conditions where braces have a clear advantage. Also, there is a cost factor involved. The cost of Invisalign is anywhere between 3,000 to 7,000 dollars and it may be only partially covered by your insurance.''In the case of malocclusion (improper bite), which is a condition where teeth are not properly aligned, most dentists suggest using clear aligners (Invisalign) because it is a good choice.''Numerous studies conducted on Invisalign suggest that the following patients have a good response to treatment''In the above cases, both Invisalign and braces will work, although braces are cheaper.''Invisalign does not have a good success rate in individuals with the following conditions''Hence, you must discuss this with your dentist. Together, you may come up with the best plan for the management of your dental problems.' Patients with minor tooth crowding Minor tooth gaps between teeth (less than 4 mm) Minor tooth rotation (crooked teeth) Orthodontic relapse (you had braces in the past, but now your teeth are shifting back to the previous position) Expansion (poor fit of the bottom and upper teeth while chewing) Intrusion (tooth is driven inside the gum) The cases that do not need braces and can be managed by active or passive retainers Severely crowded teeth Severe rotations Poor bite (open bite and deep bite): In this condition, the upper teeth and the lower teeth are not in proper alignment when the jaw is closed. Growth problems of facial bones Tip and torque control (a kind of tooth deformity) Impacted teeth Intercuspation cases (poor relation of upper and lower teeth in the hind part of the jaw)"
Is Invisalign better than braces?,"'Invisalign is a tempting choice when compared to braces. Invisalign is virtually painless and it can be removed when it is not convenient. With Invisalign, there is no calcification or staining, which is common when using braces. Invisalign does not cause damage to the gums, and there is no risk of heavy metal toxicity and plaque build-up where braces rest on the teeth. However, there are many dental conditions where only braces may help you.' "
How does Invisalign work?,"'Clear braces like Invisalign work by using detailed scans of your teeth with special technology. These three-dimensional (3D) scans are used to determine the desired final result of the dentition. The aligners are transparent molds made of ''Bisphenol A'' (BPA) free material, which sit over the upper and lower teeth. The aligners gently move your teeth one week at a time. Each week, your teeth are aligned some more by the slightly differently shaped aligners.''The treatment addresses\xa0all teeth and not just those seen when you smile. The aligners are ''plastic'' replicas of your teeth. It is recommended that the aligners be worn 22 hours a day or as prescribed by the orthodontist. Each set of aligners is worn for one to two weeks before changing to the next set. Over time, teeth reach their ideal places, according to the orthodontist’s plan. The total number of aligners will vary according to the needs of each patient.\xa0Follow-up retainers may be needed. The whole treatment may take any time from between six to 18 months.' "
What are the symptoms and treatments for cold?,"'A cold or ''common cold'' is a viral infection. It affects the upper respiratory system, which includes the nose, mouth, throat, and ''lungs''. The ''common cold'' is a self-limited\xa0''contagious''\xa0disease. It is the most frequently occurring viral infection in the world. It is usually caused by a virus group called rhinoviruses. The common cold is spread either by direct contact with infected secretions from contaminated surfaces or by inhaling the airborne virus after the infected individuals sneeze or ''cough''. A few days after the virus sets in, the patient may experience cold symptoms:''Treatment for cold:''Usually, the body defends itself automatically against the virus, and this immune response usually clears up the symptoms within a week or 10 days. There is no cure, but the symptoms may be eased through ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications. It should be noted that antibiotics do not work for the common cold because a virus usually causes a cold. Common treatment therapies or remedies include:' Low-grade fever (temperature above normal but below 100.4 °F or 38 °C) Cough Sore throat/irritation in the throat Headache Weakness Difficulty breathing Cough (often worse at night) Recurrent sneezing Nose congestion or running nose Loss of appetite Body aches Change in voice (hoarseness) Watery or red eyes Taking OTC medications, such as Tylenol/acetaminophen or ibuprofen according to the label instructions, may help in relieving fever, headaches, and body aches. Cough syrup often includes antitussive agents, designed to suppress coughing or expectorants that can loosen mucus in the throat and may help treat symptoms of a cold. Some studies show taking zinc tablets or a diet enriched with zinc may build up a stronger immune system to fight the cold virus. Nasal steroid spray like Flonase (fluticasone) along with nasal irrigation, such as neti pot, helps thin the mucus and flush out the congestion. This can be done with a mix of distilled water and salt. Drinking plenty of warm water. Using honey in warm water can help soothe sore, scratchy throats, and suppress cold symptoms. Getting sufficient rest."
What are the symptoms and treatments for a sinus infection?,"'A sinus infection, also known as ''sinusitis'' or rhinosinusitis, is a condition in which the delicate membranes that line the sinuses may get swollen and become red. ''Sinusitis'' may be caused by ''allergies'', ''viruses'', bacteria, or rarely a fungus. A bacterial sinus infection has the most severe symptoms. Very few cold symptoms (only 5-10%) can turn into ''sinus infections''. Common symptoms of a sinus infection include:''Treatment for sinus infection:\xa0' Persistent bad breath along with cold symptoms A cough that lasts more than 10 days without improving Persistent fever Pressure or pain between or around the eyes A severe headache that is felt behind or around the eyes that worsens on bending over Pain in the teeth of the upper jaw that may feel like a toothache Nasal congestion and a discolored discharge A reduced sense of smell Fatigue It is often recommended to visit a doctor for treating a sinus infection. Doctors may usually prescribe generic antibiotics like Amoxicillin or cefdinir to stop the growth of or kill bacteria to resolve a sinus infection. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and Medrol (methylprednisolone), may improve sinus drainage by reducing inflammation of the sinuses. Antihistamines, such as Benadryl, may be prescribed if sinus infections are caused by allergies. Antihistamines may help clear up sinusitis by reducing or stopping an allergic reaction. Decongestants, such as Afrin nasal spray, may help in reducing swelling, pressure, and congestion of mucus in the nasal passages. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, may help reduce symptoms associated with a sinus infection. It helps relieve pain, swelling, and fever. A warm compress over the nose and forehead may also relieve sinus pressure. Home remedies are similar to the home remedies for colds."
What is stomach virus?,'A stomach virus is also called ''stomach flu'' or ''gastroenteritis''. It is a viral infection that infects the tummy and the gut. The most common cause is ''norovirus'' and other ''viruses''. Stomach viruses are ''contagious'' and spread easily. Stomach viruses may spread in the following ways:' Consuming contaminated food or drinks Direct contact or sharing utensils with an infected person Touching surfaces that may be infected
What is food poisoning?,"'Food poisoning'' is also often called gastroenteritis and may present symptoms like stomach virus/stomach ''flu''. However, ''food poisoning'' is caused by consuming food or drinks that may be contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or parasites. The most common cause is bacteria, such as ''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''.''Food poisoning may spread in the following ways:\xa0' The onset of symptoms in food poisoning is quicker than that of a stomach virus. The symptoms of a stomach virus can take a few days to develop, whereas, in food poisoning, symptoms may appear as quickly as within six hours of consuming contaminated food and drinks. Symptoms of food poisoning may last longer. Consuming contaminated food or drinks. Consuming raw salads, eggs, undercooked meat, and dairy have a high risk of causing food poisoning if not handled or cleaned properly."
What are the signs and symptoms of a stomach virus?,"'The most common symptoms of a stomach virus are:' Diarrhea that may be watery or bloody Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain and cramps Muscle pain Fatigue Fever Headaches Loss of appetite Dehydration because of diarrhea, vomiting, and fever"
What are the signs and symptoms of food poisoning?,"'Food poisoning may usually affect more than one person (whoever has consumed the same food or drinks) and can be traced to a particular event/source. The most common signs and symptoms of food poisoning are:' Bloody diarrhea, which is more common in food poisoning than stomach flu Violent vomiting Abdominal pain and cramps Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Dehydration"
What is the treatment?,"'Some cases of stomach virus and food poisoning may resolve in a few days with simple lifestyle changes and home remedies. If not, it is advised to seek medical attention.''Medical management:''If the symptoms do not resolve, the doctor may recommend the following:' Adequate rest and drinking plenty of clear liquids, such as water, broths, and juices, to treat and prevent dehydration. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Avoid certain foods like dairy, fatty, high-fiber foods, or highly flavored foods because they are difficult to digest and may worsen diarrhea. Simple food like crackers, toast, eggs, rice, or chicken may be eaten. Over-the-counter, antidiarrheal, and anti-vomiting medications: These should not be taken without consulting a doctor. When a person has diarrhea or vomiting, the body is trying to eliminate toxins and harmful bacteria as well. Antidiarrheal medication may stop diarrhea but in turn, will cause a build of toxins and harmful bacteria in the body. Over-the-counter medications like paracetamol can be taken for fever and pain. Probiotics: These are microorganisms that boost the levels of good bacteria in the intestine and help restore gut health. Probiotics are present in certain brands of yogurt and available as supplements. Antibiotics: These can help treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. If diarrhea is caused by a virus, antibiotics will not kill the virus but can prevent superadded (secondary) bacterial infection. Fluid replacement: First, the patient would be advised to replace the lost fluids and salts orally. This involves drinking water, juice, water containing salt, electrolytes, and vitamins. If the patient is unable to hold liquids due to vomiting or the symptoms don’t improve, IV fluids may be recommended to treat dehydration. Antidiarrheal medication: Loperamide and bismuth subsalicylate may be prescribed in severe cases to reduce the severity and episodes of diarrhea. This must only be taken after consulting a doctor."
What are the other causes of diarrhea?,"'Certain medications like antibiotics and anticancer medication can cause diarrhea as a side effect. Other causes include:' Lactose intolerance: Lactose is present in dairy products. Some people have difficulty digesting lactose and present with diarrhea after eating dairy products. Artificial sweeteners: Artificial sweeteners in sugar-free products can cause diarrhea. Surgery: Abdominal or gallbladder removal surgeries can alter bowel movements causing diarrhea. Gastrointestinal disorders: Chronic diarrhea occurs due to several medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)."

Is it necessary to have sex every day?,"'Sex not only fulfills your physical needs but also establishes an emotional connection between the two partners in a relationship. The emotional connect factor is more important for women than for men.\xa0''Sex indeed comes with multiple benefits but that does not mean that it should be a daily and compulsory chore of life. It is completely fine for you to restrict the number of times you have sex in a day or week. This is because it does not always happen that both the partners want to have sex at the same time or as frequently as the other one. Moreover, it is the willingness of both partners that makes the carnal act more gratifying and enjoyable. Forcing someone to have sex is known as sexual coercion and is not advisable.''Sex might not be okay when''Hence, you should always feel free to talk to your partner about your current needs so that the two of you can settle on one thing—to have sex or not. After all, sex is not the only way to experience physical intimacy. Sometimes, even kissing and cuddling can make up for sex.''If sexual problems are hampering your relationship, you can always consult a sex therapist or sexologist.' Your partner does not want to have sex (due to tiredness or sickness). Sex becomes a major interference in your work and life. Too much sex makes you forget your household or financial responsibilities. Excessive sex is causing inflammation or irritation in the vagina."
Can someone die from sex?,"'Although there are incidents of death from sex, only 0.6% of sudden death cases are attributable to sexual intercourse. Most of these people have cardiovascular insufficiency. Other sex risks include:' An activity of sex burns calories equivalent to climbing two to three flights of the staircase. Hence, doctors advise resuming sex gradually after major surgeries. This is especially crucial for patients who have recently undergone cardiac surgery or suffered a heart attack.  There are reports of patients with known heart diseases in whom sex has triggered a life-threatening arrhythmia (rapid, irregular heart rate). Hence, if you are a heart patient and having sex causes a racing heart, shortness of breath, angina, or fatigue, you should right away see your doctor.  Sexually transmitted diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, and gonorrhea may be life-threatening. Forcefully bending the erect penis against resistance may result in penis fracture. The pain may be short-lived, or it may continue. Blood can build up under the skin of the penis (hematoma) and cause the penis to swell. Although penile fracture may happen in any position, the woman-on-top position increases the risk. It is a medical emergency, which if left untreated for 24 hours can cause permanent erectile dysfunction and urinary problems."
Is eating carrots good for you?,"'Carrots belong to the group of root vegetables that are loaded with several nutrients. They come in various colors, such as yellow, orange, black, white and purple.

Carrots have various antioxidants that protect the body against harmful free radicals. Antioxidants may help decrease the risk of ''high blood pressure'', ''heart disease'' and various ''cancers''. Carrots are high in ''fiber'', so they help regulate bowel movements and prevent ''constipation''. They also help keep weight in check since they are a low-calorie food loaded with fiber. Carrots are an excellent source of ''vitamin A'', which is essential for eye health and good vision.' "
Is it okay to eat carrots every day?,"'Eating carrots in moderation is good for your health. Eating carrots in excess, however, can cause a condition called carotenemia. This refers to yellowish discoloration of the skin because of the deposition of a substance called beta-carotene that is present in carrots. This change in skin color is more obvious in people with lighter skin tones. The yellowish discoloration classically begins in areas with thicker skin, such as the palms, soles, elbows, knees and the folds around the nose (nasolabial folds). When the affected person continues to eat more beta-carotene-rich foods, such as carrots, mangoes, apricots, apples and pumpkin, more and more skin areas start turning yellowish. Small children and infants are more vulnerable since they are generally fed on the puree of such foods. Certain fad diets may also put a person at risk of carotenemia. Though the change in skin color may be alarming, it is a harmless condition. The treatment simply involves withholding foods containing beta-carotene, such as carrots, pumpkin, cabbage, apricots, cantaloupe, squash, sweet potatoes, yams and oranges. If the skin continues to stay yellowish, you must consult with your doctor since yellowish skin color may also be seen in health conditions, such as ''liver disease'', kidney disorders and ''thyroid disease''. Unlike ''jaundice'', in carotenemia the whites of the eyes (sclera) do not become yellowish.' "
Eating how many carrots a day is too much?,"'One carrot, on average, has about four mg of beta-carotene in it. Eating about 10 carrots every day for a couple of weeks may cause carotenemia. This occurs due to the deposition of beta-carotene in the skin. Thus, you must consume various fruits and vegetables, including carrots, in moderation to get their beneficial effects without causing any unwanted effects.' "
The health benefits of garlic,"'The 10 possible health benefits of garlic include:' Medicinal properties: Garlic has been used throughout ancient history for its health benefits and medicinal properties. The health benefits are a result of the sulfur compounds formed when a garlic clove is chopped, crushed, or chewed. It has been used to treat several common illnesses, such as common colds. High nutrition value and low in calories: Garlic is highly nutritious, containing several essential nutrients, and low in calories. One clove of raw garlic contains manganese, Vitamin C, selenium, and small amounts of fiber, calcium, copper, phosphorus, iron, Vitamin B1, Vitamin B6, and potassium. Boosts immune system: Garlic has been found to boost the function of the immune system, reducing the occurrence and intensity of common ailments like the flu and other systemic or skin infections. Reduces blood pressure: Active compounds in garlic can reduce blood pressure (hypertension), reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes. Reduces blood sugar: Garlic reduces pre-meal blood sugar level fluctuations in people with or without diabetes. It is effective in diabetic patients especially if it is taken for more than 3 months. Reduces cholesterol levels: Garlic can lower the levels of cholesterol, which reduces the risk of heart disease. Rich in antioxidants: Antioxidants reduce oxidative damage in the body tissue, which slows the process of aging and protects the body. The antioxidants in garlic combined with its benefits on blood pressure and cholesterol protect the heart and brain. It reduces the risk of brain diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s. Improves physical performance: Garlic can reduce fatigue, improving athletic performance, and physical capacity. It was used in ancient times to improve the physical performance of laborers and improve athletic performance in Olympic athletes in ancient Greece. Detoxification of heavy metals in the body: At high doses, garlic has been found to protect against the organs from heavy metal toxicity due to the sulfur compounds. Garlic may increase longevity: Garlic can benefit the heart, brain, and other organs. It reduces risk factors, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and heavy metal toxicity, which can help people live longer. Garlic is also a rich source of antioxidants and nutrients, and it boosts the immune system as well."
Is it painful to have an IUD inserted?,"'Gynecologists insert a T-shaped\xa0device into the woman’s uterus (womb). This process is quick and not very\xa0painful. However, some ''pain'' is inevitable, and ''pain'' experience is different for every woman. It is normal to feel some discomfort when the opening of the womb (cervix) is stretched. For most women, this only lasts for a few seconds and may be felt as a sharp pain. The pain level during the insertion of an ''intrauterine device'' (''IUD'') is between 2/10 and 4/10 on the pain scale. Inserting an IUD is a simple procedure that takes a few minutes. An IUD is a small, T-shaped device made from ''plastic'"" and copper that is placed\xa0in a woman's womb and provides ""'contraceptive'' protection for up to 10 years.' Before an IUD is fitted, a doctor or nurse may examine the vagina. Having an IUD fitted can be uncomfortable. The patient may be given local anesthesia to numb the pain. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the coil is inserted through the cervix (neck of the womb). It can feel slightly uncomfortable and can cause some period-like pain afterward. However, painkillers can ease cramps. The patient may also bleed for a few days after having an IUD fitted."
Is it painful to have an intrauterine device removed?,"'Removing an intrauterine device (IUD) is a quick procedure and it is not very painful. However, it should be only done by an experienced medical practitioner. Removing an IUD is usually less painful than putting it in.' The patient may be asked to lie on a table with their knees bent and legs apart. The doctor may insert a speculum into the vagina to widen the opening. Threads from the patient’s IUD hang out from the cervix (neck of the womb) into the vagina. Using a special grasping tool, the doctor may gently pull the strings and pull out the device. An IUD is T-shaped and its arms will fold up as it slides out. If the doctor can't see or reach the threads, they may use a special hook or other tool to pull them into view. In rare cases, an IUD won't come out easily because it may get stuck in the wall of the uterus. During such instances, doctors usually give anesthesia to the patient and widen the cervix with forceps to pull it out. The doctor may use a thin, lighted scope to look inside the vagina and uterus to remove the IUD. The patient may feel mild cramps and may experience spotting or light bleeding for a few days or weeks after the IUD is removed. An over-the-counter pain reliever is usually recommended for a few days."
What are the advantages and disadvantages of an IUD?,"'An intrauterine device (IUD) is one of the safest and most effective methods of ''contraception''. The advantages include''Although these side effects are uncommon, an IUD has disadvantages, which include' The IUD works by creating a hostile environment inside the uterus for the sperm by acting as a foreign body. The IUD starts working as soon as it is put in and stops working as soon as it is taken out. It can be easily inserted by a trained doctor. It protects against pregnancy for 5 or 10 years, depending on the type. It is easy to use (nothing to remember after insertion), except a woman should keep tabs on the threads. It can be easily removed. It's possible to get pregnant as soon as the IUD is removed. There are no hormonal side effects, such as acne, headaches or breast tenderness. It does not interrupt sex and the partner will not know about it. It's safe to use an IUD if a woman is breastfeeding. It's not affected by other medicines. The IUD is 99% effective, if used correctly. During the course of 5 years, less than 1% of women using the IUD may become pregnant. Periods may become heavier, longer or more painful, although this may improve after a few months. It does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so condoms are still recommended during intercourse. It increases the chances of ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy happening outside the uterine body). Rarely, an IUD can lead to pelvic infection, if not treated. Most women who stop using an IUD do so because of vaginal bleeding and pain, although these side effects are uncommon."
Can I still get pregnant while using an intrauterine device?,"""Yes, but it is extremely rare. If the intrauterine device (IUD) isn't functioning properly or hasn't been put into place properly, the chances may go up. \xa0An IUD is extremely effective, having a 99% effectiveness rate. When getting an IUD, the patient may either get a non-hormonal IUD that lasts for up to 12 years or a hormonal IUD that usually lasts for two to six years. It should also be noted that IUDs do not offer protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Hence, it is advised to use condoms for avoiding ""'sexually transmitted diseases'' and nullifying the chances of ''getting pregnant''.' "
What are the nutritional and common health benefits of eating jackfruit?,"'Jackfruit is nutritious and rich in proteins, ''fiber'', antioxidants, essential ''vitamins'', and ''minerals''. One cup of jackfruit contains the following nutritional benefits:''The common health benefits of eating jackfruit include:' Calories (155 calories per cup, which mostly comes from carbohydrates and protein) Carbohydrates (40 g) Fiber Protein (3 g) Vitamin A Vitamin C Riboflavin Magnesium Zinc Potassium Copper Manganese It may benefit blood sugar control: Jackfruit has a fairly low glycemic index (the measure of how quickly the blood sugar increases after eating a particular food) probably due to the high fiber content. The high protein in jackfruit also helps prevent blood sugar levels from increasing too quickly after a meal. Improves immunity: Jackfruit contains powerful antioxidants such as vitamin C, carotenoids, and flavanones that provide several health benefits and improve immunity. Antioxidants reduce inflammation, reduce the risk of diseases, improve skin tone, slow down the aging process, and protect the heart, improving heart health. Rich source of protein: Jackfruit contains higher protein than most fruits. Jackfruits contain more than 3 g of proteins per cup, whereas most fruits contain only less than 1 g of protein per cup. Improves digestion: Jackfruit is rich in fiber, which helps to maintain good gut health and prevent constipation."
What are the risks of eating jackfruit?,"'No serious side effects of eating jackfruit have been reported. Eating jackfruit is safe for most people. Some people may be allergic to it if they are also allergic to birch pollen, hence may need to avoid eating the fruit. Because jackfruit lowers the blood sugar levels when consumed regularly, people with ''diabetes'' who consume the fruit regularly would have to get tested and have the dosage of their anti-diabetic medication adjusted by the doctor. Jackfruit might cause excessive drowsiness if combined with\xa0certain medications used during and after surgery. Hence, it is advised not to consume jackfruit for at least two weeks before an elective (planned) surgery. There are no known negative interactions of jackfruit with other foods or medications.' "
What is jock itch (tinea cruris)?,"'Jock itch'', also termed ''tinea cruris'', tinea (the fungal name is often used as the disease name), or ''ringworm'', is a term that describes superficial fungal infection of the skin located in the groin area (genitals, inner thighs, and buttock area). It is a common ''skin infection'' that occurs in warm, moist areas of the body. The major cause of jock itch is the fungus termed tinea; the term jock itch came from the ''itchy'' superficial ''fungal infections'' that frequently occur in males who wear protective gear like cups to protect the genitals during sports activities (football, baseball, and other sports). However, any tight clothing (''swimming'' suits, tight-fitting shorts, and tight-fitting underwear) may increase the chance of acquiring jock itch.' "
Is jock itch contagious?,"'Jock itch is considered to be mildly ''contagious''. Usually, it requires direct person-to-person contact or wearing the clothing of someone who has the skin disease. It is mildly contagious because if the individual who becomes associated with a person with jock itch does not provide a similar warm, moist environment that supports the growth of fungi, the uninfected individual may not get the disease.' "
How will I know if I have jock itch?,"'Symptoms of jock itch include the following:''If you are not sure you have jock itch, a physician can, after physical exam and patient history, either examine the flaking skin scales or send them off to be examined. Microscopic detection of the fungi can confirm a diagnosis of jock itch.'  An itchy red rash that is slightly raised and flaking Crack formations in the skin Often, the skin rash will have a sharp line that defines the extent of the ongoing infection. Some individuals may have a burning pain in the rash area. When clothing rubs against the skin, additional discomfort and/or pain can occur."
How does jock itch spread?,"'In general, jock itch is spread usually in areas where there are individuals dressing and undressing in athletic facilities like locker rooms. These areas frequently have a hot, moist environment that is ideal for fungal growth and also ideal for cross-contamination of clothing that is tight-fitting (jock straps, swimming suits, underwear, for example) so that fungi are more easily spread to other people.' "
How do I know when I am cured of jock itch?,"'When the skin returns to normal (redness, ''itching'', burning and flaking cease), a person is cured of jock itch. However, no matter if the person spontaneously clears the infection or if the individual requires an antifungal medication to clear the symptoms, it is still possible to become reinfected. In fact, it is not unusual for individuals to have recurrent infections especially if they fail to keep the groin area free of tight-fitting clothes and moisture.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about jock itch?,"'The majority of patients who develop jock itch do not need to contact a medical ''caregiver''. Jock itch can spontaneously be cured in some individuals simply by making sure that tight-fitting clothing and moisture from ''sweating'' or other sources is not allowed to remain in contact with the skin for any extended time (minutes to hours). For others, simple ''over-the-counter'' topical antifungal creams such as ''clotrimazole'' or ''terbinafine'' will be effective.''However, if over-the-counter antifungals are not effective, if the skin area develops a secondary (usually bacterial) infection, if the area becomes tender and/or swollen, ''lymph node'' swelling and tenderness develop, or if red streaks develop, a medical caregiver should be contacted. Individuals who are ''obese'"" with skin folds (overlapping skin) and those with suppressed immune function are likely to require more intensive treatment; such treatments are usually prescribed by the patient's physician."" "
What are the stages of kidney cancer?,"'Once your doctor has diagnosed kidney cancer, the next step is to determine the extent (stage) of cancer. Staging of kidney cancer may include additional computed tomography (CT) scans and other imaging tests to determine the location and depth of the ''tumor''. Staging of kidney cancer is done on the basis of T, N, M (tumor size, ''lymph node'' involvement, and metastatic or distant spread).''N0 means no lymph node spread; N1 means lymph nodes are involved.''M0 means no ''metastasis'' to other organs; M1 means metastasis present.' Stage I kidney cancer: Tumor is confined to the kidney and measures less than 7 cm in diameter (T1, N0, M0). Stage II kidney cancer: Tumor is within the kidney only and is sized greater than 7 cm in diameter (T2, N0, M0). Stage III kidney cancer: Tumor has spread from the kidney to the surrounding tissue or nearby lymph nodes (T1 or T2, N1, M0) or (T3, any N, M0). Stage IV kidney cancer: Tumor has spread outside the kidney to multiple lymph nodes in distant regions and/or other organs in the body (T4, any N, M0) or (any T, any N, M1)."
How long can you live with kidney cancer?,"'The 5-year survival rates also give us an idea about how treatable a particular cancer is. This rate tells you what percent of people live at least five years after the cancer is found. The five-year survival rate for people with kidney cancer is generally 75%.''Kidney cancer stage''Five-year survival rate\xa0''What does the survival rate mean?''I and II''93%''93 people out of 100 with kidney cancer will survive for at least five years''III''70%''70 people out of 100 with kidney cancer will survive for at least five years''IV''12%''12 people out of 100 with kidney cancer will survive for at least five years''Nearly 65% of people with kidney cancer are diagnosed when the cancer is in its early stage (stage I).''Keep in mind that these survival rate statistics are based on previous data of a large number of people in a particular period. It does not mean that you will also face the same outcome. How long you will live depends on various factors such as your age, other health conditions, and your body’s response to various cancer therapies. Please ask your doctor to know about the various factors in your case that can affect your survival.' "
How is kidney cancer treated?,"'The doctor will discuss various treatment options and their risks and benefits with you before initiating the therapy.''If you have kidney cancer that has spread (metastasis) to other organs, it might be very hard to treat and almost impossible to cure. In this case, the doctor will give you treatment to limit the spread of cancer and its symptoms and help you live longer.''Treatment for kidney cancer depends on the stage of cancer and includes:''Surgery: ''Surgery is often the preferred treatment if your kidney cancer is localized, that is, present only in the kidney and has not spread anywhere else. Surgery for removing the tumor from the kidney is known as nephrectomy and is of two types:''If you are not fit for the surgery, non-surgical options that destroy the tumor will be adopted. These include:' Radical nephrectomy: Also known as complete nephrectomy, this surgery involves removing the whole kidney that contains the tumor. The surrounding tissues and lymph nodes might also be removed. Partial nephrectomy: This surgery is done to remove only the tumor in the kidney but retain the kidney. It is also known as kidney-sparing surgery. Cryoablation: This procedure freezes the cancer cells by using a special hollow needle that reaches till the kidney. Radioablation: This procedure uses an electric current passing through a needle that burns the tumor in the kidney. Radiation therapy: Once cancer spreads outside of the kidneys, doctors consider local therapy such as radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays and other high-energy beams to destroy the cancer cells. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. This is usually used if the kidney cancer has spread to other organs of the body. In some cases, your doctor might combine other treatments such as surgery and radiation with chemotherapy to prevent the future growth of kidney tumors. Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy is a treatment that targets kidney cancer’s specific genes, proteins, or the tissue environment that help in the growth of cancer. It blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells but restricts damage to normal cells. Clinical trials: Many clinical trials happen on newer therapies in cancer. If the available treatments are not working, you can ask your doctor if you can enroll in one."
What is laparoscopic cholecystectomy?,"'Laparoscopic cholecystectomy'' is a minimally invasive surgery to remove the gallbladder. In an open cholecystectomy, the surgeon removes the gallbladder through a 5- to 8-inch long incision made on the right side of the abdomen below the ribs.\xa0 In a laparoscopic cholecystectomy the surgeon makes several small 1 inch long incisions. The surgeon inserts a thin tube with a camera (laparoscope) into the incision and removes the gallbladder with tiny surgical tools, guided by the images on the camera.' "
Is laparoscopic cholecystectomy major surgery?,'Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a common but major surgery. It carries a few risks and potential complications and may not be the best solution in particular situations.' 
Why is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed?,"'The gallbladder is an organ in the abdomen that produces bile which helps in breaking down the food in the stomach. The most common reason for removal of the gallbladder is the presence of ''gallstones''. ''Gallstones'' are hard deposits which form in the gallbladder.''Gallbladder removal is generally not recommended for people without symptoms unless there is a high risk of developing complications from the ''gallstones'', such as when there is associated ''diabetes''. Gallbladder removal is considered for patients with symptoms.''The symptoms of gallstones may include:''A laparoscopic cholecystectomy may considered in the following situations:''If the doctor finds gallbladder or ''bile duct cancer'' during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, they might convert the method to an open procedure.' abdominal pain indigestion nausea and vomiting fever jaundice Gallstones in the gallbladder (cholelithiasis) Inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) Gallstones in the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) caused by gallstones When the liver’s duct is compressed by gallstones, causing jaundice When a gallstone penetrates into the duodenum Gallbladder inflammation without gallstones (acalculous cholecystitis) Large polyps are present in the gallbladder"
How is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed?,"'A gastrointestinal surgeon usually performs a laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. The surgery may take up to two hours.' The patient will undergo blood tests and imaging tests such as CT and HIDA scans. The patient must not eat or drink 8 hours before the procedure. The patient must stop taking blood thinners some days prior to the surgery as per the doctor’s advice. The patient must check with the doctor before taking any regular medications and inform of any allergies. The patient is usually given antibiotics prior to the surgery. The patient lies on their back. An anesthesiologist administers general anesthesia and monitors the patient’s blood pressure, pulse and heart rate during the surgery. The doctor inflates the abdomen with carbon dioxide to improve visibility. The surgeon makes small incisions (usually four) in the skin on the right side of the abdomen below the ribs. The surgeon inserts the laparoscope and clips the blood vessels and tubes connected to the gallbladder, guided by images in a monitor. The surgeon cuts and removes the gallbladder through one of the incisions. The surgeon stops any bleeding, removes the laparoscope and sutures the incisions. The anesthesiologist brings the patient out of anesthesia and administers painkillers. The patient is monitored for four to six hours in the recovery room. The patient may be discharged the same day or the next if all is stable."
What are the side effects of laparoscopic cholecystectomy?,"'The side effects of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy usually resolve on their own in a couple of days. Side effects include:' Anesthetic side effects such as headache, nausea and confusion Pain at the incision sites, and in the shoulders due to the gas used to inflate the abdomen Gas and bloating Diarrhea or constipation Difficulty in digesting fat while the body gets used to functioning without a gallbladder -- this may become permanent."
How long does it take to recover from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy?,"'It usually takes about a week to ten days to get back to normal activities after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, heavy lifting and strenuous activities must be avoided for up to six weeks. Post-surgery, following a high-''fiber'' ''diet'' and drinking plenty of water are important.' "
Is laparoscopic cholecystectomy safe?,'Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgeries worldwide and is relatively safe. It is minimally invasive with little post-surgical ''pain'' and short recovery period.' 
What are the complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy?,"'Like any major surgery, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy entails a few risks and complications:' Infection Pneumonia Blood clots Bleeding caused by injury to blood vessels Injury to surrounding organs such as the liver, stomach or bowel Bile leak from bile duct injury which may require further surgery Persistent abdominal pain and flatulence (postcholecystectomy syndrome) caused by retained bile duct stone, inflammation, or blocked flow of bile and digestive juices into the bowel (sphincter of Oddi dysfunction)"
What is laryngitis?,"'The definition of ''laryngitis'' is an inflammation of the larynx (the voice box that contains the vocal cords). In ''laryngitis'' the vocal cords that are responsible for sounds made by the voice become inflamed and possibly swollen, which results in a voice change that may sound hoarse, raspy, or low volume; so that others can hardly hear what you say. Laryngitis may be acute or chronic, although most cases are acute and not serious. There are both infectious and noninfectious causes of laryngitis.' "
Is laryngitis contagious?,"'The most common cause of laryngitis is a viral infection that lasts about one to two weeks. Other common causes of laryngitis are overuse of the larynx (singing, shouting, for example) or exposure to an irritant. However, other more serious conditions (for example, ''cancer'' of the throat'') may infrequently cause laryngitis.''The ''viruses'' that cause laryngitis are not very ''contagious''. Most researchers suggest that the most contagious time frame for laryngitis is when the infected person has a ''fever''. Less frequent causes of laryngitis that are potentially contagious are bacterial, and rarely, fungal infection.''Other causes of laryngitis that are not contagious are'   mechanical overuse of the larynx (for example, strenuous singing or talking), chemical irritants (pollutants), or other underlying medical problems (throat cancer, for example) that cause laryngitis are not considered to be contagious."
How will I know I have laryngitis?,"'Besides ''hoarseness'', other symptoms of laryngitis are voice changes such as a weak voice or ''loss of voice''. Other symptoms of laryngitis include'""A doctor can diagnose laryngitis by the patient's history and physical exam. Chronic, severe or recurrent laryngitis may require that the larynx be visualized by a specialist who will likely use an endoscope to visualize the vocal cords. Infrequently, a biopsy of laryngeal tissue may be done.""   a raw or irritated feeling in your throat, sore throat, throat seems to be dry, a tickling sensation in the throat, or dry cough."
How is laryngitis spread?,"'Contagious causes of laryngitis (mainly viruses, but potentially, bacteria and fungi) are usually spread from person to person; however, the spread or transfer of the bacteria, viruses, or fungi that cause laryngitis is not particularly effective. If laryngitis is contagious, ''coughing'', ''sneezing'', and saliva are the likely ways it is spread to others.' "
When will I know I'm cured of laryngitis?,"'Usually, a person with laryngitis (acute or chronic) is cured when their voice returns to normal. This usually occurs within two weeks in people with acute laryngitis. Chronic laryngitis may take much longer time for the voice to return to normal. If the vocal cords have been seriously damaged, the voice may never return to normal.'  "
When should I contact a health care professional about laryngitis?,"'Laryngitis caused mainly by viruses, vocal overuse or strain, usually goes away without the need to contact a health care professional. However, you should seek medical attention if you have any of the following:''Chronic laryngitis may indicate other underlying causes of laryngitis (extreme overuse, or ''cancer'', for example) and anyone with chronic laryngitis should see a health care professional.' coughing up blood constant fever increasing pain in the throat trouble swallowing trouble breathing high-pitched breathing sounds (stridor) drooling"
Why is laser peripheral iridotomy done?,"'Peripheral iridotomy is done to treat the raised eye pressure in the ‘''Angle-closure glaucoma''’.''The ‘angle’ is the space between the ''iris'' (colored part of the eye) and the ''cornea'' (transparent layer covering the iris). This ‘angle’ is important because it contains the drainage channels for the eye fluid. Any narrowing of this ‘angle’ can cause these drainage channels (trabecular meshwork) to clog, causing raised eye pressure. Raise eye pressure (''glaucoma'') is dangerous for the ''optic nerve'' and can lead to ''blindness''.''The peripheral laser iridotomy is an extra opening created surgically over the iris. It creates an additional draining channel and thus relieves the raised eye pressure.' "
How is laser peripheral iridotomy done?,"'The procedure takes around ten minutes in the outpatient setting. The doctor will explain the procedure to you and put eye drops in the eye to make the pupil small and the iris tense. 30 minutes after the drops are put into the eye, the doctor will make you sit near the Laser machine.\xa0''He will place a contact ''lens'' over your eye. The lens absorbs the heat emitting from the laser during the procedure and protects the cornea from ''burns''.''The doctor will shoot the laser at the iris to make a small hole over it. The hole is made at a 3-o-clock or a 9-o-clock position in the iris nearer to its outer margin. The hole must be about 1.5-2 millimeters in size to provide adequate drainage for the eye fluid. Sometimes multiple iridotomies may be required to make ensure adequate fluid drainage.''After the procedure, there may be temporary increased ''ocular'' pressure due to the clogging of the drainage system by the iris particles. It is therefore important that the person is made to wait in the clinic and the eye pressure is measured at 30 minutes, one hour, and two hours after the procedure.''If the eye pressure is more than 30 mm Hg, or if it has increased by 8 mm Hg compared to the pre-operative value, the person is to be monitored for ''glaucoma'' and anti-glaucoma drops are prescribed.' "
What should I expect after the procedure?,"'You can go home the same day after the procedure. However, you are not allowed to drive. So, make sure you bring someone to take you home.''The eye drops used during the procedure may cause blurry vision lasting for the day. You may have a foreign body sensation in the eye for a few days after the surgery. Other problems might be glares (inability to look at bright lights) and halos (bright circles that surround a light source, like headlights). These are temporary problems and go away on their own. People on blood thinners or ''warfarin'' are at a high risk of bleeding during the procedure.''\xa0Your doctor will give you eye drops for the reduction of your eye pressure and redness. You must use the drops as directed by your doctor. Make sure you wash your hands before touching the drops or the eye. The doctor will schedule follow-up visits a week after and later in the fourth or the sixth week. During the first visit, he will look for the patency of the hole and measure the eye pressure. He will also measure the ‘angle’ with a test called gonioscopy.''At the next follow-ups, the doctor will check your eye pressure again. He will decide if you need to continue the eye pressure drops for a longer time. You may need to wear an eye patch for about six weeks to minimize the discomfort.\xa0''In some cases, a repeat procedure may be needed if the first iridotomy fails or is inadequate.' "
What is laser resurfacing?,"'Laser resurfacing is a cosmetic procedure done to provide a more youthful and rejuvenated appearance to the skin. It is also called a laser peel, laser vaporization, and lasabrasion. It can reduce the age-related changes on the skin, such as facial ''wrinkles'', ''scars'', and blemishes. It acts by removing the superficial layers of the skin resulting in the formation of new collagen fibers that render a healthier, firmer, and tighter skin. It also helps to remove unwanted or damaged skin and treat uneven skin tone. Advances in laser technologies have evolved this procedure that allows the ''plastic surgeon'' to make the required improvements to your skin with great precision, especially in the delicate areas.'

What is laser resurfacing done for?,"'Laser resurfacing is beneficial in treating the following skin issues:' Fine lines or wrinkles around or under the eyes, forehead, or mouth Acne scars Age spots Scars from infections like chickenpox Sun-damaged skin Nonresponsive skin after a facelift Liver spots (flat tan, brown or black spots on the skin due to aging) Dull yellowish or grayish skin tones Warts Birthmarks or moles Enlarged oil glands Uneven skin Crow feet Sagging skin"
Is laser resurfacing painful?,"'That depends on the type of laser resurfacing sought. How laser resurfacing will feel depends on several factors, mainly:''The laser treatments, which results in removing the outer skin layers (ablative lasers), one may feel like a rubber band snapping against the skin.''Thus, different people may experience varying levels of discomfort during therapy. Your doctor may administer local anesthetic injections or IV sedation to keep you comfortable. This is especially done in the deeper ablative (involving the removal of some outer layers of skin) laser treatments, such as CO2 lasers and Erbium YAG lasers.''In nonablative laser resurfacing procedures, the laser passes through the skin without removing the skin layers. Nonablative procedures cause little to no ''pain'' at all. They may require only a topical (applied on the skin) numbing cream to keep away any pain or discomfort. Pulsed-dye lasers are commonly used nonablative lasers.''After the laser resurfacing procedure, your skin may stay red or pink for up to several months. For up to a year after the procedure, your skin may be extra sensitive to sunlight. There may be some amount of tenderness in the area treated. Your doctor will recommend ways to minimize the discomfort after the procedure. You may need to avoid sun exposure and apply ''sunscreen'' daily and liberally.'

What is leprosy?,"'Leprosy'"", also termed Hansen's disease, is a chronic infection caused by the bacterium ""'Mycobacterium leprae'', a rod-shaped organism that stains reddish when an acid-fast stain is applied. Historians suggest leprosy was recognized as a disease as early as 600 BC; because of the disfigurement of individuals with untreated leprosy, people with leprosy have been shunned and isolated for many centuries. Fortunately, current multidrug therapy (MDT) has reduced leprosy so effectively that only a few countries still have individuals with this disease. Currently, the disease is rarely seen in the United States.''Leprosy has been classified into two major types: tuberculoid and lepromatous. However, there are intermediate subtypes (borderline, mid-borderline, and others). Tuberculoid leprosy has a more limited disease pattern and relatively few bacteria located in the infected tissue, while patients with ''lepromatous leprosy'' have widespread disease and much larger numbers of bacteria in infected tissue. These terms are still seen in the literature but are being replaced by the terms ''paucibacillary'' (for tuberculoid) and ''multibacillary'' (for lepromatous) types.''Mycobacterium leprae'' can infect armadillos that are indigenous to the southwest United States; occasionally, people can get leprosy if they handle these animals. Another form of leprosy is seen in ''dogs'' and cats (canine leprosy). Although canine leprosy is caused by ''Mycobacterium'' species, there is no good evidence that canine leprosy is transmitted to humans by pets.' "
Is leprosy contagious?,"'Leprosy is ''contagious'' but is considered to be only mildly contagious. However, acquisition of the disease usually occurs after long-term (months to years) contact with an untreated individual with the disease. It is passed from person to person via droplets from the nose and mouth during close and frequent contact with an untreated individual with leprosy.' "
What is the incubation period for leprosy?,"'The bacteria are slow-growing; the incubation period for leprosy is about five years (two to 10 years), and it can take as long as about 20 years before symptoms and signs of leprosy (skin lesions, nerve damage, for example) develop in some patients. ' "
How will I know if someone has leprosy?,"'Because symptoms appear so slowly after infection (from about two to 10 years), it may be difficult to tell that someone has leprosy. Skin lesions (lumps, ''bumps'', or sores), loss of eyebrows, and numbness in the skin where lesions are present are often among the first signs and symptoms of leprosy. Other signs and symptoms include thick ''dry skin'', muscle ''weakness'' or ''paralysis'', nosebleeds, ulcers (especially on the ''feet''), numbness, and/or severe ''pain''. As the disease progresses, extremities may be slowly lost (for example, toes, fingers, and nose). The diagnosis of leprosy can be made by scraping lesions and staining the skin scrapings of lesions and/or mucous secretions with an acid-fast stain to demonstrate the presence of ''Mycobacterium leprae''.' "
How is leprosy transmitted?,"""Leprosy (Hansen's disease) is spread from person to person. This spread can occur with direct person-to-person contact and/or by contaminated droplets that are released during ""'coughing'' or ''sneezing''. Individuals who inhale the contaminated droplets can develop leprosy.' "
How will I know someone is cured of leprosy?,"'Before the 1940s, there was no effective cure for leprosy. Since that time, antimicrobial medications have been used to stop or limit the disease. The key to the cure of leprosy is early treatment before irreparable damage to the patient occurs. Currently, leprosy is treatable with combination antibiotic therapy that lasts for about six months to two years, depending on the extent of the disease in an individual patient. Most individuals can be cured of leprosy; this occurs when all of the slow-growing ''Mycobacterium leprae'"" bacteria are killed by the antibiotic treatment and the patient's immune response. However, even though the person is cured of leprosy by antibiotic treatment, damage to organ systems (nerve damage, tissue loss) that has occurred during the infection will not be repaired."" "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about leprosy?,"'Individual should contact medical ''caregiver'' if they have a high risk of exposure to leprosy and develop any symptoms or signs of the condition. For example, individuals who live in a country where leprosy is endemic, like Brazil, India, Nepal, the Marshall Islands, and several other countries (see references for an extensive list), have a higher chance of developing leprosy.''Armadillos, commonly found in the southern United States, can be naturally infected and carry ''Mycobacterium leprae''. It is possible to become infected after handling these animals. People who handle armadillos and develop any signs or symptoms of leprosy should inform a physician about their contact with armadillos.'  "
What is a lumpectomy?,"'Lumpectomy''\xa0is a surgical procedure to remove a mass (cancerous or non-cancerous) from the breasts. In a lumpectomy, only the affected portion of the breast is removed, without removing the surrounding healthy breast tissue. Lumpectomy\xa0is also called breast-conserving surgery. Lumpectomy is a commonly performed surgery but still ''major surgery''\xa0with risks and potential complications. Later on, additional treatments may be required following a lumpectomy such as ''chemotherapy'' and ''radiation therapy''. For non-cancerous (benign) tumors, a lumpectomy may suffice.''Fibroadenoma ''is the most common type of benign, non-cancerous ''tumor'' of the breasts. It usually occurs in young, pre-menopausal women aged between 15 and 40 years. It may also arise during ''pregnancy'' or ''breastfeeding''. They usually do not cause complications and can be treated easily with surgery.''Breast cancer'' arises from the cells of the breasts and can spread to other parts of the body (''metastasis''). Although extremely rare, ''breast cancer'' can sometimes occur in men. If the growth is relatively small, without local invasion, and limited to one breast, a lumpectomy can be done. If not, other surgical procedures may be required.' "
When should a lumpectomy be not done?,"'Lumpectomy may be contraindicated in the following cases:' Multiple tumors in the breast that cannot be removed with a lumpectomy, which could affect the appearance of your breast Radiation therapy to the breast before surgery Cancer that has spread throughout the breast or opposite breast and involving the overlying skin Having a large tumor with small breasts, which may cause a poor cosmetic result If there is no access to radiation therapy because radiation therapy may be required for cancerous growths after a lumpectomy History of scleroderma (a condition that causes hardening of the skin and other tissues), making healing difficult after surgery History of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an auto-immune, chronic inflammatory disease"
How is a lumpectomy performed?,"'During the procedure:''A lumpectomy is usually performed under general anesthesia, so there will be no ''pain'' or discomfort during the procedure. The surgeon makes a cut over the tumor or area of the abnormal tissue. The tumor is completely removed along with a margin of surrounding healthy tissue and then sent to the lab for examination by a pathologist.''The surgeon then closes the ''wound'' with ''stitches'' (''sutures'') that may be absorbable and dissolve on their own or removed later by the surgeon.''After the procedure:' Painkillers and antibiotics would be administered. The dressing may be removed after 48 hours. Patients may be discharged the same day or 24 hours after the surgery. Post-operative pain, swelling, and bruising are normal and usually resolve in a week. Patients can resume daily activities 24-72 hours after the surgery. Complete recovery may take around two to four weeks."
What are the complications of a lumpectomy?,"'Some possible complications include:' Bleeding Hematoma (blood clot formation) Infection Pain Swelling  Bruising  Reaction to anesthesia  Decreased sensation or numbness around the surgical site, which is usually transient  Formation of unsightly hard scar tissue or keloid at the surgical site Change in the shape, symmetry, and appearance of the breast Recurrence of the tumor if tumor cells are left behind "
What is lupus?,'Lupus'' is a general term that refers to any of the various chronic inflammatory diseases that are marked by inflammation of the skin and are caused by autoimmunity. Classic ''lupus'' is also termed ''systemic lupus erythematosus'' (''SLE'') and typically initially appears as a ''rash'' accompanied by ''joint pain'' and ''fever''. There are many subclasses of ''lupus''.' 
Is lupus contagious?,"'Lupus'' is not ''contagious'"". Lupus cannot be transferred from one person to another by touching the skin lesions or by physical contact. The specific cause of lupus is not known, but many genetic predispositions (HLA types, regulatory genes) and gene-environment interactions (UV exposure, the immune system's response to microbes and/or ""'drugs'') have been identified that predispose individuals to develop this autoimmune disease.' "
How will someone know if he or she has lupus?,"'If a person has an onset of joint ''pain'', ''fever'', and a ''rash'', lupus is considered as a possible cause. If the person is ''pregnant'' or if there is a family history of lupus or any autoimmune disease, the diagnosis of SLE becomes more likely. However the American College of ''Rheumatology'' has developed criteria that can be helpful in diagnosing the systemic form of lupus (SLE). There are 11 diagnostic basic criteria. When an individual has at least four of these criterions, they are likely to have ''systemic lupus erythematosus'' (SLE). Briefly, the following is a list of the 11 criteria:''The diagnosis is usually made by a medical ''caregiver'' skilled in the diagnosis of lupus (such as rheumatologists or dermatologists).' Serositis (inflammation of the lining of the lungs or abdomen) Oral ulcers Arthritis (inflammation of many joints) Photosensitivity (rash after sun exposure) Blood disorders (low white, red, or platelet blood counts) Kidney problems (renal failure) Gastrointestinal problems (nausea, abdominal pain) Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) Immunologic abnormalities (DNA antibody, cardiolipin antibody, false positive VDRL) Neurologic disorder (seizures or psychosis) Cardiac problems (pericarditis, myocarditis) Facial cheek reddish rash (malar rash) Focal areas of hyper- and hypopigmentation and scarring (discoid rash)"
Can lupus spread?,"'Lupus does not spread from one individual to another. However, in an individual, the manifestations of the disease and their severity may increase in intensity and location over time.' "
Is there a cure for lupus?,"'There is no cure for lupus. Fortunately, there are many different drugs that can be used to reduce symptoms and control the disease. Treatments are individualized usually by the specialist, such as a ''rheumatologist'' for joint and internal organ problems, dermatologist for skin problems and/or other specialists depending upon what organ system is affected.' "
When should someone seek medical care for lupus?,"'If a person suspects that they may have risk factors and some symptoms (see criteria above) of SLE, the individual should seek medical care quickly. The earlier the person is diagnosed and begins treatment, the better the outcome for the patient. Early intervention that reduces lupus inflammation helps protect body organs.' "
What is Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease'' (named after the town where it was discovered) is caused by the bacterium ''Borrelia burgdorferi'"" when the bite of an infected tick (black legged tick) transfers the bacterium to humans during the tick's blood meal. ""'Lyme disease'' typically cause ''fever'', ''headache'', ''fatigue'', and often shows a characteristic skin ''rash'"" that looks like a bull's-eye target (""'erythema migrans''). The disease can spread to the joints, heart, and the nervous system. Other mammals can be infected (for example, ''dogs'') by tick bites. However, direct human-to-human, animal-to-animal and transmission between humans and animals does not occur. Only if a tick bites an infected person or animal, becomes infected, and then bites another human or animal, can the disease be transferred.' "
Is Lyme disease contagious?,"'Lyme disease'' is not ''contagious'' from person to person and, to date, has not been reported to be transmitted sexually, by kissing, by blood transfusions, or infected animals (for example, pet dogs). ''Lyme disease'' is transmitted to humans by infected ''ticks'', usually through the bites of ticks that are immature and are termed ""nymphs."" The ticks (nymph stage) are tiny (less than 2 mm diameter) and take about 36-48 hours of attachment to the human before the bacteria that cause Lyme disease are transmitted.' "
How will I know if I have Lyme disease?,"'Usually, a reddish expanding ''rash'' (''erythema migrans'') begins about three to 30 days after an infected ''tick bite''. This rash occurs in about 70%-80% of individuals who become infected and spreads to about 12 inches in diameter and often forms a ""bull\'s-eye"" pattern on the skin. The rash may appear on other parts of the body also and may not form the ""bull\'s-eye"" pattern. Other symptoms and signs that may come and go and are considered later signs (after days to months) are as follows:''Some individuals are not sure they have been bitten by a tick; these individuals who develop any of the symptoms above can be tested to see if they have evidence of Lyme disease. The testing should be done by their physician and the results must be carefully interpreted since the immunoassay tests for Lyme disease may sometimes give equivocal results. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a two-tiered immunoassay (enzyme immunoassay or EIA plus a ""Western blot"") testing system for Lyme disease that is reasonably reliable.' Bell's palsy (facial paralysis on one side of the face) Additional rash formation Pain and swelling of the joints Shooting pains that may interfere with sleep Severe headaches and/or neck stiffness Heart palpitations Episodes of dizziness and/or shortness of breath Short-term memory problems Inflammation of the brain and/or spinal cord"
How is Lyme disease transmitted?,"'Lyme disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick and it is not spread from person to person. However, Lyme disease can spread in the community if large areas of tall grasses and brush that surround homes or other places where people congregate become areas where infected ticks reside and where people walk or congregate. Methods to reduce tall grasses and brushy areas where ticks like to live will help control spread of Lyme disease to other individuals. People can protect themselves from tick bites by utilizing repellent sprays and by covering their body with long pants and long-sleeve shirts to help prevent ticks from reaching exposed skin.' "
When will I know I am cured of Lyme disease? How long does Lyme disease last?,"'Patients treated with antibiotics (for example, ''doxycycline'' [''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox'', Acticlate, Acticlate Cap, Doryx, Doxteric, Doxy], ''amoxicillin'' [''Amoxil'', ''Moxatag'', ''Larotid''], ''cefuroxime'' [''Ceftin'', ''Zinacef'']) in the early stages (about one to 30 days after an infected tick bite) usually recover fairly quickly (days to weeks) with no neurological or cardiac problems. A few individuals may go on to develop post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (sometimes incorrectly termed ""chronic Lyme disease"") in which patients after an appropriate course of antibiotics still have lingering symptoms of ''fatigue'', ''pain'', joint, and muscle aches for up to about six months after antibiotics have been administered. The cause of the syndrome has not been identified, but some researchers think it may be due to a combination of immune responses and residual damage to cells. However, patients adequately treated with antibiotics no longer have the causative bacteria in their system during this syndrome, and this syndrome does not need to be treated with additional antibiotics.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about Lyme disease?,"'If you are unsure that you have been bitten by tick yet you develop a rash, especially if it begins to form a ""bull\'s-eye"" pattern, you should contact a physician. In addition, even if you know you have been infected with Lyme disease, you should contact your physician immediately for appropriate therapy. If you suspect that you have been misdiagnosed or undertreated for Lyme disease, contact your physician or an infectious-disease specialist. Also, if a ''pregnant'"" woman becomes infected, she can transfer the disease to her fetus. If you're pregnant and suspect you may have been exposed to Lyme disease by tick bites, contact your ob-gyn physician immediately."" "
What is malaria?,"'Malaria'' is an infectious disease caused by parasites that invade ''red blood cells''. The protozoan parasites are among several species of the genus ''Plasmodium'"". This malaria parasite is transmitted by mosquitoes (vectors) to humans through mosquito bites that, during the bite, release parasites into the person's blood. Malaria is characterized by cycles of ""'chills'', high ''fever'', and ''sweating''.'  "
Is malaria contagious?,"'No, malaria is not ''contagious''. Malaria is not spread from person to person and is not sexually transmitted. Malaria is not contagious through casual contact or through kissing. It is not considered a sexual transmitted disease (''STD''). Malaria is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans. There is one strain of the parasite ''Plasmodium'', ''P. knowlesi'', that can be transmitted from monkeys (macaques) by mosquitoes to humans and is termed ""zoonotic"" malaria.' "
What is the incubation period for malaria?,"'The time period from initial parasite infection to the appearance of symptoms varies according to the particular species of ''Plasmodium'' that infects an individual. For example, ''P. malariae'' ranges from about 18-40 days, while ''P. falciparum'' ranges from nine to 14 days, and 12-18 days for ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale''. Initial symptoms of malaria may include shaking chills, high fevers, ''sweating'', ''headaches'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''anemia'', and/or ''diarrhea''. Diagnostic tests include microscopic examination of the blood for the presence of parasites, serology, ''PCR'' testing, and other tests that determine if the parasite is resistant to certain ''drugs''.''Travelers returning from malaria-endemic areas should remind health-care providers about their travels for at least one year after they have returned from that area of the world to avoid potentially missing the diagnosis of the disease.' "
How does malaria spread?,"'The majority of malarial infections are spread or transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes that take a blood meal from humans. During this blood meal, ''Plasmodium'"" parasites are regurgitated by the mosquito into the person's blood vessels. The parasites require both mosquitoes and humans to go through a complete and complex lifecycle that involves several life stages for development and maturation of the parasites. Malaria is not transmitted person to person. Although it is an infectious disease, it is not communicable in most instances to uninfected individuals. It is possible to transmit malaria through blood transfusions, to a fetus, or by organ donation. However, control measures have markedly reduced such transmissions."" "
"How long does malaria last, and how long will it take to be cured of malaria?","'Treatment of malaria depends on the number of different factors that include disease severity, the particular species of ''Plasmodium'' infecting the patient and the potential for ''drug resistance'' of the various species and strains of ''Plasmodium''. In general, it takes about two weeks of treatment to be cured of malaria. However, in some individuals, relapses are possible.' "
When should people seek medical care for a suspected malaria infection?,"'If an individual has visited or lived in an area where malaria is endemic (including parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America) and subsequently develops a ''headache'', high ''fever'' that comes and goes, ''fatigue'', body ''aches'', and/or shaking chills (rigors) and ''cough'', he or she should seek immediate medical attention. Patients should tell medical caregivers if they have lived in or traveled to areas where malaria is endemic. This will help the medical caregivers to order appropriate tests to confirm malaria. The most severe problems (''pulmonary edema'', ''kidney failure'', ''brain injury'', death) are seen mainly with ''P. falciparum'' infections.' "
What is breast mastopexy (breast lift)?,"'Breast sagging occurs with ''aging'', hormonal changes, ''weight loss'' and ''breastfeeding''. The breast lift, also known as mastopexy, is a procedure designed to lift and shape sagging breasts.\xa0\xa0''More than 100,000 mastopexies were performed in the United States in 2018, according to a report published by the American Society of ''Plastic'' Surgeons.''Generally, mastopexy is less painful than other cosmetic breast procedures\xa0and requires minimal follow-up care.' "
How do surgeons decide how to approach mastopexy?,"'Sagging of the female breast is medically referred to as ''ptosis'' of the breast. Cosmetic surgeons classify sagging breasts according to the grades listed below. This helps guide potential mastopexy options:\xa0' Grade 1: In mild ptosis, the nipple lies just below the natural boundary of the breast (inframammary fold) but still above the lower portion of the breasts Grade 2: With moderate ptosis, the nipple goes further below the inframammary fold but with some lower portion of breasts present below the nipple Grade 3: With severe ptosis, nipple goes well below the inframammary fold, and no lower portion mass present Pseudoptosis: The sagging of the lower portion of the breast with the nipple at or above the inframammary fold."
Who should not undergo mastopexy?," If you are planning for pregnancy, you should not undergo this surgery because breastfeeding might alter the breast structure If you had recurrent breast cancer, mastopexy might hinder detection or treatment of cancer If you are obese or have diabetes If you are addicted to smoking If you have contracted implants after breast augmentation"
How to prepare for breast mastopexy," If you fulfill all the criteria mentioned above, and if you wish to proceed with the surgery, discuss your goals and expectations with the surgeon. You will have to detail your medical and medication history and any related history. You may undergo a mammogram before the surgery if you are 35 or older. Your surgeon will discuss with you the possible risks and benefits of the procedure. Your surgeon will discuss the postoperative scars and changes in the sensation of the nipples. Your surgeon will ask for photographs that might help the surgeon to detect any asymmetries before the commencement of surgery."
What happens during the breast mastopexy procedure?," Mastopexy can be performed in an outpatient setting based upon your surgeon’s choice. Your surgeon might give local or general anesthesia to make you numb or unconscious throughout the procedure.  You will lie flat on the operating table with arms extended.  Depending on the type of surgery, an incision is made, which can be  an egg-shape around the nipple, a vertical incision, or a keyhole-shape.  an egg-shape around the nipple,  a vertical incision, or a  keyhole-shape.  The nipple is detached and fixed at a higher site with a suture that keeps it intact."
How painful is a breast mastopexy? ,"'Advancement in mastopexy techniques will continue to improve recovery times and complications rates.\xa0' Wound care is minimal; you will be asked to wear a surgical bra for a few days Opioid pain medications may control postoperative pain You should limit your activities for up to six weeks Within two to three weeks, your stitches will be removed Generally, mastopexy is less painful than other cosmetic breast procedures and requires minimal follow-up care If you experience any of these side effects, immediately contact the physician:BleedingInfectionScarringAsymmetry of nipplesSensation changes of nipplesFluid built-up at the site of incision Bleeding Infection Scarring Asymmetry of nipples Sensation changes of nipples Fluid built-up at the site of incision"
What is meningitis?,"'Meningitis'' is inflammation of the membranes (meninges) that surround the brain and the spinal cord. The usual signs and ''symptoms of meningitis'' are ''headache'', ''fever'', and a ''stiff neck''. There are many types of ''meningitis''. Often meningitis is named according to the cause. For example, there are viral, bacterial, noninfectious (aseptic), and many other types of meningitis.' "
Is meningitis contagious?,"'The contagiousness is related to the specific agent that causes the disease. The following is a summary of five types of meningitis and how they may or may not be ''contagious''.' Viral meningitis: Meningitis caused by many viruses is usually contagious. However, certain viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes are usually not spread person to person, so they are not contagious. Bacterial meningitis: Bacterial meningitis is usually contagious; some bacteria more highly contagious (such as Neisseria meningitidis in young adults and Streptococcus pneumoniae in all ages) than others. Fungal meningitis: Fungal meningitis (for example, Cryptococcus meningitis) is not considered to be contagious. Parasitic meningitis: Parasitic meningitis, which is rare (for example, Naegleria fowleri), is not considered to be contagious from person to person. Noninfectious meningitis: Noninfectious meningitis is not a result of infection but is from an underlying condition or disease and not considered contagious. Causes of noninfectious meningitis include cancers in and around the brain or spinal cord, drugs, head injury, and autoimmune disease (such as lupus or Behçet's disease)."
How contagious is meningitis?,"'In short, most bacterial meningitis infections are mildly to moderately contagious person to person, while some viral meningitis are contagious but other types are not. Fungal, parasitic, and noninfectious causes of meningitis are not contagious from one person directly to another.' "
How long is meningitis contagious?,"'This depends upon which infectious agents are causing the meningitis. In general, when the patient is secreting or producing viruses or bacteria, they are considered contagious. When the patient stops secreting or producing infectious agents is when meningitis is no longer contagious. Viral caused meningitis may be contagious from three days after infection starts to about 10 days after the symptoms develop. Bacterial meningitis is usually less contagious than viral; depending on the bacterial genus causing the infection, it may be contagious during the incubation period and for about an additional seven to 14 days. And they can be contagious for much longer (many days to months) if the person becomes a carrier. The contagious period may be shortened with antibiotic treatments.' "
What is the incubation period for meningitis?,"'The incubation period for bacterial meningitis, the most serious types of meningitis, is about three to five days after initial contact with the microbe. However, in some individuals, bacterial ''meningitis symptoms'' can occur as rapidly as 24 hours. For viral meningitis, the incubation period can range widely from only a few days to a few weeks. Patients who get meningitis usually have symptoms of ''headache'', ''fever'', and a ''stiff neck''. They may also develop ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''photophobia'', and alteration of their mental state. Children with meningitis may appear to be lethargic, drowsy, have a high-pitched cry, may develop a ''rash'', and dislike being held.''Besides the history and physical exam, the physician is likely to do a ''spinal tap'' to analyze spinal fluid to detect the agent involved. Bacteria, viruses, or other agents may be identified by subsequent tests of the spinal fluid, including microscopic identification, culture, and immunological tests. In addition, blood and urine samples are also analyzed. Identification of the precise microbe allows the physician to diagnose the type of meningitis and proceed with accurate treatments.' "
How does meningitis spread?,"'Meningitis is transmitted to people by many methods. Both bacterial and viral meningitis are spread person to person similarly. Person-to-person spread can happen with direct and indirect contact between individuals (''coughing'' up droplets, contact with the feces, ''sneezing'', saliva, kissing, or eating contaminated food). Indirect spread by using the same utensils, cups, and other items used by an infected individual can also spread the disease to others. Some ''fungal infections'' are transmitted by airborne dust particles. In addition, other types of meningitis can be transferred to humans by vectors such as mosquitoes (for example, ''West Nile virus'') or ''ticks'' (''Lyme disease'').' "
How long does meningitis last?,"'Viral meningitis lasts about seven to 10 days with symptoms receding gradually. Bacterial meningitis is usually cured by antibiotics. The time to cure varies with each individual and corresponds with the decrease of symptoms. If bacterial meningitis is not treated rapidly with antibiotics, there can be long-term injury to the brain and even death.' "
When should someone seek medical care for meningitis?,"'Individuals should contact a medical ''caregiver'' immediately about meningitis if they suspect that they have been exposed to bacterial meningitis. Meningitis, especially bacterial meningitis, is considered a medical emergency; if an individual develops early ''symptoms of meningitis'' (high ''fever'', ''headache'', and/or ''neck stiffness'') or becomes ill after contacting an individual known to have contagious meningitis, he or she should seek medical care emergently. Bacterial meningitis has about a 10% death rate unless it is treated early in the infection.''Infants with meningitis may develop a firm or bulging soft spot on the head. Other problems that can develop at any age are ''seizures'', altered consciousness, and difficulty ''breathing''. Individuals with these symptoms should immediately go to an emergency department. If an infant or child exhibits such serious ''meningitis symptoms'', if possible, seek a hospital that offers pediatric ''emergency medicine''.' "
What are micropigmentation and microblading?,"'Micropigmentation''\xa0and microblading are both popular semi-''permanent makeup'' treatments performed by a professional. Micropigmentation delivers pigment deeper into the skin compared to microblading. The results of micropigmentation last twice as long as microblading.\xa0 So, while it is still a semi-permanent technique, the results last much longer. Microblading is usually done to enhance the eyebrows and lasts for an average of 1 to 1.5 years. Micropigmentation can be done for the eyebrows, other parts of the face or body and the ''scalp''. It lasts for an average of 3 years.''The results of both micropigmentation and microblading are cosmetically satisfactory and they are safe procedures. However, microblading is a relatively safer technique. This is because, in microblading, the pigment is only deposited in the superficial layers whereas in micropigmentation the pigmentation is deposited into the deeper layers of the skin. There is also a higher risk of an ''allergic reaction'' to the pigment and infection with permanent ''makeup''. In microblading, the pigments used are much safer. Both procedures can result in ''pain'', swelling, redness, ''bruising'' and scabbing after the treatment, which usually resolves in a week. Since microblading doesn’t last as long as micropigmentation, first timers may try microblading initially to get a feel for the new eyebrows before going in for a longer lasting procedure.' "
What is microblading?,"'Microblading is a noninvasive technique that uses a fine needle pen to deposit pigment into the superficial layers of the skin. It is typically used to enhance the appearance of eyebrows in those who have very thin eyebrows or who lose eyebrows due to medical conditions or ''aging'', which creates cosmetic concerns. The tip of the needle is so fine that the hair ''strokes'' created by it look like real hair. The patient experiences mild ''pain'', which is similar to getting a ''tattoo''. A numbing cream can be applied before the procedure to minimize pain.' "
How long do microblading results last?,"'A touch-up is usually required a month after the initial treatment. The pigment can last anywhere between 1 to 3 years, but it may start fading after 1.5 years. Using skin exfoliating agents like retinol, glycolic or salicylic acid over the eyebrows may hasten fading.' "
What is micropigmentation?,"'Micropigmentation is sometimes referred to as semi-permanent makeup. It is also a noninvasive semi-permanent makeup treatment. It may be performed to enhance the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, eyelids for eyeliner and lips (to color correct). Micropigmentation can also be used to camouflage or improve the appearance of ''scars'', even out skin tone and restore color to areas of skin that have lost color because of conditions like ''vitiligo''. It reduces the time spent on applying makeup and, in the long run, it reduces the cost of buying makeup. Microblading is typically done using a manual blade while micropigmentation is performed using a ''tattoo'' device to deliver pigment into the deeper layers of the skin. Micropigmentation has the option of natural colors.''Micropigmentation may be used for the following' Minimizing the appearance of scars To replace hair in cases of thinning hair or baldness To enhance the appearance of eyebrows, replace the loss of eyebrows due to aging or medical conditions To camouflage depigmentation (lack of color) of the skin due to vitiligo To recreate an areola (the pigmented area around the nipple) following breast surgery As semi-permanent makeup (eyeliner, lip color, semi-permanent foundation)"
How long do micropigmentation results last?,"'In permanent tattoos, the carbon ingredient in the color causes the pigment to get oxidized over time and the color may appear different. In semi-permanent makeup, there is iron oxide, which does not cause a change in color but causes the pigment to fade over time. Micropigmentation usually lasts about 3 years, which is considerably longer than microblading.' "
What is mono (mononucleosis)?,"'Mono'' (also termed ''mononucleosis'' or ''infectious mononucleosis'') is a disease caused by the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' (EBV). Children are commonly infected with EBV and show few or no symptoms. Older individuals, teenagers, and adults may show symptoms when infected. These consist mainly of ''fatigue'', ''fever'', inflamed throat, and ''swollen lymph nodes'' in the neck. Infected people may also have a ''rash'', swollen ''liver'', or ''enlarged spleen''. Most of the symptoms get better within two to four weeks, but some people can be fatigued for several months. The EBV virus can become inactive after infection, and some people reactivate EBV infection even years later.' "
Is mono contagious?,"'Mono is ''contagious'"" from person to person, especially via an infected person's saliva. Other transmission methods include blood, semen, blood transfusions, and organ transplants. Unfortunately, EBV can also be spread by contact with objects like toothbrushes or eating utensils that are contaminated with EBV. Mono can be spread to ""'babies'', children, and adults. Individuals who have mono can be contagious without the characteristic symptoms of ''fever'', ''fatigue'', or swollen glands; some people can be contagious during the incubation period when no symptoms are present.' "
How do I know if I have mono?,"'Symptoms of EBV infection may include some or most of the following symptoms:'""Many diseases produce similar symptoms, so the diagnosis is usually based on the patient's history, physical, and EBV antibody tests (for example, IgG, IgM, and VCA antibody tests, Monospot test, and others). Interpretation of these tests is not always definitive."" Fatigue Inflamed throat Fever Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Enlarged spleen and/or liver Rash"
How is mono transmitted? What is the incubation period for mono?,"'Mono (mononucleosis) is spread from person to person. It is usually not spread by airborne droplets (it can be in some instances when saliva is sprayed and then inhaled) but by direct contact with an infected person\'s saliva. Because of the predominant way mono is spread (saliva), it has been termed the ""kissing disease."" The incubation period (from time of exposure to EBV to symptom development) is about four to seven weeks, and some people can spread the disease during the incubation period and up to 18 months later. Mono can be spread by blood, semen, and organ transplants. Saliva-contaminated toothbrushes, utensils, and contact with other EBV-contaminated objects may also spread the disease.' "
When will I know I am cured of mono?,"'Unfortunately, the term ""cured"" doesn\'t relate well to mono (mononucleosis) because, once infected, a person seems to be infected with EBV for life as occasional ""reactivation"" of the virus does occur even in healthy people who show no symptoms. Most people will never notice the reactivation of EBV, but according to researchers, these reactivated ''viruses'"" are probably responsible for the occasional outbreaks in individuals who have not been infected with EBV. It's estimated that about 20%-80% of people infected with mononucleosis shed EBV occasionally for many years."" "
When should I contact a health care professional about mono?,"'The majority of individuals who get mono do not require treatment by a physician. However, if you have been diagnosed with mono and had treatment at home for seven to 10 days and you still have problems with poor energy levels, body ''aches'', and swollen ''lymph nodes'', you should contact a physician. If you have a severe ''sore throat'' that lasts longer than two to three days, you should also contact a physician. You should go to an emergency department if your ''tonsils'' become swollen and they interfere with swallowing and/or ''breathing'', or if you have severe ''pain'' in the upper abdomen in the left side (possible spleen rupture).' "
What is MRSA?,"'MRSA'' is the short form of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and refers to ''strains'' of gram-positive coccal-shaped (round) bacteria that are resistant to several antibiotics. ''MRSA'' causes mainly skin infections in nonhospitalized people; in hospitalized patients, it can cause ''sepsis'', surgical site infections, and ''pneumonia''. All of these infections may be difficult to treat because of ''MRSA'""'s resistance to antibiotics.""  "
Is MRSA contagious?,"'MRSA'' is very ''contagious'' under certain circumstances (when skin alterations or damage are present); spread occurs through person-to-person contact with a ''skin infection'' or even indirect contact, such as contact with a ''MRSA'""-infected person's clothing or towels or even from benches in gyms. All ""'MRSA'' needs to establish itself is a small break in the skin or mucosa. This is important because no breaks means no infection; for example, MRSA skin-infected or MRSA-colonized ''pregnant'' females seldom infect their fetus or infants. However, many activities such as kissing, saliva exchange, and sexual contact, although somewhat less likely to transfer MRSA to another, can cause infection if the skin or mucosa is damaged. Hospitalized patients, if they have MRSA ''pneumonia'', may transfer the organisms to others through the air by contaminated droplets. Bodies of people who die from MRSA infections often have viable MRSA on their surfaces, and these organisms can infect other people. The incubation period for MRSA ranges from one to 10 days.' "
What is the incubation period for MRSA?,"'For most ''staph'' infections, including MRSA, the incubation period is often indefinite if the organisms are colonizing (not infecting) an individual (see above). However, the incubation period for MRSA often ranges from one to 10 days if it enters broken skin or damaged mucous membranes.' "
What is the contagious period for MRSA?,"'As long as there are viable MRSA bacteria in or on an individual who is colonized with these bacteria or infected with the organisms, MRSA is ''contagious''. Consequently, a person colonized with MRSA (one who has the organism normally present in or on the body) may be contagious for an indefinite period of time. In addition, MRSA organisms can remain viable on some surfaces for about two to six months if they are not washed or sterilized.' "
How will I know I have MRSA?,"'Most MRSA skin infections first appear as a reddish bump that quickly becomes swollen, painful, and warm and contains or drains pus; they can occur almost anywhere on the body. The infected person may also develop a ''fever''. Hospitalized patients may show surgical ''wound'' infections, ''pneumonia'', or ''sepsis''. However, the definitive way to diagnose MRSA is to have a doctor culture the MRSA bacteria (skin lesion, biopsy, or nasal swab) and then show the organisms are resistant to several different antibiotics.' "
How is MRSA transmitted?,"'MRSA in the community is spread from person to person by direct contact; in addition, indirect contact is also a means of spread because the bacteria can survive on objects like towels, benches, shaving equipment, and other objects. For a person to become infected, MRSA usually needs to have a breach (''abrasion'', cut, ''rash'', or ''puncture'"") in the skin. Hospital spread of MRSA can include the above methods in addition to spread by blood, saliva, and/or droplets in the air that can land on people's skin or other surface if the person has ""'pneumonia''. Hospitalized patients who are MRSA carriers or infected with MRSA usually are put under isolation conditions (for example, gloves, masks, gowns, and minimized physical contact by visitors) to help prevent MRSA spread.''People who are colonized with MRSA far less likely to transmit the organisms to others; transmission is more likely if the patient is infected with MRSA.' "
How will I know I am cured of MRSA?,"'Many people are cured of MRSA when the symptoms resolve. However, a few individuals (about two of 100 people) carry MRSA as either transient organisms or colonizing organisms in some body areas such as the nasal mucosa but show no signs of infection. Occasionally, people can be cured of their carrier situation by topical antibiotics when they no longer are positive for MRSA cultures. ''Prevention'' of MRSA infections may be accomplished by good hand washing and body cleaning hygiene practices, especially after playing contact sports or if people live in crowded areas (dorms, camps, or barracks, for example). Although cleaning clothing and other items helps reduce the chance of getting MRSA, using a disinfecting agent like bleach, when feasible, offers an even better chance of prevention.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about MRSA?,"'If you know you have had person-to-person contact with someone diagnosed with MRSA and you begin to develop any symptoms, contact a physician urgently. If you develop symptoms or signs that might be due to MRSA, contact a medical ''caregiver'' to help diagnose your condition with tests for MRSA. If you are being treated for an infection with antibiotics and the infection is not better or is getting worse and/or you are developing ''fevers'', you should urgently or emergently, depending on the severity of symptoms, see a physician.'  "
What is multiple sclerosis (MS)?,'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) that causes ''demyelination'' (destruction of myelin that insulates and protects the nerve cells) of the brain and spinal cord nerve cells. The cause of ''multiple sclerosis'' is not known.'  
"Who gets multiple sclerosis, and how many people have it?","'Onset of the disease occurs in younger people ages 15 to 30 but can be diagnosed in older and younger persons (rarely in a child). The incidence is about 400,000 patients in the US, with a ratio of 2 to 1 females to males.''Multiple sclerosis'' is not considered to be a fatal disease although rarely it may be fatal due to complications.''The lifespan in people with this form of sclerosis, especially if it is treated early, is about the same as in the general population.' "
4 Types of MS,"'There are four types of ''multiple sclerosis'':' Relapsing: Remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of MS. Remission may last for weeks to years.There are two subgroups in RRMS, a subgroup termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) consisting of a single episode of neurologic symptoms, and subgroup termed benign MS, consisting of MS with almost complete remission between relapses and little if any accumulation of physical disability over time. There are two subgroups in RRMS, a subgroup termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) consisting of a single episode of neurologic symptoms, and subgroup termed benign MS, consisting of MS with almost complete remission between relapses and little if any accumulation of physical disability over time. Secondary: In progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) exacerbations don’t fully resolve during remission. Primary: Progressive primary multiple sclerosis (PPMS) progresses over time without episodes of remission. Progressive: In relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS) patients experience increasing symptoms over time and intermittent episodes of remission."
What are the signs and symptoms of MS?,"'Signs and ''symptoms of multiple sclerosis'' are variable and depend on the area of the destruction of the myelin protecting brain and spinal cord nerves. Consequently, people with the disease may have some symptoms that other people may not have. In general, however, early signs and symptoms include visual problems such as ''double vision'' and/or ''vision loss''. Other symptoms that may occur, depending upon the patient’s disease process, include:'  Numbness Tingling (paresthesias) Weakness Vision changes Paralysis Vertigo (the person is susceptible to the risk of falls) Lack of coordination of limbs (disability to function normally, for example, the person has difficulty walking) Muscle spasms and/or involuntary muscle contractions that are painful Urinary incontinence Sexual dysfunction Heat intolerance Slurred speech Sharp, electrical like pain that occurs in the spine with neck flexion (Lhermitte sign) Mental status changes"
"Can you get MS from people who have it, and can it passed on to children?","'There is no evidence that multiple sclerosis undergoes transmission person-to-person. Consequently, the disease is not considered to be ''contagious'' so other people cannot catch it from any person with ''MS'' they may come in contact with. It is not considered hereditary by many researchers; however, individuals that have a first degree relative (for example, a parent or sibling) that develops the disease increases the risk of developing the disease. Some new research suggests that if people inherit a genetic mutation on gene NR1H3, they may develop ''MS'' (rapidly progressive form). These findings are new, and they and other genetic factors are being investigated further.''Although lifestyle factors like ''diet'', ''smoking'', ''exercise'' influence the development of such diseases like ''cancer'' and ''diabetes'', they are not risk factors in developing MS. There is much speculation about risk factors and/or causes for MS, and they range from ''vitamin D deficiency'' to viral infections such as Epstein-Barr infections, association with black ''mold'', and even too much salt intake. None of these theories or speculations have been proven. However, a recent study at Harvard suggested that ''Epstein-Barr virus'' infection may be a trigger to set off MS in genetically susceptible individuals with ''vitamin D'' deficiency.' "
What treatments are available for MS and its symptoms?,"'Treatment of MS is often determined by the type and medical condition of the patient. ''Drugs'', either rejected or taken orally are the main medical treatments, although ''drugs'' don’t cure MS. Drug therapy can limit and/or postpone nerve damage and reduce relapse occurrences.''This is a list of drugs that may be used by your doctors and other health care professionals to treat your type of MS:''Treatment of MS should be discussed with your doctor. Patients are urged to question their doctors or other health care professionals about their type of MS condition, drug treatment, and prognosis. For additional information please read our Multiple Sclerosis and Alternative Treatment for MS articles, or contact the Multiple Sclerosis Society.'  Beta interferons: relapsing-remitting MS Copaxone (glatiramer acetate): relapsing- remitting MS Gilenya (fingolimod): relapsing forms to reduce clinical exacerbations of MS Aubagio (teriflunomide): relapsing forms to reduce clinical exacerbations Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate): relapsing forms of MS Novantrone (mitoxantrone): treats of worsening relapsing – remitting MS, progressive – relapsing or secondary: progressive MS and to reduce neurologic disability and clinical exacerbations Tysabri (natalizumab): rapidly progressing MS especially if other treatments fail Ocrevus (ocrelizumab): a brand-new drug, FDA approved in 2017 (March), to treat relapsing MS and primary progressive MS"
"How will I know if I have MS, and when should I contact my doctor if I think I may have the condition?","'If you develop any of the symptoms listed previously, you should contact your doctor or other health care professional as soon as possible. Your doctor will perform a physical exam and get a history of your symptoms. If multiple sclerosis is suspected, blood work will probably be ordered to exclude another disease or disorder such as ''Lyme disease'', ''lupus'', or ''HIV''. A ''spinal tap'' may be done along with nerve studies (evoked potential testing). Imaging studies such as a ''MRI'' may be done. Your doctor will likely consult a ''neurologist'' to help make a diagnosis and for additional medical advice about ''multiple sclerosis treatment''.' "
Is multiple myeloma cancer curable?,'There is no cure for ''multiple myeloma''. Treatment for multiple ''myeloma'' can only reduce the severity of its symptoms and extend the patient’s survival by a few months or two to three years.\xa0''The best treatment for multiple myeloma varies from patient to patient and is often a combination of various therapies that include:\xa0' Immunomodulators (medications used to help regulate or normalize the immune system) Steroids Chemotherapy drugs Bisphosphonate therapy (drugs that prevent weakening or destruction of bones) Blood or platelet transfusions Plasmapheresis (filtering the blood and removes harmful antibodies) Radiation therapy (use of high-energy waves to kill tumor cells) Surgery (that repairs the damaged bones) Bone marrow transplant (a procedure to replace damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy stem cells )
What are the complications of multiple myeloma treatment?,"'Although the treatment for multiple myeloma helps reduce disease progression and the development of complications, treatment may itself produce certain complications.\xa0 These complications include:' Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage that often causes weakness, numbness, and pain, usually in your hands and feet) Cognitive impairment (condition in which a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions that affect their everyday life) Second cancers (a new and different type of cancer that happens in someone who has had cancer before) Venous thromboembolism (blood clots in the deep veins of your legs or arms) Cardiac toxicity (heart damage by chemotherapy drugs) Renal toxicity (kidney damage by chemotherapy drugs)"
How is multiple myeloma diagnosed?,"'It’s difficult to diagnose multiple myeloma early since there are no symptoms in its early stages. Early symptoms, if at all, are usually attributed to other diseases. Hence, multiple myeloma is often diagnosed based on certain tests, the patient’s symptoms, and the doctor’s physical exam of the patient.\xa0''If symptoms suggest that a person might have multiple myeloma, more tests are done that include:''Other tests include:' Blood counts: The complete blood count (CBC) is a test that measures the levels of red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets in the blood.  Blood chemistry tests: Levels of blood creatinine, albumin, and calcium will be particularly checked.  A blood test that measures lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels can predict a patient’s chances of survival. Quantitative immunoglobulins: This test measures the blood levels of the different antibodies (also called immunoglobulins).  Urine tests: A routine urine sample or urine collected over 24 hours can measure how much myeloma protein is present.  Bone marrow biopsy: Bone marrow biopsy involves drawing a sample of bone marrow to check for abnormal growth of plasma cells. Electrophoresis Serum-free light chains (a component of antibodies called light chains present freely in the serum) Beta-2 microglobulin (β2-M) Immunohistochemistry Flow cytometry Cytogenetics Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) Fine needle aspiration biopsy Core needle biopsy Bone X-rays Computed tomography (CT) scan Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans Positron emission tomography (PET) scans Echocardiogram (ECHO)"
What are the stages of multiple myeloma?,"'The International Staging System (ISS) is the most commonly used classification of multiple myeloma. It makes use of two tests: serum-beta-2 microglobulin (β2-M) and serum albumin.\xa0\xa0''According to ISS, there are three stages of multiple myeloma:''This system has recently been revised to include serum LDH) and high-risk gene abnormalities (defined by the FISH test). This new system is called the revised-ISS (or R-ISS).\xa0' Stage I: β2-M <3.5 mg/L with a serum albumin of 3.5 g/dL or more Stage II: Either of these 2 criteria: β2-M between 3.5 mg/L and 5.5 mg/L or Albumin <3.5 g/dL Stage III: β2-M >5.5 mg/L"
Why is needle localization done?,"'Needle localization is the most commonly performed procedure to locate and mark the exact position of any abnormalities in the breast. It can be performed for other parts of the body as well as to locate abnormal tissues. Needle localization is done in the following cases:' To locate and remove a tumor or abnormal tissue that is non-palpable (cannot be felt) during a physical examination but visible on radiological tests To remove an abnormal area that is too difficult for the surgeon to locate  To locate and remove a tissue sample if there are multiple abnormalities seen on radiological tests To help the surgeon remove a margin of normal, healthy tissue surrounding the abnormal tissue to ensure that there is no abnormal tissue left behind, reducing the risk of recurrence"
How is needle localization performed?,"'The patient is advised not to use any perfumes or deodorants or apply any powder prior to the procedure. Patients may have to discontinue blood-thinning medications such as ''aspirin'' two days before the procedure. Needle localization is done following a ''mammogram'' and before a breast biopsy or breast surgery. The breast is cleaned with an antiseptic solution. Local anesthesia is injected to numb the area to minimize discomfort. If the patient is not cooperative or extremely anxious, a sedating agent may be given through the veins.\xa0 With the help of a mammogram machine or ''ultrasound'', the radiologist places a thin needle leading up to the mass. Most women may experience tolerable pressure when the needle is inserted. A mammogram is repeated to recheck and confirm the needle position. The needle is then removed, leaving behind a thread-like wire hooked at the site of breast abnormality. The wire is taped as securely as possible to avoid dislodgement. The procedure takes about an hour to complete.''After the procedure:'' After the needle localization procedure is performed by the radiologist and the wire is in place, the patient is shifted to an operating room or a procedure room where breast biopsy or breast surgery will be done by a surgeon. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon then removes the entire abnormal tissue along with the wire. The breast tissue is then sent for an X-ray to confirm that the entire abnormal tissue has been removed. The excised tissue is then sent to a lab for analysis by a pathologist.' "
What are the complications of the needle localization procedure?,'The procedure is relatively safe. Some possible risks include:' Dislodgement of the guidewire before surgery  Bleeding  Swelling Bruising  Infection  Reaction to anesthesia 
What is norovirus?,"'Norovirus'' is an ''enterovirus'' that causes ''food poisoning'' symptoms in individuals. It is sometimes termed the ""''stomach flu'',"" but it is not related to the true ''flu'' ''viruses'' (''influenza'' ''viruses'') that cause respiratory problems. ''Norovirus'' is considered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) to be the most common cause of acute ''gastroenteritis'' in the United States (about 19-21 million infections per year with about 570-800 deaths). Although most cases are self-limiting, some patients (children or the elderly, for example) may develop ''dehydration'' or other serious consequences, including death.' "
Is norovirus contagious?,"'Noroviruses are highly ''contagious''. These viruses can easily infect men, women, and children. There are many subtypes of norovirus so that if you are infected with one norovirus type, it does not protect you against infection with one of the other types. The CDC estimates that in the U.S., every person will get about five infections (five different norovirus types) during their lifetime.' "
What is the contagious period for norovirus?,'Individuals are ''contagious'' as soon as the symptoms develop and may remain contagious between three days to two weeks after symptoms are gone.' 
How will I know if I have norovirus?,"'Norovirus causes ''diarrhea'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''stomach pain''; other symptoms may appear such as ''fever'', ''headache'', and/or body ''aches''. Patients usually report feeling extremely ill and weak.''Because norovirus is usually associated with contaminated foods or fluids, usually an outbreak of the disease is seen among many people who have consumed the same contaminated food or liquids. Consequently, you may suspect you have norovirus if people who have consumed the same foods that you have consumed display the same symptoms (for example, cruise-ship passengers). Other outbreaks happen when an infected individual lives in crowded conditions (for example, dorms or barracks).'""Most outbreaks of norovirus are diagnosed clinically from the patient's history and physical exam. Viral cultures can prove the diagnosis, but by the time test results are available (a few days), the symptoms are usually decreasing or are gone."" "
How is norovirus transmitted?,"'Noroviruses are easily spread to individuals by both direct and indirect contact with infected individuals. Direct contact usually occurs when people are taking care of infected patients (fecal/oral contact by changing diapers and/or bedding, for example). Norovirus can be transmitted or spread indirectly by body secretions (feces, saliva, or vomitus) to other individuals or to foods or liquids; individuals who are food handlers can easily cause outbreaks if they become infected and try to stay on the job. Norovirus can spread rapidly by indirect contact since the virus can remain viable for up to a few days on some surfaces.''Individuals can pass norovirus directly from person to person and indirectly by touching objects (utensils, for example) contaminated with norovirus or eating foods contaminated with norovirus. One study has showed that ''dogs'' may get the virus from one individual and then pass the virus to another human.' "
How will I know I am cured of norovirus?,"'The symptoms of norovirus infection usually last between 24 to about 72 hours, after which people usually recover completely. Although you may be ""cured"" of the type of norovirus that infected you, you are still susceptible to infection with other types of noroviruses. Individuals with a suppressed immune system, infants, young children, and the elderly may easily develop ''dehydration'' with norovirus infection; those with ''dehydration'' need to be treated urgently (with oral or intravenous hydration) to prevent additional problems and prolongation of infection.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about norovirus?,"'Norovirus infection can cause serious problems in those individuals who have more severe symptoms. Parents of children with signs of ''dehydration'' (for example, dry ''mucus'' membranes, reduced or no urine production) and adult individuals with similar problems need to contact a medical ''caregiver'' urgently. In addition, the following situations should trigger an urgent visit to a physician or an emergency department in any individual who may have norovirus infection:'   Children vomiting for more than one to two days Children under the age of 6 months with vomiting and/or diarrhea Mental-status changes in children or adults Individuals with other underlying medical problems (diabetes, congenital abnormalities, immune compromise, for example) Pregnancy Severe abdominal pain Blood in diarrhea fluid or vomit"
Is nutritional yeast good for you?,"'If you are a ''vegetarian'', nutritional yeast is a good source of vitamin B12 and complete protein. Even nonvegetarians can eat or make use of this yeast in their food as a health supplement.''Nonvegetarians get an adequate supply of vitamin B12 from meat and fish. Vegetarians are left with fewer options to obtain their protein and vitamin B12 requirements. Apart from being rich in vitamin B12 and other nutrients, nutritional yeast pleases your taste buds because\xa0 it has a cheesy taste.' "
What is nutritional yeast?,"'Nutritional yeast is prepared from the yeast,\xa0Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is the same yeast used to prepare baker’s yeast and brewer’s yeast.\xa0However, the yeast cells are killed during the manufacturing process.''Nutritional yeast has a nutty and cheese-like flavor, which makes it a popular substitute for cheese in various food items.''To produce nutritional yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is grown on mixtures of cane and beet molasses. After the mixture is fermented, the yeast goes through various processes including harvesting, washing, pasteurization and drying. The final product, nutritional yeast, is then packaged.''Nutritional yeast is rich in nutrients, but it may be fortified with other nutrients to enhance its nutritional value. It is available in various stores and supermarkets in the form of a spread and as flakes.' "
What are the health benefits of nutritional yeast?,"'Nutritional yeast is a low-salt, low-fat food product with a high concentration of proteins and ''vitamins'' (vitamin B12, ''folic acid'' and biotin). It also contains ''minerals'' that include''All the nine essential amino acids present in nutritional yeast make it a good source of complete protein.''Nutritional yeast contains a substance known as free glutamic acid, which enhances the ability of taste buds to taste savory foods.''Nutritional yeast may offer health benefits as a preventive agent against' Zinc Chromium Iron Magnesium Heart disease: The presence of fiber in nutritional yeast helps reduce your blood cholesterol levels. This aids in lowering your risk of heart disease. Diabetes: Nutritional yeast has a low glycemic index and it contains an antioxidant called chromium, so it is good for people with diabetes. Cancer: Nutritional yeast may have anticancer properties due to the high levels of antioxidant minerals. Neurological problems and depression: Vitamin B12 is important for nerve health and cognitive function. It also helps fight off depression."
Are there any risks associated with nutritional yeast consumption?,"'Nutritional yeast is considered safe for most people, but it may not be good for you if you have any of the following conditions''Nutritional yeast is also known to interact with certain medications, such as those given to treat ''depression''. If you are planning to include nutritional yeast in your ''diet'', it is advisable to speak with your doctor first.' Migraines: The tyramine content of nutritional yeast can trigger migraine attacks. Allergies: People who have an allergy to baker’s yeast or brewer’s yeast may develop an allergy to nutritional yeast as well. Crohn’s disease: People with inflammatory conditions of the bowel, such as Crohn’s disease, may develop trouble with their digestion after consuming nutritional yeast."
Is Obamacare still active? ,"'At present, ''Obamacare'' or the Affordable Healthcare Act is active, although one of its main clauses “the individual mandate” has been abolished at the federal level since 2019. This means that at present, there is no penalty for not buying the health insurance under Obamacare.''Obamacare has been under attack since Mr. Donald Trump was elected into office in 2016, but it has survived total abolishment. Currently, the fate of Obamacare hangs in balance in the Supreme Court of the United States. President Joe Biden’s\xa0victory over the incumbent President\xa0Donald Trump\xa0in November 2020 may spell good news for the future of the ''Affordable Care Act'' (''ACA''), but the confirmation on the same is still awaited.\xa0''The original Obamacare/Affordable Healthcare Act required every American to purchase a healthcare plan. Those who did not have an insurance plan were to have a tax penalty. In December 2017, the Trump administration passed a tax bill revoking the tax penalty for those who do not purchase the health insurance. This repeal still continues in 2020 so that there is no fine for individuals for not buying the health insurance plans in most of the United States apart from California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Washington.' "
What is Obamacare?,"'The Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare was initiated by President Barack Obama in 2010. This act was a major overhaul for the US healthcare system. It made having health insurance mandatory for every American. If any individual refused to get insurance, they were subjected to a tax penalty. Those who could not afford their healthcare plan were offered assistance by the government. Essentially, the rich helped the poor to buy insurance, making quality healthcare available to all. The tax penalty money helped people who could not afford a policy to buy one. Obamacare aimed to reduce the expenditure for uncompensated care in an average American family. Under Obamacare, the insurance company cannot deny payouts unless they find evidence of fraud.''Obamacare includes subsidies to help lower-income individuals cover the cost of their insurance. These subsidies, also known as tax credits, are still in effect in 2020. Obamacare has an Open Enrolment Period (OEP). This is the time when people can buy a new health insurance plan for the upcoming year. OEP for 2021 plans will be from November 1st 2020 to December 15th 2020. If people do not enroll in a plan during OEP, they cannot buy ACA-compliant coverage unless they experience a qualifying event. Such event include''If someone finds themselves without insurance and they are not eligible for a qualifying event, they may be able to enroll in a\xa0short-term plan\xa0depending on the state where they live.' Unemployment Move to a new coverage area Childbirth Loss of existing coverage Family event, such as marriage, divorce or death"
What does Obamacare cover?,"'The specific coverage someone receives with their plan under Obamacare will vary based on their particulars. The act has required coverage for some medical services, including' Preventative care Emergency care Outpatient care when they are not admitted to the hospital Hospitalization Pregnancy and newborn care Services for mental health and substance use disorders Rehabilitative services Pediatric care Laboratory services"
Why is Obamacare criticized?," Obamacare led to a rise in insurance premiums for many individuals, thus cutting down their savings. There was a modest fine if an individual did not buy an insurance plan. This fine was abolished in 2019. Obamacare resulted in Americans paying more taxes. The rich were essentially supporting the poor to pay for their healthcare insurance. This was unacceptable to many. Companies started cutting back on employees’ working hours to avoid paying for insurance for them."
What are the common symptoms of pancreatitis?  ,'The most common symptom is severe upper ''stomach pain'' that may radiate to the back or chest and may feel worse after eating or drinking ''alcohol''.''Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:''The symptoms of ''chronic pancreatitis'' include:' Nausea Vomiting Jaundice (yellowing of the whites of eyes) Fever Dehydration Rapid heartbeat Abdominal tenderness Skin discoloration around the belly button Unintentional weight loss Bloating Diarrhea Jaundice Decreased ability to produce insulin Indigestion Oily or smelly stools Fluid buildup in the abdominal cavity. Low blood pressure Breathing problems (hypoxia and lung failure) Kidney failure
What are the common causes of pancreatitis?  ,"'Digestive enzymes'' travel from the pancreas to the small intestine. If the pancreatic duct is blocked, the enzymes become trapped and accumulate in the pancreas. When activated while still in the pancreas they begin irritating the pancreas tissue, causing swelling, bleeding, infection, and damage, leading to pancreatitis.\xa0\xa0The most common cause of acute pancreatitis is the presence of stones in the gallbladder, which can block the enzymes flowing from the pancreatic duct to the small intestine. Other causes include:' Family history of pancreatitis. Recurrent exposure to chemicals. High-fat levels in the blood or high-fat diet. Excessive alcohol consumption Severe injury or recent abdominal procedure Hereditary disease. Severe infections like mumps or lupus By birth abnormality of the pancreas or intestine. Excessive exposure to smoking Cancer of pancreas a venomous sting from a scorpion Certain side effects of medications High levels of calcium in the blood Cystic fibrosis (a hereditary disease characterized by buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus in the lungs and other organs) Drug allergies such as an allergy to penicillin or codeine"
What are the common tests to diagnose pancreatitis?  ,"'Common tests to diagnose pancreatitis include:' Various blood tests: Blood tests may be ordered by doctors to know the levels of digestive enzymes in the blood such as amylase and lipase. Doctors may also check for blood sugar levels, triglycerides, lipids, and fats in the blood. A blood test also helps in identifying signs of infection or inflammation of the bile ducts, pancreas, gallbladder, or liver and pancreatic cancer Stool tests: Stool sample may determine fat malabsorption Imaging tests: Ultrasound, CT scans of the pancreas, gallbladder, and bile ducts and Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) creates pictures of  organs and soft tissues to determine abnormalities in the pancreas Endoscopic ultrasound: Doctors may insert a thin, flexible tube down the throat, through the stomach, and into the small intestine. The doctor then turns on an ultrasound attachment to create pictures of your pancreas and bile ducts.  Pancreatic Function Test (PFT). Doctors may use this test to measure how the pancreas responds to secretin, a hormone produced by the small intestine."
What are the treatment options for pancreatitis?,"'The common treatment for pancreatitis includes:' A hospital stay to treat dehydration with intravenous (IV) fluids or with oral rehydration therapy Pain medicine, and antibiotics by mouth or through an IV, if the infection is detected in the pancreas A low-fat diet, or nutrition by feeding tube or IV a patient is unable to eat Mild pancreatitis usually goes away in a few days with rest and treatment The doctor may give enzyme pills and vitamins to help with digestion and treat malabsorption.  Surgery: The doctor may recommend surgery to remove the gallbladder, called cholecystectomy Procedures: The doctor may drain fluid from the abdomen or remove damaged tissue from the pancreas. Endoscopic Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): Doctors use ERCP to treat both acute and chronic pancreatitis. ERCP combines upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and X-rays to treat narrowing or blockage of bile or pancreatic duct. They are also used to remove gallstones blocking the bile or pancreatic ducts. Surgeons may also perform surgery to remove the whole pancreas and may transplant islets from the pancreas into the liver. The islets will begin to make hormones and release them into your bloodstream."
What is PEG tube placement?,"'A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)\xa0tube placement is a method of placing a small, flexible tube (gastrostomy tube) into the stomach through the skin (percutaneously) with the help of an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera and a light on one end). PEG tube placement is one of the most performed endoscopic procedures in the United States.\xa0' "
What is the difference between a PEG tube and a gastrostomy tube?,"'A gastrostomy tube is a small, flexible tube that passes through the abdominal wall into the stomach. It is held in place by the ''sutures''.''A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is a gastrostomy tube placed into the stomach with the help of an endoscope. Percutaneous insertion means through the skin.' "
Who needs a PEG tube placement surgery?,"'Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement surgery may be performed in the following cases:''Patients who are unable to move food from their mouth to their stomach are the ones who usually need a PEG tube placement. This includes people who have:''Patients who need gut decompression because of inadequate drainage of gut contents:' Stroke Cerebral palsy Brain injury Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (motor neuron disease) Impaired swallowing Injury Cancer Recent surgery on the stomach or bowel Abdominal cancers Stomach outlet obstruction Bowel obstruction Diseases of gut muscles that impair emptying (e.g., gastroparesis)"
What happens during the PEG tube placement procedure?,"'You will stay in the hospital at least overnight after the PEG placement. The GI or anesthesia office will call with instructions before your procedure day.' Before the procedure, you will be instructed to not eat or drink anything for a few hours.  The procedure is generally performed with moderate to deep IV (intravenous) sedation along with local anesthesia at the site of tube placement. You will lie on the bed with the head end of the bed elevated at a 30° angle to reduce the risk of aspiration (accidental entry of food/fluids into the windpipe). The anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors your pulse and blood pressure. The antibiotics are administered intravenously. The doctor passes an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera and a light on one end) through the mouth, throat, and food pipe (esophagus) into the stomach.  When the endoscope reaches the stomach, its light can be seen on the surface of the patient’s abdomen. This spot is used for tube insertion. The fluid from the stomach is suctioned out through the endoscope. The doctor sterilizes the skin, injects numbing medicine (local anesthesia), and makes a small surgical cut (incision) about 1 cm in size.  The PEG tube is pushed into the stomach through the cut. The PEG tube is secured in place with the help of sutures. The tube is kept in place on the inside by a plastic bolster or a water-filled balloon bolster and on the outside by a small plastic disc that is placed on the surface of the abdomen. The PEG tube is flushed and suctioned before completion of the procedure to ensure patency while you are still sedated."
What are the complications of PEG tube placement procedure?,"'The complications of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement procedure include:' Peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity) Bleeding Pneumoperitoneum (entrapment of air in the peritoneum–the inner lining of the abdomen that envelops most of the organs in the abdomen) Stomach outlet obstruction Conditions related to the heart and lungs due to oversedation Allergies to the sedatives or antibiotic administered Aspiration (a serious condition in which food, liquid, or body secretion enters the airways or the lungs by accident) Infections at the site of tube (cellulitis) Peristomal leakage (leakage of stomach contents around the gastrostomy site) Delayed emptying of the stomach/bowel Bowel perforation Stomach wall ulceration (with longstanding PEG tubes) Accidental PEG tube removal (by an agitated or confused patient) Colocutaneous fistula (abnormal communication path between the skin and the large bowel) PEG tract tumor seeding"
What is a pericardial window procedure?,"'The ''heart'' is surrounded by a two-layered sac (pericardium) with a small amount of fluid. When excess fluid accumulates in the pericardium (''pericardial effusion'') it exerts pressure and impairs the heart’s function.''A ''pericardial'' window is a procedure to remove a portion of the pericardium and create a ‘window’ to continuously drain the excess fluid into the chest ''cavity''. A pericardial window can, therefore, prevent impairment of ''heart function'' that can occur with a pericardial effusion.' "
Is pericardial window open-heart surgery?,"'Pericardial window is a cardiac surgical procedure less invasive than an open-heart surgery. It is often done after an open-heart surgery to drain and prevent pericardial effusion. Pericardial window may be performed when pericardiocentesis, a less invasive method of fluid removal, is not possible, or if pericardial effusion persists or recurs after pericardiocentesis.' "
Why is a pericardial window procedure done?,'Pericardial window is a procedure to prevent impairment of heart function as a result of a pericardial effusion. The procedure is performed to''Pericardial window may be required due to the following conditions:' Relieve symptoms of pericardial effusion such asshortness of breathrapid breathdizzinessnauseachest pain shortness of breath rapid breath dizziness nausea chest pain To treat cardiac tamponade (severe impairment of heart’s function due to pressure caused by pericardial effusion) Diagnose the cause of pericardial effusion Drain recurrent pericardial effusion Prevent pericardial effusion after an open-heart surgery Chest injury Heart attack and heart failure Reaction to certain drugs Lung and certain other cancers Radiation treatment to the chest Inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis)  High level of urea in the blood (uremia) due to kidney disease/failure Still disease Hypothyroidism Connective tissue diseases Genetic muscle degeneration disease Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
How is a pericardial window procedure done?,"'A cardiac surgeon performs the pericardial window procedure\xa0 while the patient is under general anesthesia. The procedure may take several hours.' The patient undergoes blood and imaging tests. The patient must avoid eating or drinking for 8 hours prior. The patient must check with the doctor before taking any regular medication The patient must inform the surgeon about any allergies. An anesthesiologist will administer anesthesia and monitor the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. An IV line will be attached for medications. External defibrillator pads will be attached, in case the patient develops irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). The arterial and venous blood pressure will be continuously monitored during the procedure. The surgeon may perform the pericardial window using one of the following three techniques:Subxiphoid approach: The surgeon makes a 5- to 8-cm long incision in the midline just below the breastbone to visualize and access the pericardium from below.Thoracotomy approach: The surgeon makes a 6- to 8-cm long incision in the fourth or fifth intercostal space (space between the ribs) to visualize and access the pericardium.Thoracoscopic approach: The surgeon makes small incisions on the side of the chest and performs the procedure with tiny surgical tools inserted through a flexible tube with a lighted camera (thoracoscope), guided by the images on a monitor.

The surgeon drains the excess fluid and attaches a small tube enabling the fluid to continue draining into the chest cavity. The incisions will be closed with sutures or staples. The patient will be monitored for several hours in the recovery room. The fluid and tissue removed is analyzed in the lab. Hospital stay for about a week to 10 days is required, and recovery can take up to eight weeks, depending on the underlying condition and any complications."
Is pericardial window surgery dangerous?,"'Pericardial window surgery is a relatively safe procedure and could be potentially lifesaving. The success of the procedure, however, depends in part on the underlying condition of the patient.' "
Can pericardial effusion come back?,'The recurrence of pericardial effusion after a pericardial window procedure is possible. Recurrence depends on its original cause.'

Risks and complications include:' Complications from anesthesia Uncontrolled bleeding Blood clots leading to stroke Infection Recurrence of pericardial effusion Arrhythmia Heart attack Cardiac arrest Death
What is phakic IOL?,"'The phakic ''intraocular lens'' (IOL) is an alternate procedure to other refractive error procedures like\xa0''LASIK'' and\xa0PRK (''photorefractive keratectomy'') eye surgery. Phakic IOL also replaces the need to use ''eyeglasses'' and ''contact lenses'', since it is permanent. It is used to correct severe ''myopia'' (''nearsightedness''). Phakic IOLs (PIOLs) are implantable ''intraocular'' lenses made of clear silicone or ''plastic'', which is surgically placed in the eye that still contains a natural human crystalline ''lens'"". Hence, PIOLs are sometimes also called 'implantable contact lenses' (ICLs). The PIOLs function is similar to contact lenses worn on the surface of the eyes to correct nearsightedness. In some cases, PIOLs produce better and more predictable results compared to other laser refractive surgeries."" "
What are the two types of phakic IOL?,"'There are two\xa0FDA approved phakic IOLs currently available for the use in severe ''myopia'' and myopic ''astigmatism'', the choice of which is made by the eye surgeon depending on the extent of the condition:\xa0''Visian ICL'':\xa0The Visian ICL is positioned in the posterior chamber, meaning it is placed behind the ''iris'' (the colored tissue in the front of the eye that contains the pupil in the center) )\xa0 and in front of the natural lens. It is made of a soft, biocompatible collagen copolymer, making it flexible and easily foldable for implantation, hence requiring a very small surgical incision.''Verisyse'':\xa0The Verisyse is positioned in the anterior chamber, meaning it is placed in front of the iris. It is made of medical-grade plastic (polymethylmethacrylate) and is rigid.' "
What are the uses of phakic IOL?,"'Phakic IOLs are used to correct refractive errors which cannot be corrected by other refractive surgeries''The cornea and natural lens of the eye bend and focus light on the retina and create images on the retina for vision. This bending and focusing of light is also known as refraction. Refraction is affected in refractive errors, causing blurred or distorted vision. People who have myopia or nearsightedness have difficulty seeing distant objects and near vision is normal. In myopia, the light focuses in front of the retina and not on the retina. Eyeglasses and contact lenses correct this problem when used. Phakic IOLs is a permanent solution, causing the light to focus on the retina and replacing the need to use eyeglasses or lenses.\xa0' "
What is the difference between phakic intraocular lenses and intraocular lenses in cataract surgery?,"'Phakic intraocular lenses'' are implanted in the eye without removing the natural lens. Intraocular lenses used in ''cataract surgery''\xa0 replace the cloudy, opacified natural lens that occurs in ''cataract''. The natural lens is generally removed in cataract surgery.' "
How is phakic IOL done?,"'The procedure is done under local anesthesia. Intravenous sedation may be given as well. A flap is made, following which the phakic IOLs are surgically placed either between the cornea and the iris or just behind the iris, depending on the type of phakic IOL used. The natural\xa0lens is not removed. Phakic IOL is permanent and does not require any specific post-operative care besides the routine eye exams with the ophthalmologist (eye surgeon).' "
What is pinkeye?,"'Pinkeye'', also termed ''conjunctivitis'', is inflammation of the ''conjunctiva'', the tissue that lines the inside of the ''eyelid'' and the white part of the eyeball.'  Pinkeye is a common problem in both children and adults. When pinkeye develops, the blood vessels become more visible and give a pinkish tinge to the eyelids and the whites of the eyes. The inflammation of pinkeye may be caused by four main sources:bacteria,viruses,allergens, andchemical irritants. bacteria, viruses, allergens, and chemical irritants."
Is pinkeye contagious? What is the incubation period for pinkeye?,"'The answer to the question about pinkeye contagiousness depends upon the source or cause of the ''conjunctival'' irritation. For example, bacterial and viral causes of pinkeye are almost always ''contagious'' and are spread from person to person. However, pinkeye caused by allergens and chemical irritants is not ''contagious'' by person-to-person contact. Pinkeye that is contagious has an incubation period as long as 14 days. However, most doctors do not think that pinkeye becomes contagious to other people until symptoms start to develop. Some bacterial and viral ''strains'' are capable of being transferred from humans to pets (for example, ''dogs'' and cats) and also from infected pets to humans.' "
How will I know when I have pinkeye?,"'Unfortunately, the symptoms and signs of both contagious and noncontagious pinkeye often are so similar it is difficult to tell them apart. The symptoms and signs of both contagious and noncontagious pinkeye may include the following:''Diagnosis by a physician is usually done by physical examination and patient history; seldom are tests run because the only effective treatment is removal of noninfectious irritants and relatively short-term antibiotic therapy if bacterial pinkeye is suspected. In rare severe infections, physicians may utilize ''conjunctival'' scrapings and cultures to identify the infecting organism.''If you are unsure if you or others have contagious pinkeye, act as if it is contagious until you know the cause.' Redness and/or swelling of the eyelids newborn Irritated, itchy, gritty and/or a sensation of burning in the eyes Increased tearing Yellowish or greenish discharge, sometimes with crusting Sensitivity to light (photophobia)"
How do people transmit pinkeye?,"'Noncontagious causes (allergens and/or chemical irritants) of pinkeye do not spread to other individuals. Unfortunately, some chemical irritants and allergens can be spread through the air, but contagious causes of pinkeye are usually not spread through the air.''However, contagious causes such as bacterial and viral infections spread easily from person to person by touching an individual infected with pinkeye and then touching your own eyes or eyelids.' Individuals who share items like makeup or eye shadow can transfer pinkeye from these surfaces to other individuals. Pinkeye in newborns can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections and can be very serious for the newborns. Contagious pinkeye often spreads to both eyes in the infected individual."
How long does viral pinkeye last? What is the contagious period for pinkeye?," The cure for pinkeye depends on the cause; noncontagious causes can be rapidly cured (about 12-24 hours) if the cause is removed from the patient (for example, an allergen or irritating chemical is washed out by tears). If the irritant is not removed, noncontagious pinkeye may last for months. Bacterial causes may linger and require antibiotic drops placed in the eye; in about 24-48 hours after beginning antibiotic treatment, patients become noncontagious, but the symptoms and signs can still last up to a month. Unfortunately, viral pinkeye is only treated symptomatically, and it may take a few days to two weeks before symptoms and signs start to resolve. When symptoms and signs resolve, then you are cured of viral pinkeye. However, it is possible for people to get both repeated infections and/or repeated incidents of allergic or chemical irritation, so all causes of pinkeye can recur."
When should I contact a health care provider about pinkeye?,"'Although most cases of pinkeye are mild and get better on their own, in some circumstances, one may need to contact a health care provider. If you have pinkeye and have one or more of the following problems, you should contact your health care provider immediately:'  Symptoms worsen or do not improve, especially if you are undergoing treatment (for example, utilizing antibiotics). Eye pain increases to moderate or severe levels Pinkeye becomes more red in color Moderate to severe light sensitivity and/or blurry or impaired vision If you have a preexisting eye condition If you have an immune system that is weakened (for example, due to HIV, chemotherapy or cancer) If you're pregnant and suspect you may have a sexually transmitted infection, you should contact your OB/GYN physician urgently to be sure your newborn is not infected."
What is pleurisy?,"'Pleurisy'' (also termed ''pleuritis'') is inflammation of the double layered membrane that surrounds the ''lungs'' termed the pleura or plural membranes. These membranes surround the lungs (visceral pleura) and line the ribcage (parietal pleura).''The pleura lubricate the lungs, and this allows the lung tissue to easily inflate and deflate as a person breathes in and out. In between the plural membranes is a very thin area containing fluid that allows easy non-painful movement of the lung tissue. When ''pleurisy'' occurs, several things may happen. If inflammation occurs, the two layers of the membrane can become rough and as they attempt to slide, the rough surfaces cause ''pain'"". In other instances, fluid can begin to build up between the membranes and put pressure on the lungs that, in turn, reduces the lungs' ability to move normally and can cause ""'shortness of breath''. This situation is turned a ""plural effusion."" In some people, this ''pleural effusion'' can become infected, and inflammation of the pleura can occur.''Some doctors believe that pleurisy is a symptom of an underlying condition and is not a condition itself. Classification of pleurisy can be acute, subacute, chronic and/or recurrent, depending upon the underlying condition causing pleurisy. In this article, pleurisy will be considered a term for a generalized condition that results in chest discomfort.' "
Is pleurisy contagious?,"'Most doctors agree that pleurisy is not ''contagious'' in itself; however, some of the underlying conditions that may cause pleurisy are considered contagious (for example, ''tuberculosis'', bacterial ''pneumonia'' and viral infections like ''influenza'' [the ''flu'']).''Other diseases that can be the underlying cause of pleurisy are not contagious (for example, ''heart attack'', ''pulmonary embolism'', certain ''cancers'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''lupus'' and many others; sometimes the underlying cause of pleurisy is not known).'  "
How will I know if I have pleurisy?,"'Although the underlying causes of pleurisy may have a large number of symptoms, a common feature in patients with pleurisy is having a ""plural rub,"" a situation in which the two membranes (parietal and visceral pleura) move together to cause friction and ''pain'' that is usually sharp. The pain is usually localized to the area that is inflamed and is increased when the patient ''coughs'', sneezes or tries to take a deep breath. During the physical exam, a doctor may hear reduced breath sounds, ''wheezing'' and/or rapid shallow ''breathing''.''Such findings usually cause the health-care professional to order tests like a ''chest X-ray'"", CT of the chest, and/or other tests, depending upon the health-care professional's suspicion of an underlying cause of pleurisy. Often, an ""'EKG'' and blood tests are done to determine whether a medical emergency such as a heart attack has occurred. Consequently, it is important to have a health-care professional quickly diagnose a person that develops the common symptoms of pleurisy.' "
How is pleurisy spread?,"'Pleurisy is not spread from person to person; however, it may spread within the individual to occupy more space. This occurs when the underlying infectious causes further spread into the pleural space or when noninfectious causes result in fluid increases in the pleural space. In some people, both infection and fluid can increase (spread) simultaneously in the pleural space.' "
How will I know if I am cured of pleurisy?,"'Treatment for pleurisy depends on the underlying cause. It is possible to be cured of pleurisy if the underlying cause is treatable. For example, if the underlying cause like bacterial infection is stopped and cured, the symptoms described above that occur with pleurisy will resolve (abate) over time. The time span is dependent upon the time it takes to cure of the underlying cause of the disease. This situation is the same for the non-infectious causes of pleurisy.''Occasionally, a ''pleural effusion'"" will not clear up even if the underlying cause of pleurisy has been effectively treated, and in other patients, the pleural effusion may compromise breathing. In these situations, a chest tube is placed into the effusion so it can be drained; after effective drainage, most patients' symptoms resolve, and the tube is removed."" "
When should I contact a doctor about pleurisy?,"'Because pleurisy, especially in the acute form, involves ''chest pain'"", is important to be sure that the pain is not due to a medical emergency. Consequently, acute pleuritic pain should be evaluated immediately by an emergency physician to help differentiate between a heart attack or other emergency conditions and new-onset pleurisy. However, other forms of pleurisy (for example, chronic or recurrent) still need to be evaluated quickly by the patient's doctor or specialist to avoid hospitalization and/or complications that could lead to poor outcomes."" "
What is pneumonia?,"'Pneumonia'' is inflammation of the lung tissue usually but not exclusively caused by infection from bacteria, virus, or fungus. ''Pneumonia'' causes the air sacs at the end of the airways in the ''lungs'' to fill with pus. If inflammation affects both ''lungs'', the infection is termed ''double pneumonia''. If it affects one lung, it is termed single ''pneumonia'"". If it affects only a certain lobe of a lung, it's termed lobar ""'pneumonia''. Most ''pneumonia'' is caused by bacteria and ''viruses'', but some ''pneumonia'' is caused by inhaling toxic chemicals that damage lung tissue. Pneumonia can cause ''fever'', ''chills'', ''cough'', and difficulty ''breathing''. Severe pneumonia can result in death.' "
Is pneumonia contagious?,"'Because pneumonia is caused mainly by infectious microbes, pneumonia can be ''contagious''. Pneumonia caused by chemical fumes or other poisons not made by infectious agents is not ''contagious''.''Many contagious pneumonias have names, such as bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, ''Mycoplasma'' pneumonia, and ''MRSA'' (methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'') pneumonia, that indicate the type of pathogen infecting the lung. Some pneumonias have names that are not as clear (for example, ""''walking'' pneumonia,"" which indicates a milder form of ''Mycoplasma'' pneumonia). There are many other descriptive terms, such as community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia (examples that suggest the source of the organism[s] causing the pneumonia). They are all potentially contagious but not as easily contagious as the ''flu''\xa0or ''COVID-19'', for example.'  "
When is pneumonia contagious?,"'Pneumonia is contagious when the causative pathogens (usually bacteria or ''viruses'') are expelled by an infected person by ''coughing'' out infected droplets. These expelled droplets contain the bacteria or virus that causes the pneumonia. These droplets contaminate the mouth or ''breathing'' tract of another individual to eventually infect their lungs.''The approximate time when pneumonia becomes contagious varies with the type of infecting agent and may range from one to two days to weeks. In addition, some pneumonias are more highly contagious than others. For example, ''Mycobacterium'' and ''Mycoplasma'' organisms are highly contagious, but other types, including pneumococcal pneumonia, require optimal conditions to spread to another person and are weakly contagious.' "
What is the incubation period for pneumonia?,"""The incubation period for pneumonia depends on the type of pathogen causing the disease, the person's age, and his or her overall health. In general, most pneumonias begin with symptoms similar to those of a ""'cold'' or the ''flu'' that last longer than the flu (about seven to 10 days) and become more severe. The signs and ''symptoms of pneumonia'' include''These symptoms may occur as early as one to three days or about a week after ""''flu-like symptoms''"" develop.' fever and chills; a productive cough (phlegm is produced); pains or aches the chest when breathing in or during coughing; fatigue; shortness of breath; nausea and vomiting; and diarrhea."
Can pneumonia spread?,"""As described above, pneumonia is caused by infectious agents that can spread to others depending upon the type of organism causing the pneumonia. Usually, the organisms spread person to person by contact with an infected person's mouth or when small droplets that become airborne from coughing or ""'sneezing''. In addition, once pneumonia develops in the lungs, it may spread to other lobes of the lung, or even to the other lung. In severe cases, the organisms causing pneumonia may spread to other organs of the body and cause damage or even death.' "
How long is pneumonia contagious?,"'In general, many bacterial pneumonias are much less contagious after antibiotics have been administered for about 24-48 hours. However, this time period may vary for some organisms, like those that cause ''tuberculosis''. For ''tuberculosis'', it can take two weeks or more on antibiotics before the person is no longer contagious. For viral pneumonias, the person becomes less contagious after the symptoms have begun to recede, especially ''fever''. This may occur about one to two days after someone has no ''fever'', but one may still shed some infectious virus for a week or so with some types of viral pneumonias. It is not unusual to have coughing occasionally for some time (days to weeks) even after someone is not contagious.' "
When should someone seek medical care for pneumonia?,"'If someone has had fever and a ''cough'' (especially a productive ''cough'' with yellow, green, brown sputum) after having ""''flu-like'' symptoms,"" he or she should contact a medical ''caregiver''. If someone develops any ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'', ''confusion'', and/or high ''fevers'', he or she should go to an emergency department. In addition, if someone has a chronic health problem like ''diabetes'', ''HIV'', or other problems that result in a ''depressed'' immune system, he or she should see a physician immediately or go to an emergency department if even mild ''pneumonia symptoms'' develop.' "
What is poison ivy?,"'Poison ivy'' (''Toxicodendron'' spp.) is a plant native to North America. The ivy is a climbing vine related to the cashew family. ''Poison ivy'' produces an oily chemical (urushiol) onto the surface of its leaves. When people come in contact with poison ivy, the urushiol can cause an ''allergic'' skin reaction that produces reddish, itchy, and painful inflammation of the skin (''dermatitis''). Close relatives of poison ivy plants that produce similar dermatitis symptoms are ''poison oak'' and ''poison sumac''. In addition, mangoes and Japanese lacquer trees also can produce urushiol.' "
Is poison ivy contagious?,"'The poison ivy ''rash'' is an ''allergic reaction'"" to an oily chemical from the leaf surface. This is an individual's allergic response to the chemical and is therefore not considered to be ""'contagious'"". However, if a person comes in contact with the oily chemical from an affected patient's skin or clothing, then the urushiol could be passed on and a poison ivy ""'rash'' may develop in a second individual. Direct contact with the oily chemical causes the symptoms and signs attributed to poison ivy.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of poison ivy dermatitis?,"'Symptoms of poison ivy dermatitis are as follows:''More serious symptoms may include the following:''Cortisone preparations and ''antihistamines'' like ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax, ''Vistaril''), or ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet'') may help reduce the symptoms and signs.' Localized mild skin redness (erythema) Itchy skin Diffuse skin redness Edema Severe pain and/or itching Blister (bullous) skin lesions Secondary skin infections"
What is the incubation period for a poison ivy rash?,"""Dermatologists suggest that the first exposure to poison ivy has an incubation period of about five to 21 days before the rash appears. However, repeated exposure to poison ivy results in the rash appearing more quickly (about 12-48 hours). The diagnosis made with the patient's history and physical exam and usually requires no further tests. Consequently, the diagnosis is made by likely exposure to poison ivy and the appearance of the rash symptoms and signs described above."" "
Is it possible for a poison ivy rash to spread?,"""Poison ivy is not contagious and is not spread like an infectious disease from person to person. However, it can spread if the oily chemical on one person's skin is touched by another person. Even if the oil is on a person's skin or clothing, anyone who comes in contact with the irritant may develop symptoms. In addition, if the person who has poison ivy touches clothing or other areas of his body that has the irritant on the skin surface, they can spread the irritant to other parts of their own body. Consequently, it is very important to clean off the skin and clothing that has been exposed to the oil and to not scratch or touch the developing rash area if it has not been cleaned off as the person could transfer oil to the eyes, mouth, or other areas of the body. Showering with warm soapy water helps to remove the oil and can reduce the chance of any spread. Washing the exposed area within 20 minutes after exposure reduces the symptoms and signs of poison ivy rash."" "
How long does a poison ivy rash last?,"""Most individuals with poison ivy will have the rash and other symptoms and signs gradually resolve over a period of about one to three weeks. Dermatologists recommend immediately rinsing or showering the skin with lukewarm soapy water to remove the oily chemical responsible for the symptoms. This can reduce or eliminate the chance of spread to other areas of the body or to other individuals who may otherwise contact the irritant on an individual's skin. In addition, thoroughly washing clothing that may be exposed to the oily chemical is key to prevention of the spread of poison ivy. Once the oily irritant is removed, spread of the rash is prevented, although ""'itching'' and some ''pain'' may take a few days to fade.' "
When should someone seek medical care for a poison ivy rash?,"'Individuals with a poison ivy rash usually do not require medical care and have the symptoms resolve in about one to three weeks. Home care may include cool showers, cool compresses, ''calamine lotion'', and/or hydrocortisone cream. If any ''blisters'' develop, simply leave them alone and do not scratch the irritated skin area.''However some patients may be very sensitive or allergic to the oily chemical produced by poison ivy. If any of the following symptoms or signs develop after contacting the irritant produced by poison ivy, the individual should seek immediate medical care:'  Difficulty with breathing or trouble swallowing Swelling, especially around the eyes Fever A rash develops on the face and/or genitalia. A rash covers most of an individual's body. Nothing relieves the discomfort (itching, pain) of the rash."
What is POTS?,"'Postural orthostatic\xa0tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a syndrome characterized by increased ''heart'' rate (tachycardia), a fall in ''blood pressure'' (''hypotension'') and giddiness when standing (orthostatic). In POTS, the symptoms occur because the heart does not receive sufficient blood supply when the person stands upright. The word refers to a group of symptoms that usually occur together. In POTS, there is a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (dysautonomia). The autonomous nervous system is part of the nervous system that regulates heart rate, blood pressure and ''breathing'' pattern. POTS can occur in both sexes and at any age, but it is more common in women between ages of 15 to 50 years old.' "
Is POTS a serious condition?,"'POTS is\xa0a serious\xa0condition that can significantly affect the quality of life, but it’s not usually life-threatening. There is no permanent cure or standardized treatment protocol available for POTS, but various treatment options are available to manage the disease conservatively. With appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications, most patients have seen improvement in symptoms and some may even experience complete resolution of symptoms, allowing them to live a normal life. The long-term prognosis for those diagnosed with POTS is not conclusive based on research.' "
What causes POTS?,"'POTS can occur for a variety of reasons.POTS is characterized into different types depending on the underlying cause. The most common types are''Risk factors''Some possible factors that can increase the risk of POTS are' Hypovolemic: The person has reduced fluid volume in the body due to dehydration, hot environment or blood loss. Neuropathic: There is damage to the nerve fibers that regulate blood flow. Hyperadrenergic: The person has increased levels of the adrenergic hormone, norepinephrine, which is a stress hormone. Post-pregnancy After a severe illness, major surgery or trauma Prolonged bed rest Dysfunction of the heart or blood vessels Damage to the nerves in the legs Long periods of increased stress, anxiety or fear Autoimmune diseases Diabetes Infections like Lyme disease and infectious mononucleosis or Epstein Barr virus (EBV) Nutritional deficiencies Genetic predisposition (positive family history)"
What are the signs and symptoms of POTS?,"'Patients may experience a combination of symptoms, which vary with each individual. Some patients may only have mild symptoms, while others may have severe symptoms that affect quality of life. They include' Increased heart rate of over 100 beats per minute within the first 10 minutes of standing Fall in blood pressure Giddiness Feeling lightheaded Weakness Fatigue Difficulty focusing Shortness of breath Chest discomfort or pain Tremors Nausea Pain and coldness in the hands and legs Poor exercise tolerance Pain in the hands and feet"
How is POTS treated?,"'There is no standardized treatment protocol or a permanent cure for POTS. Treatment involves a combination of medication and lifestyle modifications to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.''Medications''Medications that may be prescribed include ''beta-blockers'' to reduce the workload of the heart and ''antidepressants'' and ''benzodiazepines'', which relax muscles, reduce ''anxiety'' and have sedating effects on the body.''Lifestyle modifications' Wear compression stockings: These help to improve blood flow by compressing the legs and pushing the blood up to the heart. A healthcare professional is able to prescribe an appropriate pair of compression stockings. Eat an appropriate diet: It is advised to eat a healthy, balanced diet rich in protein, dairy, fresh fruits and vegetables. It is advised to eat small meals more often, for example, six small meals spread out throughout the day instead of three big meals. Maintain adequate hydration: Increase fluid intake in the form of clear liquids, juices, broths and fruits with high water content. This helps to increase fluid levels, blood volume and maintain salt and water balance. Exercise: POTS can decrease exercise tolerance and cause fatigue and weakness, making exercise difficult. However, even light exercise like walking, jogging or yoga can improve blood flow and improve heart health. Get adequate sleep. Raise the head from the bed first and then the rest of the body slowly to reduce symptoms. Obtain psychological support and join support groups to help manage depression and stress associated with chronic illnesses."
Is pseudotumor cerebri serious?,"'Pseudotumor cerebri'' is a medical condition that causes increased pressure inside the skull (intracranial pressure). This is due to increased fluid accumulation inside the skull. This fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced inside the brain ''cavities'' and lubricates the coverings of the brain. Either increased CSF production or reduced absorption can cause CSF to accumulate. ''Pseudotumor cerebri'' can cause serious and permanent complications if left untreated. It can cause progressive and permanent ''loss of vision''. Thus, people with pseudotumor cerebri must go for regular eye exams and checkups so that ''eye problems'' are diagnosed and treated before they progress.''In some people, pseudotumor cerebri may recur after treatment. Therefore, regular checkups by the doctor are important to help monitor symptoms and screen for any underlying problems.' "
What is pseudotumor cerebri?,"'The term pseudotumor cerebri means a false ''brain tumor'' because several symptoms of this condition mimic a brain ''tumor''. It occurs in certain susceptible individuals who are on medications to treat ''cancer'' or even ''acne''. It is a medical condition in which there is increased pressure inside the skull due to buildup or reduced absorption of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, the fluid present inside the skull). Pseudotumor cerebri is also called ''idiopathic intracranial hypertension'' because there is no obvious cause of increased intracranial pressure in this condition. It causes symptoms such as ''headache'' and loss of vision that get worse with time. Pseudotumor cerebri can affect anyone. However, it is most common in women between 20 and 50 years of age.''Depending on the onset and duration of symptoms, pseudotumor cerebri can be one of two types' Acute pseudotumor cerebri: In this form, the symptoms happen suddenly. This often occurs after a head injury or stroke. Chronic pseudotumor cerebri: In this form, the symptoms develop gradually over time. Chronic pseudotumor cerebri may be caused by some underlying medical condition."
What are the symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri?,'The symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri often mimic those of a brain tumor. The signs and symptoms include''The symptoms may become worse while straining or exerting such as during ''exercise''. This is because ''exercise'' can increase intracranial pressure.' Headache Blurred vision Diplopia (double vision) Loss of vision Dizziness Nausea with or without vomiting Neck stiffness Difficulty walking Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) Forgetfulness Depression
Can pseudotumor cerebri be cured?,"'Pseudotumor cerebri can be treated by medications and surgery. The condition, however, may recur in some people despite treatment. Therefore, regular checkups by the doctor are important to help monitor symptoms and screen for any underlying problems.''Treatment options may vary depending on several factors such as the presence of any underlying conditions and severity of signs and symptoms. Treatment for pseudotumor cerebri can include' Weight loss may be needed in individuals who are obese or overweight through lifestyle changes or surgery. Limiting the intake of fluids or salt is recommended. Surgical options to reduce intracranial pressure, such as therapeutic shunting that involves surgical placement of a shunt (a special kind of tube) to drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lower spine into the abdomen, may be needed. This will remove excess CSF and relieve the intracranial pressure. A spinal tap or removal of excess fluid through a lumbar puncture may be done to reduce the pressure. Medications may be given to reduce fluid buildup and CSF pressure. These include diuretics that will help remove excess fluid from the body."
What is psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis'' is a chronic skin inflammation. ''Psoriasis'' causes areas of the skin to be reddish with thick silvery, dry scales. ''Psoriasis'' can be itchy and sometimes painful. ''Psoriasis'' is a persistent disease that is caused by a misdirected immune system. Inherited genes and certain environmental conditions may also play a significant role in the development of psoriasis.' "
Is psoriasis contagious?,"'No. Psoriasis is not ''contagious''. Psoriasis is not transmitted sexually or by physical contact. Psoriasis is not caused by lifestyle, ''diet'', or bad hygiene.''While the exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, researchers consider environmental, genetic, and immune system factors as playing roles in the establishment of the disease. For example, environmental factors can trigger exacerbations of the disease, including cold weather, ''trauma'', infections, alcohol intake, and some chemicals and/or ''drugs'"". Certain genes are more commonly found in people with psoriasis, and psoriasis commonly runs in families. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease whereby one's immune system is misdirected to cause inflammation in the skin. Current treatments often take advantage of this concept by modifying immune responses to improve psoriasis. Moreover, it is also known that, occasionally, after an immunological-related event occurs (for example, recovering from ""'strep throat'', after antimalarial drugs, or cessation of steroid therapy) there can be activation of psoriasis.' "
How long will it take for someone to know if he or she has psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis is diagnosed by the clinical appearance of reddish skin with silvery, white scales. Of note, there are different types of psoriasis (including ''pustular psoriasis'', ''guttate psoriasis'', ''erythrodermic psoriasis'', and ''psoriatic arthritis'') that are diagnosed by their appearance.' "
Can psoriasis spread?,"""Psoriasis is not contagious, so it can't spread from one person to another. However, in an individual, it is not unusual to have more than one area of skin involvement. Over time, additional body sites can develop psoriasis lesions. In general, psoriasis lesions develop on the elbows, knees, ""'scalp'', ears, low back, and between the buttocks.' "
Is there a cure for psoriasis?,"'Unfortunately, there is no cure for psoriasis. However, there are multiple ways to manage the ''disease. Medications, light therapy, ''stress'' reduction, adjunctive therapy sessions, moisturizers with salicylic acid, and sunlight are treatments. Some treatments can be used together. For best results, many clinicians suggest psoriasis be managed by a dermatologist skilled in treating this chronic disease.' "
When should someone consult a medical caregiver about psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis is not considered a medical emergency, but once a lesion or two develops on the skin that resembles the description for a psoriatic lesion, the individual should make a consultation with a dermatologist or an appointment with their doctor to consider initiating proper treatment.' "
Is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) contagious?,"'Respiratory syncytial virus'' (RSV) is ''contagious'"". In the United States, it's the most common cause of inflammation of the small airways in the ""'lungs'' (bronchiolitis) and of ''pneumonia'' in children under 1 year of age. It also is significant cause of respiratory illnesses in older adults. Nearly all children in the U.S. will have been infected by RSV by 2 years of age. RSV usually causes a mild respiratory infection, but it can occasionally cause more serious infections that require hospitalization from ''breathing'' compromise with bronchiolitis or ''pneumonia''. RSV was discovered in 1956 (isolated from a chimpanzee but later found to be from human origins) and was designated chimpanzee coryza agent by J. Morris and associates. Years later, the ''viruses'' were renamed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In virology terminology, RSV is an enveloped RNA virus and is a member of the family ''Paramyxoviridae'' that infects lung tissue.' "
"What is the incubation period for a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
infection?","'Most infants and children and older adults usually develop symptoms about 4 to 6 days after their first exposure to RSV. This is referred to as the incubation period. Symptoms of RSV include a ''runny nose'' and ''decreased appetite'' followed by ''coughing'', ''sneezing'', no ''fever'' or a mild ''fever'' at 1 to 3 days. Most individuals with RSV who are otherwise healthy do not require hospitalization. However, some very young infants and others may develop more serious symptoms of ''wheezing'', irritability, decreased activity, ''cyanosis'' (blue-gray color to skin) and breathing difficulties. Some of these individuals may require short (3 to 5 days) hospital stays. Even more severe infections can require supported breathing. Definitive diagnosis can be done by viral cultures, detecting RSV antigens, ''PCR'' assays, and molecular probes (molecules used to detect other molecules or structures).' "
What is the contagious period for RSV?,"'The symptoms described in the previous section usually last approximately 1 week during which symptoms gradually disappear. Individuals are usually no longer contagious after the symptoms disappear (5 to 8 days). However, individuals with weakened immune systems can be contagious for as long as 4 weeks.' "
How does respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) spread?,"'RSV is spread person to person. ''Coughs'' and/or sneezes distribute droplets filled with the RSV microbes into the air. If uninfected individuals have the droplets contact their mouth, nose, or eyes, or inhale them, they may become infected with RSV. Infections can also occur from direct person-to-person contact such as kissing the face of an infected child. In this way, RSV can be transferred from infants to adults and from infants to ''pregnant'' adults. In addition, indirect contact with RSV-infected droplets that have landed on surfaces that can be touched, such as doorknobs, eating utensils, or toys, can also become sources that transfer the infection. RSV can survive for many hours on hard surfaces.' "
When should I seek medical care for anyone with RSV infection?,"'Most children and some adults who develop RSV infections do not need to seek medical care. Individuals with premature infants, young children with chronic heart or lung conditions, and children or adults with weakened immune systems should seek medical care immediately if infection with RSV is suspected. While there is no commercially available RSV vaccine, there is a drug called palivizumab (''Synagis'"") that may be used in certain infants and children who are at high risk for developing severe RSV infection. Unfortunately, this drug cannot help or cure children already suffering from serious RSV disease and cannot prevent infection with RSV. The drug's function, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, is to reduce the severity of RSV in children (mainly under 1 year of age) with underlying problems such as congenital ""'heart disease'', chronic lung disease, or other debilitating conditions.'  "
What is ringworm?,"'Ringworm'' is a ''rash'' caused by a fungus in the skin. ''Ringworm'' is caused by various genera and species of fungi (for examples, ''Trichophyton'' species, ''Epidermophyton'' species). The term ''ringworm'' is used because the ''rash'' often occurs in a ringlike, circular pattern. ''Ringworm'' is also referred to as a form of tinea or dermatophytosis. Other terms for ''ringworm'' are based on the location of the infection, such as '""athlete's foot""', ''jock itch'' (groin), and others. ''Ringworm'' is a common ''skin infection'' worldwide.'  "
Is ringworm contagious?,"'Ringworm is very ''contagious'"". Ringworm can be transferred from person to person by direct contact (skin to skin) and also by indirect contact such as touching an infected person's clothing or even by touching a bench or other object that has contacted an infected person's skin. It can be acquired in ""'swimming'' pool and hot tub areas by indirect contact. Humans can acquire ringworm from animals (for example, from ''dogs'').' "
How long is ringworm contagious? Is ringworm contagious during treatment?,'Ringworm is ''contagious'' as long as lesions are present. It stops being contagious about 24-48 hours after treatment begins.' 
What is the incubation period for ringworm?,'The incubation period ranges from about 4-14 days.' 
How will I know if I am infected with ringworm?,"""The time from initial contact with the fungus to symptoms (incubation period) ranges from about 4-14 days and, depending upon what part of the body's infected, symptoms and signs can be ""'itchy'' skin with a ring-shaped ''rash'', red, scaly and cracking skin or plaques, and/or ''hair loss''. It is possible for ringworm to be contagious during the incubation period (before ringworm symptoms and signs are apparent). If the fingernails become infected, the fingernails may become discolored and thickened. Patients with abnormally ''depressed'' immune systems usually have more severe symptoms and may develop skin abscesses and large areas of infected skin. Most ringworm infections are diagnosed by a microscopic examination of skin scrapings. Sometimes a fungal culture of the infected skin area is used to identify the infection. Some clinicians suggest that close relatives of infected individuals also be treated even if they show no symptoms or signs of ringworm since often family members of an infected person frequently become infected.' "
How does ringworm spread?,"'Ringworm is easily spread from person to person by touching infected areas on another person or by touching clothing or other objects that have been in contact with an infected person. Ringworm can be spread by people using locker rooms for ''swimming'' pools or locker rooms for other athletic events. People who have ''excessive sweating'' and wear tight clothing are more susceptible to ringworm infection. Ringworm infection is common in wrestlers. Covering skin areas that are infected with ringworm does not guarantee that a person is not contagious. Theoretically, direct skin-to-skin contact in water or a swimming pool or hot tub may spread the infection but is far less likely to do so than direct skin-to-skin contact elsewhere. In addition, it is possible to become infected from infected animals that have ringworm.' "
How will I know if I am cured of ringworm?,"'In general, ringworm is not contagious about 24-48 hours after topical medication treatment. However, treatment protocols usually require about one to two weeks of treatment. If treatment is interrupted or not completed, it is possible to have ringworm reoccur. Most forms of ringworm can be treated with ''over-the-counter'' medications in cream, lotion, or powder forms. These include ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin, Mycelex, and many others). These medications are antifungal medications. Even if an individual is successfully cured of ringworm, it is still possible to become reinfected if the individual encounters another source of infection (an infected person or contaminated object).' "
When should I seek medical care for a ringworm infection?,"'Many individuals can be treated with ''over-the-counter'' creams and lotions and cured. However, this treatment may not work for all individuals. Individuals should contact a health care provider if they have a ringworm infection that is getting worse or does not resolve using over-the-counter medications. Ringworm on the ''scalp'' usually requires treatment with prescription antifungal medications, so these individuals should contact their physician for treatment. Individuals who have a weakened immune system must contact their physician quickly as severe infection with complications may occur, including secondary ''bacterial infections''.'  "
Which other rheumatoid arthritis drugs are safe in pregnancy?,"'Antirheumatoid ''drugs'' that are safe to use during pregnancy are as follows:' Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine): It is completely safe to take throughout pregnancy. Infliximab/adalimumab: It is safe to use up to 20 weeks of pregnancy period. In exceptional cases, it can be used throughout pregnancy. Enbrel (Etanercept): It can be continued up to 30 to 32 weeks of pregnancy. In extreme cases, it may be used throughout pregnancy. Certolizumab: It is safe to use in all nine months of the pregnancy. Golimumab: It is advised to take this medicine only in the first three months of pregnancy. Kineret (Anakinra): This drug is used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis and prescribed when most of the options fail during pregnancy. In the first three months, this is relatively safe, but in the following months, the drug may cause ill effects in the unborn baby. Orencia (abatacept): It is not safe in pregnancy and may cause side effects like cleft palate, facial abnormalities, and brain developmental abnormalities in the unborn baby. It is to be used only if no other options are available."
Does rituximab cross the placenta?,"'Rituximab may cross the placenta in the later ''stages of pregnancy''. However, there are no studies to prove whether rituximab causes ''birth defects'' in the newborns. Mothers and infants exposed to rituximab in the second and third trimester should be monitored for the risk of infections and abnormally low white blood cell counts. Low counts of specific white blood cells may make the ''newborn'' prone to infections.' "
Can rituximab cause miscarriage or stillbirth?,"'No study has linked rituximab to ''miscarriage'' or ''stillbirth''; therefore, more research into this subject is essential.' "
Can rituximab cause infertility?,'Rituximab has not known to cause ''infertility'' and appears to be a safe and effective alternative. The use of rituximab before pregnancy is well tolerated. It is advised to stop the drug 12 months before attempting to conceive.' 
Can rituximab cause preterm birth?,"'Rituximab may not cause preterm birth or low birth weight ''babies'', but ''rheumatoid arthritis'' has shown to increase the risk of preterm birth. More research is required to conclude about rituximab and its association with the preterm birth if any.' "
What is roseola?,"'Roseola'' (also termed ''sixth disease'', roseola infantum, and exanthema subitum) is a common viral infection that occurs mainly in children between 6-24 months of age. The virus that causes roseola is usually relatively benign, because about two-thirds of children infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, roseola begins with a high ''fever'' (102 F-105 F) that breaks in about three to seven days. When the ''fever'' breaks, a reddish or pinkish ''rash'' characteristic of roseola occurs all over the body (starting on the trunk and spreading to the arms, legs, and face) and lasts from a few hours to a few days. There is no specific treatment for roseola; however, the fever can be reduced with ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') and cool sponge baths.' "
Is roseola contagious? What is the incubation period for roseola?,"'Roseola is ''contagious''. It has an incubation period (from time of exposure to the virus to symptom development) from about five to 14 days. The individual remains contagious until one or two days after the fever subsides. The roseola ''rash'' may still be present, but the child or individual is usually not contagious after the fever abates. Roseola is caused by a common virus (belonging to the family of herpesviruses and termed HHV-6). This virus does not cause ''cold sores'' or genital infections. Most ''pregnant'' females (about 96%) are immune to HHV-6 so there are only rare reports of a mother contracting roseola and transferring the virus to the fetus, in which HHV-6 may cause problems like ''miscarriage'' or ''birth defects''.' "
How will I know if someone or my child has roseola?,"'If someone has roseola, usually they become infected from other individuals (for example, the children in a day-care center or siblings). The key to diagnosis of roseola is that when the fever stops, a non-itchy rash develops all over the body. The person, usually a child, has a decrease in appetite, mild ''diarrhea'', or slight ''cough'' with ''runny nose'' but otherwise seems to be acting normal. This is not unusual for a child with roseola. However, if a child develops a high fever (102 F-105 F) and the fever does not go down, the child may develop more severe symptoms. Most individuals visit their physician/pediatrician to rule out other potential problems that may produce similar but more severe symptoms (for example, ''meningitis'').' "
How is roseola transmitted?,"""Roseola is easily spread from person to person in day-care centers, preschools, and among siblings by contact with a person's respiratory secretions and/or saliva. Sharing items like cups or utensils and even toys that are sometimes chewed on by a child can spread the virus to other children easily. For those adults who have never been infected with HHV-6, they too, may become infected, but the illness is not usually as severe in adults."" "
When will I know that someone or my child is cured of roseola?,"'In general, once the fever has abated for about a day or so, the person is usually cured and no longer contagious for roseola. The rash may linger on for a few days. Fortunately, most people are infected as a child and develop an immune response that renders them protected, usually for life, against roseola.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about roseola?,"""If you or your child has a rash that doesn't improve after a few days or, more importantly, the individual has fever of about 103 F, or fever less than 103 F that lasts for about one week, or if you or your child develops any ""'seizures'"", slows or stops eating and drinking, or is not acting normal, the individual should be seen urgently by their physician or seen in a (pediatric) emergency department. If you aren't sure about what to do, contact your child's pediatrician or your physician immediately."" "
What is Salmonella?,"'Salmonella'' is a genus name that represents gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria that cause disease in humans and other warm-blooded animals. ''Salmonella'' can cause various diseases, such as ''food poisoning'', gastrointestinal inflammation, ''typhoid fever'', and ''sepsis''.\xa0The CDC estimates that every year in the United States about 1.2 million people are infected with ''Salmonella'', 23,000 need hospital care, and 450 deaths occur.'  "
Is Salmonella contagious?,"'Many of the members of the bacterial genus ''Salmonella'' are ''contagious''. The organisms can be transferred from person to person by both direct (via saliva, fecal/oral spread, kissing) and indirect contact (for example, using contaminated eating utensils). In addition, a number of ''Salmonella'' species can be transmitted from animals (snakes, turtles, chickens, hamsters, cats, and ''dogs'') to humans, usually by direct contact. Undercooked meats and especially eggs are common sources of ''Salmonella'' bacteria.' "
What is the contagious period for Salmonella?,"'Some individuals may shed ''Salmonella'' for days to weeks after symptoms have resolved and remain ''contagious'' during this time. A few individuals may become carriers and be contagious for years (for example, Typhoid Mary, a food handler responsible for several typhoid outbreaks).' "
How will I know if someone has a Salmonella infection? What is the incubation period for salmonellosis?,"'Most symptoms of salmonellosis begin within 12-24 hours after exposure to the bacteria. It is not unusual to have a group of individuals come down with the same symptoms if ''Salmonella'' infection comes from contaminated foods. Health care professionals often recognize outbreaks when people who eat or drink from a contaminated source begin to seek medical care (for example, a large family reunion with many people eat contaminated potato salad). The symptoms and signs usually include ''stomach cramps'', ''diarrhea'', ''fever'', and occasionally ''vomiting''. Usually, a physician makes the diagnosis after laboratory examination of the ''stool'' sample, because the bacteria can be easily cultivated and identified. However, if the symptoms are relatively mild (for example, no ''dehydration''), by the time the organism is identified, most people will be spontaneously cured of the disease.' "
How is Salmonella transmitted?,"'Salmonella'' spread usually through the fecal-oral route (contamination of hands or objects with bacteria shed in the ''stool''); ''Salmonella'' can be excreted into the environment and easily contaminate food and water sources. When animals or humans touch or consume food or drink contaminated with ''Salmonella'', they are likely to get salmonellosis. The contaminated animal or human then can easily spread the bacteria to other animals and/or humans by direct and indirect contact.' "
How will I know if I am cured of Salmonella?,"'Salmonellosis for most people is an uncomfortable disease that lasts about three to five days and often requires only good oral fluid intake for recovery. The symptoms gradually wane, and most people spontaneously clear the infection in this time period. However, for other individuals, ''symptoms of dehydration'', ''nausea'', and ''vomiting'' may be more severe. Most infected patients do not require antibiotic treatment, although some individuals will require antibiotics to help cure the infection. A few individuals may have very severe symptoms that require the patient to be hospitalized.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about Salmonella?,"'If any individual shows signs of ''dehydration'' (for example, reduced or absent urination, dry ''mucus'' membranes), have immunodeficiency problems, or has ''sickle cell anemia'', he or she should contact a physician urgently or go to an emergency department to avoid complications of severe ''dehydration'' and/or ''sepsis'' (spread of infection to the bloodstream). People at higher risk for ''Salmonella'' infections are infants, young children, and anyone with suppressed immune system function.'  "
What is salpingo-oophorectomy?,"'Salpingo-oophorectomy is a procedure to remove the fallopian tube (salpingectomy) and ovaries (oophorectomy). If one set of fallopian tubes and ovary is removed, it is known as a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. If both sets of fallopian tubes and ovaries are removed, it is known as a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.''After the surgery, women may stop menstruating and experience sudden premature ''menopause''. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may also lead to permanent ''infertility''.' "
Why is salpingo-oophorectomy performed?,"'Salpingo-oophorectomy is performed in the following conditions:' Ovarian cancer A genetic mutation that increases cancer chance Cancers of other organs in the reproductive system Endometriosis (inner lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, ovaries, or cervix) Ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube (a condition where the embryo implants itself in the fallopian tube) Patient requiring hysterectomy (partial or complete removal of the uterus) Benign tumors with no ovarian tissue spared Pelvic inflammatory disease (infection of the ovaries and surrounding area) Torsion of the ovary (a condition where the ovary twist around the connecting stalk) Severe pelvic pain that originates in the reproductive organs A tubo-ovarian abscess not responsive to antibiotics"
How is salpingo-oophorectomy performed?,"'Salpingo-oophorectomy is performed under general (or rarely regional) anesthesia. The physician makes a cut about 10-15 cm long into the abdominal wall either vertically (extending from pubic bone to the navel) or horizontally (across the pubic hairline). After entering the abdomen, the physician explores the abdomen and pelvis. Using an instrument, the physician retracts the bowel to expose the pelvis.''The physician identifies the ovaries and the fallopian tubes and detaches them. The physician sidelines the ureters as they lie near the ovaries. This procedure is more painful than the laparoscopic one and the healing period is longer. Salpingo-oophorectomy can also be performed with the help of a laparoscope to avoid large abdominal incision and shorten recovery time.' "
What is Sativa?,"'Cannabis is an annual, flowering herb that includes three different species:''Cannabis sativa or Sativa is tall, pale green color herbs that constitute a group of a substance known as cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are mainly of two types:''Cannabis is the most illegally used drug in the world and is associated with various ''mental health'' issues. The leaves, seeds, stems, or roots are mainly used for intoxication purposes.' Cannabis sativa Cannabis indica Cannabis ruderalis Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): This component causes hunger and has intoxicating properties. Besides, it relieves pain and nausea. Cannabidiol (CBD): This component of cannabis doesn’t have any intoxicating properties. It alleviates anxiety, pain, inflammation, and many other conditions."
What are the common effects of cannabis?,'General effects of cannabis include:' Euphoria Feelings of wellbeing Spontaneous laughter and excitement Increased appetite Dry mouth Quiet and reflective mood
When will cannabis show up on a drug test?,"'Several tests are used to detect the presence of cannabis. They include:' Saliva test: A person can test positive for cannabis for up to 34-48 hours after last use. Urine test: Infrequent users test positive for 1-3 days, moderate users can test positive for 7-21 days, and a heavy user can test positive for a month or longer after the last drug use. Hair test: Cannabis can be detected on a hair test for up to 90 days. Blood test: Cannabis will be visible on a blood test for up to 36 hours."
How long is cannabis expected to stay in the body?,"'Detectable amounts of THC may remain in the body for days or even weeks after use. THC is absorbed by various body tissues and organs or metabolized by the ''liver''. The metabolites thus formed are immediately removed via urine. However, THC stored in the body tissue is released back into the bloodstream over time, where it is metabolized by the liver. In a chronic user, the excretion rate of THC through urine is less; hence, it builds up in the liver.' "
What is scabies?,"'Human ''scabies'' is caused by the human ''itch'' ''mite'' (''Sarcoptes scabiei'', variation or subtype ''hominis''). This itch mite burrows into the upper layers of skin and lays its eggs in the skin. This itch mite is found worldwide and often causes outbreaks in places where people are living close together, such as dormitories, nursing homes, institutions, or prisons. The ''rash'' often includes areas such as the web spaces of the fingers, wrists, beltline, ''feet'', scrotum, and areolas, but other areas may get infected.'  "
Is scabies contagious?,"'Scabies'' is ''contagious''. However, it usually requires fairly long skin-to-skin contact with an infested person (for example, carrying a person, sleeping with the person, or ''sexual partners''). Infrequently, it may be contagious through contact with clothing or bedding, but this form of transfer of ''scabies'' is thought to be very infrequent. In general, most people who become infested with scabies usually have about 10-15 itch mites on their body. One exception to this rule is a scabies infestation that is seen less frequently called crusted or Norwegian scabies, in which large areas of skin are infected with huge numbers (thousands) of itch mites; a person with this type of scabies is highly contagious.''Although pets can become infested with similar itch mites, they are not usually spread from humans to animals or from animals to humans.' "
What is the contagious period for scabies?,"'As long as an individual has about 10 to 15 itch mites on their body and has skin-to-skin contact with an uninfested person, that person is contagious for scabies and can pass the organisms to others. In addition, a person who has recently acquired scabies and is in the incubation period (without symptoms) is also contagious for scabies.' "
How will I know if I have scabies? What is the incubation period for scabies?,"'People usually know if they have scabies from the presence of a very itchy ''rash'' that has little tendrils that extend out of an area of itchy rash (these are the burrows that the itch mite makes in the skin layers), especially if they have noticed similar skin changes on a person with whom they may have had close contact. Some physicians may do skin scrapings and, with fairly common laboratory stains, may identify the mite and/or its eggs or fecal matter in the skin scrapings viewed with a microscope. In young children, pinkish-brown nodules may form on the skin. The incubation period for scabies can be up to eight weeks; the infested person can be contagious during this period.' "
How is scabies transmitted?,"'Scabies is spread by direct and usually prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has the disease. Indirect spread can sometimes occur through contaminated clothing or towels. Crusted or Norwegian scabies is highly contagious, both from direct contact and indirect contact (from clothing, bedding, towels, for example) because of the very high concentration of mites.' "
How will I know if I am cured of scabies?,"'Scabicides like permethrin are used topically (spread onto skin) to kill the itch mites. Usually, a cream or lotion is applied from the neck down to the feet, and the cure results in remission and finally disappearance of the rash. However, sometimes people may seem to be cured only to have ''itching'' and the rash return in a few weeks. This may be due to inadequate treatment that allows the eggs to survive and hatch or may be due to inadequate cleaning of clothing or bedding (scabies mites are killed by hot water and dryer heat, or dry cleaning, and cannot survive more than two or three days away from human skin) or simply due to contacting someone who has scabies. If there is no further symptom development about two to four weeks after treatment, most people will be cured of scabies.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about scabies?,"'If you or someone close to you has scabies, contact a physician for treatment and for advice about who else may benefit from treatment (for example, sexual partners, family members). Patients with crusted scabies require isolation and/or barriers (gloves, gowns, for example) to protect others from the mites; such patients often are hospitalized and also tested for underlying health problems (such as immunosuppression).' "
What is scarlet fever?,"'Scarlet fever'' (also termed ''scarlatina'') is an illness characterized by a bright red ''rash'' that can cover most of the body and is caused by a toxin secreted by group A streptococci, a type of gram-positive ''coccus''-shaped (round) bacteria. ''Scarlet fever'' usually occurs in individuals that have had a ''strep throat'' infection or occasionally in those who have had streptococcal ''skin infection''. The majority of people who get scarlet ''fever'' are between about 5-12 years of age. (It rarely occurs in ''babies'' under 2 years of age.)' "
Is scarlet fever contagious?,"'Scarlet ''fever'' may be ''contagious'' if a person becomes infected with a group A streptococcal bacterial strain that produces the scarlet fever toxin. However, not all people who get group A ''streptococcal infections'' develop scarlet fever; only a small percentage of these patients go on to develop scarlet fever.' "
How will I know if I have scarlet fever?,"'Individuals with scarlet fever usually have some or most of the following symptoms and signs:'""The red rash may develop later than other symptoms (up to about seven days later). The physician can give a clinical diagnosis from the patient's history, physical exam, and possibly a ""'rapid strep test''; in some individuals, a throat culture may be done to determine if ''group A strep'' is the infecting bacteria.' Red rash with a sandpaper feel when touched Fever above 101 F Red, sore throat A ""strawberry-like"" appearance of the tongue Headache, body aches Nausea and/or vomiting Enlarged lymph nodes Some individuals may have whitish coating on the tongue and/or back of the throat"
How is scarlet fever transmitted?,"'The bacterial infection (''strep throat'' or skin infection) that results in scarlet fever is contagious, but some people will get the infection (such as ''strep throat'') without going on to develop scarlet fever. Consequently, scarlet fever spread is the secondary result of the way most group A streptococcal infections are spread -- by direct person-to-person contact (kissing, touching mucus membranes, for example) and by indirect methods such as contaminated eating utensils, cups, and other objects used by infected individuals. However, not all individuals who get group A streptococcal infections will develop scarlet fever.' "
When will I know I am cured of scarlet fever?,"'Scarlet fever can be treated with antibiotics because once the streptococci bacteria are debilitated or killed, they stop producing toxin and the rash will slowly fade away. A medical ''caregiver'' can help diagnose scarlet fever by doing a simple ''strep'' test or, if indicated, can culture the throat to confirm a group A streptococcal infection. Individuals with scarlet fever need to be treated quickly with antibiotics to reduce the chance of developing long-term health problems such as ''rheumatic fever'', ''kidney disease'', ear infections, and other types of infections.'

When should I contact a physician about scarlet fever?,"'An individual should see a medical caregiver if they have had a recent infection of strep throat and then develop the ''symptoms of scarlet fever'"" (especially a reddish rash on the body). It's important to have a physician evaluate the patient to be sure that appropriate diagnosis and treatment (antibiotics) take place quickly to avoid or reduce the chances of any of the complications of scarlet fever such as organ impairment (of the kidneys, heart, joints, for example).""  "
What is sepsis?,"   Sepsis is an illness that affects all parts of the body; it occurs in response to an infection and can become life-threatening. If not treated quickly, organ failure can occur, leading to septic shock, low blood pressure, and eventually, death. Sepsis is a general term that covers all types of infectious processes that can lead to the above symptoms. Many types of bacteria, viruses, and occasionally, fungi and parasites may cause sepsis; for the purpose of this article, the term pathogens will be used to include all of the above-mentioned organisms. Pathogens that cause sepsis usually first cause localized infections such as pneumonia, kidney infections, abdominal infections, sexually transmitted diseases, or septicemia (blood stream infections) that eventually may result in sepsis. The term sepsis is frequently preceded by other terms (for example, MRSA, neonatal, meningococcal, or neutropenic, for example); these terms usually indicate a sepsis subtype that may describe the infecting organism, like ""MRSA sepsis"" or a condition found in a subtype, like ""neutropenic sepsis."""
Is sepsis contagious?,"'Sepsis itself is not ''contagious'', but the pathogens that cause sepsis are usually contagious. What this means is that the pathogens that may cause sepsis can be transferred, usually from person to person, directly or indirectly (by contaminated items like utensils or clothing). If the pathogens are transferred, the person may or may not develop sepsis; consequently, most septic individuals, while capable of transferring pathogens the cause infection, will not necessarily transfer the condition of sepsis. The pathogens that cause sepsis may remain viable for a while after the death of a person; these pathogens are contagious although sepsis is not.' "
How will I know if someone has sepsis?,"'Sepsis is sometimes difficult to diagnose because it shares symptoms from other conditions. However, if a person has any of the following symptoms that are common to individuals with sepsis, he/she or his/her guardians need to contact a physician urgently. If the symptoms are more severe, he or she should go to an emergency department:''There are new definitions of sepsis. A person who meets at least two of the following criteria, plus has confirmed or suspected infection according to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) meets the definition for sepsis:''Consequently, a physician usually determines if a person is septic by physical exam and blood tests; people who are septic require hospitalization and immediate treatment.' Fever and chills Rapid heart rate Rapid breathing Low blood pressure Rash Confusion and/or disorientation Elevated heart rate greater than 90 Body temperature either high (greater than 100.4 F) or low (less than 98.6 F) Respiratory rate of greater than 20 breaths per minute or a reduced partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in arterial blood Abnormal white blood cell count (WBC) greater than 12,000 or less than 4,000 cells/ul or 10% bands (immature white blood cells)"
How does sepsis spread?,"""As stated previously, sepsis is not spread from person to person, although the pathogens that can cause sepsis may be spread among people, both directly and indirectly. However, sepsis spreads within a person's body, usually from a site of infection that is somewhat localized to one organ (for example, ""'pneumonia'' in the ''lungs'' or a ''wound'"" infection in the leg). When the localized infection is severe, the pathogen may reach the bloodstream, and when this happens, the pathogen spreads to other organs; in addition, some of the pathogens may quickly multiply in the blood. When these situations arise, the person's infection has spread internally, and the person is considered to be septic."" "
When will I know I am cured of sepsis?,"'Individuals can be cured of sepsis usually by being hospitalized and treated with IV antimicrobial medications that are effective against the organisms causing the infection. Surgical drainage or removal of the source may also be needed. Depending upon the exact cause of the infection, the duration that the person has been septic, and the severity of involvement of organs, recovery can be relatively quick, lengthy, or if treatment begins late in the septic process, organ damage and/or death may occur.''Sepsis is a serious condition; even patients with no signs of organ failure with a timely diagnosis have a 15%-30% chance of death; those patients with severe sepsis and shock have a ''death rate'' of about 40%-60%.' "
When should I contact a health care provider about sepsis?,"'The best time to contact a health care provider about sepsis is before it occurs. This may sound impossible, but in reality, it is easy to do. If a person has any signs of increasing difficulties or severe symptoms of any infectious disease (for example, pneumonia, ''meningitis'', wound infections, or organ infections, such as kidney infections), he or she should contact a physician or go to an emergency department quickly. Appropriate treatment of infections can reduce the chance of developing sepsis. Alternatively, if a person develops signs and symptoms of SIRS listed above, they should immediately go to an emergency department.''The key to preventing poor outcomes (organ damage, death) of sepsis is early and appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the infecting pathogen.'  "
What is septoplasty? ,"'The septum is a partition separating the two chambers of the nose. The septum is composed of bone, cartilage, and lined by mucous membrane. It is usually straight, provides a framework to the nose, and maintains its elasticity too. It can handle a substantial amount of force; however, a tremendous force can lead to ''fracture'', resulting in the deviation of the septum. A ''deviated septum'' can lead to nasal obstruction.''Septoplasty'' is a procedure to straighten a deviated septum. Repositioning of the deviated septum clears the obstruction, improves the airflow, and the quality of life.' "
What is septoplasty used for? ,'Septoplasty can be recommended in any of the following conditions:''Septoplasty should be avoided if any of the following medical conditions persists:' nasal obstruction caused due to deformity in the nose bleeding from nostrils obstruction present in the opening of the sinus trauma which might result in the deviation of the septum cosmetic purpose; and septoplasty can provide access to the surgeon to perform brain tumor resection large hole or fissures present in the septum cocaine abuse cancer of the lymph nodes a condition that causes inflammation of blood vessels of the septum (Wegner granulomatosis)
What does the septoplasty procedure involve?," You will have to consult your surgeon before the surgery; during the consultation, your surgeon may ask you to undergo a CT scan. You will have to detail your medical as well as medication history; mention specifically any history of allergy, nasal surgery, and nasal trauma. You will be informed about the risks and benefits of this procedure. You may be asked to refrain from taking herbal extracts and vitamin supplements a few weeks before the surgery. If you are allergic to a certain food or environmental irritant, you need to discuss it with your surgeon.  Your surgeon might give you local or general anesthesia to make you numb or unconscious throughout the procedure.  An incision is made on the side of the nose to access the septum.  The surgeon lifts the mucous membrane; which is the protective covering of septum.  The deviation is corrected and repositioned to the desired shape.  The incision is closed and packed with petroleum jelly stripping.  Septoplasty requires only a few hours to complete. Breath through the mouth while the packing is in place. While resting, the patient should avoid lying flat, keeping their head at an elevation above the feet for 24 to 48 hours. Opioid pain medication may be prescribed to control post-operative pain."
When to call the doctor about septoplasty complications,"'If any of these symptoms appear, immediately contact your physician:''Septoplasty is generally a low risk procedure and the healing takes place rapidly. It is possible to initially have nasal obstruction and worsening of symptoms. However, with the advancement of technology such as endoscopic septoplasty and laser-assisted septoplasty, results have improved and relapse rates have decreased.' Intense pain, Swelling, Difficulty in breathing, Postoperative fever, Nausea, Diarrhea, Lowering blood pressure, Inflammation and reddening of the skin, Excessive bleeding from nostrils and Loss of smell."
What is hydronephrosis?,"'Hydronephrosis involves the collection of urine in the kidney due to incomplete emptying of the urinary tract. This results in swelling and obstruction of the kidney. The swelling or obstruction can occur at:''Hydronephrosis may be of two types:''Hydronephrosis, if left untreated, can lead to ''kidney failure''.''The different stages of severe hydronephrosis include:' Opening of the kidneys The ureters The bladder The urethra Unilateral hydronephrosis (only one kidney is affected) Bilateral hydronephrosis (both the kidneys are affected) Grade 0: There Is hardly any swelling. Grade 1: Mild swelling at the center of the kidney (pelvis) but no dilation in the chambers of the kidney (calyces). Grade 2: Mild swelling of the pelvis and the calyces. Grade 3: Moderate swelling of the pelvis and calyces. Grade 4: Severe swelling of pelvis and calyces, which appear ballooned."
What causes hydronephrosis?,"'The most common cause of hydronephrosis includes:''In women, hydronephrosis may occur as a result of:' Kidney stones Tumors in the bladder or prostate gland Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlargement of the prostate gland causing pressure in the urethra) Blood clots in the kidney or ureter Narrowing of the urinary tract Nerve or muscle problems in the kidney or ureters Urinary retention Vesicoureteral reflux (a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidney) Ureterocele (a condition where the lower part of the ureter may protrude into the bladder) Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (blockage at the point where the kidney joins the ureter) Ureterovesical junction obstruction (blockage at the point where the ureter joins the bladder) Posterior urethral valves (a congenital condition in which there are abnormal laps of tissue in the urethra) Urethral cancer Pregnancy (expansion of uterus can exert pressure on the ureters) Uterine prolapse (uterus sags down from its normal position) Cystocele (a condition where the wall between a woman’s bladder and her vagina weakens and allows the bladder to droop into the vagina)"
What are the symptoms of hydronephrosis?,"'Hydronephrosis generally doesn’t cause any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they include:''In the case of ''electrolyte'' abnormalities, it may lead to:' Nausea Vomiting Blood in the urine Weakness or malaise Fever due to a urinary tract infection Chest pain Shortness of breath Leg swelling Sudden or intense pain in the back or side No key changes in urine output Cloudy urine Painful urination Heart rhythm disturbance Muscle spasms"
What is the treatment for severe hydronephrosis?,"'Surgery would be recommended only in the most severe cases. The goal of the surgery is to reduce swelling and pressure in the kidney by establishing a free flow of the urine. The most common surgical procedure used for the treatment of hydronephrosis is pyeloplasty. Pyeloplasty repairs the most common type of blockage, ureteropelvic junction (blockage at the point where the kidney joins the ureter). It removes the narrowed or obstructed part of the ureter and reconnects the healthy portion to the kidney’s drainage system. The physician may perform pyeloplasty in:' Traditional or open incision method Robot-assisted pyeloplasty"
What is shingles?,"'Shingles'' is a viral infection caused by the ''varicella-zoster virus'' (also known as VZV, ''herpes zoster''). ''Shingles'' usually causes a single strip or patch of painful ''blisters'"" that wrap around either the left or right side of the patient's torso or extremities, although it may occur on the face. ""'Shingles'' results from the activation of the ''chickenpox'' virus already present, but inactive (dormant), in nerve tissues. The virus remains dormant in spinal nerves (dorsal root ganglia) usually after the person has had ''chickenpox'' as a child. The virus can remain dormant in the nerve tissues for many years and then can become activated along an infected nerve or group of nerves, usually in adults (50-60 years and older). However, about 20%-25% of ''shingles'' infections occur in individuals less than 20 years old. The ''shingles'' virus can even damage the unborn baby and newborns if their mothers develop ''chickenpox'' during ''pregnancy''.' "
Is shingles contagious?,"'Individuals who never have had ''chickenpox'' and have not received the ''vaccine'' for ''chickenpox'' are susceptible to ''shingles'' virus infection. Consequently, ''shingles'' disease is ''contagious'' for chickenpox by transmission of the ''varicella''-zoster virus (VZV) to these individuals. However, the ''shingles'' ''rash'' is not ''contagious'' in that a ''rash'' from one individual is unable to spread to another individual so the disease, shingles itself, is not directly contagious. Nevertheless, the disease of shingles can pass the virus from its active ''rash'' ''blisters'' directly to another individual (an adult, child, or baby) who can become infected with the ''varicella-zoster virus'' if the individual is not immune to VZV and develop chickenpox. The chickenpox infection can cause shingles in some individuals later in their life. Shingles, in this manner, may be considered to be indirectly contagious. Moreover, because ''varicella''-zoster virus infection is commonly contagious in the form of chickenpox, and this infection can eventually lead to shingles development in some patients, it is fair for some researchers to say that shingles is indirectly contagious by the spread of chickenpox.' "
When is shingles contagious?,"'A ''rash'' will begin to appear after a few days of symptoms such as''During the appearance of this rash and subsequent ''blister'' formation, the patient begins to shed the virus from the skin lesions and is contagious.''Shingles has two stages:' skin tingling, burning, and/or numbness, usually on only one side of the body. a prodromal stage and active stage; and the prodromal stage or period consists of symptoms without the rash while the active stage or period begins when the rash starts."
How long is shingles contagious?,"'Classic ''symptoms of shingles'' are painful blisters in a band along a nerve distribution on one side of the body. These blisters usually break open and ooze fluid. This may last about five to seven days. The ''pain'' in the area of the rash can be intense as the nerve is irritated. The individual is contagious and can spread the virus when blisters are forming and until all of the blisters have crusted over. The rash may heal in about two to four weeks, and some skin areas may ''scar''.' "
Can shingles spread by touch or by saliva?,"'The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) that is shed from the shingles lesions is very contagious to those people who have never had exposure to chickenpox or the ''chickenpox vaccine'' who then touch the blisters. Although shingles is not routinely thought of as being transmitted or spread by intercourse or sexual contact, individuals should be aware that during these activities if they touch other individuals with shingles who are still shedding the virus, the virus may be spread to the uninfected individual. This second individual, if not immune to VZV, would then have the virus in them and could develop chickenpox and perhaps shingles in the future.''Theoretically, it may be possible to spread VZV to other individuals during a zoster outbreak because VZV has been reportedly detected in saliva and nasal secretions in individuals with chickenpox and/or shingles. However, there is little or no data about the frequency of secretion transmission. Such spread of VZV to others is considered to occur rarely.' "
When should people seek medical care for shingles?,"'If people develop ''pain'' and/or a rash in a band on one side of the body or face, they should seek medical care is as soon as possible as treatments may reduce the ''pain'' and any possible further nerve or ''eye problems''. If the rash occurs near the nose or eyes, they should seek emergency medical care. Individuals with a medical problem or taking medication that decreases their immune response (such as ''pregnancy'', ''cancer'', ''chemotherapy'', ''HIV'') should seek help immediately if they suspect they may be developing shingles. Children should be vaccinated against chickenpox and older individuals (50-60 years old) should discuss the ''shingles vaccine'' (''Zostavax'', Shingrix) with their doctors to reduce the risk of developing shingles.' "
What is pharyngitis?,"'Pharyngitis'' is medical term for a ''sore throat''. Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx (throat) that results in throat discomfort, ''pain'' and/or throat scratchiness; in some individuals it may cause painful swallowing. ''Sore throat'' is usually caused by a viral infection and less commonly, a bacterial infection usually by group A ''streptococci'' (''strep throat''). Other causes of ''sore throat'' include inflammation due to ''allergy'', toxins, or ''cancer''. Some doctors distinguish pharyngitis from ''laryngitis'' and/or ''tonsillitis'', but others do not. ''Laryngitis'' is confined to the larynx (voice box) while tonsillitis is inflammation confined to the ''tonsils''. Since it is not unusual for a pharyngitis to spread to adjacent structures like the ''tonsils'' or larynx, it is not unreasonable to lump these inflammatory diseases together; however, the symptoms are slightly different for each disease.''There are three types of pharyngitis:'   Non-exudative (does not produce fluids like pus; this is the most common form of pharyngitis and usually caused by viruses) Exudative (produces a body fluid like pus; this usually suggest a bacterial cause) Ulcerative (production of small ulcers and/or a grayish membrane on parts of the pharynx). Ulcerative pharyngitis (mainly caused by bacteria) is infrequently seen but is considered to be a medical emergency."
Is a sore throat contagious?,"'Yes, pharyngitis (viral and bacterial) is ''contagious'' and can be transmitted from one person to another. Usually, mucus, nasal discharge and saliva can contain the viruses and/or bacteria that can cause sore throat. Consequently, even kissing can cause transfer of these organisms. Unfortunately, some of these viruses and bacteria that cause sore throat can survive for a period of time on objects like towels, brushes or even clothing, so that contact with these contaminated items can spread the disease.''Sore throat caused by ''allergy'', toxins, ''trauma'' or ''cancers'' are not contagious. The focus of this article will be on sore throat caused by viruses and bacteria since these are the most common causes of sore throat.' "
How will I know if someone has a sore throat?,"'Pharyngitis can cause the pharynx (the throat) tissue to become swollen and reddish. Some people can develop a mild ''fever'' and have some difficulties speaking or swallowing food. ''swollen Lymph nodes'' and tonsils may enlarge and become tender. Those affected may feel excessively tired.''Laboratory studies can detect group A ''streptococci'' (rapid antigen detection). Other diagnostic tests can include throat cultures or the ''mono'' spot test. A health care professional may help you determine the cause of your sore throat. In addition, some doctors use the specific set of criteria (Centor criteria) to determine the likelihood of a person getting ''strep throat'' (''Streptococcal'' pharyngitis).' "
How is sore throat spread?,"""Sore throat is transmitted from one person to another by bacteria or viruses in the infected person's saliva, mucus and/or nasal discharge. People that are not infected just need to come in contact with these substances directly or indirectly by touching contaminated objects such as hairbrushes, towels, or toothbrushes."" "
How will I know if I'm cured of a sore throat?,"'Sore throat caused by viruses is usually contagious as long as symptoms are present. Once the symptoms disappear, the person is usually no longer contagious and is ""cured"" of viral pharyngitis. However, the person may still be susceptible to other types of viruses that can cause pharyngitis. Bacterial pharyngitis usually is also contagious as long as symptoms are present but, in contrast to viral pharyngitis, antibiotics may reduce the time span of infection, and the individual becomes no longer contagious about 24 hours after taking an effective antibiotic.'  "
When should I contact a health care professional about a sore throat?,"'If a person has a sore throat should contact a health care professional if they''Go to an emergency department immediately if a person develops' have a sore throat for more than a week, if they develop a reddish rash, if the lymph nodes are swollen and tender, and/or if the person has a high fever. drooling, shortness of breath, or difficulty in eating or swallowing foods or liquids."
What is strep throat?,"   Strep throat is a contagious throat infection usually caused by group A streptococcal bacteria. The incubation period for strep throat is between 1-5 days after being exposed to the bacteria. Strep throat is often accompanied by symptoms and signs, for example:FeverChillsSwollen lymph nodes on the sides of the neckHeadacheNausea or vomiting Fever Chills Swollen lymph nodes on the sides of the neck Headache Nausea or vomiting Strep throat is one of many causes of inflammation of the pharynx (pharyngitis), also referred to as sore throat. Streptococcus spp. are the most common bacterial species to cause a sore throat (15%-30% of pharyngitis in children and about 5 to 10% in adults). A rapid strep test can be done in your doctor's office to determine if you have strep or a sore throat. Usually, people with strep throat are treated with antibiotics and aren't contagious for about 24 hours after starting the antbiotics. However, strep throat that is not treated with antibiotics is contagious for about 2-3 weeks after exposure. There are many other causes of sore throat including many viruses, bacteria other than strep, allergies, acid reflux, and tumors. Your doctor can help sort through the causes of your sore throat."
Is strep throat contagious?,"'Strep throat'' is contagious for about 2-3 weeks in individuals who do not take antibiotics. However, individuals who take antibiotics for ''strep throat'' usually are no longer contagious about 24 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy. The bacteria that cause ''strep'' throat can be transmitted person-to-person by direct contact, especially from ''mucus'' droplets from the mouth and indirect contact, such as kissing and sharing utensils or drinking cups.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of strep throat?,"'The incubation period for strep throat varies about 1-5 days after exposure to the bacteria. If you develop a ''sore throat'' and a ''fever'', you should consider the possibility that you may have strep throat, especially if another family member or a coworker has been diagnosed with the disease. The pattern of ''symptoms of strep throat'' include:''Some people with strep throat also may develop:'   Sore throat Fever (usually greater than 102 F or 38.8 C) Whitish or yellowish pus areas on the tonsils and throat Headache Muscle pain Nausea and vomiting Strep throat is often accompanied by swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Rarely, a person with strep throat can develop a rash. If a you have a runny nose, constant sneezing and coughing, it actually is less likely that you have strep throat."
How is strep throat spread?," Strep throat is easily spread by exposure to droplets from an infected person's sneeze or cough. Kissing can also cause person-to-person spread. Moreover, streptococci can survive for a while on toothbrushes, doorknobs, and other objects. If people who do not have strep throat touch these contaminated objects, and subsequently touch their mouth or nose, they can become infected."
Is there a test to diagnose strep?,"'Strep throat is diagnosed by the medical history, physical examination of the throat, and with a ''rapid strep test'' on a swab of the throat. The rapid strep test can be confirmed by a throat culture. However, most physicians will diagnose and begin treatment before a throat culture test is completed. You will receive the results of the test the same day.' "
How do I know when I'm cured of the infection?,"   Individuals can be cured of strep throat by taking antibiotics. A person taking antibiotics is no longer contagious after about 24 hours. Without taking antibiotics, persons with strep throat are infectious for about three weeks. A person is cured when symptoms are cleared."
Is strep throat serious? When should I call the doctor?,"'If you suspect that you have strep throat, you should contact a doctor; however, it is more urgent if you have these symptoms and signs .''The major reason to seek medical care for strep throat is that if it goes untreated or is not appropriately treated, serious complications can develop, and include:''Early treatment of strep throat can help prevent these and other complications.'

Develop symptoms of drooling, difficulty breathing and/or swallowing Ear infections Abscesses (retropharyngeal and/or peritonsillar) Toxic shock syndrome Rheumatic fever Scarlet fever Autoimmune disorders Kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis)"
What is swine flu?,"'Swine flu'' is a term that is being replaced by the designation ''H1N1'' ''influenza'' and refers to a particular type of influenza virus that has a genetic makeup that includes viral genes that are associated with the infection of pigs. Swine ''flu'' was the cause of an influenza outbreak that was considered to be a pandemic in 2009. The term swine flu came about because the type of influenza virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic, H1N1, contained genetic elements of influenza virus that were mainly thought to be characteristic for influenza strains that caused ''flu-like symptoms'' in pigs but had genetically changed to be able to cause flu in humans.''Additionally, another type of swine flu virus, H3N2v, has been discovered. It is not as ''contagious'' as H1N1, but there are reports of this virus spreading from pigs to humans. In general, this swine flu is similar in most aspects to the disease caused by H1N1, but it is apparently less severe and is not easily spread from person to person. This article will focus on the swine flu virus H1N1.' "
Is swine flu (H1N1) contagious?,"'Swine flu is contagious from person to person. It can be spread through the air by droplets produced by ''sneezing'', ''coughing'', or by direct contact with saliva or mucus secretions. In addition, the virus can survive for a short time outside the infected individual, so people can indirectly contact H1N1 by touching areas (desks, utensils, cups, tabletops, for example) where droplets have recently landed after an infected person with the virus has inadvertently contaminated a surface.' "
What is the contagious period for swine flu (H1N1)?,"'The contagious period for H1N1 is about one day before symptoms develop to about a week after symptoms develop in individuals who spontaneously overcome the infection. In severely infected people and in some children, some contagious ''viruses'' may be shed for a few weeks.' "
How will I know if I have swine flu?,"'Symptoms of swine flu (H1N1) begin like regular ''flu symptoms'' and include ''fever'', ''sore throat'', ''cough'', body aches, ''headaches'', ''chills'', and ''fatigue''. Some individuals may also have ''diarrhea'' and ''vomiting''. The majority of people with swine flu are not diagnosed definitively with tests. Unfortunately, these symptoms can be similar to those produced by other diseases so usually a person finds out that they have swine flu (H1N1) after contacting their physician, who can run several different blood tests and other viral identification tests to determine what type of flu or other illness may be present. The tests are usually run on those with more severe symptoms.' "
How is swine flu transmitted?,"'Swine flu (H1N1) is spread by person-to-person contact by either touching surfaces contaminated by an infected person or by encountering expelled droplets produced when a person is coughing or sneezing. Consequently, swine flu is spread both directly and indirectly by infected individuals to others. However, the spread of swine flu is not 100% effective, as researchers have suggested that people living in the same house with someone infected by the H1N1 virus will have only an 8%-19% chance of getting infected.' "
How will I know if I am cured of swine flu?,"'The majority of people who get swine flu (H1N1) spontaneously ""cure"" themselves with their effective immune response. Others may benefit from the use of antiviral medications and/or supportive therapy, which can include hospitalization for those patients who have severe infections. Unfortunately, even though individuals can be cured of a specific viral type, influenza viruses (including ones that fall into the general category of swine flu viruses) mutate fairly rapidly so that immune protection against one viral type does not mean that a person will be fully or even partially protected against other influenza virus types. This is the reason that each year a new ''vaccine'' is typically produced for the flu season that is designed to protect vaccinated people against the predominant influenza types expected to be present in the population.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about swine flu (H1N1)?,"'Most people who become infected with H1N1 viruses do not need to contact a medical ''caregiver'"" because the symptoms abate and the infected individual recovers over a period of about a week or so. However, if the symptoms become serious (for example, the patient's symptoms worsen), it is important to contact a physician urgently or possibly emergently. Anyone with symptoms of ""'shortness of breath'', ''confusion'', rapid ''breathing'', reduced responsiveness, or bluish skin (especially in children) should be taken to an emergency department.''Those with suppressed immune function, those who have multiple medical problems, or who are ''pregnant'' and suspect they have become infected with swine flu (H1N1) should contact their physician immediately. If they have any of the more severe symptoms listed above, they should consider going to an emergency department.' "
How does tattoo removal work?,"'Tattoos are permanent, as the ink is inserted deep into the skin by the needles.' Tattoo removal requires using an ultra-short pulse laser. These lasers work by emitting extremely hot blasts, in short, quick bursts to heat up and break apart the ink particles. They work at an extremely fast speed; some blasts are as quick as one trillionth of a second. The speed plays a significant role in the effectiveness of removal. Ink color matters because they absorb different wavelengths. The immune system thinks of it as an intruder. Like other injuries to the skin, white blood cells will spring into action to protect the body. The white blood cells will attempt to break down the ink, though very slowly. They will also carry small parts of it to the liver, where the ink will be processed and discharged. Once the laser breaks the ink down into smaller pieces, the white blood cells seize them and carry them to the liver so they can be flushed out along with other foreign objects and toxins in the body."
What are the different ways to remove a tattoo?,"'Common techniques for tattoo removal include laser surgery, surgical removal, and ''dermabrasion''.' Laser surgery: Most common way to remove a tattoo. Before laser treatment, the skin is numbed with local anesthesia. Then a powerful pulse of energy is applied to the tattoo to heat and shatter the tattoo ink. Multicolored tattoos might need treatment with various lasers and different wavelengths. An individual may need repeated sessions to lighten the tattoo, and it might not be possible to completely erase the tattoo. Surgery: Surgical tattoo removal is effective only on small tattoos, but it leaves a scar. During surgical removal, the skin is numbed with an injection of local anesthesia. The tattoo is removed with a scalpel, and the edges of the skin are stitched back together. Dermabrasion: During dermabrasion, the tattooed area is typically chilled until numb. Then the tattooed skin is sanded down to deeper levels with a high-speed rotary device that has an abrasive wheel or brush. This allows the tattoo ink to leach out of the skin. Chemical peels: This procedure may not require anesthesia. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) peels can also be used to remove tattoos. TCA is a mild acid that is applied to the skin to remove the outer layers of the skin and the tattoo ink."
What are the side effects of the tattoo removal process?,'The most common side effects include:' Redness Soreness Sensitive skin Swelling Bleeding Blisters Hyperpigmentation (dark patches of skin) Hypopigmentation (light patches of skin) Infection
How to take care of skin after the tattoo removal process?,"'It is considered that the first 24 hours after the process is crucial for better healing of the skin. The healing process may be enhanced by following the below steps:' Apply a cold compress to help reduce the inflammation or discomfort that may likely occur Avoid physical activities and hot shower during the first 36 hours Avoid using any type of makeup for 48 hours after undergoing the removal process Avoid using any non prescribed medication or cream on the treated spot for the first 24 hours Apply ointment, such as antibacterial cream or Neosporin, on the treated spot for at least 3 days Dressing on the treated skin may need to be changed every day For at least 2 weeks, limit exposure to the sun, pool water, hot tubs, or saltwater"
What is Ebola?,"'Ebola'' (also termed ''Ebola hemorrhagic fever'') is a viral disease that, until the 2014 outbreak in West Africa, was considered a rare but deadly disease that causes a potentially fatal ''fever'' in humans as well as infection of nonhuman primates (for example monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees) and African fruit bats. Before 2014, small outbreaks were usually confined to small isolated villages in Africa. In 2014, an outbreak had villagers going to local cities for treatment and resulted in spreading the disease to a number of countries in Africa. A few individuals transferred the disease to other countries (for example, the U.S., Spain); caregivers got the disease from those individuals being treated for ''Ebola''. The 2014 outbreak of Ebola was the largest in history; current estimates are that about 29,000 individuals were probably infected, with about 15,200 laboratory-confirmed infections that resulted in about 11,200 deaths, according to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC). The CDC states that there are no current infectious Ebola patients in Senegal, Nigeria, Spain, United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy.\xa0Since the 2014 outbreak, there have been others. The Congo reported an outbreak in May 2018 that is still not stopped as of August 2018.''There is some evidence that four of the five viral types that cause Ebola likely circulate in nonhuman primates; in addition, there is some evidence that ''Ebola virus'' types may be carried by African fruit bats. If these primates and/or bats are handled or eaten (Bush meat) by people, humans may contract the disease and then pass it on to other humans.' "
Is Ebola contagious?,"'Ebola is ''contagious''. The virus spreads through direct contact (via broken skin or mucous membranes, in the nose, mouth, or eyes). Blood or body fluids from infected individuals are capable of causing infection in others. Examples of body fluids include urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, ''breast milk'', and semen. Unfortunately, objects such as needles and syringes that have been contaminated with blood or body fluids can also transmit the disease. Furthermore, contact with animals such as primates and/or African fruit bats may also transmit the ''Ebola virus'' from these animals to humans.'""When a person dies from Ebola, the person's body has high concentrations of the virus both a few days before and after death. Also, the virus is in high ""'concentration'' on contaminated sheets, clothing, or other items that have touched the recently deceased person. In these situations, Ebola is highly ''contagious''.'""Full protective gear is advised to protect health care workers from becoming infected; for more details, the reader is referred to CDC's guidelines (see ""'http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/evaluating-patients/think-ebola.html'').' "
What is the incubation period for the Ebola virus?,"'The incubation period for Ebola varies from about two to 21 days. People are not contagious for the disease until the first symptoms appear (sudden onset of ''fatigue'', ''fever'', ''muscle pain'', ''headache'', and/or ''sore throat'').' "
How will I know if someone is infected with Ebola?,"'It is sometimes difficult to know if a person is infected with the ''Ebola virus''; however, if a person has been a medical ''caregiver'' to a patient with Ebola or if a person has recently spent time in an area where Ebola infection is present, then a person who develops early signs and symptoms, such as ''fever'', ''headache'', ''weakness'', ''stomach pain'', ''fatigue'', ''lack of appetite'', ''diarrhea'', ''vomiting'', joint and muscle ''aches'', or unexplained bleeding, should be suspected to be infected with Ebola until proven otherwise.''The diagnosis of Ebola is usually done by special blood tests (''PCR'' or ''polymerase chain reaction'', virus isolation, and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ''ELISA'' test). These tests are available in some state labs and the CDC in the United States and can help distinguish between Ebola, Marburg, and other viral diseases that produce similar symptoms.' "
How is the Ebola virus transmitted?,"""Outbreaks often begin with a single individual or small group that contacts an infected primate and/or African fruit bat. Members of such a small group then can pass an Ebola infection from person to person by blood or body fluid contact as the virus travels through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes. Ebola usually does not begin to become contagious to other people until symptoms develop. Rapid spread can occur when an individual is dying or dies because of the massive viral load within the individual's body and body secretions.""""The disease can spread quickly in hospitals, clinics, and among families because of the close proximity to the infected patient's body fluids. Appropriate protective equipment and sterilization of needles and other items are needed to avoid the spread of Ebola ""'viruses'' to other individuals, especially medical caregivers.''Ebola is not spread through the air or by water or foods that have not come in contact with infected humans, primates, or African fruit bats.' "
How will I know if someone is cured of Ebola? What is the contagious period for Ebola?,"'In general, individuals who spontaneously self-cure or, after hospitalization and supportive care, survive the infection, become noncontagious after about 21 days from the onset of symptoms (a few investigators suggest 42 days should be considered the length of time to become noncontagious since the risk is 0.2%-12% that some individuals are contagious longer than 21 days). This time period is complicated by the fact that some men who survived the disease have ''Ebola virus'' in their semen for three months, and in a few men, the semen has had Ebola virus present for over nine months. In addition, some patients may have dormant Ebola virus in their eyes for extended time periods. Researchers are still trying to determine if these dormant ''viruses'' can reactivate and cause disease in the previously infected patient or in uninfected individuals who come in contact with them; they advise precautions be taken to avoid exposure to body fluids in patients with dormant Ebola infection.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about Ebola?,"'Because Ebola can be a devastating disease, anyone who is likely to have been exposed to Ebola should immediately contact a medical ''caregiver'', preferably someone at the CDC in the United States. This notification allows the CDC to do close monitoring of potentially infected or infectious individuals according to current CDC guidelines and will afford those individuals who develop the infection early treatment, to increase their chances for survival and decrease the possibility of transferring infection to others.\xa0In addition, an experimental ''vaccine'' (rVSV-ZEBOV) helps to prevent infections with Ebola, and a new antiviral drug, mAb114, helps the body render the Ebola virus ineffective.''Individuals and health care workers who have been exposed to Ebola-infected patients and develop early symptoms of Ebola need to isolate themselves from other uninfected individuals and go to a clinic or hospital in their country that is capable of taking care of Ebola-infected patients. Ideally, such individuals should be careful (use barrier techniques and/or inform EMS or other transporters) not to contaminate anyone while they are transported to the appropriate health care facilities.' "
What is the external cephalic version?,"'External cephalic version is a procedure where the physician turns the fetus from a buttock or ''feet''-down position (breech presentation) or a side-lying position (transverse position) to a head-down position (cephalic presentation) before the commencement of ''labor''. The physician applies pressure on the abdomen to turn the fetus head-down. Presentation other than cephalic may pose difficulty in vaginal birth. Thus, ECV makes it easier for the physician to deliver by the vagina. If performed accurately, ECV avoids the need for cesarean delivery, thus avoiding its risk.''ECV is performed typically around 37 weeks before the beginning of ''labor''.' "
When is the external cephalic version recommended?,'External cephalic is recommended in women who are around 36 weeks ''pregnant'' and have a breech presentation. ECV is recommended when' Mother has a single fetus. The fetus has not dropped to the pelvis. There is enough amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus for sufficient turning of the fetus. The mother has been pregnant before.
When is the external cephalic version recommended?,'ECV is usually avoided when' The amniotic sac is ruptured. The mother has heart problems that make it difficult for her to receive tocolytic medicines to prevent uterine contractions. There is fetal distress (fetal experiences oxygen deprivation). There is placenta previa (placenta partially or completely covers the cervix) or placenta abruption. The fetus’s neck is straight rather than being bent. The fetus has a congenital defect. The mother is pregnant with multiple fetuses. The fetus doesn’t have a normal shape.
How is the external cephalic version performed?,"'Before an ECV, the physician administers tocolytic medicine to relax the uterus and prevent its contraction. When the uterus is relaxed, the physician places both their hands on the surface of your abdomen. Next, the physician pushes in the required direction until the fetus flips to the cephalic position. The physician continuously monitors the fetal heart rate, and if there is a dip in the heart rate, they may stop the procedure and opt for cesarean delivery. If the first attempt was unsuccessful, the physician might repeat the maneuver by giving epidural anesthesia to reduce the ''pain''.' "
What is the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Stomach flu'' or ''gastroenteritis'' is a general term for a number of inflammatory problems that occur in the gastrointestinal tract. ''Gastroenteritis'' is a better term because when some individuals use the term ""stomach ''flu'',"" they get the term confused with the ''flu'' (''influenza'') and the ''viruses'' that cause the flu. ''Influenza'' ''viruses'' do not cause ''stomach flu''.''The most common symptoms of the stomach flu include:''Other symptoms may include:''Because stomach flu means gastroenteritis and, because when the term “stomach flu” is used, the readers usually mean acute gastroenteritis caused by viruses (mainly ''Norovirus''); the emphasis of this article will be on ''Norovirus''- caused gastroenteritis although other causes will be mentioned.'   Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Fever Headache Body aches Dehydration"
Is the stomach flu contagious? What causes it?,"'There are many causes of stomach flu. The most common causes are ''contagious'' gastroenteritis, and include:''However, many other causes of gastroenteritis that are not ''contagious'' include:''Many medications list gastroenteritis as a common side effect.' Viruses (for example, Norovirus, Adenovirus and others), Bacteria (for example,  Salmonella,  Shigella,  E. coli and others), and Parasites (for example  Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium, and others). Food allergies Antibiotics Toxins"
What are the signs and symptoms of the stomach flu?,"'The primary symptom of stomach flu or gastroenteritis is ''diarrhea'' that does not contain blood usually accompanied by ''nausea'', some occasional ''vomiting'', and abdominal cramping.''The incubation time for gastroenteritis varies according to the particular cause. The most rapid incubation time is usually with viral illnesses (for example, for ''Norovirus'', which is about 1 -2 days), and the infected person may become contagious during this time without symptoms of ''nausea'' or ''diarrhea''.''Noncontagious causes (''allergies'', toxins, medication side effects) may produce symptoms very rapidly (minutes to hours) and in some people, the symptoms may become so severe that they require emergency care.'""Doctors usually base the diagnosis on the person's history and physical exam; some patients will need further blood and fecal tests done to determine the cause, especially in more severe infections.""  "
How is the stomach flu spread (how do you get it)?,"   Contagious causes of stomach flu (gastroenteritis) are spread usually through contamination of food or water or by person-to-person (fecal – oral route) spread via contaminated droplets containing infectious organisms. Some of the contagious causes of gastroenteritis (most notably, Norovirus) can be spread by kissing and other close personal contact or on surfaces where droplets containing viruses or other agents survive. Some viruses can even be spread to household pets such as dogs that, in turn, can spread the disease to other people. Fortunately, most causes of contagious gastroenteritis are not spread by breastfeeding or through breast milk. Noncontagious gastroenteritis such as that related to side effects of medicine or food allergies is not spread from person to person."
How long is the stomach flu contagious (incubation period)?,"'Stomach flu is contagious when the organisms that cause stomach flu are spread to uninfected individuals. The timeframe or how long the infected person remains contagious depends on the infecting cause. For example, most common cause of stomach flu is ''Norovirus''. It has an incubation period of about 12 - 48 hours, and can cause the person to be contagious during the incubation period and for as long as they shed virus (usually about three days after symptoms stop but sometimes up to two weeks). ''Norovirus'' symptoms usually last about one to two days and is sometimes termed the 24 hour stomach flu.''Other infectious agents such as other viral ''strains'', bacteria, and other infectious agents have incubation periods and contagious periods unique to them. Because this is an introductory article about stomach flu, readers are recommended to check the incubation periods and contagious periods of whatever infectious agent is thought to be causing the problem (for example, ''Salmonella'' or ''E. coli'').' "
How long does the stomach flu last?,"'For contagious causes of stomach flu, many individuals have symptoms that last about 2 to 5 days, after which the symptoms tend to resolve. Once the symptoms resolve, an individual may be considered ""cured"" of stomach flu. However, it\'s not unusual for that same individual to develop stomach flu again at some point in time if they are exposed to other causes, or in some individuals, the same infectious cause. Occasionally, the stomach flu ""symptoms"" progress and goes on to become another more severe disease (for example, salmonellosis or ''shigellosis'').'  "
How long do the contagious causes of the stomach flu last on surfaces?,"'The most common cause of stomach flu, noroviruses, can live on surfaces for up to about two weeks. Consequently, is important to try to avoid contaminating surfaces while you are infected with the virus and equally important, anyone not infected individual should wash their hands with soap and water after touching surfaces that might be contaminated. Cleaning surfaces like doorknobs or kitchen counters with a diluted bleach and water solution can help reduce the chance of infection.''For other causes of stomach flu (gastroenteritis), the reader is suggested to look up the specific infectious agent to determine how long it will remain viable and contagious on surfaces.' "
When should I contact a doctor for the stomach flu?,"'Many people get contagious stomach flu from different causes, but in general, they recover from the infection in about 2 to 5 days and usually do not contact a health-care professional. Most doctors consider gastroenteritis to be a self-limiting disease. Unfortunately some people, especially the elderly, young children, and individuals that have multiple medical problems may develop more severe symptoms. Consequently, people should contact their health-care professional or emergency department if one or more the following occurs:'   Gastroenteritis symptoms that last more than five days The intensity of the symptoms increases A fever above 101 F or 38.3 C Bloody diarrhea Signs of dehydration appear, for example, little or no urine output or dry mucous membranes Constant or increasing abdominal pains A person is immunocompromised, has other medical problems, or is pregnant Facial or throat swelling Shortness of breath"
What is fish odor syndrome?,"'Fish odor syndrome or trimethylaminuria is a condition characterized by a fishy body odor that is released in the sweat, urine, breath and reproductive fluids due to excessive excretion of trimethylamine. People with this condition cannot break down trimethylamine, a chemical found in certain foods. Excess trimethylamine is the cause of the fishy odor or rotten fish odor.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of fish odor syndrome?,"'Besides the fishy odor, patients may also experience the following symptoms:''The aforementioned symptoms may not be experienced by all and vary from person to person.''The fishy odor may get worse with increased ''sweating'', exercising, and emotional ''stress''. In women, the symptoms may worsen during''The odor may vary from person to person and can interfere with daily aspects of life, leading to social or psychological problems.' Anemia Depression Hypertension Neutropenia (low blood neutrophil count) Recurrent pneumonia Splenomegaly (an increased spleen size) Tachycardia (an increased heart rate) High urine trimethylamine level Low self-esteem Anxiety Social isolation Menstruation Taking oral contraceptives Menopause"
What causes fish odor syndrome?,"'Fish odor syndrome is caused by a deficiency in FMO3 genes. Under normal conditions, the trimethylamine precursors (choline) obtained from the food is reduced to trimethylamine by colonic bacteria. This trimethylamine then diffuses through the cell membranes to reach the liver, and the FMO3 in the liver oxidizes trimethylamine into odorless trimethylamine-N-oxide; however, people having fish odor syndrome fail to metabolize trimethylamine due to lack of FMO3 genes, leading to the buildup of trimethylamine.' "
How do people inherit fish odor syndrome?,"'People inherit fish odor syndrome by an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both the copies of the gene obtained from parents have mutations. Both the parents may each carry one copy of mutated genes (carriers), although they do not show any signs or symptoms. In some conditions, the carriers may exhibit mild or occasional symptoms. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, there is a 25% chance to have a child with fish odor syndrome.' "
How to diagnose fish odor syndrome?,"'Fish odor syndrome is usually diagnosed based on the symptoms, a clinical examination, and a test to measure the level of trimethylamine in the urine. Genetic testing can help to diagnose fish odor syndrome.' "
Is there a cure for post-polio syndrome?,"'Presently, there are no medications to cure, stop or reverse the damage caused by the ''post-polio syndrome''. However, the symptoms of the post-''polio'' syndrome may be managed via a multipronged approach. This involves rehabilitation and lifestyle changes for the management of this condition. Researchers have demonstrated that non-fatiguing exercises may improve muscle strength and reduce ''tiredness'' in people with post-polio syndrome. These approaches help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.''The following recommendations may help in the management of post-polio syndrome' Seek medical advice from a physician experienced in the treatment of neuromuscular disorders. Do regular non-fatiguing exercises under the supervision of an experienced health professional. Use mobility aids, ventilation equipment and revise activities of daily living to avoid rapid muscle tiring and total body exhaustion. Avoid activities that cause pain or fatigue that lasts for more than 10 minutes. Join support groups that encourage self-help, group participation and positive action. Counseling for the affected person and their family that may help individuals and families adjust to the late effects of polio. Speech therapy that may be sought along with voice-strengthening exercises. This will also help to compensate for swallowing difficulties. Go for sleep apnea treatment to cope with sleeping difficulties. The healthcare provider may suggest changes in sleeping patterns such as avoiding sleeping on the back or using devices that help to keep the airways open during sleep. Take medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen that may be used to relieve pain. "
What is post-polio syndrome?,"'Post-polio syndrome is a medical condition that affects polio survivors in the form of newer muscle ''weakness'' at least 10 to 20 years after an attack of acute poliomyelitis infection. Poliomyelitis or polio is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. It can occur at any age and affect a person’s nervous system.\xa0Introduction of the polio ''vaccine'' in 1955 has helped to eradicate this disease from the United States. Because of the worldwide use of the polio vaccine, polio is now endemic to only three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan).''Although post-polio syndrome is rarely life-threatening, the symptoms can significantly affect the affected person’s ability to function independently. Weakness of the respiratory muscles may cause trouble with proper ''breathing''. This can hamper daytime activities and ''sleep''. When the muscles involved in swallowing are affected, there can be aspiration or entry of food and liquids into the ''lungs'', leading to serious complications such as ''pneumonia''. The affected person may also report decreased tolerance to ''cold''.' In post-polio syndrome, polio survivors begin experiencing new weakening in muscles previously affected by polio infection. The syndrome most often presents as progressive muscle weakness and muscle atrophy (a gradual decrease in the size of the affected muscles). There may be pain because of joint degeneration and increasing skeletal deformities such as scoliosis (sideways curvature of the spine). Pain and deformities may precede weakness and muscle atrophy. Symptoms may range from minor symptoms to visible muscle weakness and atrophy."
Is post-polio syndrome contagious?,"'Unlike polio, post-polio syndrome is not a ''contagious'' disease, which means others cannot catch it from the affected people. Post-polio syndrome can only affect a polio survivor.' "
What is thrush?,"'Thrush'' is an infection of the oral mucous membranes (inner lining of the mouth and tongue) by the fungus ''Candida albicans''. Thrush is also termed oral thrush, ''oral candidiasis'', and oropharyngeal ''candidiasis''. Thrush infection is not very common in the healthy population. However, thrush can be present in about 5%-7% of ''babies'' less than 1 month old, in ''AIDS'' patients (about 9%-31%), and in approximately 20% of ''cancer'' patients.'  "
Is thrush contagious?,"'Oral thrush, a fungal infection, is not considered ''contagious''. The causative fungus, ''Candida albicans'', is often already a natural inhabitant of the mouth and throat. When the oral environment changes (usually due to an immature or ''depressed'' immune system), the fungus can multiply and cause symptoms. Occasionally, individuals taking antibiotics or steroids (such as ''prednisone'"") can develop thrush. Although thrush is usually considered not to be contagious, one instance where the fungus can be passed back and forth is between infant and mother. An infant may develop thrush and transfer it to the mother's nipples, which become painful with reddish, cracking skin. Conversely, mothers may develop a ""'Candida albicans'' ''yeast infection'' on their nipples while taking antibiotics or steroids and transfer the infection to their babies while ''breastfeeding''. The incubation period for oral thrush is about two to five days.' "
How will I know if I have thrush?,"'Usually, the first common sign of thrush in adults and children is the presence of whitish raised oral lesions (sometimes resembling cottage cheese). The lesions can be on the tongue, the inside of the cheeks, on the gums, ''tonsils'', or the back of the throat. It can be painful and bleed a little if they are scraped when touched or brushed with a ''toothbrush''. Some people with thrush lose the sense of taste while others have a feeling of cotton in the mouth. Severe thrush can spread to the ''esophagus'' and cause ''fever'', ''difficulty swallowing'', and a feeling like something is caught in the throat. Severe thrush can spread to other parts the body such as the ''lungs'', ''liver'', and skin. Most thrush can be diagnosed by simply observing the characteristic lesions. Scrapings can be used to microscopically identify the fungus. In addition, fungal cultures can document ''Candida albicans''.' "
How is thrush spread?,"'In general, most of the population has some trace levels of ''Candida albicans'"" on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Most the time, the fungus causes little or no problems unless there is a change in the mucous membranes, in a person's immune system, or from taking antibiotics or steroids. These situations allow the fungus to proliferate. Consequently, in most instances, there is no transfer from person to person of thrush. The major exception to this is with infants and their breastfeeding mothers, as they may transfer ""'Candida albicans'' between each other.' "
When will I know if I am cured of thrush?,"'In general, mild to moderate oral thrush infections are treated using antifungal mouthwash or lozenges. The treatment is usually for seven to 14 days. For severe thrush, it is advised to treat for twice as long as the symptoms last (for example, 28-42 days). More severe thrush symptoms and signs may persist for a greater length of time (for example, 14-21 days) before they resolve.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about thrush?,"""Contact your child's pediatrician immediately if your infant has any symptoms of thrush. If an adult individual has symptoms or signs of thrush, they should contact their physician for both care and an examination to determine what underlying causes might be leading to the development of thrush.""'If after seven days of treatment, symptoms not improving or are getting worse, contact a physician. If you have an immune system that is suppressed or altered (''HIV'' infection, ''cancer'', breastfeeding, taking antibiotics) and develop symptoms of thrush, contact a doctor immediately.' "
What is tonsillitis?,"'The large ''tonsils'' are two oval-shaped areas of lymphoid tissue that occur on the left and the right side of the throat. These ''tonsils'' are also referred to as the palatine ''tonsils''. In addition, there are two lingual ''tonsils'' located at the base and the back of the left and right tongue. ''Tonsillitis'' is inflammation of one or both of the tonsils. The ''adenoids'' are lymphoid tissue located at the back the pharynx that often become infected with the same microbes at the same time as the tonsils.'  "
Is tonsillitis contagious?,'Most acute infections of the tonsils are due to ''viruses'' or bacteria and usually is ''contagious'' by direct person-to-person contact.''Some individuals can become chronic carriers of potentially infectious bacteria and can be mildly contagious for long periods of time. People who are infected by bacteria and are treated with antibiotics are considered non-contagious after approximately 24-48 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy.' Tonsillitis caused by a virus infection usually is contagious for about seven to 10 days. Bacterial tonsillitis can remain contagious for about two weeks.
How will I know if I have tonsillitis?,"'Symptoms that suggest tonsillitis include'""The tonsils themselves are usually enlarged, reddish, and depending upon the infecting organism may have whitish/yellowish to gray-appearing pus areas on the tonsil's surface. The diagnosis of tonsillitis is usually made clinically by a health-care professional after simply observing the tonsils. However, other tests such as ""'X-rays'' of the soft tissues or a ''CT scan'"" may be ordered if there's some concern about more serious spread of the infection into the neck. In addition, throat cultures are done if ""'strep'' infection is suspected while blood tests may be ordered to detect certain viral infections like ''mononucleosis''.'   fever, sore throat, bad breath, difficulty or irritation while trying to swallow, and tender and possibly enlarged cervical lymph nodes."
How does tonsillitis spread?,"'Tonsillitis is usually spread by direct and/or close contact with an infected person. Contaminated droplets produced by ''coughing'', ''sneezing'' or kissing can be easily transmitted to another person with both viral and ''bacterial infections''.' "
When will I know when I am cured of tonsillitis?,"'Individuals can be cured of tonsillitis, both bacterial and viral types when the symptoms of swollen reddish tonsils and other symptoms go away (about seven to 10 days). Many individuals require no treatment, while some with a bacterial cause may need antibiotics. However, there are some individuals that may have symptoms go away, only to have them return within weeks or months. These individuals are not cured of tonsillitis but have developed chronic, recurrent tonsillitis that eventually may require surgical removal of the tonsils.' "
When should I contact a health care professional about tonsillitis?,"'Usually, tonsillitis is not considered an emergency medical condition. However, you should contact a health care professional if you have''You should seek emergency medical care if you' a sore throat, a fever greater than 38.3 C or 101 F, swollen and tender tonsils with whitish or yellowish to gray-colored coating, or pain on only one side of the throat. are having severe pain, have difficulty swallowing and/or breathing, have a bad headache, and abdominal pain and/or headache."
What is trigeminal neuralgia surgery?,"'Trigeminal neuralgia'' surgery is a treatment for ''nerve pain'' (neuralgia) that is caused by the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve exits the brain directly through the skull to supply sensation to the face. The procedure frees the trapped nerve and stops the transmission of ''pain'' signals from the trigeminal nerve to the brain.\xa0''Trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux, is a type of severe nerve ''pain'' in the forehead, cheek, ''teeth'' and jaw, usually affecting one side of the face.' "
Types of trigeminal neuralgia treatments," Microvascular decompression: This procedure is an open surgery in which the surgeon makes a small opening in the skull (craniotomy) and places a Teflon sponge between the trigeminal nerve and the impinging blood vessel. Percutaneous procedures: These procedures are minimally invasive and involve insertion of a needle into the bundle of nerves where the three branches of the trigeminal nerve join (Gasserian ganglion). There are three kinds of percutaneous procedures:Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal gangliolysis (PRTG) or radiofrequency rhizotomy: An electric current is passed through the needle, producing a thermal lesion in the Gasserian ganglion and disrupting the pain signals.Percutaneous balloon decompression (PBM): A balloon is inserted and inflated in the Gasserian ganglion for up to 10 minutes to damage it and block the pain signals.Percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizotomy (PRGR): Glycerol is injected to destroy the pain transmitting nerve fibers in the Gasserian ganglion. Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal gangliolysis (PRTG) or radiofrequency rhizotomy: An electric current is passed through the needle, producing a thermal lesion in the Gasserian ganglion and disrupting the pain signals. Percutaneous balloon decompression (PBM): A balloon is inserted and inflated in the Gasserian ganglion for up to 10 minutes to damage it and block the pain signals. Percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizotomy (PRGR): Glycerol is injected to destroy the pain transmitting nerve fibers in the Gasserian ganglion. Gamma Knife surgery: Also known as stereotactic brain radiosurgery, this procedure is the least invasive. The Gamma Knife delivers precise, controlled beams of radiation to the trigeminal nerve where it connects to the brain stem and thereby directly stops the pain signal transmission."
Is trigeminal neuralgia surgery brain surgery?,"'Trigeminal neuralgia surgery is not a brain surgery as it does not affect the brain. Microvascular decompression surgery involves making an opening in the skull and the membrane (dura) covering the brain, to access the trigeminal nerve. The brain itself is untouched during the surgery. The percutaneous procedures are minimally invasive with only a needle insertion directly in the nerve, while Gamma Knife surgery is a targeted delivery of radiation to the nerve.' "
Why is a trigeminal neuralgia surgery performed?,"'The trigeminal nerve is the cranial nerve responsible for sensations in the face and motor functions like biting and chewing. The trigeminal nerve has three main branches on each side of the face, sending and receiving signals between the brain and the facial tissues.''When the trigeminal nerve is irritated, it can result in trigeminal neuralgia that can be debilitating. A blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve is the most common cause of trigeminal neuralgia.''Other causes of the trigeminal ''nerve compression'' include''Trigeminal neuralgia may be''Without treatment, typical trigeminal neuralgia can progress to the atypical kind.

Medications are not effective in controlling the pain Patients are intolerant to medications Other previous treatment procedures have failed"
Is tubal sterilization reversible?,"'Tubal ligation'' is technically reversible. However, the procedure is complicated and the results are not guaranteed. Though it is possible to reverse a tubal ligation, it is a major surgery that doesn’t always work, it is rarely covered by insurance and it is not recommended. The success rate of tubal sterilization reversal depends on the method used for tubal ligation and how much of the fallopian tube is damaged after tubal ligation. Women who have had a tubal ligation reversed have a higher than average risk of a fertilized egg implanting in the fallopian tube (''ectopic pregnancy'') rather than in the uterus. This can become a life-threatening emergency.''Other considerations about having a tubal ligation reversed include the following' The surgery takes several hours and most women are hospitalized for at least 2 days. There is no guarantee that the patient will be able to become pregnant after having the reversal. Surgeons usually refuse to perform the surgery if they think there is little chance that it will be successful. About half of the women who request reversal are turned down."
How is tubal sterilization reversal performed?,"'Before the procedure, the doctor will likely suggest getting a complete physical exam. The exam may include\xa0blood\xa0and imaging tests to make sure the ovaries are normal. A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) may be done to check the length and function of the remaining fallopian tubes. The doctor may also suggest some tests for the woman’s partner, such as a\xa0sperm count\xa0and\xa0semen analysis, to rule out any ''fertility'' problems. If it turns out that tubal ligation may be reversed, the doctor specifies a date.''The procedure is usually done under general anesthesia and takes about 2 to 3 hours. The patient’s vitals are monitored throughout the procedure.''All surgery has some risk. The complications of tubal ligation reversal include' The surgeon then makes two small cuts on the belly and cuts out the sealed portion of the fallopian tubes and reattaches the ends carefully with very fine dissolvable surgical sutures. In a few conditions, the surgeon places a small lighted scope, called a laparoscope, through the incisions of the belly button and into the pelvic area. This lets the doctor look at the fallopian tubes and decide if reversal surgery is possible. If the doctor decides it’s okay to do the reversal, they may then make a small surgical cut called a ""bikini cut"" near the pubic hairline. Microscopic instruments attached to the end of the laparoscope let the doctor remove any clips or rings that were used to block tubes and reconnect the ends of the tubes to the uterus using very small stitches. The cuts are closed and the patient may be monitored closely. Patients usually require at least 15 to 30 days to recover after the procedure depending on their age. During the healing process, the patient may be placed on painkillers, antibiotics and vitamin supplements. Anesthesia reactions, such as vomiting, headache and dizziness Excess bleeding Infection Damage to nearby organs The tubal ligation reversal also gives a woman a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening condition where a fertilized egg grows outside the womb. Failed surgery Sometimes, the area where a woman has had the tubal ligation reversal forms scar tissue and blocks the fallopian tubes again."
What are the chances of getting pregnant after a tubal sterilization reversal procedure?,"'The chances of ''getting pregnant'' after a tubal ligation reversal varies from woman to woman. The patient’s health and age are prominent factors, which are taken into consideration before recommending surgery. In general, a reversal of tubal ligation is successful 40% to 85% of the time. Most women with a successful reversal get pregnant within the first year.' "
What are the alternatives to a tubal sterilization reversal procedure?,"'In vitro fertilization''\xa0(''IVF'') is an alternative to tubal sterilization reversal. In this procedure, the egg and sperm are fertilized outside the womb in a laboratory dish. The fertilized egg (embryo) is later placed into the patient’s womb. IVF is also an option if a patient doesn’t get pregnant after tubal ligation reversal surgery. Surrogacy may also be considered.' "
What is tuberculosis (TB)?,"'Tuberculosis'' (''TB'') is a disease (bacterial infection) caused by a bacterium named ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' that usually infects the ''lungs'', but in some individuals, the bacteria can attack any part of the body. Before treatments were effective against TB, it was the leading cause of death in the United States.' "
Is tuberculosis (TB) contagious?,"'Yes, TB is highly ''contagious'' and can be transmitted from an infected person to an uninfected person, mainly when a person with TB ''coughs'', sneezes, speaks, or even sings (known as airborne transmission or airborne disease). Other people who breathe in the aerosolized bacteria can become infected. Some individuals have TB infections but show no symptoms because their bodies prevent TB organisms from growing. Patients with this type of infection are termed as having latent (dormant) TB. Individuals with latent TB have the organisms suppressed; in this condition, the individuals are not contagious for TB when the organisms are dormant. However, if a person with latent TB is no longer able to suppress the TB organisms, that individual can then become contagious.''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'"" organisms can survive for a while even in the deceased; to avoid getting TB, physicians who perform autopsies have to be careful not to spread the organisms into the air while they're doing their investigations."" "
How will I know if I have tuberculosis?,"'People may suspect they have tuberculosis if they have spent any length of time around ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'' individuals known to have tuberculosis. Symptoms and signs of TB include the following:''A physician can order skin tests, TB blood tests, and send sputum samples for specialized stains and culture to definitively diagnose tuberculosis in an individual.' Severe coughing lasting at least three weeks or more Night sweats Coughing up blood or sputum Chest pains Fatigue Weight loss with no appetite Fever and chills"
How do people transmit tuberculosis?,"'TB spreads when the organisms are coughed up or aerosolized by sneezing, speaking, or singing. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that TB is not spread by handshakes, sharing food, ''drinks'', or toothbrushes, touching items like toilet seats, clothing, or bedsheets, or kissing. People with other health problems like ''diabetes'', ''HIV'' infection, ''drug abuse'', ''alcohol abuse'', and/or recent exposure to individuals with TB are at increased risk for contracting TB.' "
What is the incubation period for tuberculosis?,"'The incubation period for tuberculosis is measured from exposure time to time of development of a positive tuberculin skin test. In most individuals, the incubation period varies from approximately two to 12 weeks. However, the risk for developing active disease is highest in the first two years after infection and development of a positive TB skin test.' "
How will I know if I am cured of tuberculosis? What is the contagious period for TB?,"'Treatment for tuberculosis, both active infections and latent TB infections, involves the use of several different anti-TB medications (for example, ''isoniazid'' [Nydrazid, Laniazid, INH], rifampin [''Rifadin''], ''rifapentine'' [''Priftin''], ''ethambutol'' [''Myambutol''], ''pyrazinamide''), often in combination, for up to a total of six to nine months. A physician will determine the best treatment for you on an individual basis, since some strains of the bacteria are resistant to certain ''drugs''. Some people are probably noncontagious after two weeks while on medication or during treatment but some researchers suggest that others may take longer (months) until they are not able to spread the disease. Reduction or absence of symptoms and signs suggests that a person on antibiotics is unlikely to be contagious, but this is not always true.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about tuberculosis?,"'Tuberculosis, like many diseases, is best treated early in the infection. Consequently, you should contact a physician if'""An individual should not put off seeing a physician if there's slightest chance he or she has TB because the disease can progress and eventually cause death if not treated in a timely fashion.""  you have been exposed to someone with active TB; you have had a positive TB skin test; you have developed symptoms of a severe cough with blood-tinged or bloody sputum; you have other symptoms of TB, such as fatigue, fever, or night sweats along with coughing; your condition worsens with treatment; you have symptoms of yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) while undergoing treatment; your vision changes, such as developing blurry or odd colored vision."
What is ulcerative colitis?,"'Ulcerative colitis'' is an ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD'') that affects the inner lining of the ''large intestine'' (large bowel or colon) leading to erosion and ulcers. It is a lifelong illness with no specific cause or cure. Patients have repeated cycles of flare-ups and the disappearance of the disease.\xa0Moreover, ''ulcerative colitis'' can cause disease elsewhere in the body, apart from the intestine. There is often an emotional and social impact on ''ulcerative colitis''.' "
What are the causes of ulcerative colitis?,"'The exact cause of ulcerative ''colitis'' is unknown.\xa0However, possible factors involved include:' Genetics: If you have a family history you maybe more likely to have develop the disease. Immune reactions: The body’s own antibodies attack the inner lining of the large intestine (autoimmune disorder). Lifestyle factors:A diet that contains high fats, vitamin B6, sulphur, and a high amount of meat.Alcohol and substance abuse.Psychological stress. A diet that contains high fats, vitamin B6, sulphur, and a high amount of meat. Alcohol and substance abuse. Psychological stress. Medications: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increases the risk of flares of ulcerative colitis. Consuming milk may exacerbate the disease."
What are the early signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis?,"'Initially, patients commonly note:' Rectal bleeding Frequent bowel movements Mucous discharge from the rectum Tenesmus (constant feeling of the evacuation of the bowels) Lower abdominal pain and cramps Dehydration"
What are the other signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis?,"'Severe ''diarrhea'' and abdominal cramps''Ulcerative colitis is also associated with various manifestations outside of the colon, such as inflammation of the eyes, joints, skin, and ''lungs''.' Fever Abdominal distention/ bloating Increased heart rate Severe abdominal pain Weight loss Pus discharge through the anus"
What are the types of ulcerative colitis?,"'The severity of ulcerative colitis is usually described as mild, moderate or severe.' Ulcerative proctitis: Inflammation limited to the area close to the anus (rectum). Symptoms are usually mild and rectal bleeding may be the only sign. Proctosigmoiditis: Inflammation involves the lower end of the colon. Left-sided colitis: Inflammation extends from the rectum up through the sigmoid and descending colon. Pancolitis: Pancolitis involves the entire colon. Acute severe ulcerative colitis: This rare form of colitis affects the entire colon and causes severe pain, profuse diarrhea, bleeding, fever, and the inability to eat. Mild: Bleeding per the rectum and fewer than four bowel movements per day. Moderate: Bleeding per the rectum with more than four bowel movements per day. Severe: Bleeding per the rectum with more than four bowel movements per day and systemic illness with the loss of protein."
How is ulcerative colitis diagnosed?,"'The physician' conducts a complete physical assessment, and recommends a series of specialized blood and radiological investigations (X-ray, CT scan, etc.). A colonoscopy, endoscopy, biopsy, stool examination and other tests are evaluated."
What is the treatment of ulcerative colitis?,"'Treatment could involve either medical or surgical treatment, depending on the severity. Patients would also require lifestyle changes.''Medical treatment includes:' Medication to suppress and/or modulate the immune system may be required Painkillers Anti-diarrhea medication Antibiotics for infections may be prescribed Surgical treatment includes:Surgical removal of part of the colon or whole colon (colectomy) in the most severe situations Surgical removal of part of the colon or whole colon (colectomy) in the most severe situations Dietary changes:A diet with low fat, meat, vitamin B6, sulfur, and milk A diet with low fat, meat, vitamin B6, sulfur, and milk Managing psychological stress and getting emotional support"
Is uterus cancer fatal?,"'Uterine cancer'' is not fatal when it is diagnosed and treated in the early stages. Generally, a 5-year survival rate for patients in stage 1 of uterine ''cancer'' is 90%. However, the 5-year survival rate can vary depending on the extent to which the ''cancer'' has spread. The 5-year survival rate of ''cancer'' confined to the uterus (localized uterine cancer) is 95% whereas for cancer that has spread to nearby organs (regional uterine cancer) and distant organs or tissues (distant uterine cancer) is 69% and 17%, respectively. This has been represented in the table below.''*SEER: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program' "
What is uterine cancer?,"'Uterine cancer is the most common cancer affecting the reproductive system of women. It starts when healthy cells in the uterus grow out of control, forming a mass of tissue or ''tumor''. A tumor can be cancerous or benign/noncancerous.''Benign conditions of the uterus include''Cancer of the uterus'' includes' Benign polyps: Abnormal growths in the lining of the uterus. Fibroids: Noncancerous tumors in the muscles of the uterus. Endometriosis: A condition in which the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. Endometrial hyperplasia: A condition in which there is an overgrowth of the healthy cells of the lining of the uterus (endometrium). Adenocarcinoma: This is the most common type of uterine cancer and accounts for 80% of all uterine cancers. It is commonly known as endometrial cancer because it develops from the cells in the endometrium. Sarcoma: This type of uterine cancer mainly affects the uterine muscles (myometrium). Sarcoma accounts for about 2% to 4% of cancers. Different types of sarcoma includeLeiomyosarcomaEndometrial stromal sarcomaUndifferentiated sarcoma Leiomyosarcoma Endometrial stromal sarcoma Undifferentiated sarcoma"
Who is at risk for getting uterine cancer?,"'The following factors may increase the risk of uterine cancer' Age over 50 years Obesity: Overweight women produce extra estrogen, a hormone that increases the risk of uterine cancer. White women are more likely to develop uterine cancer; however, black women are more likely to develop advanced uterine cancer. Genetics: Uterine cancer runs in the family. Diabetes Breast cancer Colon cancer Ovarian cancer Drugs like Tamoxifen Radiation therapy Fatty foods Estrogen imbalance"

Complications of surgery include pain and tenderness. Radiation therapy: Radiation of high frequency destroys the cancerous cells. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses medications to kill cancerous cells. Hormonal therapy Immunotherapy Targeted therapy"
What is whooping cough (pertussis)?,'Whooping cough'' (also termed ''pertussis'') is a respiratory disease that is caused by the bacterium Bordetella ''pertussis''. It results in characteristic fits of ''coughing'' (the characteristic ''noise''\xa0on ''inhalation'' produces a whooping sound) and mild to moderate difficulty with ''breathing'' (most noticeable during coughing fits). These symptoms are caused by the release of toxins produced by ''Bordetella pertussis'' bacteria that damage the lining of throat cells and cause inflammation and swelling of the throat.'  
Is whooping cough contagious?,"'Whooping cough'' is considered highly ''contagious'' and is only found in humans. Coughing or ''sneezing'' spreads whooping ''cough'' from person to person. The bacteria can live in droplets that become airborne during coughing or sneezing; anyone in close contact with an individual who has whooping cough is likely to be exposed to the disease. Even individuals who have had pertussis vaccine in the past can become infected because the vaccine, and even having the disease, does not confer lifelong protection against whooping cough. Likewise, even individuals who previously had whooping cough are not immune to future episodes of infection. Consequently, pertussis vaccine booster shots are highly recommended and are usually incorporated with other vaccines like ''diphtheria'' and ''tetanus'', which have a similar limited time (about five to 10 years) of protection.' "
How will I know if someone has whooping cough? What are the various stages of pertussis?,"'Early in the disease patients may have ''cold''-like symptoms (mild cough and/or ''fever''), but after about a week or so, severe coughing can begin. The cold-like symptoms comprise stage one of whooping cough and last about one to two weeks; stage one is termed the catarrhal stage. Stage two, termed the paroxysmal stage, can last from about one to six weeks and consists of fits of rapid coughing (coughing fits) and the characteristic whooping sounds. Stage three, termed the convalescent stage, lasts about two to three weeks with gradual reduction of the coughing fits. The length of time coughing fits last is variable; for example, some individuals will still experience some coughing for as long as about three and a half months. The coughing fits can cause intermittent ''shortness of breath'', ''vomiting'', and ''fatigue''. Unfortunately, usually a person is not diagnosed with whooping cough until stage two, but the person can be contagious during stage one. Individuals with whooping cough are highly contagious during the first two weeks of stage two, but they still can be contagious for about three weeks. Some experts suggest antibiotic therapy reduces contagiousness in individuals with the disease.''Not every person who gets pertussis develops the characteristic coughing fits; if a person, especially an infant or young child, develops a persistent relatively severe cough for a week or more, a physician should be consulted to perform blood tests and cultures for ''Bordetella pertussis'' bacteria.' "
How is whooping cough transmitted? What is the incubation period for pertussis? What is the contagious period for pertussis?,"'Coughing, sneezing, or direct personal contact with an infected individual easily spreads whooping cough from person to person. It is not spread to pets (''dogs'' and cats, for example), but it can be spread to other adults and even to vaccinated individuals whose vaccine immunity has waned. It can be spread before the characteristic coughing fits begin. The incubation period is variable, and symptoms develop usually five to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria; occasionally, the incubation period can be up to three weeks. It is possible to be contagious during the incubation period, but the highly contagious time for spread to others is in the beginning weeks of stage two (coughing fits, whooping sounds produced).' "
When will I know someone is cured of whooping cough?,"'After about three weeks of symptoms, the body usually develops an immune response that effectively limits and/or kills the bacteria. However, symptoms can still be present for some period of time (weeks to months) because of the damage done by the infection. Early treatment with antibiotics is thought to reduce the time of contagiousness and importantly, may reduce the severity of symptoms. However, antibiotics may not help reduce any symptoms if started later (a few weeks) in the disease process. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) states that giving ''cough medicine'"" for pertussis usually will not help and is not recommended for children under 4 years of age; parents and/or caregivers should check with their child's pediatrician if they aren't sure what to do."" "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about whooping cough?,"""Call your child's physician or your physician or consider going to an emergency department if coughing spells cause the following:""  Pauses in breathing Struggling to breathe Face turning blue or red during coughing fits Vomiting during and/or after coughing fits Inhalation that produces a whooping sound"
Can whooping cough be prevented?,"""Perhaps the best way to avoid pertussis is to contact your child's pediatrician to make sure that your child is up to date with their childhood vaccinations since these include vaccinations for pertussis. For adults, the same thing is true; they should get routine booster shots for pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus every 10 years or when their physician recommends it."" "
What is angina? What does it feel like?,"   Angina (angina pectoris) describes the pain, discomfort, ache, or other associated symptoms that occur when blood flow to heart muscle cells is not enough to meet its energy needs. The classic description of angina is a crushing pain, heaviness or pressure that radiates across the chest, sometimes down the arm, into the neck, jaw or teeth, or into the back. It may be associated with shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and weakness. Many people do not use pain as a description for angina, instead describing the sensation as a fullness, tightness, burning, squeezing, or ache. The discomfort may be felt in the upper abdomen, between the shoulders, or in the back. The pain may be felt just in an arm, right, left or both, and may or may not be associated with other symptoms. Angina is often brought on by exercise and other strenuous activities and gets better with rest. When the body requires the heart to pump more blood, the heart muscle is asked to do more work and that can cause it to outstrip its energy supply. When the body rests, angina should start to subside. Angina tends to progress slowly over time and patients may not recognize that their symptoms are due to heart disease. It may be fatigue and exercise intolerance, the gradually inability to perform work or other activities that had once been easier to do. It may be shortness of breath with activity like walking up steps or uphill. It is worrisome when the pain comes on at rest or at sleep, since it means that little activity is causing enough stress to cause angina symptoms. This is the same situation that occurs when muscles in the leg or arm fatigue because of overuse and they begin to ache. The difference is that one can stop lifting or running but the heart cannot stop beating to rest. The other difference is that the symptoms of angina are felt in different ways by different patients and may not be recognized as coming from the heart. Unfortunately for some patients, they may have no symptoms at all, even with significant narrowing of their coronary arteries, and they may first present for care in the midst of a myocardial infarction or heart attack, when a coronary artery is completely blocked. This is especially true for women who may have atypical angina symptoms including fatigue, malaise, weakness, and dizziness. Angina is a warning sign that the heart muscle is not getting adequate blood supply and oxygen. If unheeded it may lead to a heart attack or myocardial infarction (myo=muscle + cardium=heart + infarct=death). The term mesenteric angina may also be used to describe abdominal pain due to decreased blood supply to the intestine from narrowing of the mesenteric arteries that supply the small and large bowel. Unfortunately, there are a couple of eponyms that contain the term angina, that have nothing to do with pain from decreased blood flow. Ludwig's angina is a serious infection of the floor of the mouth. Vincent's angina is another term for trench mouth, where painful ulcerations affect the gums, mouth, and tongue."
What are the signs and symptoms of angina? Does it cause pain?,"'Classic angina is described as chest pressure that radiates down the arm, into the neck or jaw and is associated with shortness of breath and ''sweating''. However, patients may use different words to describe the pain, including pain, heaviness, tightness, ache, and fullness. The location may or may not be in the chest; instead it may be described in the upper abdomen, back, arms, shoulder, or neck.''Typical angina symptoms should be made worse with activity and should resolve or get better with rest.''Angina may not have any pain and instead may present as shortness of breath with exercise, malaise, fatigue, or weakness. Patients with ''diabetes'' have an altered sensation of pain and may have markedly atypical symptoms. Women may not have the same angina constellation of symptoms as men.'

What causes angina?,"'The heart gets its blood supply from coronary arteries that branch off the ''aorta'' just as it leaves the heart. The coronary arteries run along the surface of the heart, branching into smaller and smaller blood vessels as they supple each muscle cell of the heart. The most common reason a patient complains of angina is because of narrowed coronary arteries caused by ''atherosclerotic'' ''heart disease'' (ASHD).''Cholesterol'' plaque gradually builds on the inner lining of a coronary artery, narrowing its diameter and decreasing the amount of blood that can flow past the blockage. If the heart is asked to do more work and pump harder and faster, enough oxygen may not be able to be delivered beyond the blockage to meet the energy demand of the ''myocardium'' and this can cause the symptoms of angina to occur.''If a plaque ruptures, a ''blood clot'' may form that completely occludes the coronary artery and prevents any blood flow to the section of the heart muscle that the artery supplies. This is called a heart attack or myocardial infarction and is a medical emergency. Heart muscle that loses its blood supply will die and be replaced with ''scar tissue'"" that is unable to contract. This may decrease the heart's ability to pump as strongly as before. As well, heart muscle that loses its blood supply can become irritable and result in heart rhythm disturbances like ventricular ""'fibrillation'' or ventricular ''flutter'' that can result in ''sudden cardiac death''.''Because each beat of the heart not only sends blood to the body, but also to itself, there are a variety of systems in the body and within the heart that have to function normally to deliver oxygen to the heart muscle. Should any of them, either individually or in combination, fail to perform adequately, angina may occur. Examples include the following:''If any of these steps fail, the heart muscle may not get enough oxygen and the patient may feel pain or discomfort called angina.'   The electrical system of the heart needs to be able to generate a heartbeat that is neither too slow (bradycardia) nor too fast (tachycardia). There may be an intrinsic problem with the heart's electrical conducting system. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia are too fast rates that can be associated with chest pain, shortness of breath, and other angina symptoms. Complete heart block can make the heart beat too slowly. The abnormal heart rhythm may be due to electrolyte or hormone abnormalities, medications, or toxic ingestions (for example cocaine overdose). Heart valves need to allow blood to flow between heart chambers and to the body and lungs in the right direction and at the right speed. This is especially true of the aortic valve that controls blood leaving the heart into the aorta. Severe aortic stenosis or narrowing of the aortic valve, may not allow enough blood to leave the heart with each heartbeat to provide blood flow into the coronary arteries. The heart muscle has to be able to have an adequate squeeze or strength to pump blood. The lack of this ability may be due to cardiomyopathy (damaged heart muscle). There needs to be enough red blood cells in the bloodstream to carry oxygen. Patients who have anemia can develop shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain with activity. The lungs need to work so that they deliver enough oxygen to the body. Patients with COPD or emphysema may not be able to extract enough oxygen from the air to supply the body's needs. Most often these patients have shortness of breath but they may also develop angina. Certain poisonings including carbon monoxide can prevent oxygen from attaching to red blood cells and cause shortness of breath and chest pain."
What are the types of angina?,"'Angina due to a decrease or lack of coronary artery blood flow''Angina is most often caused by narrowing of the coronary arteries because of atherosclerotic ''heart disease''. There may be one or more arteries that are blocked and the amount of pain or other symptom severity is not necessarily related to the number of blood vessels blocked. Usually, there has to be at least a 50% narrowing of a coronary artery to cause symptoms.''Prinzmetal angina describes pain that is caused when a coronary artery goes into spasm temporarily decreasing blood supply to a section of heart muscle.''Microvascular angina describes narrowing of small arteries to cause areas of the heart to have decreased blood flow. The large coronary arteries may be normal.''Syndrome X'' cardiac disease describes decreased blood flow to the heart muscle with normal coronary arteries not caused by the vasospasm that is seen in Prinzmetal angina. This may be a variant of microvascular angina.''Rare causes may also include abnormalities that occur with the coronary arteries that are not due to ASHD including scarring that can occur from chest ''radiation'', inflammation of the arteries because of underlying illness like ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''scleroderma'"", and Kawasaki's disease, as well as congenital abnormalities affecting coronary artery anatomy.""'Other causes of angina''Some causes for angina are multifactorial. For example, a patient with atherosclerotic heart disease may become acutely ill or injured, where a ''fever'' or anemia may compound the inability of narrowed blood vessels to deliver oxygen to heart muscle cells. Or a patient who abuses cocaine can increase heart rate plus cause coronary arteries to constrict, leading to angina.'   Poorly controlled high blood pressure (hypertension) can place significant strain on the heart muscle as it continues to pump blood, causing pain. Aortic stenosis describes the narrowed valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle, the chamber of the heart that pumps blood to the body, into the aorta. If the valve narrows enough, decreased blood flow into the coronary arteries may be the cause of angina. Cardiomyopathy describes a variety of conditions where the heart muscle is unable to adequately pump blood to meet the body and the heart's oxygen needs. Ischemic cardiomyopathy, heart muscle that has been damaged by atherosclerotic heart disease, is the most common type of cardiomyopathy. Situations exist that can cause the body not to be able to meet the heart's demand for oxygen. These include anemia and poisonings. Other circumstances may occur where the heart's oxygen demand is increased and angina occurs. Oxygen demand increases when the heart is asked to pump harder and faster. Examples include tachycardias like atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter that are out of control, fevers, hyperthyroidism, and the stress of major illness, infection, and trauma."
How is angina diagnosed?,"""The preliminary diagnosis of angina usually is made by the patient's history. The health care professional needs to understand what symptoms the patient is experiencing and may ask similar questions in a variety of ways to gain that understanding. This may be a frustrating process for both patient and professional because the symptoms of angina can range from classic to vague.""'Part of the history will be to assess risk factors for heart disease. These include ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', ''diabetes'', family history, and ''smoking''. Histories of ''stroke'' (''cerebrovascular accident'' or CVA) or ''peripheral artery disease'' (PAD) are both risk factors since the mechanism of these diseases, ''hardening of the arteries'' or ''atherosclerosis'' are the same as for heart disease.''There are other diseases that can cause chest pain, ''abdominal pain'', shortness of breath, sweating, and ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Questions may be asked to determine whether other possibilities other than angina exist. ''Pulmonary embolism'', ''pneumonia'', ''aortic aneurysm'', ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''), ''peptic ulcer'' disease, and ''gallbladder disease'' are bit a few of the potential causes of symptoms other than angina.''Physical examination will help narrow the potential list of diseases but in of itself, will not make the formal diagnosis.''This is the time that the health care professional has to make a clinical decision as to the source of symptoms. If the tentative or provisional diagnosis is angina, a further decision has to be made whether it is stable or unstable.''With ''stable angina'', a defined exercise will bring on the symptoms and rest will make it better. For example, a patient gets chest discomfort after walking 2 miles and it gets better with 5 minutes of rest. The pain pattern is constant and the amount of exercise required to bring on the symptoms has not been getting shorter. Often a patient with known angina will take a ''nitroglycerin'' pill to resolve the pain and it does so promptly.''Unstable angina'' usually happens at rest, wakens the patient at night, or comes on with minimal activity. These are times when the heart muscle is not being asked to work harder and yet angina symptoms may be present. Unstable angina is a potential warning sign of impending heart attack. There may be a transition from stable to unstable and the patient may describe decreasing amounts of exertion needed to bring on the angina symptoms.''Over time, a patient with angina may have their symptoms brought on by less and less activity. This progression needs to be monitored closely by both patient and doctor. The frequency of nitroglycerin use may be a clue that a coronary artery might be getting critically narrow increasing the risk of heart attack.''If angina is the major consideration, then an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') is usually performed. The electrical signal tracing of the heart can be interpreted to decide if heart muscle is damaged. The initial EKGs most important function is to decide if the patient is in the midst of suffering a heart attack or myocardial infarction (MI). This is a medical emergency.''If the EKG does not show a new heart attack and if the patient has stable symptoms, the next step depends upon the situation. Blood tests may be done to check cardiac enzymes. These are chemicals (troponin, CPK, myoglobin) contained in heart muscle cells that may leak into the bloodstream if the cell is injured. If the chemicals are not detected, then the presumption is that if the pain is due to ASHD, critical narrowing has not caused heart muscle damage. However, the tests need to be done and interpreted based upon the clinical situation.''With a stable EKG, resolved symptoms, and concern still present that the patient has angina, tests to image the heart may be considered. These may include one or more of the following: stress tests, nuclear imaging, ''echocardiogram'', cardiac ''CT scan'', and heart catheterization. The decision as to what test is most appropriate depends upon the patient, their symptoms, underlying health, risk factors, and the level of concern of the health care professional.'

What is the treatment for angina?,"'Treatment for angina depends upon the cause and may include behavior modification, exercise, medication, and surgery.''Should the cause be ASHD, medications may be used to help minimize progression of artery narrowing and plaque buildup. Medications can be also be used to decrease the oxygen requirements of the heart and to allow the heart muscle to function more efficiently.''Aspirin'' may be recommended to make platelets less sticky to prevent clot formation and prevent heart attack.''Long-acting nitroglycerin medications (Imdur, Nitropaste) may be prescribed to dilate coronary arteries and increase blood flow to the heart muscle. As well, nitroglycerin may be used to abort an episode of angina. In this case it may be taken as a tablet or spray under the tongue.''The best treatment for angina is ''prevention'', especially if the cause is ASHD. Lifelong control of ''blood pressure'', cholesterol, and ''diabetes'' will help prevent the development of plaque buildup within arteries not only in the heart but also the brain and peripheral arteries as well. ''Smoking cessation'' is mandatory.'  "
Angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery,"'When patients continue to have angina despite maximally tolerated combinations of nitroglycerin medications, ''beta blockers'', and ''calcium channel blockers'', ''cardiac catheterization'' with coronary arteriography is indicated. Depending on the location and severity of the disease in the coronary arteries, patients can be referred for ''balloon angioplasty'' (''percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty'' or PTCA with or without ''stents'') or ''coronary artery bypass graft'' surgery (''CABG'') to increase coronary artery blood flow.' "
What are other methods are used to evaluate angina?,"'CT scan calcium scoring is highly accurate in detecting small amounts of calcium in the plaque of coronary arteries. Ultrafast CT scanning is useful in evaluating chest pain in younger patients (men under 40 and women under 50 years old). Since young people do not normally have significant coronary artery plaque, a negative calcium score makes the diagnosis of ''coronary artery disease'' unlikely. However, finding calcium by this method is less meaningful in older patients who are likely to have mild plaquing simply from the ''aging'' process.''Even though a calcium score is useful in detecting calcium in plaque, it cannot determine whether the calcium-laden plaque actually causes artery narrowing and reduces blood flow. For example, a patient with a densely calcified plaque causing minimal or no artery narrowing will have a strongly positive CT scan, but a normal ''exercise stress test''. In most patients who are suspected of having angina due to ''coronary artery disease'', an exercise stress study is usually the first step in determining whether any plaque is clinically significant. High speed CT scanners can actually detect true coronary artery plaques and lesions similar to ''coronary angiography''.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'""), using magnetism and radio waves, can be used to image (produce a likeness of) the blood vessels. Larger vessels, such as the carotid arteries in the neck, can be imaged using this technique. Future software and hardware improvements may allow screening of the heart's arteries with magnetic resonance testing."" "
Can you die from angina?,"'Prevention offers the best prognosis, but that said, should angina be due to atherosclerotic heart disease, ''heart function'' and symptoms may be controlled with lifelong attention to ''diet'', exercise, and appropriately taking medications that may be prescribed.''The purpose in preventing progression of ASHD is to decrease the risk of heart attack. Should one of the coronary arteries become completely blocked, that section of heart muscle may die and be replaced with ''scar'' tissue. This leads to a weakened heart that will affect quality of life. Chronically decreased blood flow to heart muscle may not cause a single heart attack but may affect heart function and lead to ischemic cardiomyopathy and again affect lifestyle.''Patients with angina who have had a heart attack and continue to smoke have up to a 50% risk of another heart attack and death.''Patient with Prinzmetal angina and syndrome X have an excellent prognosis with little risk of long term heart damage.' "
Can angina be prevented?,"'The risk for atherosclerotic heart disease can be minimized by preventive medicine. Exercise, a healthy ''diet'', and avoiding ''smoking'' will decrease the likely of developing atherosclerotic heart disease, ''stroke'', and peripheral artery disease.''A patient should never smoke but heart attack risk begins to decrease shortly after he or she quits ''smoking''.''Lifelong screening and controlling ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), ''high cholesterol'', and diabetes will minimize the risk of developing heart disease but that risk does not become zero.''Understanding that angina and heart disease may not present with symptoms of chest pain may help a patient seek care from a health care professional. This may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.'  "
Islet Cell Transplantation Introduction,"'In islet cell transplantation, ''insulin'""-producing beta cells are taken from a donor's pancreas and transferred into a person with ""'diabetes''. Once transplanted, the donor islets begin to make and release insulin, actively regulating the level of ''sugar'' in the blood.' "
What Are the Benefits of Islet Cell Transplantation?,"'A successful islet cell transplant can significantly improve the quality of life for a person with ''diabetes''.''Once transplanted, the islet cells automatically monitor ''sugar'"" in the body and can regulate insulin levels by delivering the appropriate amounts needed to normalize blood sugar levels, even as the body's needs change (for example, after exercising or eating).""'Successful islet cell transplantation can provide the following benefits:' It can eliminate the need for frequent blood sugar measurements and the need for daily insulin injections. Although only a few people are completely free of insulin injections a year after transplantation. It can provide more flexibility with meal planning. It can help protect against the serious long-term complications of diabetes, including heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and nerve and eye damage."
What Are the Risks of Islet Cell Transplantation?,"'As with any organ or tissue transplant, rejection of the donor cells is the greatest challenge in those with diabetes. The immune system serves to protect the body from ""invading"" substances that do not belong -- bacteria and ''viruses'', for example. Even when needed donor tissue is transplanted, the recipient\'s immune system recognizes it as ""foreign"" and tries to destroy it. This attack on the donor tissue is called ""rejection.""''All transplant recipients must take, for the rest of their life, strong ''drugs'' to suppress the immune response and prevent rejection. Many of these drugs have serious side effects. The long-term effects of these immunosuppressive or anti-rejection drugs are not yet known, but it is suspected that they may increase the risk of ''cancer''.' "
How Successful Is Islet Cell Transplantation?,"""Scientists developed the procedure for transplanting islet cells to treat diabetes in the 1960's. The first transplantation attempts, which began in the 1990's, succeeded only 8% of the time, which was attributed to the fact that anti-rejection drugs available at the time interfered with insulin's effectiveness.""'But in 1999, a clinical trial conducted at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, brought new hope. Using enhanced techniques to collect and prepare the extremely fragile donor islet cells, as well as using improved anti-rejection drugs, the researchers achieved a 100% success rate. All of the patients in their trial were freed from the need for insulin for at least one month. The process followed by the researchers -- dubbed the ""Edmonton Protocol"" -- is still being studied in ''clinical trials'' around the world.' "
Can Anyone With Diabetes Get an Islet Cell Transplant?,"'Typically, candidates for islet cell transplantation are between the ages of 18 and 65, have had ''type 1 diabetes'' for more than 5 years, and are experiencing diabetes-related complications such as frequent periods of unconsciousness due to lack of insulin and early signs of kidney problems that could lead to ''kidney failure''.' "
Can Islet Cell Transplantation Be Done at any Hospital?,"'Because it is still considered an experimental therapy, islet cell transplantation for diabetes is not widely available. There are currently 17 U.S. centers participating in islet cell research programs. The American Diabetes Association recommends that pancreas or islet cell transplantation be performed only in these major centers, which are best equipped to handle the complex and long-term medical and personal needs of transplant patients.' "
What Is the Future for Islet Cell Transplantation Research?,"'There are two main areas of focus in islet cell transplantation research:''Researchers are also working to develop methods of transplanting islet cells that will reduce or eliminate the risk of rejection and the need for immunosuppression. One approach involves coating the islet cells with a special gel that prevents the immune system from recognizing and targeting the donor cells.''WebMD Medical Reference' Collecting enough islet cells to do the transplant: Obtaining enough islet cells for transplantation is a major challenge. Typically, about 1 million islet cells are needed, which is equivalent to two donor pancreases. Because the need surpasses the number of human donors available, researchers are studying the use of cells from other sources, including fetal tissue and animals such as pigs. Researchers are also attempting to grow human islet cells in the laboratory. Preventing rejection: Researchers continuously seek to develop new and better anti-rejection drugs. Many advances have been made in anti-rejection drugs over the past 15 years. Newer drugs -- such as tacrolimus (FK506) and rapamycin -- have fewer and less harmful side effects than some older drugs like cyclosporine and prednisone."
What are pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)?,"'Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors form in hormone-making cells (islet cells) of the pancreas. The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine.''There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas:''Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may be benign (not ''cancer'') or ''malignant'' (''cancer''). When pancreatic NETs are ''malignant'', they are called pancreatic endocrine ''cancer'' or islet cell ''carcinoma''.''Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better prognosis.''Pancreatic NETs may or may not cause signs or symptoms.''Pancreatic NETs may be functional or nonfunctional:''Most pancreatic NETs are functional tumors.'  Endocrine pancreas cells make several kinds of hormones (chemicals that control the actions of certain cells or organs in the body), such as insulin to control blood sugar. They cluster together in many small groups (islets) throughout the pancreas. Endocrine pancreas cells are also called islet cells or islets of Langerhans. Tumors that form in islet cells are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs). Exocrine pancreas cells make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food. Most of the pancreas is made of ducts with small sacs at the end of the ducts, which are lined with exocrine cells. Functional tumors make extra amounts of hormones, such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon, that cause signs and symptoms. Nonfunctional tumors do not make extra amounts of hormones. Signs and symptoms are caused by the tumor as it spreads and grows. Most nonfunctional tumors are malignant (cancer)."
What are the different types of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs. Pancreatic NETs make different kinds of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon. Functional pancreatic NETs include the following:''These other types of tumors are grouped together because they are treated in much the same way.' Gastrinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make gastrin. Gastrin is a hormone that causes the stomach to release an acid that helps digest food. Both gastrin and stomach acid are increased by gastrinomas. When increased stomach acid, stomach ulcers, and diarrhea are caused by a tumor that makes gastrin, it is called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A gastrinoma usually forms in the head of the pancreas and sometimes forms in the small intestine. Most gastrinomas are malignant (cancer). Insulinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. It moves glucose into the cells, where it can be used by the body for energy. Insulinomas are usually slow-growing tumors that rarely spread. An insulinoma forms in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas. Insulinomas are usually benign (not cancer). Glucagonoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that increases the amount of glucose in the blood. It causes the liver to break down glycogen. Too much glucagon causes hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). A glucagonoma usually forms in the tail of the pancreas. Most glucagonomas are malignant (cancer). Other types of tumors: There are other rare types of functional pancreatic NETs that make hormones, including hormones that control the balance of sugar, salt, and water in the body. These tumors include:VIPomas, which make vasoactive intestinal peptide. VIPoma may also be called Verner-Morrison syndrome.Somatostatinomas, which make somatostatin. VIPomas, which make vasoactive intestinal peptide. VIPoma may also be called Verner-Morrison syndrome. Somatostatinomas, which make somatostatin."
What are risk factors for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"""Having certain syndromes can increase the risk of pancreatic NETs. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.""'Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is a risk factor for pancreatic NETs.' "
What are signs and symptoms of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'Different types of pancreatic NETs have different signs and symptoms. Signs or symptoms can be caused by the growth of the tumor and/or by hormones the tumor makes or by other conditions. Some tumors may not cause signs or symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.''A non-functional pancreatic NET may grow for a long time without causing signs or symptoms. It may grow large or spread to other parts of the body before it causes signs or symptoms, such as:''The signs and symptoms of a functional pancreatic NET depend on the type of hormone being made.''Too much gastrin may cause:''Too much insulin may cause:''Too much glucagon may cause:''Too much vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may cause:''Too much somatostatin may cause:'  Diarrhea. Indigestion. A lump in the abdomen. Pain in the abdomen or back. Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. Stomach ulcers that keep coming back. Pain in the abdomen, which may spread to the back. The pain may come and go and it may go away after taking an antacid. The flow of stomach contents back into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). Diarrhea. Low blood sugar. This can cause blurred vision, headache, and feeling lightheaded, tired, weak, shaky, nervous, irritable, sweaty, confused, or hungry. Fast heartbeat. Skin rash on the face, stomach, or legs. High blood sugar. This can cause headaches, frequent urination, dry skin and mouth, or feeling hungry, thirsty, tired, or weak. Blood clots. Blood clots in the lung can cause shortness of breath, cough, or pain in the chest. Blood clots in the arm or leg can cause pain, swelling, warmth, or redness of the arm or leg. Diarrhea. Weight loss for no known reason. Sore tongue or sores at the corners of the mouth. Very large amounts of watery diarrhea. Dehydration. This can cause feeling thirsty, making less urine, dry skin and mouth, headaches, dizziness, or feeling tired. Low potassium level in the blood. This can cause muscle weakness, aching, or cramps, numbness and tingling, frequent urination, fast heartbeat, and feeling confused or thirsty. Cramps or pain in the abdomen. Weight loss for no known reason. High blood sugar. This can cause headaches, frequent urination, dry skin and mouth, or feeling hungry, thirsty, tired, or weak. Diarrhea. Steatorrhea (very foul-smelling stool that floats). Gallstones. Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. Weight loss for no known reason."
What tests do doctors use to diagnose pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'Lab tests and imaging tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose pancreatic NETs. The following tests and procedures may be used:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as glucose (sugar), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Chromogranin A test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of chromogranin A in the blood. A higher than normal amount of chromogranin A and normal amounts of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon can be a sign of a non-functional pancreatic NET. Abdominal CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy: A type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic NETs. A small amount of radioactive octreotide (a hormone that attaches to tumors) is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body. This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or rectum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): A procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A catheter (a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts. A dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken. If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open. Tissue samples may also be taken and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Angiogram: A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood. A contrast dye is injected into the blood vessel. As the contrast dye moves through the blood vessel, x-rays are taken to see if there are any blockages. Laparotomy: A surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Intraoperative ultrasound: A procedure that uses high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) to create images of internal organs or tissues during surgery. A transducer placed directly on the organ or tissue is used to make the sound waves, which create echoes. The transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer, which uses the echoes to make pictures called sonograms. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. There are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic NETs. Cells may be removed using a fine or wide needle inserted into the pancreas during an x-ray or ultrasound. Tissue may also be removed during a laparoscopy (a surgical incision made in the wall of the abdomen). Bone scan: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in bones where cancer cells have spread and is detected by a scanner."
What tests assess the specific type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor?,"'Other kinds of lab tests are used to check for the specific type of pancreatic NETs. The following tests and procedures may be used:' Fasting serum gastrin test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of gastrin in the blood. This test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours. Conditions other than gastrinoma can cause an increase in the amount of gastrin in the blood. Basal acid output test: A test to measure the amount of acid made by the stomach. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours. A tube is inserted through the nose or throat, into the stomach. The stomach contents are removed and four samples of gastric acid are removed through the tube. These samples are used to find out the amount of gastric acid made during the test and the pH level of the gastric secretions. Secretin stimulation test: If the basal acid output test result is not normal, a secretin stimulation test may be done. The tube is moved into the small intestine and samples are taken from the small intestine after a drug called secretin is injected. Secretin causes the small intestine to make acid. When there is a gastrinoma, the secretin causes an increase in how much gastric acid is made and the level of gastrin in the blood. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy: A type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic NETs. A small amount of radioactive octreotide (a hormone that attaches to tumors) is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body. This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS. Fasting serum glucose and insulin test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of glucose (sugar) and insulin in the blood. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 24 hours. Fasting serum glucagon test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of glucagon in the blood. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours. VIPomaSerum VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of VIP.Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. In VIPoma, there is a lower than normal amount of potassium.Stool analysis: A stool sample is checked for a higher than normal sodium (salt) and potassium levels. Serum VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of VIP. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. In VIPoma, there is a lower than normal amount of potassium. Stool analysis: A stool sample is checked for a higher than normal sodium (salt) and potassium levels. SomatostatinomaFasting serum somatostatin test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of somatostatin in the blood. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours.Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy: A type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic NETs.

What factors affect the treatment options and prognosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,'Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Pancreatic NETs can often be cured. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:'  The type of cancer cell. Where the tumor is found in the pancreas. Whether the tumor has spread to more than one place in the pancreas or to other parts of the body. Whether the patient has MEN1 syndrome. The patient's age and general health. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).
How do doctors determine the staging of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor?,"'The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the NET is found in the pancreas and whether it has spread. The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging. The results of the tests and procedures used to diagnose pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are also used to find out whether the cancer has spread. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures.''Although there is a standard staging system for pancreatic NETs, it is not used to plan treatment. Treatment of pancreatic NETs is based on the following:' Whether the cancer is found in one place in the pancreas. Whether the cancer is found in several places in the pancreas. Whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas or to other parts of the body such as the liver, lung, peritoneum, or bone."
How does cancer spread in the body?,"'There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
What is metastasis?,"'Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the ''primary tumor''. For example, if a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually neuroendocrine tumor cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, not ''liver cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
What are recurrent pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,'Recurrent pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are tumors that have recurred (come back) after being treated. The tumors may come back in the pancreas or in other parts of the body.' 
What are the treatment options for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic NETs. Different types of treatments are available for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When ''clinical trials'' show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Six types of standard treatment are used:''An operation may be done to remove the tumor. One of the following types of surgery may be used:''Chemotherapy'' is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When ''chemotherapy'' is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the ''drugs'' enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.''Hormone therapy'' is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or ''radiation therapy'' is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.''Hepatic arterial occlusion uses drugs, small particles, or other agents to block or reduce the flow of blood to the liver through the hepatic artery (the major blood vessel that carries blood to the liver). This is done to kill cancer cells growing in the liver. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.''Chemotherapy delivered during hepatic arterial occlusion is called chemoembolization. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with the substance that blocks the artery and ''cuts'' off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body.''The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery.''Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Certain types of targeted therapies are being studied in the treatment of pancreatic NETs.''Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care for pancreatic NETs may include treatment for the following:' Enucleation: Surgery to remove the tumor only. This may be done when cancer occurs in one place in the pancreas. Pancreatoduodenectomy: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, nearby lymph nodes and part of the stomach, small intestine, and bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin. The organs removed during this procedure depend on the patient's condition. This is also called the Whipple procedure. Distal pancreatectomy: Surgery to remove the body and tail of the pancreas. The spleen may also be removed. Total gastrectomy: Surgery to remove the whole stomach. Parietal cell vagotomy: Surgery to cut the nerve that causes stomach cells to make acid. Liver resection: Surgery to remove part or all of the liver. Radiofrequency ablation: The use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed. In other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. This is done in the hospital with general anesthesia. Cryosurgical ablation: A procedure in which tissue is frozen to destroy abnormal cells. This is usually done with a special instrument that contains liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide. The instrument may be used during surgery or laparoscopy or inserted through the skin. This procedure is also called cryoablation. Stomach ulcers may be treated with drug therapy such as:Proton pump inhibitor drugs such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole.Histamine blocking drugs such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine.Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. Proton pump inhibitor drugs such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole. Histamine blocking drugs such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine. Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. Diarrhea may be treated with:Intravenous (IV) fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride.Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. Intravenous (IV) fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride. Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. Low blood sugar may be treated by having small, frequent meals or with drug therapy to maintain a normal blood sugar level. High blood sugar may be treated with drugs taken by mouth or insulin by injection."
Are there clinical trials for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the ''NCI website''.''Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "

What is iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"'Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS or ''IT band'' syndrome) is an overuse injury of the connective tissues that are located on the lateral or outer part of thigh and knee. It causes ''pain'' and tenderness in those areas, especially just above the ''knee joint''. Iliotibial band syndrome is the most common cause of lateral ''knee pain'' in runners and bicyclists.''The iliotibial band is a thick band of fascia (tissue) that begins at the iliac crest in the pelvis, runs down the lateral or outside part of the thigh, and crosses the knee to attach into the top part of the tibia or shinbone. It forms from the tensor fascia lata and two of the gluteal muscles (gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) in the buttock and then stretches across the knee. The iliotibial (IT) band helps stabilize the outside part of the knee through its range of motion.''The iliotibial band is one of the hip abductor muscles, moving the hip away from the midline. The iliotibial band also helps with both knee flexion and extension.''When the knee is flexed, the IT band is located behind the femoral epicondyle, a bony outcropping of the femur or thighbone at the ''knee joint''. The IT band moves forward across the condyle when the knee is extended. There is a sac or bursa that allows the band to glide smoothly across the condyle, but should inflammation occur in this area, the increased friction from repeatedly rubbing the iliotibial band across the bony condyle can cause ''pain'', especially along the outer (lateral) aspect of the knee joint.''If the symptoms are ignored, the inflammation can continue and scarring develop in the bursa, decreasing knee range of motion and causing increasing ''pain'' with decreasing activity.' "
What causes iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"'Iliotibial band inflammation is an overuse syndrome that occurs most often in long-distance runners, bicyclists, and other athletes who repeatedly squat. The iliotibial band syndrome may be the result of a combination of issues, including''There can be a predisposition to develop IT band syndrome. Anatomy issues may include differences in the lengths of the legs (a leg-length discrepancy), an abnormal tilt to the pelvis, or bowed legs (genu varum). These situations can cause the iliotibial band to become excessively tight, leading to increased friction and irritation when the band crosses back and forth across the femoral epicondyle during activity.''Training errors may cause runners to develop iliotibial band syndrome symptoms. Roads are canted or banked with the center of the road higher than the outside edge to allow for water runoff. If a runner always runs on the same side of the road, it produces the same effect on the body as having a leg-length discrepancy. One leg is always downhill compared to the other, and the pelvis has to tilt to accommodate the activity. ''Running'' too many hills can also cause inflammation of the IT band. Running downhill is especially stressful on the IT band as it works to stabilize the knee.''Bicyclists may develop IT band inflammation should they have improper posture on their bike and ""toe in"" when they pedal. The issue may be how the toe clips are aligned, forcing the foot to be internally rotated, toed in. This can cause the same effect as bowed legs, increasing the angle of the IT band as it crosses the knee and increasing the risk of inflammation.''Other activities with increased knee flexion can cause symptoms and include rowing and ''weight lifting'', especially with excessive squatting.' poor training habits, poor flexibility of muscle, and other mechanical imbalances in the body, especially involving the low back, pelvis, hips, and knees."
What are iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome symptoms and signs?,"   Pain on the lateral side of the knee is the most common symptom of iliotibial band syndrome and is due to inflammation of the area where the band crosses back and forth at the femoral epicondyle. Initially, there may be a sensation of stinging or needle-like pricks that are often ignored. This can gradually progress to pain every time the heel strikes the ground and finally can become disabling with pain when walking or when climbing up or down steps. Some patients may feel a snapping or popping sound at the knee, and there may be some swelling either where the band crosses the femoral epicondyle or below the knee where it attaches to the tibia. Occasionally, the pain may radiate along the course of the IT band all the way up to the outer side of the thigh to the hip."
How do health care professionals diagnose iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"""Often, the diagnosis of iliotibial band syndrome can be made by the patient's story of symptoms. The patient describes the progression of lateral ""'knee pain'' that is made worse when the heel strikes the ground. Physical examination is helpful because the area of pain can often be palpated with tenderness and swelling felt over the femoral epicondyle, where the bursa or sac is located.''The health care professional may also look for leg-length discrepancy, muscle imbalance, and tightness in the legs and back. There is tenderness of the outer thigh just above the knee joint, while the knee and hip joints themselves are normal to examination.''Usually, a full physical examination of the low back and legs, including the hips, knees, and ankles, is performed to detect other potential causes of lateral ''knee pain''.''Plain ''X-rays'' are not usually required to help with the diagnosis, but ''MRI'' may be used to look for inflammation surrounding and beneath the iliotibial band. The ''MRI'' can also exclude other causes of outer ''knee pain''. These include torn cartilage (lateral ''meniscus tear''), sprained lateral collateral ligament, muscle tendon inflammation, and problems between the kneecap and the femur (patellofemoral pain). Most often, ''X-rays'' and MRI images are not needed.'  "
What is the treatment for iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"'Iliotibial band syndrome is an overuse injury that causes inflammation. IT\xa0band syndrome treatment includes the following:''Research continues with other injection therapy options to find non-surgical cures.''It is unusual that the conservative nonsurgical treatment fails to help. However, orthopedic surgery may be an option for patients who fail conservative (nonoperative) treatment.''Before surgery is considered, other potential causes of lateral knee pain are usually considered. These include lateral ''meniscus'' tear and chondromalacia.'   Rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). Anti-inflammatory medications, like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve), may be helpful. Note that any over-the-counter medications can have potential side effects, as well as interactions with prescription medications. If questions or concerns exist, it is wise to ask a health care professional or pharmacist about their safe use. Home treatment can involve stretching, massage, and use of foam rollers at the site of pain and inflammation. Should these first-line treatments not work, physical therapy may be needed to decrease the inflammation at the IT band. Some treatments focus on flexibility and stretching. Friction rubbing may occur over the IT band at the femoral epicondyle may help to break down inflammation and scarring. Therapeutic ultrasound techniques may be used, including phonopheresis (ultrasound propels anti-inflammatory medications through the skin into the inflamed tissue) and iontophoresis (electricity is used instead of ultrasound) to help decrease irritation in the soft tissues surrounding the knee. The physical therapist may also help evaluate the underlying cause of the problem and look at muscle strength and balance and/or flexibility and gait analysis (watching a person walk, run, or cycle). Shoe orthotics may be useful if there is a gait problem, pelvic tilt, or leg-length discrepancy as a potential cause of IT band syndrome. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone) injected at the site of inflammation may be of benefit. Arthroscopy can be used to find the inflammation surrounding the iliotibial band and cut it away. This inflammation and scarring is often found in the lateral recess of the knee between the IT band and the femoral epicondyle. Other surgical options may be available, including cutting out a small triangular part of the IT band to lengthen the band and allow more room for it to slide across bone."
What stretches and exercises are beneficial for iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,  
What exercises should be avoided with iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"'Most patients recover from iliotibial band syndrome, but it can take from weeks to months to return to full activity without pain. Patience in allowing the body to heal is required for optimal results.''Understanding the importance of symmetry in the body is helpful in preventing iliotibial band syndrome. When activities alter that symmetry, symptoms may occur.''Symptoms may occur in runners who always run in the same direction on an indoor track or who always run on the same side of a banked road. This causes an artificial tilt to the pelvis and increases the risk of developing inflammation and pain. When running indoors, it is wise to change directions when running longer distances. Some tracks have the runners change directions every few minutes while others change direction on alternate days. While running toward traffic is an important safety strategy, finding a way to run on the opposite side of the street safely may minimize the risk of developing iliotibial band syndrome.''Bicyclists are at risk for iliotibial band syndrome if they tend to pedal with their toes turned in (internally rotated), which can cause abnormal stretching of the iliotibial band at the knee. Being aware of pedaling technique and setting the pedals and clips properly may minimize the risk of developing symptoms.''Keeping muscles and other structures stretched is an important part of prevention of many musculoskeletal injuries, including iliotibial band syndrome.' "
Where can people find more information about iliotibial band (IT band) syndrome?,"""Iliotibial band syndrome is a common runner's affliction. Often a local running store will be able to provide information about the signs and symptoms of the injury, including area health care professionals who can help runners and other athletes."" "
What should I know about itching?," The medical term for itching is pruritus. Bacterial and fungal infections, bites and stings, infestations, chronic diseases, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, allergic reactions, sun exposure, and dry skin, and other skin disorders and health conditions all may be causes of itching. Anti-itch creams and lotions containing camphor, menthol, phenol, pramoxine (Caladryl, Tronolane), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), or benzocaine can bring relief. Some cases of itching will respond to corticosteroid medications. It is important to avoid scratching when possible to prevent worsening of the condition and disruption of the skin that could lead to bacterial infection. If itching persists, worsens, or is associated with skin lesions, go see a health care professional."
What is an itch?,"'Itch is an irritation in the skin that elicits an urge to scratch. Itchiness is a problem that everyone experiences, and the symptom can be localized (limited to one area of the body) or generalized (occurring all over the body or in several different areas). Sometimes, depending upon the underlying cause, itching may be worse at night. In medical terminology, itching is known as ''pruritus''.''Generalized itch that occurs all over the body is often more difficult to treat than localized itch. Itches can also occur with or without skin lesions (''bumps'', ''blisters'', ''rash'', redness, or abnormalities that can be seen on the skin). An itch that is accompanied by a visible skin abnormality should be evaluated by a physician and, in some cases, by a dermatologist since the problem is likely to be a condition that requires specialized medical treatment (for example, ''eczema'', ''scabies'', etc.).' "
What are associated symptoms and signs of itching (pruritus)?,"'Depending upon the underlying cause, itchiness may be associated with other symptoms and signs. Most commonly, these associated findings include skin lesions such as ''rash'', blisters, bumps, or redness of the affected area. Dryness of the skin is a common cause of itch. Itching of skin can lead to tears in the skin (excoriations) from scratching. Less commonly, generalized itching all over the body can be a sign of chronic medical conditions such as ''liver disease''. In these situations, there may be no changes to the appearance of the skin.'  "
What causes itching?,"'Pruritus can be caused by many conditions. ''Stress'', ''anxiety'', or other emotional problems can cause itching. ''Stress'' also can aggravate itch from other causes. ''Dry skin'' (''xerosis'') is perhaps the most frequent cause of itch without a rash. Many people also report ''sunburn'' itch following prolonged exposure to UV ''radiation'' from the sun along with the ''pain'' of ''sunburn''. Other causes of generalized itching that may not produce a rash or specific skin changes include metabolic and hormone disorders (for examples, ''kidney disease'', ''hyperthyroidism''), ''cancers'' (for example, ''lymphoma''), reactions to ''drugs'', interruptions in bile flow (''cholestasis'') from ''liver disease'', and diseases of the blood (for example, ''polycythemia'' rubra vera). Itching is common with allergic reactions, such as ''food allergies'' or other types of ''allergy''. Itching can also result from ''insect stings'' and bites such as mosquito or ''flea bites''.''Psoriasis'' is a chronic cause of ''skin inflammation'' that can also be associated with itching. Patients with ''psoriasis'' typically develop red, elevated, scaling plaques of dry, ''itchy'' skin. ''Atopic dermatitis'' is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that usually starts in childhood. Itching, rash, and thickening of the skin over time are characteristic symptoms of ''atopic dermatitis''. This is considered to be a type of ''allergy'' (an immune system reaction against a foreign substance) that is associated with inhaled ''allergies'' (''hay fever'') and is chronic.''Infections and infestations of the skin are another cause of itch. Genital itching or ''anal itching'', which may accompany burning and ''pain'', in men and women can occur as a result of genital infections such as ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs''). ''Vaginal itching'' is sometimes referred to as feminine itching, and sexually transmitted diseases can also cause ''anal itching'' and pain. Vaginal yeast infections are another cause of vaginal itching. Other common infectious causes of itch include a yeast (fungal) infection of the crotch (''tinea cruris'') commonly known as ''jock itch'', ''psoriasis'', and ''ringworm'' of the body (''tinea corporis'""). Another type of parasitic infection resulting in an itchy sensation is the so-called swimmer's itch. Swimmer's itch, also called ""'cercarial dermatitis'', is a skin rash caused by an ''allergic reaction'' to infection with certain parasites of birds and mammals that are released from infected snails in fresh and saltwater. Itch may also result from skin infestation by ''body lice'', including ''head lice'' and ''pubic lice''. ''Scabies'' is a highly ''contagious'' skin condition caused by an infestation by the itch ''mite'' ''Sarcoptes scabiei'' that is known to cause an intense itch that is particularly severe at night.'  "
What causes itching? (Continued),"'Brachioradial pruritus is a neurologic condition that results in intense itching of the arms. It usually develops on the forearm over the head of the brachioradialis muscle, but it can occur anywhere on the upper extremities. This is often caused by a ''pinched nerve'' in the neck.''Itching can also result from other conditions that affect the nerves or nervous system, such as ''diabetes'', ''shingles'' (''herpes zoster''), or ''multiple sclerosis''.''Irritation of the skin from contact with fabrics, ''cosmetics'', or other substances can lead to itching that may be accompanied by rash, known as ''contact dermatitis''. ''Poison ivy'' is another example of contact ''dermatitis''. Reactions to drugs or medications can also result in widespread itching that may be accompanied by a rash or ''hives''. Sometimes women report that they experience generalized itching during ''pregnancy'' or a worsening of the conditions that normally cause itching. Contact dermatitis from ''poison ivy'', ''poison oak'', or ''poison sumac'' (due to contact with the oily sap urushiol) or ''allergy'' to nickel are also common causes of localized itching.''Itching of the ''scalp'' can be caused by a number of conditions, including ''dandruff'', psoriasis, or ''seborrheic dermatitis''.''Most people who have itching do not have a serious underlying condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose itching?,"'As with any condition, a careful medical history and physical examination will suggest to your health care provider the particular diagnostic tests that may be needed to learn the cause of itching. Some common causes like ''dry skin'' or sunburn may be obvious, while causes such as chronic systemic diseases or conditions may require blood or imaging tests to identify. If a skin condition is responsible for the itch, sometimes a scraping or biopsy may be performed to identify the condition. Nevertheless, many common ''rashes'' and skin ailments have a characteristic symptom or appearance that may suggest the correct diagnosis.' "
What types of health care specialists treat itching?,"'Because the causes of pruritic skin are so varied, many different medical practitioners can be involved in treating itching. Itching is commonly treated by specialists in family medicine, internal medicine, ''pediatrics'', or dermatology. Itching related to allergy may be treated by an allergist or immunologist. Itching related to ''STDs'' may be managed by a gynecologist or ''urologist''. An obstetrician-gynecologist may treat women suffering from itching during pregnancy or ''vaginitis''. People with itching due to chronic diseases may be treated by the specialists who manage these conditions, such as endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, nephrologists, oncologists, hematologists, neurologists, and infectious-disease specialists. Some causes of itching are treated by emergency-medicine specialists.' "
Should people scratch the itch?,"""Itching usually prompts scratching, which can sometimes lead to a vicious itch-scratch cycle. Scratching can initially feel satisfying, but prolonged scratching just leaves you with irritated skin that can still itch and often worsens the itching itself. Since scratching provides only temporary relief and doesn't promote healing of the underlying problem, it is best to avoid scratching if at all possible. If scratching breaks open the skin, bacterial infection can set in. This is known as secondary infection. And if scratching continues for many months or years, the area that is scratched may develop thickened skin (lichenification) or pigmentation that darkens the area.""'The best way to allow irritated skin to heal is to stop scratching it. However, willpower often is not enough since the urge to scratch can be compelling. The following sections discuss some general measures and home remedies to help to stop scratching and control itch, regardless of the cause.'  "
What are topical itch treatments? Are there any home remedies for itching?,"'Topical itch treatments, those used on the skin, include ''cold'' applications, creams, and lotions.''Cold applications'': Because cold and itch travel along the same nerve fibers, the use of cold can ""jam the circuits"" and deaden itch. Methods of applying cold include the following:''Hot water'' (in the shower, for instance) feels good temporarily, but it can leave you feeling even itchier later. Therefore, the use of hot water is not recommended.'   Cool water, either by running tap water over the affected area or placing a cold clean washcloth on the skin Cool showers A cool bath; products that contain colloidal oatmeal are available over the counter as an itch relief bath Ice packs, either the commercially available type or ice cubes in a plastic bag"
What are topical itch treatments? Are there any home remedies for itching? (Continued),"'You can apply these products over and over, every few minutes if needed. These preparations help numb the nerve endings and stop you from a frenzy of scratching, which leaves the skin raw, sore, and even itchier.''Although hydrocortisone-containing creams and lotions are often promoted as itch reducers, this ingredient only helps an itch that is caused by a rash responsive to cortisone, such as the skin diseases ''eczema'' and ''seborrhea''. Since OTC hydrocortisone-containing creams and lotions are weak (even so-called ""maximum-strength"" products contain only 1%), they aren\'t too helpful for itch even in responsive conditions. When pruritus is caused by irritations of other sorts (''insect bites'"", for instance), hydrocortisone doesn't help much at all. If you use hydrocortisone for 10 days and experience no improvement, you should go see a physician to help determine the cause of your itch."" Camphor Menthol Phenol Pramoxine Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) Benzocaine (or one of the other ""caine"" anesthetics)"
What are oral medications that treat itch?,"'Traditionally, ''antihistamines'' are used to treat itch. Examples include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax), and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton and others). These medicines can induce drowsiness in many people and must be used with care before driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Although antihistamines may help relieve itchy skin, they seem to do so mainly by helping people fall asleep and avoid scratching at night. If falling or staying asleep is not your main problem, you may want to try one of the nonsedating antihistamines. ''Loratadine'' (''Claritin'') and ''fexofenadine'' (''Allegra'' and others) are examples of newer second-generation antihistamines that are available without a prescription. The second-generation antihistamines do not have the sedating effects of the older first-generation antihistamines but they are not very effective in quelling the itch.' "
Is it possible to prevent itching?,"'Itching can be prevented only to the extent that the underlying cause(s) of the itching sensation can be prevented. For example, careful use of ''sunscreen'' products can prevent the itching associated with sunburn. Keeping well hydrated and using moisturizers can prevent the itch associated with dry skin. It is also possible to take preventive measures to avoid contagious conditions that may be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact like sexually transmitted diseases, or tick or ''bug bites'', or ''lice'' infestations that may be the sources of itching. Chronic itch associated with serious conditions like ''skin cancers'' and ''liver'' or kidney disease cannot typically be prevented.' "
When should the doctor be consulted for itching (pruritus)?,"""If home treatment isn't helping, scratching is affecting the skin being scratched (infection, lichenification [thickening and scarring], or pigmentation), or the itch is disturbing one's ""'sleep'"", consult a doctor to ascertain what's causing the itching. A doctor can also prescribe stronger cortisone-based creams (for eczemas and ""'allergies'') and prescription-grade antihistamines, if necessary, or treat the underlying condition that is causing the itch.' "
What are possible complications of itching?,"'As mentioned previously, a secondary bacterial infection of the skin is perhaps the most common complication of itching. This occurs not as a result of the itch but as a result of the scratching and associated skin damage. Antibiotics may be required to treat a bacterial infection of the skin. Itching itself is unlikely to lead to other complications, although some of the underlying diseases that cause itching (see above) are associated with complications specific to the disease itself.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for itching?,"'Itching itself is not associated with long-term skin problems or harm, and most cases of itch are temporary and resolve on their own or with topical or oral treatments. Itching that is associated with a serious condition may persist if the condition worsens or it may be managed with medications.' "
What is anal itching (pruritus ani)?,"'Anal itching (known medically as pruritus ani) is irritation of the skin at the opening of the anal canal through which ''stool'' exits the body that leads to itching. The skin surrounding the opening is known as the anus. The itching is accompanied by the desire to scratch. Although itching may be a reaction to chemicals in the stool, it often implies that there is inflammation of the anal area. The intensity of anal itching and the amount of inflammation increases with the direct ''trauma'' of scratching and the presence of moisture. At its most intense, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort that often is described as burning and soreness.' "
What are common causes of anal itching?,"'Other problems that can cause anal ''itch'' include:' An itchy bottom can be caused by irritating chemicals in the foods we eat, such as are found in spices, hot sauces, and peppers. Anal itching also can be caused by the irritation of continuous moisture in the anus from frequent liquid stools, diarrhea, or escape of small amounts of stool (incontinence or fecal soilage). Moisture increases the possibility of infections of the anus, especially yeast, particularly in patients with diabetes or HIV. Treatment with antibiotics can lead to a yeast infection and irritation of the anus. Psoriasis can irritate the anus. Abnormal passageways (fistulas) from the small intestine or colon to the skin surrounding the anus can form as a result of medical conditions (such as Crohn's disease), and these fistulas bring irritating fluids to the anal area. Rarely, tumors of the anus (anal cancer) may be the cause of itching. Pinworms, Hemorrhoids, Tears of the anal skin (fissures), and Skin tags (abnormal local growth of anal skin)."
What are additional symptoms associated with anal itching?," The intensity of anal itching and the amount of inflammation increases from the direct trauma of scratching and the presence of moisture. At its most intense, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort that often is described as burning and soreness, especially during and after bowel movements. There also may be small amounts of bleeding."
What kind of doctor treats anal itching?,"'Although anal itching can be evaluated by a family practice or internal medicine physician, it most often is evaluated by a ''colorectal'' surgeon (proctologist) and sometimes by a ''gastroenterologist''.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose the cause of anal itching?,"'Anal itching is first evaluated with a careful examination of the anus for such abnormalities as ''hemorrhoids'', anal fissures, skin tags, moisture, and excoriations (breaks in the skin from scratching).''A rectal examination with a finger inserted into the anal canal can identify rectal tumors. For a closer look at the anal canal, a proctoscope can be used. A proctoscope is a short tube that is inserted through the anus and into the rectum so that the anal canal can be examined visually If pinworms are suspected, they and their eggs can be identified using the ''pinworm test'', a test in which the worms and eggs are recovered from the anus using transparent adhesive tape.' "
What are treatment options and home remedies for anal itching?,"'Initial self-care for simple itching is directed toward relieving symptoms, like burning and soreness. It is important to clean and dry the anus thoroughly and avoid leaving soap in the anal area.''Many ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) products are sold for the treatment of an itchy anus and are available as ointments, creams, gels, suppositories, foams and pads. These products often contain the same ''drugs'' used to treat hemorrhoids.''Most products contain more than one type of active ingredient. Almost all contain a protectant in addition to another ingredient. Only examples of brand-name products containing one ingredient in addition to the protectant are discussed in this article.' Cleaning efforts should include gentle showering without direct rubbing or irritation of the skin with either the washcloth or towel. After bowel movements, moist pads (such as baby wipes, flushable moist wipes, and flushable anal cleansing wipes) should be used for cleaning the anus instead of toilet paper. If there is constant moisture present in the anus or stool incontinence, it may be necessary to clean the anus with wet wipes between bowel movements. When used around the anus, ointments, creams, and gels should be applied as a thin covering. When applied to the anal canal, these products should be inserted with a finger using finger cots (latex covers for the fingertips) or a ""pile pipe."" Pile pipes are most efficient when they have holes on the sides as well as at the end. Pile pipes should be lubricated with ointment prior to insertion. Suppositories or foams do not have advantages over ointments, creams, and gels."
Local anesthetics,"'Local anesthetics temporarily relieve ''pain'', burning, and itching by numbing the nerve endings. The use of these products should be limited to the perianal area and lower anal canal. Local anesthetics can cause ''allergic'' reactions with burning and itching. Therefore, the application of anesthetics should be discontinued if burning and itching increase.''Examples of local anesthetics include:' benzocaine 5% to 20% (Americaine Hemorrhoidal, Lanacane Maximum Strength, Medicone) benzyl alcohol (Itch-X) 5% to 20% dibucaine 0.25% to 1.0% (Nupercainal) dyclonine 0.5% to 1.0% lidocaine (Xylocaine) 2% to 5% pramoxine 1.0% (Fleet Pain-Relief, Procto Foam Non-steroid, Tronothane Hydrochloride) tetracaine 0.5% to 5.0%"
Vasoconstrictors,"'Vasoconstrictors are chemicals such as epinephrine, a naturally occurring chemical. Applied to the anus, vasoconstrictors make the blood vessels become smaller, which may reduce swelling. They also may reduce symptoms due to their mild anesthetic effect.''Vasoconstrictors applied to the perianal area -- unlike vasoconstrictors given by injection -- have a low likelihood of causing serious side effects, such as ''high blood pressure'', nervousness, ''tremor'', ''sleeplessness'', and aggravation of ''diabetes'' or ''hyperthyroidism''.''Examples of vasoconstrictors include:' ephedrine sulfate 0.1% to 1.25% epinephrine 0.005% to 0.01% phenylephrine 0.25% (Medicone Suppository, Preparation H, Rectocaine)"
Protectants,"'Protectants prevent irritation of the perianal area by forming a physical barrier on the skin that prevents contact of the irritated skin with aggravating liquid or stool from the rectum. This barrier reduces irritation, itching, pain, and burning. There are many products that are themselves protectants or that contain a protectant in addition to other medications.''Examples of protectants include:' aluminum hydroxide gel cocoa butter glycerin kaolin lanolin mineral oil (Balneol) white petrolatum starch zinc oxide (Desitin) or calamine (which contains zinc oxide) in concentrations of up to 25% cod liver oil or shark liver oil if the amount of vitamin A is 10,000 USP units/day."
Astringents,"'Astringents cause coagulation (clumping) of proteins in the cells of the perianal skin or the lining of the anal canal. This action promotes dryness of the skin, which in turn helps relieve burning, itching, and pain.''Examples of astringents include:' calamine 5% to 25% zinc oxide 5% to 25% (Calmol 4, Nupercainal, Tronolane) witch hazel 10% to 50% (Fleet Medicated, Tucks, Witch Hazel Hemorrhoidal Pads)"
Antiseptics,"'Antiseptics inhibit the growth of bacteria and other organisms. However, it is unclear whether antiseptics are any more effective than soap and water.''Examples of antiseptics include:' boric acid phenol benzalkonium chloride cetylpyridinium chloride benzethonium chloride resorcinol"
Keratolytics,'Keratolytics are chemicals that cause the outer layers of skin or other tissues to disintegrate. The rationale for their use is that the disintegration allows medications that are applied to the anus and perianal area to penetrate into the deeper tissues.''The two approved keratolytics used are:' aluminum chlorhydroxy allantoinate (alcloxa) 0.2% to 2.0% resorcinol 1% to 3%
Analgesics,"'Analgesic products, like anesthetic products, relieve pain, itching, and burning by depressing receptors on pain nerves.''Examples of analgesics include:' menthol 0.1% to 1.0% (greater than 1.0% is not recommended) (Calmoseptine) camphor 0.1% to 3% (greater than 3% is not recommended) juniper tar 1% to 5%"
Corticosteroids,"'Corticosteroids'' reduce inflammation and can relieve itching, but their chronic use can cause permanent damage to the skin. They should not be used for more than short periods of a few days to two weeks. Only products with weak ''corticosteroid'' effects are available over-the-counter. Stronger corticosteroid products that are available by prescription should not be used for treating anal itching.' "
What if anal itching persists?,"'For persistent anal itching, efforts are directed toward identifying an underlying cause. An examination by a doctor can rapidly identify most causes of anal itching. Adjustments in ''diet'', treatment of infections, or surgical procedures to correct the underlying cause may be required.' "
What is Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding condition in which the blood doesn't clot as it should. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets).""""Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites). They're made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. Platelets stick together (clot) to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.""'You can understand the name of this disease by an explanation of its three parts. ""Idiopathic"" (id-ee-o-PATH-ick) means that the cause of the condition isn\'t known. ""Thrombocytopenic"" (throm-bo-cy-toe-PEE-nick) means there\'s a lower than normal number of platelets in the blood. ""Purpura"" (PURR-purr-ah) refers to purple ''bruises'' caused by bleeding under the skin.''People who have ITP often have purple ''bruises'' that appear on the skin or on the mucous membranes (for example, in the mouth). The bruises mean that bleeding has occurred in small blood vessels under the skin.''A person who has ITP also may have bleeding that results in tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a ''rash''.'""People who have ITP also may have nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums when they have dental work done, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Women who have ITP may have menstrual bleeding that's heavier than usual.""'More extensive bleeding can cause hematomas (he-mah-TO-mas). A ''hematoma'' is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump.''Bleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but can be life threatening if it occurs.'""In most cases, an autoimmune response is believed to cause ITP. Normally your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known.""""ITP can't be passed from one person to another."" "
What Are The Types of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"'There are two types of ITP: acute (temporary or short-term) and chronic (long-lasting).''Acute ITP generally lasts less than 6 months. It mainly occurs in children, both boys and girls, and is the most common type of ITP. Acute ITP often occurs after an infection caused by a virus.''Chronic ITP is long-lasting (6 months or longer) and mostly affects adults. However, some teenagers and children can get this type of ITP. Chronic ITP affects women 2 to 3 times more often than men.' "
What Are The causes of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""In most cases, it's believed that an autoimmune response causes idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).""""Normally, the immune system makes antibodies (proteins) to fight off germs or other harmful things that enter the body. In ITP, however, the immune system attacks and destroys the body's platelets by mistake. Why this happens isn't known.""'Children who get acute (short-term) ITP often have had recent viral infections. It\'s possible that the infection somehow ""triggers"" or sets off the immune reaction that leads to ITP in these children. ITP in adults, on the other hand, doesn\'t seem to be linked to infections.'  "
What Are The Risk Factors for Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"'Both children and adults can develop idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).''Children usually get the acute (short-term) type of ITP. Acute ITP often develops after an infection caused by a virus. Adults tend to get the chronic (long-lasting) type of ITP. Women are 2 to 3 times more likely than men to get chronic ITP.''ITP is a fairly common blood disorder, with 50 to 150 new cases per every 1 million people each year; about half of these cases are children. However, the number of cases of ITP is rising because routine blood tests that can detect a ''low platelet count'' are being done more often.'""ITP can't be passed from one person to another."" "
What Are The Symptoms and Signs for Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""Having a low platelet count doesn't cause symptoms. However, the bleeding that a low platelet count can cause may have the following signs and symptoms:""""Any kind of bleeding that's hard to stop could be a sign of ITP. This includes menstrual bleeding in women that's heavier than usual.""'Bleeding in the brain is rare, and the symptoms of bleeding in the brain may vary in severity.'""A low number of platelets doesn't cause ""'pain'', ''fatigue'' (''tiredness''), problems concentrating, or any other symptoms.' Pinpoint red spots on the skin that often are found in groups and may look like a rash. The spots, called petechiae, are due to bleeding under the skin. Bruising or purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes (such as in the mouth) due to bleeding under the skin. The bruises may occur for no known reason. This type of bruising is called purpura. More extensive bleeding can cause hematomas. A hematoma is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump. Nosebleeds or bleeding from the gums (for example, when dental work is done). Blood in the urine or 
stool (bowel movement)."
How Is Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Diagnosed (ITP)?,"'Your doctor will diagnose idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.'""Your doctor will want to make sure that your low platelet count isn't due to another condition (such as an infection) or a side effect of medicines you're taking (such as ""'chemotherapy'' medicines or ''aspirin'').''Your doctor may ask about:''Your doctor will give you a physical exam and look for signs of bleeding and infection. For example, your doctor may look for pinpoint red spots on the skin and bruising or purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes. These are signs of bleeding under the skin.'""You'll likely have blood tests to check your platelets. These tests usually include:""'You also may have a blood test to check for the antibodies that attack platelets.''If blood tests show that you have a low number of platelets, your doctor may recommend more tests to confirm a diagnosis of ITP. For example, bone marrow tests may be used to see whether your bone marrow is making platelets.''Some people who have mild ITP have few or no signs of bleeding. These people may be diagnosed only after a blood test done for another reason shows that they have a low platelet count.' Your signs and symptoms of bleeding and any other signs or symptoms you're having Whether you have illnesses that could lower your platelet count or cause bleeding Medicines or any other over-the-counter supplements or remedies you take that could cause bleeding or lower your platelet count A complete blood count. This test shows the numbers of different kinds of blood cells, including platelets, in a small sample of your blood. In ITP, the red and white blood cell counts are normal. A blood smear. During this test, some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is then used to look at your platelets and other blood cells. In ITP, the number of platelets is lower than normal."
What Are The Treatments For Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""Treatment for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is based on how much and how often you're bleeding and your platelet count. In some cases, treatment may not be needed.""'Medicines often are used as the first course of treatment. Treatments used for children and adults are similar.''Adults who have milder cases of ITP may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts. However, adults with ITP who have very low platelet counts or problems with bleeding are treated. ''The acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months and requires no treatment. Children who have milder cases of ITP may not need treatment other than monitoring and followup to make sure platelet counts return to normal. Children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), are treated.''If ITP needs to be treated, medicines often are tried first. ''Corticosteroids'' (cor-ti-co-STEER-roids), such as ''prednisone'', are commonly used to treat ITP.''These medicines, called steroids for short, help increase your platelet count by lowering the activity of your immune system. However, steroids have a number of side effects, and some people relapse (get worse) when treatment ends.'""The steroids used to treat ITP are different from illegal steroids taken by some athletes to enhance performance. Corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them for many years.""'Some medicines used to help raise the platelet count are given through a needle inserted into a vein. These medicines include immune globulin and anti-Rh (D) immunoglobulin. The monoclonal antibody ''rituximab'' is also often used for treatment of ITP.''Medicines also may be used along with a procedure to remove the spleen, called splenectomy (splee-NECK-tuh-mee).'""If steroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy don't help, two newer medicines—eltrombopag and romiplostim—can be used to treat ITP.""'If necessary, the spleen will be removed surgically. This organ is located in the upper left abdomen. The spleen is about the size of a golf ball in children and a baseball in adults.''The spleen makes antibodies (proteins) that help fight infection. In ITP, these antibodies destroy platelets.'""If ITP hasn't responded to steroids, removing the spleen will reduce the destruction of platelets. However, it also may make you more likely to get certain infections. Before you have the surgery, your doctor may give you vaccines to help prevent these infections.""'If your spleen is removed, your doctor will explain what steps you can take to help avoid infections and what symptoms that should be reported to your physician.''Some people with ITP who have severe bleeding may need to have platelet transfusions and be hospitalized. Some people will need a platelet transfusion before having surgery. However, most people with ITPdo not need platelet transfusions.'""For a platelet transfusion, donor platelets from a blood bank are injected into the recipient's bloodstream. This increases the platelet count for a short time.""""Some infections can briefly lower a person's platelet count. If a person who has ITP has an infection that can lower his or her platelet count, treating the infection may help increase the platelet count and reduce bleeding problems.""'If a person who has ITP is taking medicine that can lower his or her platelet count or cause bleeding, stopping the medicine can sometimes help increase the platelet count or prevent bleeding.''For example, aspirin and ''ibuprofen'' are common medicines that increase the chance of bleeding. If you have ITP, your doctor may suggest that you avoid these medicines.' "
How Can Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Be Prevented?,"""You can't prevent idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but you can prevent its complications."" Talk to your doctor about which medicines you can take. Your doctor may advise you to avoid medicines such as aspirin or ibuprofen that can affect your platelets and increase your risk of bleeding. Protect yourself from injuries that can cause bruising or bleeding. Seek treatment right away if you develop any infections. Report any symptoms of infection, such as a fever, to your doctor. This is very important for people with ITP who have had their spleens removed."
Living with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP),"'If you have idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), you can take steps to prevent complications. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition.'""If you have ITP, try to avoid injuries, especially head injuries, that can cause bleeding in the brain. For example, don't participate in contact sports such as boxing, football, or karate. Other sports, such as skiing or horseback riding, also put you at risk for injuries that can cause bleeding.""'Some safe activities are ''swimming'' and ''walking''. Ask your doctor about physical activities that are safe for you.''Take precautions such as regular use of seatbelts and wearing gloves when working with knives and other tools.'""If your child has ITP, ask his or her doctor whether you need to restrict your child's activities.""'Find a doctor, preferably a hematologist, who is familiar with treating people who have ITP. Hematologists are doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and disorders. Discuss with your doctor how to manage ITP and when to seek medical care.''Talk to your doctor before taking prescription and over-the-counter medicines and nutritional ''supplements''. Some medicines and supplements can affect platelets and increase your chance of bleeding. Common examples are aspirin or ibuprofen.''Tell your doctor about all of the over-the-counter medicines you take, including ''vitamins'', supplements, and herbal remedies. These products may contain substances that increase your risk of bleeding.''Watch for symptoms of infection, such as a ''fever'"", and report them to your doctor promptly. If you've had your spleen removed, you may be more likely to become ill from certain types of infection.""'In women who are ''pregnant'"" and have ITP, the ITP usually doesn't affect the baby. However, some ""'babies'' born to mothers who have ITP are born with or develop low numbers of platelets soon after birth.''Their platelet counts almost always return to normal without any treatment. Treatment can speed the recovery in the very few babies whose platelet counts remain very low.''Treatment for ITP during ''pregnancy'"" depends on a woman's platelet count. If treatment is needed, the doctor will take a close look at the possible effects of the treatment on the unborn baby.""'Women who have milder cases of ITP usually can go through pregnancy without treatment. Pregnant women who have very low platelet counts or a lot of bleeding are more likely to have serious heavy bleeding during delivery or afterward. To prevent serious bleeding, these women usually are treated.' "
What Is The Outlook For Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)?,"""For most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition.""""Acute ITP in children often goes away on its own within a few weeks or months and doesn't return. In most children who have ITP, the platelet count returns to normal within 6 months. Treatment may not be needed.""""A small number of children, about 5 percent, whose ITP doesn't go away on its own may need to have further medical or surgical treatment.""'Chronic ITP will vary with each individual and can last for many years. Even people who have severe forms of chronic ITP can live for decades. Most people who have chronic ITP are able at some point to stop treatment and keep a safe platelet count.' "
What Are Other Names For Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)?, Immune thrombocytopenic purpura Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura
What is an IUD (intrauterine device)?,"'The intrauterine device (IUD) is a small T-shaped device that is used as a method of ''birth control'"" designed for insertion into a woman's uterus. Having an IUD means that changes occur in the uterus that make it difficult for ""'fertilization'' and implantation of an egg. IUDs also have been referred to as ""intrauterine ''contraception''"" (IUC). Some IUDs approved for use in the United States contain medications that are released over time to facilitate the ''contraceptive'' effect. An IUD is a type of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).''IUDs have been shown to be over 99% effective in preventing ''pregnancy''. Although IUDs are highly effective, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
How does an IUD work?,"'It is not fully understood how IUDs work. They are thought to prevent ''conception'' by causing a brief localized inflammation that begins about 24 hours after insertion. The inflammatory reaction inside the uterus attracts white blood cells, which produce substances that are toxic or poisonous to sperm. The ''progesterone''-releasing IUDs also cause a subtle change in the lining of the uterus that impairs the implantation of the egg in the uterine wall. This type of IUD also alters the cervical ''mucus'', which, in turn, inhibits sperm from passing through the cervix.' "
What are the side effects of an IUD?,"'Side effects of the IUD are limited primarily to the uterus and depend upon the type of IUD that is inserted. The copper IUD may cause worsening of ''menstrual cramps'' and heavier menstrual bleeding, although hormonal IUDs usually reduce menstrual flow. Women with hormonal IUDs may have irregular periods and ''spotting'', particularly in the first three to six months.''It is also possible for the IUD to pass through (perforate) the uterine wall and enter the abdominal ''cavity'', where it must be retrieved surgically. Perforation of or ''trauma'' to the uterus by the IUD occurs in one to three per 1,000 insertions.'  "
Does an IUD cause pain?,"'An IUD does not cause ''pain'"". The insertion procedure is done in a doctor's office and may cause a brief discomfort similar to menstrual cramping. An anesthetic can be injected into the cervix prior to the insertion procedure."" "
What are warning signs and symptoms of possible complications from an IUD?,"'Warning signs of possible complications from an IUD include''If a woman experiences any of these signs, she should contact a health-care professional.' abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, abnormal spotting or bleeding, a smelly vaginal discharge."
What are the advantages of an IUD? How effective is an IUD?,"'The advantages of the IUD include the fact that it is highly effective in preventing conception, is reversible, and starts working almost immediately. Once the IUD is removed, there is a quick return to ''fertility''. The ''Mirena' "
"What are the types of IUDs (ParaGard, Mirena, Skyla)?","'Intrauterine devices (IUDs) that are available in the U.S. come in two different types: 1) copper-releasing, or 2) progesterone-releasing.'   TCu380A (ParaGard) is a copper-containing IUD: It releases copper from a copper wire that is wrapped around the base. The released copper contributes to an inflammatory reaction in the uterus that helps prevent fertilization of the egg. It is approved to remain in place for up to 10 years. Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (Mirena or Skyla): This form of IUD releases a progestin hormone from the vertical part of the T. Progestin acts to thicken cervical mucus, creating a barrier to sperm, as well as renders the lining of the uterus inhospitable to implantation of an egg. The two brand-named IUDs in this category contain different amounts of the hormone. Mirena is approved for up to five years of use and Skyla for up to three years."
Who can use an IUD?,"'Most healthy women are be able to use an IUD. They are not right for every woman, however, and some women should not use an IUD for contraception. Before an IUD is inserted, a woman will have a ''pregnancy test'' to ensure she is not ''pregnant'' and will be tested for sexually transmitted diseases (''STD'').''The following are reasons that a woman should not use an IUD:''A woman who is ''allergic'"" to copper or who has Wilson's disease should not use the copper-containing IUD."" Ongoing pelvic infection, such as an STD or a recent STD Cancer of the uterus or cervix Unexplained vaginal bleeding Abnormal or distorted uterine anatomy"
How is an IUD inserted?,"'IUDs are only available by prescription and must be properly inserted by a health-care professional. A ''pelvic exam'' is required to insert an IUD, similar to the procedure for having a ''Pap test''. The IUD is inserted into the uterus long as the woman is not pregnant.''The IUD is a small ""T""-shaped device with a monofilament tail that is inserted into the uterus by a health-care practitioner in the office setting. When inserted into the uterus, the arms of the ""T"" are folded down, but they then open out to form the top of the ""T."" The device rests inside the uterus with the base of the T just above the cervix and the arms of the T extending horizontally across the uterus. A short piece of monofilament string attached to the IUD extends through the cervix into the vagina. This string makes it possible to be sure that the IUD is still in the uterus.' "
How soon does an IUD start working?,"'The IUD begins working to prevent pregnancy as soon as it is inserted, but full protection is believed to take about seven days in some cases, depending on when in the ''menstrual cycle'' it is inserted. If you have an IUD inserted within seven days of ending your ''menstrual period'', it should be effective right away. At any other time in the menstrual cycle, you should use another method of birth control for the first week after insertion.' "
How long does an  IUD last?,"'The copper-containing IUD can be left in place for up to 10 years, and the hormonal IUDs can remain for three or five years, depending upon the type of IUD.' "
How is an IUD removed?,"'An IUD must be removed by a health-care professional. It is very important that a woman not attempt to remove an IUD on her own, as serious problems may result. IUD removal is carried out by determining the position of the uterus, then locating and grasping the stings of the IUD with a special forceps or clamp. A health-care professional will then remove the IUD by gentle traction on the strings.'""Occasionally, the strings of the IUD will not be located. In these situations, the strings have often slipped higher into the cervical canal. A health-care professional can use special instruments to locate the strings and/or remove the IUD. Complications of IUD removal are rare, and removal can take place at any time. Some studies have shown that removal is easier during the menstrual period, when a woman's cervix is typically softer than during other times in the menstrual cycle."" "
Will an IUD affect my periods?,"'The woman must check her IUD every month to be sure that it is still in place. The woman with an IUD in place will still have normal menstrual periods, although some women notice that flow is heavier. Other women, especially those with a hormone-releasing IUD, may have a lighter menstrual flow. Sometimes, the uterus expels (pushes out) the IUD. Expulsions may not cause any specific symptoms and can be overlooked. In addition to the woman checking the IUD, the device must also be checked periodically by a health-care professional.' "
Will my partner feel my IUD?,"'You and your partner should not be able to feel the IUD itself. However, you may feel the strings of the IUD at the upper end of the vagina.' "
What are the risks and complications of IUDs?," An IUD may not be appropriate for women who have heavy menstrual bleeding, had previous pelvic infections, have more than one sexual partner, or plan on getting pregnant. This is because IUDs do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STDs) and should not be in place if a woman intends to become pregnant. If women become pregnant with their IUDs in place, 50% of the pregnancies end in miscarriage. Any woman with an IUD who develops signs or symptoms of pregnancy, or has a positive pregnancy test, should see a health-care professional soon. Women who use non-progesterone types of IUDs are less likely to have an ectopic pregnancy compared to women using no contraception. When a woman using an IUD does become pregnant, the pregnancy is more likely to be ectopic. Nevertheless, ectopic pregnancy in a user of an IUD is a rare occurrence. Serious complications due to infection (pelvic inflammatory disease) associated with an IUD may prevent a woman from being able to become pregnant in the future. Also, with the progesterone-releasing IUDs (levonorgestrel IUDs), a reduction in menstrual flow and a decrease in painful menstrual cramping are often observed with continued use. This is because the progesterone hormone can cause thinning of the lining of the uterus. These menstrual changes are not dangerous in any way and do not mean that the contraceptive action of the IUD is diminished."
Does an IUD protect a woman from sexually transmitted infections (STDs)?,"'No, the IUD does not provide protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
Introduction,'You have been informed by your healthcare provider that you will need to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of a medication to treat your health condition. ''The treatment for many conditions relies on medications administered by IV infusion therapy.' 
How do I prepare for the infusion?,"'Below are a few helpful suggestions to help you create a pleasant and healing experience. ''Check with your healthcare practitioner or the staff at the infusion center for any pre-infusion instructions. Some examples may include: '   The first and most important step is to replace confusion with confidence.  Make a list of questions that pertain to your health condition or questions about your medication and infusion to review with your healthcare practitioner. It may be necessary to make an appointment to review all of your questions.  Learn about the infused medication. There are many places to obtain information about your medication. Discuss the medication(s) with your doctor. Pharmaceutical companies often provide information in the offices and on the Internet for patients and their families. There may also be medical books written about your medication or health condition.  Visit the Infusion Center and meet the medical staff before your first infusion.  Drink plenty of water to be sure you are well hydrated. If you have a heart condition, kidney condition or any other health condition that prevents you from drinking large amounts of fluid, check with your healthcare practitioner for instructions on how to hydrate before your infusion procedure. Some infusions may require that you pre-medicate with medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Check with the infusion staff regarding any pre-medications you need to take prior to your infusion, the dose, and the best time to take the medications.  Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes. You will want to be comfortable, and most likely your vital signs will monitored (for example, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate (breathing rate), or a cardiac monitor may be attached to your chest). Every infusion center is different, so check with yours in regard to what to expect. Wearing loose fitting clothes allows the medical staff to easily and properly monitor your vital signs.  Consider wearing clothing with layers to allow for temperature control. The temperature of the infusion center may be cool or warm; also some intravenous infusions can make you feel either warm or cool. Having layers of clothing allows you the flexibility to easily control your comfort zone.  Most infusion centers will provide blankets, pillows, water and coffee. Check to see what the center provides in case they do not offer something that will make you more comfortable.  Do not wear any fragrance or perfume, other patients may be allergic. Bring a complete list of current medications, allergies, and emergency contact information for the infusion staff to add to your chart."
What are some things I can do to pass the time while receiving therapy?,"'Things to take or do:''PLEASE DO NOT TALK ON YOUR CELL PHONE'' - Place your phone on vibrate mode or turn it off. This is not a time for talking on the phone (unless you have an OK from the infusion staff).''Arrive at the infusion center with a:'  Book Magazine Newspaper Crossword puzzle or Suduko game Hand held games - (if they are quiet or have headphones) Bring your own music (I-pod or MP3 player) A neck pillow - the type used on airplanes Pictures of your family or loved ones Study for that upcoming test Bring your computer and get some work done, watch a movie, or play games. Snacks and a drink (if allowed in the infusion room) Bring paper and pen - make a list of things you need to do Write a letter -a letter of encouragement - of love - of thanks. Catch up on paper work Plan a party Make your shopping list Knit Crochet Draw or doodle Plan a trip Take a nap Pray Meditate Smile Positive attitude (you are in good hands). Personal affirmation - Find one that feels good and energizes you. For example: ""I have the perfect medicine...at the perfect time...I am healing."" Sit back and relax"
What happens during and after the infusion?,"'Be confident that you are receiving excellent care!' Ask questions and notify the staff immediately if you are not feeling ""right"" or have a concern.  Consider talking with someone in the Infusion Center receiving treatment. They may have some advice about their health condition that will help you. You may meet a new friend.  After your infusion is completed, ask for any important post infusion instructions. You may need to take post-infusion medications. Check with your healthcare practitioner or the infusion staff for detailed instructions.  A dressing will be placed in the area where your infusion was done. This dressing should be kept in place for at least 30 minutes or longer. If you are on a blood thinner, leave the dressing in place longer to avoid any bleeding. Check with the staff at the Infusion Center in regard to the length of time necessary to keep the dressing in place.  If you have an allergy to tape, inform the infusion staff (advise them of all allergies).  Obtain a phone number to call in the event that you have any questions or possible side effects to the medication you receive (such as a fever or rash) after your infusion has been completed. "
What are some of the conditions that are treated with an IV drug infusion?,'Examples of conditions treated with IV infusion include:'   Ankylosing spondylitis  Behcet's disease  Cancer Common variable immunodeficiency Crohn's disease  Dermatomyositis  Guillain-Barre syndrome Iritis  Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis  Multiple sclerosis  Osteoporosis  Pemphigus  Psoriasis  Psoriatic arthritis  Rheumatoid arthritis  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Ulcerative colitis Wegener's granulomatosis
What is an intravenous cholangiogram (IVC)?,"'    The intravenous cholangiogram or IVC is a radiologic (x-ray) procedure that is used primarily to look at the larger bile ducts within the ''liver'' and the bile ducts outside the liver. The procedure can be used to locate ''gallstones'' within these bile ducts.  IVC also can be used to identify other causes of obstruction to the flow of bile, for example, narrowings (strictures) of the bile ducts and ''cancers'' that may impair the normal flow of bile.' "
How is an intravenous cholangiogram done?,"'    To do an IVC, an ''iodine''-containing dye is injected intravenously into the blood.  The dye is then removed from blood by the liver which excretes it into the bile. The iodine is concentrated enough just as it is secreted into bile that it does not need to be further concentrated by the gallbladder in order to outlinethe bile ducts and any ''gallstones'' that may be within them.  The gallbladder is not always seen on an IVC since the iodine-containing bile may bypass the gallbladder entirely and empty directly into the small intestine.' "
What are the risks of an intravenous cholangiogram?,'    Occasional serious ''allergic'' reactions can occur to any iodine-containing dye. These reactions can usually be treated but they rarely may result in the death of the patient.' 
When is an intravenous cholangiogram useful?,
