Questions,Answer
What is hemophilia?,"'Hemophilia is not one disease but rather one of a group of inherited ''bleeding disorders'' that cause abnormal or exaggerated bleeding and poor blood clotting. The term is most commonly used to refer to two specific conditions known as hemophilia A and ''hemophilia B'', which will be the main subjects of this article. Hemophilia A and B are distinguished by the specific gene that is mutated (altered to become defective) and codes for a defective clotting factor (protein) in each disease. Rarely, hemophilia C (a deficiency of Factor XI) is encountered, but its effect on clotting is far less pronounced than A or B.''Hemophilia A and B are inherited in an X-linked recessive genetic pattern and are therefore much more common in males. This pattern of inheritance means that a given gene on the X chromosome expresses itself only when there is no normal gene present. For example, a boy has only one X chromosome, so a boy with hemophilia has the defective gene on his sole X chromosome (and so is said to be hemizygous for hemophilia). Hemophilia is the most common X-linked ''genetic disease''.''Although it is much rarer, a girl can have hemophilia, but she would have to have the defective gene on both of her X chromosomes or have one hemophilia gene plus a lost or defective copy of the second X chromosome that should be carrying the normal genes. If a girl has one copy of the defective gene on one of her X chromosomes and a normal second X chromosome, she does not have hemophilia but is said to be heterozygous for hemophilia (a carrier). Her male children have a 50% chance of inheriting the one mutated X gene and thus have a 50% chance of inheriting hemophilia from their carrier mother.''Hemophilia A occurs in about 1 out of every 5000 live male births. Hemophilia A and B occurs in all racial groups. Hemophilia A is about four times more common than B. B occurs in about 1 out of 20- 30,000 live male births.'""Hemophilia has been called the Royal Disease because Queen Victoria, Queen of England from 1837 to 1901, was a carrier. Her daughters passed the mutated gene on to members of the royal families of Germany, Spain, and Russia. Alexandra, Queen Victoria's granddaughter, who became Tsarina of Russia in the early 20th century when she married Tsar Nicholas II, was a carrier. Their son, the Tsarevich Alexei, suffered from hemophilia."" "
What causes hemophilia?,"'As mentioned above, hemophilia is caused by a genetic mutation. The mutations involve genes that code for proteins that are essential in the blood clotting process. The bleeding symptoms arise because blood clotting is impaired.''The process of blood clotting involves a series of complex mechanisms involving 13 different proteins, classically termed factors I through XIII and written with Roman numerals. If the lining of the blood vessels becomes damaged, platelets are recruited to the injured area to form an initial plug. These activated platelets release chemicals that start the clotting cascade, activating the series of 13 proteins known as clotting factors. Ultimately, fibrin is formed, the protein that crosslinks with itself to form a mesh that makes up the final ''blood clot''. The protein involved with hemophilia A is factor VIII (factor 8) and with hemophilia B is factor IX (factor 9).''Hemophilia A is caused by a mutation in the gene for factor VIII, so there is deficiency of this clotting factor. Hemophilia B (also called Christmas disease) results from a deficiency of factor IX due to a mutation in the corresponding gene.''A condition referred to as hemophilia C involves a deficiency of clotting factor XI. This condition is much rarer than hemophilia A and B and typically leads to mild symptoms. It is also not inherited in an X-linked manner and affects persons of both sexes.''Hemophilia A is more common than hemophilia B. About 80% of people with hemophilia have hemophilia A. Hemophilia B occurs in about 1 out of every 20,000 to 30,000 people. A subgroup of those with hemophilia B has the so-called Leyden phenotype, which is characterized by a severe hemophilia in childhood that improves at ''puberty''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of hemophilia?,"'Hemophilia can vary in its severity, depending upon the particular type of mutation (genetic defect). The degree of symptoms depends upon the levels of the affected clotting factor. Severe disease is defined as <1% factor activity, 1% to 5% factor activity is moderate disease, and greater than 5% factor activity constitutes mild disease. The extent of bleeding is dependent upon the severity (the amount of factor activity) and is similar for hemophilia A and B.''With severe hemophilia (A or B), bleeding begins at an early age and may occur spontaneously. Those with mild hemophilia may only bleed excessively in response to injury or ''trauma''. Female carriers of hemophilia have variable degrees of factor activity; some may have near normal levels and do not show any bleeding tendencies, while some may have less than the predicted 50% reduction and may bleed more often than non-carrier females.''In severe hemophilia, bleeding episodes usually begin within the first 2 years of life. Heavy bleeding after ''circumcision'' in males is sometimes the first sign of the condition. Symptoms may develop later in those with moderate or mild disease. The bleeding of hemophilia can occur anywhere in the body. Common sites for bleeding are the joints, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. Specific sites and types of bleeding are discussed below.'   Hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joints) is characteristic of hemophilia. The knees and ankles are most often affected. The bleeding causes distension of the joint spaces, significant pain, and over time, can be disfiguring. Over time, joint destruction occurs, and joint replacement surgeries can be required. Bleeding into the muscles may occur with hematoma formation (compartment syndrome). Bleeding from the mouth or nosebleeds may occur. Bleeding after dental procedures is common, and oozing of blood from the gums may occur in young children when new teeth are erupting. Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract can lead to blood in the stool. Bleeding from the urinary tract can lead to blood in the urine (hematuria). Intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain or skull) can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or lethargy, and can lead to death. Increased bleeding after surgery or trauma is characteristic of hemophilia."
How is hemophilia diagnosed?,"'The majority of patients with hemophilia have a known family history of the condition. However, about one-third of cases occur in the absence of a known family history. Most of these cases without a family history arise due to a spontaneous mutation in the affected gene. Other cases may be due to the affected gene being passed through a long line of female carriers.''If there is no known family history of hemophilia, a series of blood tests can identify which part or protein factor of the blood clotting mechanism is defective if an individual has abnormal bleeding episodes.''The platelet (a blood particle essential for the clotting process) count and bleeding time test should be measured as well as two indices of blood clotting, the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). A normal ''platelet count'', normal PT, and a prolonged aPTT are characteristic of hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Specific tests for the blood clotting factors can then be performed to measure factor VII or factor IX levels and confirm the diagnosis.''Genetic testing to identify and characterize the specific mutations responsible for hemophilia is also available in specialized laboratories.'  "
Is it possible to know if you are a carrier of hemophilia?,"'Since men with the genetic mutation will have hemophilia, a man who does not have the condition cannot be a carrier of the disease. A woman who has a son with known hemophilia is termed an obligate carrier, and no testing is needed to establish that she is a carrier of hemophilia. ''Women whose carrier status is unknown can be evaluated either by testing for the clotting factors or by methods to characterize the mutation in the DNA. The DNA screening methods are generally the most reliable. ''Prenatal diagnosis'' is also possible with DNA-based tests performed on a sample obtained through ''amniocentesis'' or ''chorionic villus sampling''. Most individuals are seen and tested by consultants who specialize in genetically linked diseases.' "
What are treatments for hemophilia?,"'The mainstay of treatment is replacement of the blood clotting factors. Clotting factor concentrates can be purified from human donor blood or made in the laboratory using methods that do not use donor blood. This type of therapy is known as replacement therapy. Clotting factor replacement therapy is carried out by infusing the clotting factor concentrates into a vein, much like a ''blood transfusion''. This type of therapy can be administered at home with proper instruction and training.''Depending upon the severity of the condition, replacement therapy of the deficient clotting factor may be carried out on an as-needed basis (called demand therapy) or on a regular basis to prevent bleeding episodes (known as prophylactic therapy).''People who have mild cases of hemophilia A are sometimes treated with the drug desmopressin, also known as ''DDAVP''. This drug stimulates release of substances from platelets that help form the platelet plug. It is administered either slowly through the intravenous route (IV) or, occasionally, in nasal spray form.''Pain'' relievers may be prescribed for symptom relief, but ''pain'' relievers other than ''aspirin'' or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''naproxen'', ''ibuprofen'') must be used, since these types of ''drugs'"" further inhibit the blood's ability to clot. ""'Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others) is often given for ''pain'' relief.'  "
Inhibitors,"'A major complication of treatment is the development of so-called inhibitors to the clotting factors. Inhibitors (antibodies) are produced because the body sees the factor concentrates used to treat patients to reduce or prevent bleeding, as foreign and activates an immune response in the patient to destroy the foreign substances (factor VIII or factor IX).''Inhibitors to factor VIII are the most common and occur in about one-third of those with severe hemophilia A and about 1 out of every 50 people with mild or moderate hemophilia A. They typically develop in childhood in those with severe hemophilia A and later in life in milder cases. Inhibitors destroy both the replacement factor VIII concentrates as well as any factor VIII that is present in the body. This is a serious complication of treatment because the factor concentrates are no longer effective in treating the condition. The action of inhibitors to destroy factor VIII concentrates shows different degrees of severity among individuals and can even vary over time in the same individual.''In about two-thirds of cases, the inhibitors disappear on their own or with treatment known as immune tolerance therapy (ITT) or immune tolerance induction (ITI). In cases of severe hemophilia A with persistence of inhibitors, other factor concentrates, such as activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa, are administered to attempt to help control bleeding.''The development of inhibitors to factor IX is much less common and occurs in about 1% of those with hemophilia B. However, these can cause a very serious ''allergic reaction'' when factor IX concentrates are given. Immune tolerance therapy to eliminate inhibitors is less successful than with hemophilia A.' "
Infections,"'Blood-borne infections, such as the ''HIV'' virus and ''hepatitis B'' and C, were a major complication of treatment for hemophilia during the 1980s. These infections were transmitted through the factor concentrates and other blood products that were used to treat hemophilia. The use of large blood donor pools to prepare factor concentrates and the lack of specific tests for infectious agents both contributed to the contamination of blood products used to treat hemophilia. By 1985, about 90% of people with severe hemophilia were infected with the ''HIV'' virus, and about half of all people with hemophilia were ''HIV''-positive. Today, improved screening and manufacturing practices including virus removing techniques as well as the development of recombinant factors have essentially eliminated this tragic complication of treatment.' "
Can hemophilia be prevented?,"'Hemophilia is a genetic (inherited) disease and cannot be prevented. ''Genetic counseling'', identification of carriers through molecular genetic testing, and ''prenatal'' diagnosis are available to help individuals understand their risk of having a child with hemophilia.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) for hemophilia?,"'Before factor concentrates were developed, those with hemophilia had a significantly decreased life expectancy. Life expectancy before the 1960s for those with severe hemophilia was limited to 11 years. Currently, the mortality (death) rate for males with hemophilia is twice that of healthy males. As mentioned before, the increase in ''HIV'' and ''hepatitis'' infections associated with therapy during the 1980s led to a corresponding increase in death rates.''Currently, prompt and adequate treatment can greatly reduce the risks of life-threatening bleeding episodes and the severity of long-term damage to joints, but joint deterioration remains a chronic complication of hemophilia.' "
What are possible future treatments for hemophilia?,"'Multiple trials and studies are underway to examine the possibility to use gene therapy to replace the defective genes in hemophilia. To date, stable and sustained production of the deficient clotting factors has not been achieved in humans, but this is an area of active investigation that holds great promise for the future.' "
What is colic? What causes colic in babies?,"'Physicians have recognized infantile colic for a long time. In 1954, Dr. Morris Wessel, a well-known New Haven pediatrician, defined an infant with colic as ""one who, otherwise healthy and well-fed, had paroxysms of irritability, fussing, or crying without an obvious cause lasting for a total of three hours a day and occurring on more than three days in any one week for a period of three weeks."" The only modification (Rome IV criteria) of this original ""Rule of Three\'s"" is the notation that colic duration is now ""one or more weeks."" It is also important to remember that not all fussy ''babies'' suffer from colic. Most infants normally cry two to three hours per day, but the crying spreads out during the 24-hour period.' "
What are colic symptoms and signs in babies?,"""The crying or fussing most frequently begins suddenly and often after a feeding. The cry is loud, high pitched, and continuous, and the spells last from one to four hours. The baby's face often gets flushed or red. The belly is sometimes distended or prominent, the legs alternating between flexed and extended straight out; the ""'feet'' are often ''cold'' and the hands clenched. The episodes, while they can occur at any time of the day or night, typically begin in the late afternoon or early evening, just when parents or caregivers are most exhausted. There are some babies who are more prone to infantile colic than others. If one or both parents were colicky, their baby is more at risk. Infantile colic typically begins at about 2 to 3 weeks of age, reaches its peak at 2 months, begins to subside by 3 months, and is gone by 3½ to 4 months of age. But the frustrating fact remains that although many babies experience colic and much research has been done on the topic, there is no one proven cause of colic. Some studies found no discernible cause for one-quarter of those babies who suffered from colicky episodes. This reality is very frustrating for most parents.''There are factors that may worsen the ''colic symptoms'' amongst all colicky babies:' Overfeeding in an attempt to lessen the crying Feeding certain foods, especially those with high sugar content (for example, undiluted juices), may increase the amount of gas in the intestine and worsen the situation The presence of excessive anger, anxiety, fear, or excitement in the household A multitude of other factors yet unknown"
What remedies can help babies with colic?,"'This is a very common problem (up to 40% of all babies suffer from colic). Discuss any concerns with the child\'s pediatrician and talk to other parents or relatives who have had similar experiences. Also keep in mind that colic generally occurs in big, healthy, active, vigorous babies who are great eaters and who grow very well. Sickly, poor-feeding, unhealthy babies or babies with significant underlying problems may well be cranky, miserable, and unhappy; however, these infants tend to be this way most of the time, whereas the baby with colic generally has episodes at a very predictable (""set your clock by the beginning and end"") time of the day.''Here are some suggestions:'   Do not overfeed! Stick to the baby's regular feeding schedule of timing and amount of milk taken, as measured in ounces in the bottle-fed baby or in minutes on the breast in the breastfed baby. Breastfeeding mothers should avoid too many milk products (""you don't have to drink milk to make milk""), caffeine, onions, cabbage, beans, broccoli, and other gas-producing, irritating foods. Be sure that if the baby is taking juices, that they are very diluted, or just offer plain water. If babies are really thirsty, they will drink it. Avoid juices (young infants should not be drinking juice anyway). In the formula-fed baby, try changing to a formula containing whey hydrolysate (such as Good Start) or try a low-allergy formula (such as Nutramigen, Alimentum, or Pregestimil). Some research suggests that making these changes can result in a decrease in the number of episodes and duration of symptoms in some infants. It is worth the expense of a week's trial to see if the formula is at all contributing to the colic. Consider the use of a pacifier. Babies naturally have a strong sucking reflex. The non-nutritive sucking associated with pacifier use calms some babies. Other calming techniques might include infant massage, a warm bath, or a warm washcloth applied to the tummy. Take a break! When the anxiety, fear, and tension get to be too much (or perhaps an hour before!), try to have someone else watch the baby, even for an hour, and leave the house. Try to keep a positive attitude. Try walking the baby in a front-pouch-style carrier with his legs drawn up and pressure off his belly. Though there is no clear evidence that physical stimulation helps, many parents swear by it. Rhythmic, steady movements, like rocking gently or by use of ""white noise"" sounds, like running the vacuum, or having the clothes dryer within earshot soothe some babies. (Never leave a baby unattended near the dryer, as there is a serious risk of injury.) Wrap the baby firmly in a comfortable blanket (""swaddling""). Medications, such as simethicone (Phazyme, Flatulex, Mylicon, Gas-X, Mylanta Gas), and other homeopathic treatments have not conclusively proven to be more effective than placebo (sugar pill) and should be avoided unless prescribed by the infant's medical provider. Hyoscyamine (Levsin), an antispasmodic medication used to treat adults with various intestinal ailments, has been associated with serious side effects in young infants. Be cautious with herbal remedies. Although there are some who recommend chamomile, fennel and others, there is little evidence that these treatments cure colic. Try to avoid using gripe water, unless recommended specifically by the pediatrician, because there are often unregulated ingredients (alcohol, etc.) that may be harmful to the infant. Recently, there have been some interesting results using certain probiotics (dietary supplements containing live bacteria or yeast and used to aid digestion). Systematic reviews of research trials examining the use of Lactobacillus reuteri have shown reduced crying intervals among both breastfed and formula-fed infants. While not a cure for colic, probiotics may be helpful for some infants. It is important to discuss these options with a health care professional prior to using them."
"What can the doctor do to help a colicky baby? What is the treatment for colic 
in an infant?","'It is critically important to consult the baby\'s doctor at the very beginning of the suspected colic symptoms. While there are no tests that doctors can perform where the results come back ""colic,"" it is very important to exclude several other causes of crying or sudden-onset screaming in a newborn. Remember that other less serious causes of crying include anything that causes discomfort. Check if the infant is hungry, too cold or too warm, over-tired or suffering from food intolerance (gassy, overly ''loose stool'' that may be a sign of lactose or milk protein intolerance). Other more serious medical conditions to consider include intestinal blockage or obstruction, abdominal infection, a ''hernia'"", a scratch of the baby's eye, an ""'ear infection'', a ''bladder infection'', hair or ''fiber'"" wrapped around fingers or toes, and others. Once the baby receives a clean bill of health, an understanding, supportive doctor is worth his/her weight in gold! Should a colicky baby's symptoms ever suddenly change, the doctor will reassess the situation and look for unrelated problems that can arise in any baby. As discussed above, the doctor may recommend an ""'over-the-counter'' anti-gas bubble medicine for the baby (for example, simethicone or Mylicon Drops) or even a ''probiotic''. Babies take these medications orally. When it seems that there are as many home remedies or ""cures"" for colic as there are grandparents, always call the baby\'s doctor first. Finally, remember that after the three or four months, the colic resolves; there are no long-term problems associated with colic.'  "
"Which is better, breastfeeding or formula-feeding?","'Human milk'' is the preferred feeding for all infants. With rare exceptions, this includes premature and sick newborns, as well. Pediatricians generally advise that full-term, healthy infants exclusively breastfeed when possible for the first 12 months of life and, thereafter, for as long as mutually desired. Advantages of ''breastfeeding'' include''Some parents choose ''formula-feeding'' either because of personal preference or because medical conditions of either the mother or the infant make breastfeeding ill-advised. Parents need not feel guilty for choosing formula-feeding. Infant formulas are a time-tested, perfectly acceptable alternative to breastfeeding. Even though ''formula-fed'' ''babies'' do not receive infection-fighting antibodies from the breast milk, they still will have received a four- to six-month supply of these antibodies via placental blood flow prior to delivery. Remember also that the majority of breastfeeding infants end up on a combination of breast- and formula-feedings before their first birthday.''Some common reasons for choosing formula-feeding include:'  breast milk is nutritionally sound and easy to digest; breastfeeding is believed to enhance a close mother-child relationship; breast milk contains infection-fighting antibodies (immunoglobulins) that may reduce the frequency of diarrhea, gastroenteritis, otitis media (ear infections), and other respiratory infections in the infant; and breast milk leads to cost savings and is convenient. There is an inadequate supply of maternal breast milk. The baby is sucking inefficiently. Parents are unable to quantify the amount of breast milk received by the baby. Some parents want to know exactly how much their baby is receiving at each feeding, and formula/bottle-feeding allows exact measurement. A significant reason for not breastfeeding is concern about transferring certain drugs the mother is taking through the breast milk to the infant. Examples of medications that are considered unsafe for the baby include cimetidine (Tagamet), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), lithium (Lithobid), gold salts, methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), metronidazole (Flagyl), cyclosporine, and bromocriptine (Parlodel). Cancer chemotherapy agents are generally also contraindicated. Numerous other medications have not yet been adequately studied in the context of breastfeeding and the possible effects on the baby. Mothers taking medications may choose bottle-feeding rather than risk any potential effect on the baby. An increasing number of mothers must return to work shortly after their baby's delivery. Formula-feeding offers a practical alternative for mothers who may not be able to breastfeed due to work schedules. Formula-fed babies often need to eat less frequently than do breastfed babies because breast milk moves through the digestive system more quickly. Thus, breastfed babies may become hungry more frequently. A benefit of bottle-feeding is that the entire family can immediately become intimately involved in all aspects of the baby's care, including feedings. The mother can therefore get more rest, which can be critically important, especially if the pregnancy and/or delivery were especially difficult."
"What is in an infant formula, and how do I choose the right one?","'This article is designed to review the various types of infant formulas and the nutritional basis for choosing one formula type over another. This information can help ""demystify"" the numerous choices available to a parent when considering options at the pharmacy or grocery store. A small percentage of ''newborn'"" infants will require a specialized formula (for example, premature infants, infants with metabolic diseases, or infants with intestinal malformations). These children's unique dietary requirements should be an item of individual discussion between the parents and the infant's pediatrician and will not be addressed here.""'In order to achieve appropriate growth and maintain good health, infant formulas must include proper amounts of water, carbohydrate, protein, fat, ''vitamins'', and ''minerals''. Each of these components is discussed below. The three major classes of infant formulas are as follows:'""Water is an important part of a baby's ""'diet'"" because water makes up a large proportion of the baby's body. When properly prepared, all infant formulas are approximately 85% water.""'Infant formulas are available in three forms: liquid ready-to-use, liquid concentrate, and powder concentrate. Liquid ready-to-use formulas do not require the addition of water, while the liquid and powder concentrates require the addition of water.'""It is of prime importance for parents to read, understand, and follow the manufacturer's directions when adding water to liquid and powder concentrates. Adding too much water to these concentrates or adding water to ready-to-use formulas can lead to water intoxication in the baby. In severe cases, water intoxication can cause ""'low blood sodium'' levels, irritability, ''coma'', and even permanent ''brain damage''. Conversely, failing to adequately dilute the concentrates with water causes formulas to be too concentrated, or ""hypertonic."" Hypertonic formulas can induce ''diarrhea'' and ''dehydration''. In extreme cases, ingestion of overly hypertonic formulas can lead to ''kidney failure'', ''gangrene'' of the legs, and ''coma''. Therefore, parents should not adjust the amount of water that is added to concentrates to either ""fatten the baby up"" or ""put the baby on a diet."" Instead, parents should discuss their concerns regarding the baby\'s calorie intake with his/her pediatrician.''Carbohydrates (glucose, lactose, sucrose, galactose, etc.) are sugars or several sugars linked together. Carbohydrates provide energy (calories) for the brain, muscles, and other organs. Lactose is a carbohydrate consisting of glucose linked to galactose. Lactose is the major carbohydrate in human breast milk, cow milk, and in most milk-based infant formulas.''While most infants will thrive on a formula that contains lactose, some infants are lactose intolerant. ''Lactose intolerance'' is due to a lactase enzyme deficiency (low levels of enzyme activity) in the small intestine. Lactase enzymes are necessary for ""digesting"" lactose by breaking the link between glucose and galactose. The ''intestines'' can then absorb the smaller glucose and galactose molecules. In infants who are lactase deficient, the undigested lactose cannot be absorbed. This, in turn, can cause ''diarrhea'', ''cramps'', ''bloating'', ''vomiting'', and ''gas''. ''Lactase deficiency'' is more common in premature infants than in full-term babies. Lactase deficiency can also develop temporarily during recovery from viral gastroenteritis (commonly referred to as the ""''stomach flu''""). Finally, lactase deficiency can be ''inherited'' (rarely).''For infants with lactose intolerance, formulas that contain no lactose can be used. Lactofree is an example of a milk-based formula that contains ''corn''-syrup solids rather than lactose as its carbohydrate calorie source. Many soy-protein formulas also do not contain lactose and are suitable for lactose-intolerant infants. In addition to ''corn''-syrup solids, other examples of carbohydrates contained in lactose-free formulas include sucrose (table ''sugar''), tapioca starch, modified cornstarch, and glucose polymers (short chains of glucose molecules).'""Proteins contain different amino acids that are linked together. Proteins provide both calories and the amino-acid building blocks that are necessary for proper growth. The protein in human milk provides between 10%-15% of an infant's daily caloric need. Casein and whey are the two major proteins of human milk and most milk-based formulas. (Immunoglobulins, a type of protein unique to breast milk, provide infection-fighting immunity and are not considered as a nutritional source and are not efficiently metabolized.) While formulas from different manufacturers may vary slightly in the relative proportion of these two proteins, healthy babies generally thrive on any milk-based formula brand.""'Some infants have a true ''allergy'' to the cow proteins that are in milk-based formulas. Infants with true ''cow milk allergy'' can develop ''abdominal pain'', diarrhea, ''rectal bleeding'', skin ''rash'', and ''wheezing'' when given milk-based formulas. These symptoms will disappear as soon milk-based formula is removed from the diet. ''Allergy'' to cow-milk protein is different from lactose intolerance. Treatment of cow-milk-protein ''allergy'' involves using formulas that contain no cow milk or using formulas that contain ""predigested"" casein and whey proteins. The predigesting process breaks the whole proteins into smaller pieces or into amino acids. The amino acids and smaller protein pieces are hypoallergenic (do not cause allergy).''Soy-protein formulas contain no cow milk and are reasonable alternatives for infants with true cow-''milk allergy''. Since most soy-protein formulas also contain no lactose, they are also suitable for infants with lactose intolerance. The carbohydrates in soy-protein formulas are sucrose, corn-syrup solids, and cornstarch or glucose polymers.''Certain infants have allergy to both cow-milk proteins and soy proteins. These infants require a formula in which the cow-milk protein (casein) has been ""predigested"" and specific amino acids added to provide a formula that can provide proper ''nutrition'"". The decision to utilize one of these specialized formulas should be made in consultation with the infant's pediatrician.""'Fat in human milk and formula provides a significant percentage of the total daily caloric needs for a growing infant. Formula manufacturers utilize many different vegetable oils for fat, including corn, soy, safflower, and coconut oils. Some formulas contain ""predigested"" ''fats'' known as medium chain ''triglycerides'' (MCT). These are analogous to the ""predigested proteins"" discussed above. Because of their unique application, formulas containing MCT are not routinely recommended for healthy infants and children.''There is a significant amount of research into determining the ideal concentration and ratios of fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) for infant ''nutrition'"". Some studies have suggested that these may have a positive effect on short-term cognitive function and possibly early visual acuity. More research is needed to clarify this issue, and you should discuss this with your infant's pediatrician before supplementing.""'Vitamins are organic substances that are essential in minute quantities for the proper growth, maintenance, and functioning of the baby. Vitamins must be obtained from food because the body cannot produce them. The exception is ''vitamin D'', which can be produced by the skin when it is exposed to the sun. All exclusively breastfed babies and infants consuming less than 32 oz/day of formula will not receive enough ''vitamin D'' precursor and thus should receive a daily ''vitamin D'' supplement. There are four fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and several water-soluble vitamins. These include the B vitamins, B1 (''thiamine''), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (''niacin''), B6 (''pyridoxine''), and B12 (cobalamin), as well as folate and ''vitamin C'' and pantothenic acid, and biotin. These vitamins have been added to infant formulas to ensure proper nutrition. Unless otherwise directed by their pediatricians, routine vitamin supplementation is not necessary for healthy full-term infants taking formulas.''High doses of certain vitamins can have adverse effects. For example, high doses of ''vitamin A'' can cause ''headaches'', ''vomiting'', ''liver'' damage, brain swelling, and bone abnormalities. High doses of vitamin D can lead to high levels of calcium in the blood and kidney and ''heart'' damage. Therefore, high doses of vitamins should not be given to infants and young children without supervision by their pediatricians.''Minerals (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, ''iodine'', copper, and zinc) and trace elements (manganese, chromium, selenium, and molybdenum) are included in most formulas. Therefore, there is no evidence that mineral supplementation is necessary for healthy formula-fed, full-term infants.''All parents desire to provide the best possible nutrition for their infant. As such, some parents prefer organic and non-GMO formulas. This is an individual decision, but there is little science to support these types in lieu of traditional formula choices. Similarly, some parents believe incorrectly that goat milk is an appropriate source of human (infant, children, and adult) nutrition. Unfortunately, goat milk is deficient in iron, folate, vitamins C and D, thiamine (vitamin B-1), niacin (vitamin B-3), ''vitamin B-6'', and pantothenic acid. Goat milk may also ''stress'"" a newborn's kidneys, resulting in metabolic acidosis.""   Milk-based formulas are prepared from cow milk with added vegetable oils, vitamins, minerals, and iron. These formulas are suitable for most healthy full-term infants and should be the feeding of choice when breastfeeding is not used, or is stopped before 1 year of age. Soy-based formulas are made from soy protein with added vegetable oils (for fat calories) and corn syrup and/or sucrose (for carbohydrate). These formulas are suitable for infants who cannot tolerate the lactose (lactose intolerant, see below) in most milk-based formulas or who are allergic to the whole protein in cow milk and milk-based formulas. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of soy formulas for the above infants as well as for infants of parents seeking a vegetarian-based diet for a term infant. These formulas are not recommended for low-birth-weight or preterm infants or for the prevention of colic or allergies. There are special formulas for low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, low-sodium formulas for infants that need to restrict salt intake, and ""predigested"" protein formulas for infants who cannot tolerate or are allergic to the whole proteins (casein and whey) in cow milk and milk-based formulas."
"So, what types of formula should parents give to their babies?"," Most infants and children will thrive on a cow-milk-based, lactose-containing formula such as Similac (Abbott Nutrition), Enfamil (Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals), or Good Start (Nestle). There are a number of smaller companies that produce routine application formulas that may be sold at larger stores as well as a number of big box stores (for example, Costco) that market their own proprietary formulas. Some infants may be lactose intolerant (not allergic) and will better tolerate a lactose-free milk-based formula such as Enfamil Lactofree (Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals) or Similac Lactose-Free (Abbott Nutrition). For children who are recovering from infectious diarrhea and gastroenteritis, the short-term use of lactose-free formulas may help decrease cramps and diarrhea. This should only be a temporary change, and reintroduction to standard formulas is recommended. Some parents of lactose-intolerant infants may prefer to use soy-protein-based formulas such as Isomil (Abbott Nutrition), Prosobee (Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals), and Allsoy (Nestle). Infants who are allergic to cow-milk protein can also use soy-based formulas. For infants who are allergic to cow-milk protein and soy protein, the ""predigested"" protein formulas including Pregestimil (Mead Johnson), Nutramigen (Mead Johnson), and Alimentum (Abbott Nutrition) can be used. Unique medical conditions may require a specific formula recommendation by the pediatrician. This applies to children with some common genetic deficiencies such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and for premature and low-birth-weight infants. Generic infant formulas are also available and are often made by the same manufacturers that produce the brand name products. Whether you are considering brand name or generic products, check the expiration dates on the packages, and compare ingredient lists to be sure you are purchasing products with the same ingredients. Homemade infant formulas are not recommended."
Can I make my own infant formula?,"""The U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend against homemade infant formulas. This is due to the fact that these formulas do not meet all of an infant's nutritional needs. In addition, cow-milk protein that has not been cooked or processed appropriately is difficult for an infant to digest and may damage an infant's immature kidneys and/or intestines, causing ""'anemia'"" from bleeding into the bowel movements. Today's ""'infant formula'' is a very controlled, state-of-the-art product that cannot be duplicated at home.' "
Introduction to lumbar spinal fusion,"'The lumbar spine is the lower portion of the spine found at the center of the curve of the low back, below the rib cage. This area can be a common source of pain. ''Low back pain'' is the second most common reason for visits to the family physician, behind the ''common cold''. As people become older, various changes occur in the lumbar spine that can cause pain. In most cases these changes are due to normal ''degenerative arthritis'' (wear of cartilage over time). The physician must also rule out other more serious conditions including ''tumor'', infection, ''scoliosis'' (curvature of the spine), ''spondylolisthesis'' (slippage of one spinal bone on another), or ''fracture''.''Fortunately, most patients with ''low back pain'' will have improvement in their symptoms regardless of treatment within six weeks. During that time the physician has various treatment options including medications, physical therapy, or injections that can help ease the symptoms. Some of those patients that do not improve after six to 12 weeks may be candidates for surgery. The spine surgeon has different types of surgical options available based on the specific cause of pain. ' "
What is lumbar spinal fusion?,"'Lumbar spinal fusion is an operation that causes the vertebrae (bones of the spine) in the lower back to grow together. The goal of the lumbar fusion is to have the two vertebrae fuse (grow solidly together) so that there is no longer any motion between them. Removing the intervertebral disc (cushion between the bones) or ''bone spurs'' can reduce some of the pressure on the nerves, helping to reduce pain. Additionally, by fusing the two vertebrae together, this may stop the formation of bone spurs at that location, further reducing pain and potential nerve injury. ''There are many different specific techniques to try to fuse the vertebrae together. The surgery can be performed either through an incision in the back, the abdomen, or a combination of both. In many cases metal screws and rods are placed from the back into the bones to hold them in position while the fusion occurs. During an interbody fusion, the surgeon removes the intervertebral disc and places either a bone graft or a metal or ''plastic'' cage, or a combination of these in its place. The decision on what type of fusion is best for each patient is based on their specific complaints and the cause of symptoms. Spinal fusion can be very effective in the properly selected patient.'  "
What is minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'Minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion is similar to traditional lumbar spinal fusion, but it uses smaller incisions and causes less damage to the surrounding tissues during surgery.''As with traditional lumbar spinal fusion, there are many specific techniques available to try to fuse the vertebrae together using minimally invasive techniques. This can be done through the abdomen, from the back, from the side, or with any combination of these.''Minimally invasive lumbar fusion through the abdomen uses four small incisions, approximately ½ inch in length. A ''fiber'' optic viewing camera is used, similar to other minimally invasive procedures including laparoscopic gallbladder or ''appendix'' removal.''Fusion with screws and rods can be performed through the back using several 1-2 inch incisions. In these cases a series of increasingly larger dilators (hollow tubes with solid inserts) are inserted through the incisions to help spread the muscles apart. Once the muscles have been moved away, the screws and rods can be placed through the dilator tubes. In some cases an operating microscope is used to help the surgeon see more clearly.'""One of the most recent advances in minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion is the ability to perform fusion surgery through the patient's side. There are several techniques that allow the surgeon to make a small incision, approximately 2 inches in the patient's side, directly over the planned fusion site. The muscles are then carefully moved aside, and a series of increasing larger dilators are inserted down to the lumbar spine. Specialized instruments can then be used through the dilator tube to remove the intervertebral disc and place a bone graft or metal or plastic spacer in its place. This technique is typically combined with a procedure from the back to place rods and screws for additional support."" "
What are the advantages of minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'The major advantage of all of these minimally invasive techniques is that there is less damage caused to the surrounding tissues. Unfortunately, in traditional spinal surgery it is necessary to cut through muscles and move them out of the way in order to reach the spine. This can cause a large amount of pain following surgery, and it can lengthen the recovery time. Instead of cutting and moving muscles, the minimally invasive techniques can more gently spread through the muscles to allow access to the spine. This is much less painful for the patient, and it does not require as long of a recovery period for the muscle to heal.''Another benefit of less muscle damage is less blood loss and thus a reduced need for blood transfusions using the minimally invasive techniques. There is often less need for narcotic pain medications following this form of surgery, and a shorter hospital stay.' "
What is the disadvantage of minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'As with any new technique, one of the major disadvantages is the additional time needed to perform the procedure. While a surgeon may be very comfortable with the traditional surgical fusion techniques, it will take time to be able to achieve the same outcome using these new methods. Surgeons with more experience can now perform lumbar spinal fusion in equal or even less time than with the traditional techniques.''Not all surgeons perform these techniques, so it may not be available from your current surgeon or in your area. Because this is a relatively new technique, many insurance companies consider this to be an investigational surgery and do not provide insurance coverage for it, so a patient should check with the insurer prior to surgery regarding coverage.'  "
How effective is minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'The results for the minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion through the abdomen have not been as good as the traditional open anterior (from the front of the spine) fusion techniques. The success of the fusion has been less reliable, the operative times are longer and there are increased risks of injury to the nerves using the minimally invasive techniques. Because of this, many surgeons have stopped using this technique.''The results of the minimally invasive procedures through the back have been much more promising. Experienced surgeons are able to perform lumbar spinal fusion through the back quicker, with similar fusion rates, less blood loss, and quicker recovery times than using traditional techniques. '""The newer minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion techniques though the patient's side are still being refined. The initial techniques had some increased risk of damage to nerves, but more recent changes have made these even safer and more effective. The results so far are very promising for this technique, but there have been a limited number of studies. Additionally, since this was only recently developed, there are fewer surgeons performing this technique."" "
Am I a candidate for minimally lumbar invasive spinal fusion?,"'First, you and your doctor need to determine if you are a candidate for spinal fusion. Remember, the majority of patients with ''low back pain'' recover within six weeks regardless of treatment. If you have had prolonged symptoms you should see your physician. If it is decided you may need surgery you will be referred to a spinal surgeon for further evaluation. If a fusion is thought to be potentially beneficial for you, the option of minimally invasive techniques can then be discussed with your surgeon.' "
What is multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is a disease that causes ''demyelination'"" of the brain and spinal cord, or a loss of the protective covering around nerve fibers called axons. When this occurs, the axons (the parts of the nerve cells that transmit impulses to other cells) don't work well. As more areas are affected by the loss of myelin, different symptoms develop. The specific symptoms seen in ""'MS'' are related to the area of injury in the brain or spinal cord. Patients might experience or describe numbness, tingling, or ''weakness''. The weakness might be mild or severe enough to cause ''paralysis'' of one side of the body. In some cases, patients may develop loss of control of their bladder or an inability to empty their bladder. As ''MS'' progresses, some patients are left with muscle ''spasticity'', which is an involuntary painful contraction of some muscles. '  "
What is spasticity?,"'Spasticity is a condition in which muscles are exhibiting almost constant contracture or activity, leading to loss of range of motion, decreased function, and even ''pain''. Spasticity occurs after an area of the brain or spinal cord has been injured, leading to weakness and increased tone. When an arm or leg that is affected by spasticity is moved by a health-care professional, there is involuntary resistance to that movement. Often, this spasticity is made worse when the speed (or velocity) of the movement increases. Spasticity is often seen in association with a brain injury, such as after:' a
	stroke, 
	 traumatic damage to the brain or spinal cord, or 
 in cases of MS."
"What is baclofen, and what are its side effects?","'Baclofen'' is a medication that works in the brain to decrease uninhibited signals that start in an injured area of the brain and cause spasticity. By decreasing these signals, the affected muscle can relax somewhat, and the symptoms of spasticity can be reduced.When taken in pill form baclofen can be effective, but can lead to side effects such as:''These side effects can limit the amount of medication that can be used to decrease the symptoms of spasticity. However, the medication can also be injected around the spinal cord, directly into the cerebral spinal fluid. When used in this way, only small amounts of the medication are needed, and side effects may be reduced. '   sleepiness,  
dizziness, 
	 
nausea, 
	 
headache,

How is an intrathecal baclofen pump used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"""Baclofen can't treat MS itself. However, this medication can be effective in reducing the symptoms associated with severe spasticity caused by MS. "" "
Who is a good candidate for an intrathecal baclofen pump?,"'There are various selection criteria used to determine if someone with MS is a candidate for an intrathecal baclofen pump.'""The primary consideration is the presence of spasticity that interferes with the individual's daily activities or care. ""'If someone with MS has primary weakness, then the intrathecal baclofen pump is not an option. Other considerations include limited response to oral baclofen or intolerable side effects at the doses that are required to control the spasticity as well as a good response to a screening test of intrathecal baclofen administered into the cerebrospinal fluid. Prior to implantation of the pump, there must not be any sign of infection. ' "
How does an intrathecal baclofen pump work?,"'The pump is implanted under the skin and is connected to a catheter (tube) that ends in the spinal fluid. The specific area of placement of the tubing is dependent on each patient and their associated symptoms. The pump has a small reservoir where the medication (baclofen) is placed and is programmed to deliver a specific amount of medication on a regular basis to the cerebrospinal fluid. The exact amount of medication delivered is unique to each patient and can be adjusted based upon symptoms. The programming is initially performed each month after the pump is implanted; once a patient has reached a stable dose, then the pump is checked and refilled every two to three months. ' "
How can I expect to feel after having an intrathecal baclofen pump implanted?,"'Implanting a pump is a surgical procedure, and many patients experience some soreness around the surgical site after the pump is implanted. The pump is typically located in the abdomen, and some patients find that clothing that rubs over the area is uncomfortable. Some surgeons may fill the pump during the implantation, so that it starts working right away, while others wait a short time after the surgery is completed prior to filling the reservoir with medication. Once medication is flowing, benefits may be identified in six to eight hours.' "
"What are the potential risks and side effects of an intrathecal baclofen 
pump?","'As with any surgery, there is a risk of infection around the area of the pump or tubing. If this is seen, the pump and tubing may need to be removed to allow the infection to clear. ' The pump must be assessed and refilled regularly; 
abruptly stopping the baclofen can be dangerous.  Patients who have an intrathecal baclofen pump shouldn't drink alcohol, as this can increase the risk 
of side effects such as sleepiness.  Exposure to heat, such as from a hot tub or 
heating pad, can increase the flow of medication, which could lead to an 
overdose.  Certain types of
	MRI should be avoided, as this could cause problems 
with the pump. "
"How much does a pump cost? Does insurance cover a intrathecal baclofen 
pump?","'Intrathecal baclofen pump therapy is approved by the FDA; as such, most insurance companies pay for this procedure and follow-up care. However, every plan is different, and the amount of coverage may vary. ' "
What is bacterial vaginosis (BV)?,"'Bacterial vaginosis also is referred to as nonspecific ''vaginitis'', is a vaginal condition that can produce vaginal discharge and results from an overgrowth of certain kinds of bacteria in the vagina. In the past, the condition was called ''Gardnerella'' ''vaginitis'', after the bacteria that were thought to cause the condition. However, the newer name, bacterial vaginosis, reflects the fact that there are a number of species of bacteria that naturally live in the vaginal area and may grow to excess, rather than a true infection with foreign bacteria, such as occurs with many sexually-transmitted disease (''STDs'').''The ''Gardnerella ''organism is not the sole type of bacteria causing the symptoms. Other kinds of bacteria that can be involved in bacterial vaginosis are ''Lactobacillus'', Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium'', as well as a number of other types. When these multiple species of bacteria that normally reside in the vagina become unbalanced, a woman can have a vaginal discharge with a foul odor.' "
What are signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis (BV)?,"'Many women with bacterial vaginosis have no signs or symptoms at all. When symptoms do occur, the most common include:''Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, if present, can occur any time in the ''menstrual cycle'', including before, during, or after the ''menstrual period''. The amount of vaginal discharge that is considered normal varies from woman to woman. Therefore, any degree of vaginal discharge that is abnormal for a particular woman should be evaluated.'   An abnormal amount of vaginal discharge The vaginal discharge is thin and grayish white. Vaginal odor (foul-smelling or unpleasant fishy odor) The vaginal discharge and odor are often more noticeable after sexual intercourse. Pain with sexual intercourse or urination (rare symptoms)."
What causes bacterial vaginosis (BV)?,"'Researchers have had difficulty determining exactly what causes bacterial vaginosis. At present, it seems to be that a combination of multiple bacteria must be present together for bacterial vaginosis to develop. Bacterial vaginosis typically features a reduction in the number of the normal hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli in the vagina. Simultaneously, there is an increase in concentration of other types of bacteria, especially anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that grow in the absence of oxygen). As a result, the diagnosis and treatment are not as simple as identifying and eradicating a single type of bacteria. Why the bacteria combine to cause the unbalance is unknown.''Certain risk factors have been identified that increase the chances of developing bacterial vaginosis. These risk factors for BV include:''However, the role of sexual activity in the development of the condition is not fully understood, and although most experts believe that bacterial vaginosis does not occur in women who have not had sexual intercourse, others feel that the condition can still develop in women who have not had sexual intercourse.'   multiple or new sexual partners, IUDs (intrauterine devices) for birth control, recent antibiotic use, vaginal douching, and cigarette smoking."
How common is bacterial vaginosis (BV)? Is it an STD or yeast infection?," Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition. It is the most common vaginal complaint in women of childbearing age. Studies have shown that approximately 29% of women in the U.S. are affected. Bacterial vaginosis is found in about 25% of pregnant women in the U.S. and approximately 60% of women who have an STD. Bacterial vaginosis is not the same thing as an STD or yeast infection. Bacterial vaginosis is not dangerous, but it can cause disturbing symptoms. Any woman with an unusual discharge should be evaluated so that more serious infections such as Chlamydia and gonorrhea can be excluded. Symptoms may also mimic those found in yeast infections of the vagina and trichomoniasis (an STD), and these conditions must also be excluded in women with vaginal symptoms."
Can you get bacterial vaginosis (BV) from a sexual partner?,"'The term ""vaginosis"" refers to a vaginal abnormality; therefore a male cannot ""get"" bacterial vaginosis. However, female sex partners of women with bacterial vaginosis may want to consider being evaluated because it can spread to female partners.' "
Is bacterial vaginosis contagious (BV)?,"'Although'' bacterial vaginosis is not considered to be a ''contagious'' condition'"", the role of transmissibility of bacteria among individuals is not fully understood. Since having multiple or new sexual partners increases a woman's risk of developing bacterial vaginosis, this suggests that spread of bacteria among individuals may alter the balance of bacteria in the vagina and potentially predispose to development of bacterial vaginosis. However, since bacterial vaginosis also occurs in celibate women, other causative factors must also play a role in its development.""'It is not possible to contract bacterial vaginosis from toilet seats, ''swimming'' pools, or hot tubs, or from touching contaminated objects.' "
"Is there a test to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV)? What is the ""whiff test?""","'When a woman notices an unusual vaginal discharge and reports this to her doctor, he or she will ask her a series of routine questions to help distinguish mild from more serious conditions. Additional issues that might indicate the presence of a more serious condition include:''In addition to these questions, the doctor will perform a ''pelvic exam''. During the exam, the doctor notes the appearance of the vaginal lining and cervix. The doctor will also perform a manual exam of the ovaries and uterus. The cervix is examined for tenderness, which might indicate a more serious infection. The doctor may collect samples to check for ''Chlamydia'' or gonorrhea infection.''Examining the vaginal discharge under the microscope can help distinguish bacterial vaginosis from infections such as yeast vaginitis (vaginal ''yeast infection'', ''Candidiasis'') and ''trichomoniasis''. A sign of bacterial vaginosis under the microscope is a vaginal cell called a clue cell. Clue cells are vaginal cells covered with bacteria and are believed to be the most reliable diagnostic sign of bacterial vaginosis. In addition to clue cells, women with bacterial vaginosis have fewer of the normal vaginal bacteria, called ''lactobacilli''. A vaginal pH greater than 4.5 is also suggestive of bacterial vaginosis. Cultures of bacteria are generally not useful in establishing the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis since it is caused by bacteria that are normally present in the vagina.''During the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis the doctor may perform a ""whiff test"" with potassium hydroxide (KOH) liquid. When a drop of KOH testing liquid used in the ""whiff test"" contacts a drop of the discharge from a woman with bacterial vaginosis, a certain fishy odor can result.' fever, pelvic pain, new or multiple sexual partners (especially with unprotected intercourse), and a history of sexually-transmitted infections (STDs)."
Can bacterial vaginosis (BV) be treated and cured with home remedies?,"'There are no home remedies or natural remedies for bacterial vaginosis. Antibiotics are the only treatment. It is important to note that douching (rinsing the interior of the vagina) will not help with BV, and here is no proven medical benefit of douching. In fact, douching may ''flush'' bacteria farther up the genital tract into the uterus or Fallopian tubes, potentially worsening the condition.''Studies of yogurt/lactobacilli ''probiotic'' preparations (either taken orally or applied to the vagina), which are designed to help reestablish the lactobacilli population in the vagina, have not shown consistent results in treating bacterial vaginosis.' "
What medicine treats bacterial vaginosis and reccurent BV? Can antibiotics cure it?,"'Bacterial vaginosis can be cured with antibiotics. Even after a woman has been cured, however, BV often recurs. A second course of antibiotics is necessary if a woman experiences recurrent bacterial vaginosis that produces symptoms.''Antibiotics are the recommended treatment for bacterial vaginosis. A few antibiotic remedies are routinely used and include:''Recurrence of bacterial vaginosis is possible even after successful treatment. More than half of those treated experience recurrent symptoms within 12 months. It is unclear why so many recurrent infections develop. With recurrent symptoms, a second course of antibiotics is generally prescribed.''Treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women is recommended to decrease the risk of pregnancy-associated complications related to infection. Treatment prior to Cesarean delivery, total abdominal ''hysterectomy'', and insertion of an ''IUD'' is also recommended by most experts.' metronidazole (Flagyl) taken by either oral (pill) form or vaginal metronidazole gel (Metrogel). The oral metronidazole can cause some minor but unpleasant side effects, but is believed to be the most effective treatment. The gels do not typically cause side effects, although yeast vaginitis can occur as a side effect of the medication. vaginal clindamycin cream (Cleocin) tinidazole (Tindamax) is an antibiotic that appears to be effective in treating bacterial vaginosis, and may have fewer side effects than metronidazole."
What is the treatment for recurrent BV? How is it treated during pregnancy?,"'While up to 1/3 of cases of bacterial vaginosis may resolve on their own, it is recommended that medical treatment be given if symptoms are present or during pregnancy to avoid the development of complications.''Bacterial vaginosis may recur even after successful treatment. More than half of those treated experience recurrent symptoms within 12 months. It is unclear why so many recurrences develop. With recurrent symptoms, a second course of antibiotics is generally prescribed.\xa0Recurrent bacterial vaginosis may develop in the same woman after she has been treated so it is important to see a doctor if symptoms persist or recur. Up to 50% of women who are treated will develop a recurrence of symptoms in the year following treatment.''Treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women is recommended to decrease the risk of pregnancy-associated complications related to infection. Treatment prior to Cesarean delivery, total abdominal hysterectomy, and insertion of an IUD is also recommended by most experts.''A return visit to your doctor is recommended if the your symptoms do not resolve after treatment with antibiotics or if symptoms return.'

Which types of doctor treats bacterial vaginosis?,"'Bacterial vaginosis is typically managed by a gynecologist. It can also be treated by primary care providers such as family practitioners, internal medicine doctors, and pediatricians.' "
What is the definition of bad breath?,"'The definition of bad breath, or halitosis, is an unpleasant smell coming from the mouth. Halitosis can occur on occasion, or it can be a chronic condition. It may be caused by foods a person eats, poor oral hygiene, diseases, or other factors.' "
What are the causes and health risk factors of bad breath?,"'There are many risk factors and causes for halitosis, and even healthy people have bad breath on occasion. Some common causes of halitosis include the following:'   Food: Food is a primary source of bad odors that come from the mouth. Some foods, such as garlic, onions, spicy foods, exotic spices (such as curry), some cheeses, fish, and acidic beverages such as coffee can leave a lingering smell. Most of the time the odor is short lived. Other foods may get stuck in the teeth, promoting the growth of bacteria and dental plaques, which causes bad breath odor. Low carbohydrate diets may also cause ""ketone breath."" These diets cause the body to burn fat as its energy source. The end-product of making this energy is ketones, which cause a fruity acetone-like odor on the breath when exhaled. This fruity odor in a diabetic might indicate uncontrolled blood sugars. Tobacco products: Smoking and chewing tobacco can leave chemicals that remain in the mouth. Smoking can also precipitate other bad-breath causes such as gum disease or oral cancers. Poor oral health: When a person does not brush or floss his/her teeth regularly, food particles remaining in the mouth can rot and cause bad odors. Poor dental care can lead to a buildup of plaque in the mouth, which causes an odor of its own. Plaque buildup on the teeth can also lead to an unhealthy condition called periodontal (gum) disease. When plaque hardens, it is referred to as tartar (calculus). Tartar holds bacteria that can irritate the gums and lead to gum disease. The mild form of gum disease is called gingivitis; if gingivitis is not treated, it can advance to periodontitis. Health problems: Sinus infections, pneumonia, sore throat (pharyngitis) and other throat infections, the common cold, influenza (flu), tonsil stones (tonsilloliths), thrush, bronchitis, postnasal drip, diabetes, acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD), lactose intolerance, other stomach or digestion problems, and some liver diseases or kidney diseases may be associated with bad breath. Dry mouth: Also called xerostomia, dry mouth can also cause bad breath. Saliva helps moisten and cleanse the mouth, and when the body does not product enough saliva, bad breath may result. Dry mouth may be caused by salivary gland problems, connective tissue disorders (Sjögren's syndrome), medications, or breathing through the mouth. Allergies: Many medications used to treat allergies can cause dry mouth, another cause of halitosis. In addition, post-nasal drip is a common allergy symptom that can result in bad breath. Sinus congestion due to allergies can also cause people to breathe from their mouths, causing dry mouth. Mouth infections: Cavities, gum disease, or impacted teeth may cause bad breath. Dentures or braces: Food particles not properly cleaned from appliances such as braces can rot or cause bacteria and odor. Loose-fitting dentures may cause sores or infections in the mouth, which can cause bad breath. Medications: Many medications, including antihistamines to treat allergies and diuretics, can cause dry mouth (see above), which can cause bad breath. Other medications that may lead to bad breath may include triamterene (Dyrenium) and paraldehyde. ""Morning breath"": Bad breath in the morning is very common. Saliva production nearly stops during sleep, allowing odor-causing bacteria to grow, causing bad breath. Pregnancy: Being pregnant in itself does not cause bad breath, but the nausea and morning sickness common during pregnancy may cause bad breath. In addition, hormonal changes, dehydration, and eating different foods due to cravings may also contribute to bad breath during pregnancy. Other causes of bad breath: Objects stuck in the nose (usually in children), alcoholism, and large doses of vitamin supplements may also cause bad breath."
What signs and symptoms may be associated with bad breath?,"'It is generally simple how to tell if you have bad breath. Others may notice someone has halitosis before the person does, so another person may tell him or her about their bad breath or give them a larger than normal personal space. The most obvious sign or symptom of bad breath is noticing an unpleasant smell coming from the mouth.''Other signs and symptoms of bad breath include' unpleasant or sour taste or changes in taste, dry mouth, and a coating on the tongue."
What health care specialists treat halitosis?,"'The first stop when you have halitosis is usually your dentist. If your dentist determines you have a healthy mouth, you will likely be referred to a physician to look for an underlying health problem.''If you have periodontal disease, you may see a periodontist, a dentist who specializes in gum disease and ''dental implants''.'""If you have braces, it's like that your bad breath is caused by food getting stuck in them. You may see your orthodontist for an adjustment.""'Bad breath in ''babies'"" or young children may be a sign of infection or undiagnosed medical problems. Consult a child's pediatrician or dentist if an infant or young child has bad breath."" "
When should someone see a health care professional about bad breath?,"'If proper oral hygiene does not get rid of bad breath, see a dentist or doctor for a diagnosis if bad breath is accompanied by''Also see a doctor or dentist if bad breath develops after taking a new medication, after recent ''dental surgery'', or any other symptoms develop that are of concern.' persistent dry mouth, sores in the mouth, pain or difficulty with chewing or swallowing, broken teeth or dental pain, white spots on the tonsils, and/or fever or fatigue."
How do health care professionals diagnose halitosis?,"'You have halitosis if you have bad breath, and a doctor is not needed to diagnose the condition. However, if your bad breath is chronic, if it does not go away with proper oral hygiene, or you have other symptoms, you will need to see a doctor or dentist to diagnose the underlying cause.''A doctor or dentist will examine your mouth to look for signs of gum disease, dry mouth, or infections that may be the cause of your bad breath.' "
What are treatment options and home remedies for bad breath? What can be done to prevent bad breath?,"'Treatment of bad breath depends on the cause.''The American Dental Association recommends the following:''Keep the mouth moist by drinking water and chewing sugarless gum or sugar-free hard candy to stimulate the production of saliva. Mouthwash may temporarily mask bad breath odors, but it may not treat the underlying cause.''Natural remedies used in the treatment of bad breath include chewing on mint or parsley.''If bad breath is due to a health problem such as a ''sinus infection'', ''diabetes'', acid reflux (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'', or ''GERD''), etc., then the underlying medical issue needs to be treated.''If bad breath is a side effect of taking a medication, discuss with a health care professional whether there are other options for medication that can be taken. Never stop taking a medication without first consulting your health care professional.''For patients who suffer from dry mouth (xerostomia), artificial saliva may be prescribed by a dentist.'   Brush and floss teeth regularly. Remember to brush the tongue, too, to remove bacteria from its surface. Brushing the tongue can help with bad breath caused by foods a person has eaten. See a dentist regularly for checkups and to ensure dentures or braces are properly fitted and cleaned (and clean dentures thoroughly each night). Quit smoking or using chewing tobacco. Sugarless gum and sugar-free candy can also keep the mouth from drying out. Keep the mouth moist by drinking water and chewing sugarless gum or sugar-free hard candy to stimulate the production of saliva. Eat a diet of foods that need to be thoroughly chewed to keep saliva flowing. Foods that require a lot of chewing, such as apples or carrots, are good options. Over-the-counter mouthwash can help kill bad breath-causing bacteria and may temporarily mask bad breath odors, but it may not treat the underlying cause."
What products can be used to eliminate or mask bad breath?,"'Bad breath that is due to simple causes such as foods may be more easily masked or eliminated than bad breath due to medical conditions, infections, or medication side effects.''There are some things a person can do to eliminate or at least temporarily mask bad breath.'   Good oral hygiene: Brushing the teeth and tongue, and flossing, keeps the mouth healthy and can often get rid of bad breath, at least in the short term. Mouthwash may temporarily mask bad breath and can help with oral hygiene. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugar-free mints may temporarily mask bad breath odor. For more serious cases of bad breath, dentists can prescribe special toothpaste and mouthwash that can improve the symptoms of bad breath."
What is the prognosis for people with halitosis?,"'Most of the time, bad breath can be cured and prevented with proper oral hygiene. It is rarely life-threatening, and the prognosis is good. However, bad breath may be a complication of a medical disorder that needs to be treated.' "
What is cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol is a naturally occurring fat that the body needs to produce important structures and chemicals. It is one of the main components of cell membranes, the outer lining that protects the internal structures that make body cells work and function properly. Cholesterol is also a building block for many of the hormones in the body including mineralocorticoids that control ''electrolyte'' levels in the body, glucocorticoids involved in carbohydrate ''metabolism'', and sex hormones including testosterone, ''estrogen'', and ''progesterone''. Cholesterol is one of the building blocks that assists in forming ''vitamin D'' in the body. ''Vitamin D'' is responsible for calcium ''metabolism'' in the body.''There are two important types of cholesterol, ''high density lipoprotein (HDL)'' and ''low density lipoprotein (LDL)''. LDL is the bad cholesterol that deposits in arteries when too much is present. HDL is considered the good cholesterol because it can bind to ''LDL cholesterol'' and return it to the ''liver'' where it can be removed from the body. ''While most of the cholesterol in the body is obtained through the foods we eat, it is also produced in the ''liver'"" to meet the body's demands. The body attempts to regulate the amount of total cholesterol, but when too much cholesterol is present, the excess can be deposited in arteries throughout the body. This leads to artery narrowing and increases the risk of ""'heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. Elevated LDL levels increase the risk of these diseases, and elevated HDL levels decrease the risk.' "
What does a cholesterol test measure?,"'Cholesterol tests are blood tests that measure the amount of cholesterol in the body. The health-care professional may order only a cholesterol test with results showing:''In addition to cholesterol level, the health-care professional also may order a ''lipid profile'' test. \xa0The ''lipid'' profile test will also measure ''triglyceride levels'' and another fatty substance found in the blood.'   The total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL levels."
How do I prepare for a cholesterol test?,"'For the best and most accurate results, it is important to fast for many hours before the cholesterol blood test is taken. Each laboratory has its own guidelines for not eating, and the fast may range from 9-16 hours. It is acceptable to drink water.' "
Do I need to call my doctor for my test results?,"'It usually takes a day or two from the time the blood is drawn until your health-care professional receives the results of the cholesterol test. Ideally, the health-care professional will contact you with those results and explain their significance. However, if you have not been contacted in a short period of time, it is reasonable to contact your health-care professional and ask for the test results.''There are home cholesterol test kits available that have been U.S. FDA approved, but their accuracy is not necessarily as good as that of a certified laboratory. These tests usually measure total cholesterol only, but some also can measure HDL, LDL and cholesterol. If you use one of the home kits, it is wise to discuss the results with your health-care professional.''The purpose of the cholesterol blood test is to determine whether treatment is needed for ''high cholesterol''. That treatment may include dietary and lifestyle modifications, medications, or both to control ''cholesterol levels'' and decrease the risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and peripheral ''vascular disease''. ' "
How do I interpret my cholesterol test results?,"'Cholesterol levels'' are but one of the risk factors for ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. It is important to control cholesterol levels to minimize risk just as it is important to control ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', and avoid ''smoking''.''Guidelines for cholesterol levels have been developed by many health organizations including the American ''Heart'' Association. It is important to remember that tests may need to be repeated over time to help monitor treatment and disease risk ''prevention''.\xa0' "

What is Balamuthia?,"'Balamuthia mandrillarisis'' a free-living ameba (a single-celled living organism) found in the environment. It is one of the causes of granulomatous amebic ''encephalitis'' (GAE), a serious infection of the brain and spinal cord. ''Balamuthia'' is thought to enter the body when soil containing ''Balamuthia'' comes in contact with skin wounds and ''cuts'', or when dust containing ''Balamuthia'' is breathed in or gets in the mouth. The ''Balamuthia'' amebas can then travel to the brain through the blood stream and cause GAE. GAE is a very rare disease that is usually fatal.''Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) first discovered ''Balamuthia mandrillaris'' in 1986. The ameba was found in the brain of a dead mandrill baboon. After extensive research, ''B. mandrillaris'' was declared a new species of ameba in 1993. Since then, more than 200 cases of ''Balamuthia'' infection have been diagnosed worldwide, with at least 70 cases reported in the United States. Little is known at this time about how a person becomes infected.' "
Where is Balamuthia found?,'Balamuthia'' has been found in dust and soil in many places around the world. It is possible that ''Balamuthia'' may also live in water.' 
How do you get a Balamuthia infection and how is it spread?,"'Balamuthia'' infection is not spread from person to person.''Balamuthia'' is thought to enter the body when soil containing ''Balamuthia'' comes in contact with skin wounds and cuts, or when dust containing ''Balamuthia'' is breathed in or gets in the mouth. Once inside the body, the amebas can travel through the blood stream to the brain, where they cause GAE. There are also a few reports of ''dogs'' that might have become infected after ''swimming'' in ponds.''Balamuthia'' infection can occur at any time of year.' "
What are the symptoms of a Balamuthia infection?,"'The symptoms of ''Balamuthia'' infection can begin with a skin ''wound'' on the face, chest, torso, arms, or legs. If the infection involves the brain, the disease it causes is called granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE). Diagnosis of ''Balamuthia'' GAE can be difficult, but some early symptoms might include:''Other signs of ''Balamuthia'' GAE might include:''The disease might appear mild at first but can become more severe over weeks to several months. Often the disease is fatal, with a death rate of more than 89%. Overall, the outlook for people who get this disease is poor, although early diagnosis and treatment may increase the chances for survival.'  Headaches Stiff neck or head and neck pain with neck movement Sensitivity to light Nausea Vomiting Lethargy (tiredness) Low-grade fever Behavioral changes Seizures Weight loss Partial paralysis Difficulty speaking in full sentences Difficulty walking"
How long after infection do symptoms appear?,'It can take weeks to months to develop the first symptoms of ''Balamuthia'' GAE after initial exposure to the amebas.' 
How long will symptoms last?,"'GAE is chronic and symptoms develop over a period of several weeks to as long as 2 years. Although ''Balamuthia'' GAE is often fatal, there are several recorded cases of ''Balamuthia'' infection where the patients survived after long-term treatment with multiple ''drugs''. In some of those cases, the patients were able to return to normal, functioning lives.' "
Who is most likely to get a Balamuthia infection?,"'Balamuthia'' can infect anyone; this includes persons that are healthy or persons with weakened immune systems (such as persons with ''HIV/AIDS'', ''cancer'', ''liver disease'', ''diabetes mellitus'' and/or persons taking immunosuppressive drugs following organ transplantation).' "
What should I do if I think I may have a Balamuthia infection?,'Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible if you think you may have a ''Balamuthia'' infection.' 
How is a Balamuthia infection diagnosed?,"'Doctors and scientists must use special research tests to identify ''Balamuthia''. These tests are not widely available, but CDC is available to help with testing.' "
What is the treatment for a Balamuthia infection?,"'Currently, treatment recommendations include the use of a combination of several drugs. Most cases of ''Balamuthia'' are diagnosed right before death or after the patient has died. This delay in diagnosis limits the amount of experience doctors have using different drugs to treat ''Balamuthia'' infection. Current treatment plans are based on lab studies of the ameba and the few cases where the patients have survived.' "
Should I be worried about getting Balamuthia from others?,'No. There have been no reports of a ''Balamuthia'' infection spreading from one person to another except through organ donation/transplantation.' 
How can I prevent a Balamuthia infection?,"'Currently, there are no known ways to prevent infection with ''Balamuthia'' since it is unclear how and why some people become infected while others do not. Research is currently underway to learn more about ''Balamuthia'' in hopes of finding ways to prevent future infections.' "
What is balanitis (inflammation of the head of penis)?,"'Balanitis is an inflammation of the skin of the head of penis (glans penis). If the foreskin is involved as well, it is referred to as balanoposthitis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of balanitis? Is it painful?,"'Usually, most common signs and symptoms of balanitis are:''An odorous discharge can accompany these symptoms.'   Redness or mild swelling Iitching Rash Irritation or pain on or around the penis"
What causes balanitis?,"   Balanitis is usually found in uncircumcised males. Poor hygiene can contribute when the area under the foreskin is not washed regularly and bacteria, skin, and sweat accumulate. Some underlying medical conditions can also increase the risk of balanitis, especially diabetes mellitus. Allergies to certain chemicals can cause an allergic balanitis. This could be chemicals in soaps or other products in touch with the glans of the penis. Certain infections (especially yeast infections) can cause a balanitis. Reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter syndrome) is associated with inflammation around the head of the penis (circinate balanitis). Balanitis is not a sexually transmitted disease (STD); however, it can have similar symptoms (for example, itching and redness). "
How is balanitis diagnosed?,"'A health care professional will usually be able to diagnose balanitis based on asking the patient questions (history) and physical examination. No additional tests are usually necessary. If a doctor suspects that the balanitis is caused by an underlying medical condition, the patient might require blood tests.' "
Which medications treat balanitis?,"'First, the underlying cause is determined and the treatment directed against the reason for the condition. If there is an infection, the appropriate antifungal medication can be used. If it is a hygiene issue, daily habits are changed. Young boys may require instruction on how to retract and clean their foreskin.''The optimal medications will depend on the underlying cause of the balanitis. For examples, doctors will prescribe a topical antifungal cream if ''Candida'' infection is present, or an antibiotic if a ''cellulitis'' is suspected. In refractory or repeated situations, the doctor might suggest ''circumcision'' as a possible way to prevent further infections by eliminating the overlying foreskin.'  "
Which home remedies or OTC medications soothe pain and treat balanitis?,"'Switching soaps or other possible offending irritants can be helpful. Other times, the doctor will prescribe oral or topical medications.'  "
What is the prognosis for balanitis? Can it be cured?,'The prognosis of balanitis is generally good.' 
Can balanitis be prevented?,"'The risk of balanitis can be reduced with proper hygiene, but not all balanitis can be prevented depending on the underlying cause. ''Circumcision'' has been advocated as a way of preventing or reducing the risk of balanitis in patients who had multiple episodes.' "
What is balanitis?,"'Balanitis'' is an inflammation of the head of the penis and/or foreskin that surrounds the head of the penis in uncircumcised men. However, not everyone agrees with this definition. For example, some consider balanitis as only inflammation of the penis head while inflammation of the foreskin is ''posthitis'' and when both structures are inflamed, the problem is referred to as ''balanoposthitis''. For the purpose of this article, balanitis will be considered an inflammation of the head of the penis and/or surrounding foreskin.'   Males who are predisposed to developing balanitis include those with:Congestive heart failureNephritisCirrhosisMorbid obesity Congestive heart failure Nephritis Cirrhosis Morbid obesity Males who are more likely to develop balanitis include those:With poor personal hygieneWho are sensitive to chemical irritants (for example, soaps and lubricants)That have drug allergies With poor personal hygiene Who are sensitive to chemical irritants (for example, soaps and lubricants) That have drug allergies Males with diabetes are at increased risk of developing balanitis and diabetes is a very common cause of balanitis. Glucose (sugar) on the skin encourages bacterial and fungal growth, particularly males:With uncontrolled diabetes (people with uncontrolled diabetes have high glucose levels in their urine), andThat have diabetes and take medications that causes more sugar to be excreted in the urine, for example dapagliflozin (Farxiga). With uncontrolled diabetes (people with uncontrolled diabetes have high glucose levels in their urine), and That have diabetes and take medications that causes more sugar to be excreted in the urine, for example dapagliflozin (Farxiga). Balanitis can be a distinct clinical feature in men with reactive arthritis. Balanitis can be caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)."
Is balanitis contagious?,"'The answer to this question is somewhat complex; not a simple yes or no.'   Balanitis caused by the normal skin bacteria on the penis or balanitis caused by a chemical skin irritant is generally considered non-contagious. Balanitis caused by certain fungi (yeast) and/or specific bacteria or viruses (including those that cause STDs such as gonorrhea) is transferable from one person directly to another person. Although the actual disease balanitis usually is not transferred to other males, the organisms causing balanitis may be transferred. Since some of the bacteria, fungi, or viruses that cause balanitis are contagious, balanitis could be considered ""contagious"" under special conditions (such as balanitis caused by STDs)."
How can you tell if you have balanitis? What its symptoms and signs?,"'If the male with whom one has had contact has balanitis caused by chemical or normal skin bacteria, it is unlikely that the disease is contagious. However, there is a significant risk of a person becoming infected if he or she has been exposed to a male who has balanitis caused by specific viruses, bacteria, or fungi such as:''The time required to develop symptoms after exposure (incubation period) differs with the different viruses, bacteria, or fungus. However, the first signs and ''symptoms of balanitis'' are:''Other symptoms may develop, depending upon the transmitted viruses or bacteria. For example, discharge from the urethra, ulcerations, and ''enlarged lymph nodes'' are symptoms that may develop with sexually transmitted diseases. Tests for ''STD'""'s and specific bacteria and viruses can help distinguish balanitis from other diseases that may mimic balanitis like ""'herpes'' and gonorrhea.'   Yeasts Neisseria gonorrhea Chlamydia Treponema Redness Itching Swelling Tenderness of the head of the penis and its surrounding foreskin"
How will I know if I am no longer contagious?,"'If you have, or have had the non-contagious type of balanitis, then you should have no concerns about being contagious. However, if balanitis was due to an infectious bacteria or virus, then you would be noncontagious after the bacteria or virus was ""treated and cured."" Antibiotics and topical creams are used to treat balanitis. The time frame for complete recovery varies according to the nature of the infectious agent.' "
What is the treatment for balanitis? How long does it take to go away?,"'Treatment for common yeast-caused balanitis is topical canesten 1% cream (''clotrimazole'', Lotrimin); recommended treatment time varies from about 2 weeks to 1 month. ''Lotrisone'' (combination of betamethasone and clotrimazole) has also been used.' "
When should you call a doctor for balanitis? Can it be cured?,"'Contact your doctor for any redness, swelling and/or irritation of the penis and/or foreskin. Healthcare professionals can help you with treatment of both noncontagious and contagious causes of balanitis, and determining the cause of the infection. Persistent symptoms of balanitis should be evaluated by a health-care professional.' Complications of balanitis include constriction of the opening of the urethra (phimosis) and severe urinary obstruction. These complications can require emergency treatment. Some with balanitis may require consultation with a urologist. Balanitis caused by bacteria, yeast or other organisms that are resistant to treatment may not be easily cured."
What is balloon angioplasty?,"'Balloon angioplasty'' of the coronary artery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), was introduced in the late 1970s. PTCA is a nonsurgical procedure that relieves narrowing and obstruction of the arteries to the muscle of the heart (coronary arteries). This allows more blood and oxygen to be delivered to the heart muscle. PTCA is now referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, as this term includes the use of balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices. Percutaneous coronary intervention is accomplished with a small balloon catheter inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist, and advanced to the narrowing in the coronary artery. The balloon is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. When successful, percutaneous coronary intervention can relieve ''chest pain'' of ''angina'', improve the prognosis of individuals with unstable angina, and minimize or stop a ''heart attack'' without having the patient undergo open heart ''coronary artery bypass graft'' (''CABG'') surgery.''In addition to the use of simple balloon angioplasty, the availability of stents, in a wire-mesh design, have expanded the spectrum of people suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention, as well as enhanced the safety and long-term results of the procedure. Since the early 1990\'s, more and more patients are treated with stents, which are delivered with a percutaneous coronary intervention balloon, but remain in the artery as a ""scaffold"". This procedure has markedly reduced the numbers of patients needing emergency CABG to below 1%, and particularly with the use of the new ""medicated"" stents (stents coated with medications that help prevent recurrence due to ''scar tissue''), has reduced the rate of recurrence of the blockage in the coronary artery (""restenosis"") to well below 10%. At present, the only patients treated with just balloon angioplasty are those with vessels less than 2mm (the smallest diameter stent), certain types of lesions involving branches of coronary arteries, those with ''scar'' tissue in old stents, or those who cannot take the antiplatelet blood thinners after the procedure.''Various ""atherectomy"" (plaque removal) devices were initially developed as adjuncts to percutaneous coronary intervention. These include''Such devices were initially thought to decrease the incidence of restenosis, but in ''clinical trials'' were shown to be of little additional benefit, and now are only used in selective cases as an adjunct to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (percutaneous artery intervention).' the use of the excimer laser for photoablation of plaque, rotational atherectomy (use of a high-speed diamond-encrusted drill) for mechanical ablation of plaque, and directional atherectomy for cutting and removal of plaque."
What causes a coronary artery disease?,"'Arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscles are called coronary arteries. ''Coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') occurs when cholesterol plaque (a hard, thick substance comprised of varying amounts of cholesterol, calcium, muscle cells, and connective tissue, which accumulates locally in the artery walls) builds up in the walls of these arteries, a process called arteriosclerosis.''The arteriosclerotic process can be accelerated by ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', elevated ''cholesterol levels'', and ''diabetes''. Individuals are also at higher risk for arteriosclerosis if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women) or if they have a positive family history of coronary ''heart disease''.' Over time, arteriosclerosis causes significant narrowing of one or more coronary arteries. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50% to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle during exercise. Lack of oxygen (ischemia) in the heart muscle causes chest pain (angina) in most people. However, some 25% of those with significant coronary artery narrowing experience no chest pain at all despite documented ischemia, or may only develop episodic shortness of breath instead of chest pain. These people are said to have ""silent angina"" and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina. When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90% to 99%, people often have angina at rest (unstable angina). When a blood clot (thrombus) forms on the plaque, the artery may become completely blocked, causing death of a part of the heart muscles (heart attack, or myocardial infarction)."
How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"'The resting ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ECC)'' is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and can show changes indicative of ischemia or heart attack. Often, the EKG in individuals with coronary artery disease is normal at rest, and only becomes abnormal when heart muscle ischemia is brought on by exertion. Therefore, ''exercise'' treadmill or bicycle testing (''stress'' tests) are useful screening tests for those with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and a normal resting EKG. These ''stress'' tests are 60% to 70% accurate in diagnosing significant coronary artery disease.''If the stress tests are not diagnostic, a nuclear agent (Cardiolite or ''thallium'') can be given intravenously during stress tests. Addition of one of these agents allows imaging of the blood flow to different regions of the heart, using an external camera. An area of the heart with reduced blood flow during exercise, but normal blood flow at rest, signifies substantial artery narrowing in that region.''Stress ''echocardiography'' combines echocardiography (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart muscle) with exercise stress testing. It is also an accurate technique for detecting coronary artery disease. When a significant narrowing exists, the heart muscle supplied by the narrowed artery does not contract as well as the rest of the heart muscle. Stress echocardiography and thallium stress tests are 80% to 85% accurate in detecting significant coronary artery disease.''When a person cannot undergo an ''exercise stress test'' because of neurological or arthritic difficulties, medications can be injected intravenously to simulate the stress on the heart normally brought on by exercise. Heart imaging can be performed with either a nuclear camera or echocardiography.''Cardiac catheterization'' with ''angiography'' (coronary arteriography) is a technique that allows X-ray pictures to be taken of the coronary arteries. ''It is the most accurate test to detect coronary artery narrowing''. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the openings of coronary arteries. ''Iodine'' contrast ""dye"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded. Coronary arteriography gives the doctor a picture of the location and severity of narrowed artery segments. This information is important in helping the doctor select medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, or ''coronary artery bypass'' graft surgery (CABG) as the preferred treatment option.''A newer, less invasive technique is the availability of high speed '' CT ''coronary angiography''. While it still involves ''radiation'' and dye exposure, no catheters are needed in the arterial system, which does decrease the risk of the procedure somewhat. This modality has a more limited role, in that, it is less questionable than conventional angiography and cannot allow PCF to be done the same time. It is important to remember that the risk of serious complications from conventional coronary angiography is very low (well under 1%).'  "
What medications treat coronary artery disease?,"""Angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply, and also may partially dilate the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. Three commonly used classes of ""'drugs'' are the ''nitrates'', ''beta blockers'', and calcium blockers.''Examples of nitrates include:''Examples of beta blockers include:''Examples of calcium blockers include:''A newer fourth agent, ranolazine (Ranexa) is of value.''Many people benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. When significant ischemia still occurs, either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing, coronary arteriography is usually performed, often followed by either percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Individuals with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of heart attack. In addition to angina medications, they are given ''aspirin'' and the intravenous blood thinner, ''heparin''. A form of heparin, ''enoxaparin'' (''Lovenox''), may be administered subcutaneously, and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in those with unstable angina. Aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets, while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. Potent IV antiplatelet agents (""super aspirins"") are also available to help initially stabilize such individuals. While people with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications, they are often at risk for the development of ''heart attacks''. For this reason, many people with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography, and possible percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation, stenting, or atherectomy. During percutaneous coronary intervention, a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or wrist. The artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. Under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy), a long, thin plastic tube, called a guiding catheter, is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the ''aorta''. A contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that X-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. A small diameter guide wire (0.014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. A balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. This balloon is then inflated for about one minute, compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. Balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure, to as much as 20 atmospheres. Finally, the balloon is deflated and removed from the body.''Intracoronary stents are deployed in either a self-expanding fashion, or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the stent is expanded and deployed, and the balloon is removed. The stent remains in place in the artery.''CABG surgery is performed to relieve angina in those whose illness has not responded to medications and are not good candidates for PCI.' isosorbide (Isordil), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), and transdermal nitrate patches. propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and metoprolol (Lopressor). nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Verelan PM, Isoptin, Isoptin SR, Covera-HS), diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac), and amlodipine (Norvasc). Atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire, and then activated in varying fashion, depending on the device chosen. CABG is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations, or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments which are not well-suited for percutaneous coronary intervention. CABG is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. CABG surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in people with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and in those with significant narrowing in multiple arteries, especially in cases of decreased heart muscle pump function."
What are the complications of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention, using balloons, stents, and/or atherectomy can achieve effective relief of coronary arterial obstruction in 90% to 95% of patients.''When stents are placed patients are started on aspirin as well as a second agent for up to a year or more depending on the type of stent. These agents are clopidogrel (''Plavix''), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) may be given as an IV agent when the stent is placed for patients who cant take pills.''To help prevent the process of thrombosis during or after percutaneous coronary intervention, aspirin is given to prevent platelets from adhering to the artery wall and stimulating the formation of ''blood clots''. Intravenous heparin or synthetic analogues of part of the heparin molecule is given to further prevent blood clotting; and combinations of nitrates and calcium blockers are used to minimize vessel spasm. Individuals at an increased risk for abrupt closure include:''The incidence of abrupt occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention has declined dramatically with the introduction of coronary stents, which essentially eliminate the problem of flow-limiting arterial dissections, elastic recoil, and spasm. The use of new intravenous ""super aspirins"", which alter platelet function at a site different from the site of aspirin-inhibition, have dramatically reduced the incidence of thrombosis after balloon angioplasty and stenting.''When despite these measures, a coronary artery cannot be ""kept open"" during percutaneous coronary intervention, emergency CABG surgery may be necessary. Before the advent of stents and advanced anti-thrombotic strategies, emergency CABG following a failed percutaneous coronary intervention was required in as many as 5% of patients. In the current era, the need for emergent CABG following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than 1% The overall acute mortality risk following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than one percent; the risk of a heart attack following percutaneous coronary intervention is only about 1% to 2%. The degree of risk is dependent on the number of diseased vessels treated, the function of the heart muscle, and the age and clinical condition of the patient.'   In a very small percentage of individuals, percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed because of technical difficulties. These difficulties usually involve the inability to pass the guide wire or the balloon catheter across the narrowed artery segments. The most serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention results when there is an abrupt closure of the dilated coronary artery within the first few hours after the procedure. Abrupt coronary artery closure occurs in 5% of patients after simple balloon angioplasty, and is responsible for most of the serious complications related to percutaneous coronary intervention. Abrupt closure is due to a combination of tearing (dissection) of the inner lining of the artery, blood clotting (thrombosis) at the balloon site, and constriction (spasm) or elastic recoil of the artery at the balloon site. women, individuals with unstable angina, and individuals having heart attacks."
How long is the recovery time after percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention is performed in a special room fitted with computerized X-ray equipment called a cardiac catheterization laboratory.''Patients are then brought to a monitored bed for observation.''Most patients are discharged home the day after percutaneous coronary intervention.''Patients are maintained on aspirin indefinitely after percutaneous coronary intervention to prevent future thrombotic events (for example, unstable angina or heart attack).''Exercise stress testing is sometimes done several weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention and signals the beginning of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation can involve a 12-week program of gradually increasing monitored exercise lasting one hour three times a week. Lifestyle changes can help to lower the chance of developing further coronary artery disease. These include:''Cholesterol reduction is often aided by the addition of medications which may not only lower cholesterol levels, but may offer protection against future ''heart attacks''.' Patients are mildly sedated with small amounts of diazepam (Valium), midazolam (Versed), morphine, and other sedative narcotics given intravenously. Patients may experience minor discomfort at the site of the puncture in the groin or the arm. Patients also may experience brief episodes of angina while the balloon is inflated, briefly blocking the flow of blood in the coronary artery. The percutaneous coronary intervention procedure can last from 30 minutes to two hours, but is usually completed within 60 minutes. The plastic catheters left in the artery are removed from the groin after four to 12 hours depending on how long blood thinning is needed to stabilize the opened artery. When these catheters are removed, the area is compressed by hand or with the aid of a mechanical clamp for about 20 minutes to prevent bleeding. In many instances, the artery in the groin may be sutured or ""sealed"" in the catheterization laboratory, and the catheters are immediately removed. This enables the patient to sit up in bed within a few hours after the procedure. Patients are advised not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds or perform vigorous exertion for the first one to two weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention. This allows the area in the coronary artery as well as the groin or arm arteries to heal. Patients may return to normal work and sexual activity two or three days after percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients who receive stents, an additional anti-platelet agent [in most instances clopidogrel (Plavix)] is given in conjunction with aspirin for one year; this is because the metal in the stents may promote the formation of blood clots after the stent is inserted. stopping smoking, reducing weight and dietary fat, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and lowering blood cholesterol levels."
What are the long-term results of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Long-term benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention depend on the maintenance of the newly-opened coronary artery(ies).''Restenosis can simply be observed or treated with medications if the narrowing is not critical and the patient is not symptomatic.'   Thirty percent to 50% of patients with successful balloon angioplasty (no stent) may develop recurrent narrowing (restenosis) at the site of the balloon inflation, usually within six months following percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients may complain of recurrence of angina or may have no symptoms. Restenosis is often detected by exercise stress tests performed at 4 to 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Restenosis occurs with a significantly higher frequency in people with diabetes. The rate of restenosis is greater in vein grafts, at the origins of vessels, in the beginning part of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and in those with suboptimal initial results. The widespread use of intracoronary stents has reduced the incidence of restenosis by as much as 50% or more; this is due to prevention of ""elastic recoil"" in the artery, as well as providing a larger initial channel in the treated artery. With the newer medicated stents, the restenosis rate is well under 10%. Some patients undergo a repeat percutaneous coronary intervention to increase coronary artery blood flow. Second percutaneous coronary intervention procedures have similar initial and long-term results as first procedures, although certain patterns of restenosis have a very high repeat recurrence rate. Sometimes, CABG surgeries are recommended for those patients who have developed more extensive disease in the restenosed artery as well as in the other coronary arteries. Patients may also choose CABG surgery to avoid the uncertainty of restenosis after the second percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients with restenosis after balloon angioplasty or stents, the use of intracoronary radiation (brachytherapy) may reduce the risk of future restenosis. If no evidence of restenosis is observed after 6 to 9 months, studies have demonstrated that the treated arterial segment is likely to remain open for many years. ""Late restenosis"" after 1 year or more is very uncommon. Symptoms developing more than 1 year after successful percutaneous coronary intervention are usually due to blockage in a different segment of the artery or in a different artery from that which was treated in the initial percutaneous coronary intervention."
Introduction to endoscopy,"'The use of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopes has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ''esophagus'', stomach, duodenum, and colon (''large intestine''). The last remaining frontier in the ''intestines'' has been the small intestine. Wireless ''capsule endoscopy'' allows physicians to visualize the inside of the intestines from the esophagus through to the colon, but capsule ''endoscopy'"" has limitations, the most notable of which are the inability to control the capsule's passage and to perform therapeutic interventions, such as biopsy and electrocautery. Although capsule endoscopy is likely to remain an important diagnostic procedure because of its simplicity, the limitations of capsule endoscopy have been overcome by the development of balloon endoscopy, also known as enteroscopy.""  "
What is balloon endoscopy?,'There are two types of balloon endoscopy: single balloon and double balloon. ' 
Single balloon endoscopy,"'For single balloon endoscopy, a 200 cm long flexible, fiberoptic, endoscope (a hose-like tube one centimeter in diameter with a light and a camera on the tip) is fitted with an equally long overtube that slides the full length of the endoscope. On the tip of the overtube is a balloon that can be inflated and deflated. The balloon is blown up to anchor the overtube within the intestine. While the overtube is anchored, the endoscope can be advanced further into the small intestine. By withdrawing the overtube the small intestine can be shortened and straightened to make the passage of the inner endoscope easier. The balloon may then be deflated so that the overtube can be inserted further and the endoscope advanced again. The endoscope itself is a standard endoscope with working channels that allow the intestine to be inflated with air, rinsed with water, or used to guide biopsy or electrocautery instruments to the tip of the endoscope.' "
Double balloon endoscopy,"'For double balloon endoscopy, similar equipment is used, but a second balloon is located on the tip of the endoscope. Both balloons - the one on the overtube and the one on the endoscope - can be alternatively inflated to anchor the overtube or the endoscope to assist with the passage of the endoscope or overtube, respectively.' "
What to expect with balloon endoscopy,"'Balloon endoscopy, like other gastrointestinal endoscopy, requires intravenous sedation. The procedures are long, often requiring 1-3 hours. The most important complications of balloon endoscopy are perforation of the small intestine or bleeding either due to insertion of the endoscope or the use of therapeutic instruments.'  "
What is the future for balloon endoscopy?,"'Balloon endoscopy is revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal diseases. Nevertheless, its use is restricted because of the large expenditure of time that is necessary to perform it. Either newer, faster systems will need to be designed or, perhaps, paramedical personnel will be needed to perform the insertions before balloon endoscopy is as commonly performed as other types of endoscopy. For now, when there is concern about disease in the small intestine, wireless capsule endoscopy often is performed first. Then, if abnormalities are found, or if despite a normal capsule endoscopy there still is a strong suspicion that there may be disease in the small intestine, balloon endoscopy is performed.' "

Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
What is a barium enema series?,"'A lower GI series, also known as a barium enema, barium enema procedure, barium enema X-ray or double-contrast barium enema, is an X-ray test in which a white liquid, called barium, is infused through a catheter (tube) inserted through the anus and into the rectum until it fills the large bowel (colon). X-ray films of the colon then are taken so that the outline of the colon can be seen.    The barium enema and double contrast barium enema are used to define normal and abnormal anatomy of the colon and rectum. Colon and rectal abnormalities that can be detected include ''diverticulosis'', polyps, dilation of the colon, ''Hirschsprung disease'' in infants, and colon ''cancers''.'  "
What are the risks of a lower barium enema?,"'Distention of the colon is uncomfortable, but only a few patients find it very painful. Any X-ray test procedure involves some risk of radiation exposure. The radiation exposure is minimized by standard techniques which have been developed and approved by national and international radiology committees and councils. All radiology technologists are certified by national certifying boards.  ''Women who are or may be pregnant should notify the doctor requesting the procedure and the radiology staff, as there is a potential risk of harm to the fetus with any radiation exposure.  Complications of barium enema examination are rare.  The tip of the enema catheter or distention of the colon can penetrate the wall of the colon and give rise to a localized infection (''abscess'') or ''peritonitis'' (generalized infection of the abdominal ''cavity'').  This usually occurs only when excessive pressure is used to infuse the barium or there is already a diseased colon that is weakened.'  "
"How does the patient prepare for a lower barium enema, and how is it performed?","'Any internal or external materials that make an X-ray image less clear can interfere with the accuracy of a barium enema. Therefore, before undergoing a barium enema (lower GI), it is important to eliminate as much fecal material from the colon and rectum as is possible. Prior to the examination, a clear ''liquid diet'' and cleansing enemas often are used to empty the colon. Further medications that help evacuate the bowel are usually used. This is called a bowel prep. External materials such as extra clothing, metallic devices, or jewelry are removed prior to the test. A radiologist (a doctor specializing in the use and interpretation of ''X-rays'') and a radiology technologist work perform the procedure on the patient.'   A barium enema involves filling the colon and rectum with a white liquid material (barium) through a catheter (tube) inserted into the rectum through the anus. It is normal during the procedure to feel some fullness or mild discomfort in the abdomen. Subsequently, an X-ray machine is placed in front of the patient with X-ray film behind. Images of the colon then are obtained by exposing the abdomen to the radiation. The contrast in density between the barium-filled colon and other structures of the abdomen are apparent on the X-ray film and give an excellent outline of the colon. The radiologist also will use a fluoroscope, an X-ray device on which the barium can be seen in motion flowing into the colon. Further static images of the colon then are obtained on plain X-ray film or digital computerized image. The barium then may be drained so that only a small amount of barium remains sticking to the lining of the colon, and air is infused into the colon to distend it. Further X-rays then are taken which give more detail of colon's lining than the X-rays of the barium-filled colon. This latter procedure is called a double contrast barium enema since both air and barium are used to provide the images. Polyps and small cancers are more readily found using this technique (called an air contrast barium enema). A barium enema can take anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour depending on the problem being studied and the particular anatomy of the patient's colon."
How does the patient obtain the results of a lower barium enema series?,"'After the X-ray films are developed by the radiology technologist, they are transmitted to the radiologist, who interprets the body structures visualized on the X-ray film. An interpretation and report of the barium enema is forwarded to the doctor who requested the test usually within one to two days. The doctor then can review the results of the report with the patient. The actual films of the examination also can be sent to the health care practitioner if necessary.' "
What is an upper gastrointestinal (GI) series?,"'An upper gastrointestinal (GI) series (barium swallow), is a radiological test that is used to visualize the structures of the upper ''digestive system'' - the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. (If visualization of the remaining parts of the small intestine is necessary, a small bowel follow through\xa0 can be added to the test.) These structures are observed during the examination, and the images are also\xa0 saved for further review on X-ray film or as digital images. An upper GI series can reveal conditions such as ulcers, tumors, hiatal hernias, scarring, blockages, and abnormalities of the muscular wall of the gastrointestinal tissues.' "
What are the risks of an upper GI series?,"' Any x-ray test procedure involves some risk from ''radiation'' exposure. The radiation exposure is minimized by standard techniques that have been assigned and approved by national and international radiology committees and councils.  Radiology technicians are certified by national certifying boards.''Patients who are or may be pregnant should notify the requesting practitioner and radiology staff, as there is potential risk of harm to the fetus with any  radiation exposure.' "
"How does a patient prepare for an upper GI series, and how is it performed?","'A radiology technologist guides the patient through the upper GI series along with a radiologist (a physician trained in performing and interpreting ''x-rays''). Because an upper GI series involves interpreting images of the gastrointestinal system, it is important that any materials or objects internally or externally that could potentially interfere with interpretation of the X-ray film be avoided. Therefore, patients are requested not to eat or drink anything from four to eight hours before the procedure. Patients also are asked to remove their clothing and all metallic objects such as jewelry.''As barium passes through the digestive system, ''constipation'' can result, especially in patients prone to ''constipation''. Therefore, it generally is advisable that patients who undergo an upper GI series drink extra fluids after the test and consider a ''laxative'' to relieve the bowels of the barium if the barium is not eliminated completely within the next day or two. As it is passing in the ''stool'', barium has a whitish appearance that maybe apparent for several days after the test.'   A patient will be positioned behind X-ray equipment called a fluoroscope for X-ray exposure. The patient then is asked to swallow a liquid that contains barium. The barium fills and then coats the lining of the intestinal tract making the adjacent esophagus, stomach and duodenum visible. (X-rays of the stomach and intestine done without barium provide very little detail and information.) X-ray images are obtained at different angles through the chest and abdomen. The X-ray machine (fluoroscope) produces these images by sending X-ray radiation through the tissues of the body to a film on the opposite side of the patient's body. As the radiation penetrates the body, it is absorbed in varying amounts by different body tissues. Due to differences in their composition, the different organs and certain abnormalities and conditions all become visible on the X-ray film, by blocking the penetration of the X-ray beam to varying degrees. After development of the film, an image of the organs is revealed. The radiologist then examines the X-rays and can identify various normal and abnormal structures of the gastrointestinal system. If needed, further enhancement of the different structures can be obtained by having air as well as barium in the stomach. This is accomplished by swallowing baking soda crystals."
How does the patient obtain the results of the upper GI series?,"'After the radiology technician develops the X-ray film or digital image, it is transferred to the radiologist. This physician interprets the films. The radiologist then generates a report that is transmitted to the physician who requested the test. The radiologist and the practitioner often review the findings together. The practitioner can review the results of the upper GI series with the patient and can proceed with therapy or discuss whether other tests may be necessary.' "
"What is mitral valve prolapse? What causes it, and what does it look like (pictures)?","'Mitral valve prolapse (also known as ""click murmur syndrome"" and ""Barlow\'s syndrome"") is the most common heart valve abnormality. The condition is slightly more prevalent in women than in men. The mitral valve is one of the four heart valves. A normal mitral valve consists of two thin leaflets, located between the ''left atrium'' and the ''left ventricle'' of the heart. Mitral valve leaflets, shaped like parachutes, are attached to the inner wall of the left ventricle by a series of strings called ""chordae."" When the ventricles contract, the mitral valve leaflets close snugly and prevent the backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left ''atrium''. When the ventricles relax, the valves open to allow oxygenated blood from the ''lungs'' to fill the left ventricle.''In mitral valve prolapse, the mitral apparatus (valve leaflets and chordae) becomes affected by a process called myxomatous degeneration. In myxomatous degeneration, the structural protein collagen forms abnormally and causes thickening, enlargement, and redundancy of the leaflets and chordae. Blood normally flows through the mitral valve from the left upper chamber (left ''atrium'') to the left lower chamber (left ventricle) of the heart. When the ventricles contract, the redundant leaflets prolapse (flop backwards) into the left ''atrium'', sometimes allowing leakage of blood through the valve opening (''mitral regurgitation'') back into the left atrium. When severe, mitral regurgitation can lead to ''heart failure'' and ''abnormal heart rhythms''. Most people are unaware of the prolapsing of the mitral valve. However, others may experience a number of symptoms.''The mitral valve prolapse (MVP) syndrome has a strong hereditary tendency, although the exact cause is unknown. Affected family members are often tall, thin, with long arms and fingers, and straight backs. Mitral valve prolapse is more common in women from 20 to 40 years old; however, also occurs in men.''For reasons not clear, people with mild mitral valve prolapse often have more symptoms and signs than those with severe prolapse (which may require surgery). Rarely, people with severe mitral valve prolapse will have symptoms that can affect the entire body.' "
What are the sign and symptoms of mitral valve prolapse?,"'Most people with mitral valve prolapse have no symptoms, however, those who do commonly complain of symptoms may experience:''Often the severity of symptoms in people with ''mitral prolapse'' is inversely correlated to the degree of anatomic abnormality of the heart. Many people with severe symptoms have barely detectable prolapse, and the small minority with severe prolapse and valve dysfunction have no symptoms.'   Fatigue is the most common symptom of mitral valve prolapse, although the reason for fatigue is not understood. People with mitral valve prolapse may have imbalances in their autonomic nervous system, which regulates heart rate and breathing. These imbalances may cause inadequate blood oxygen delivery to the working muscles during exercise, thereby causing fatigue. Palpitations are sensations of fast or irregular heartbeats. In most people with mitral valve prolapse, palpitations are harmless. Rarely, potentially serious heart rhythm abnormalities may underlie palpitations and require further evaluation and treatment. Sharp chest pains, which can be prolonged. Unlike angina and chest pain, rarely, mitral valve prolapse occurs during or after exercise, and may not respond to nitroglycerin. Anxiety, panic attacks, and depression may be associated with mitral valve prolapse. Like fatigue, these symptoms are believed to be related to imbalances of the autonomic nervous system. Migraine headaches have been occasionally linked to mitral valve prolapse. The migraines are probably related to abnormal nervous system control of the tension in the blood vessels in the brain. Pulmonary edema usually occurs when fluid inside of the blood vessels of the lungs leak outside of the vessel, which causes swelling of the surrounding tissues."
What are the risk factors for mitral valve prolapse?,"'Risk factors that increase the risk for mitral valve prolapse include the following:' Age (over 50) Family history Certain diseases (Marfan syndrome, Graves' disease, for example) Alcohol Stimulants like caffeine Magnesium deficiency"
How is mitral valve prolapse diagnosed?,"'Examination of the patient reveals characteristic findings unique to mitral valve prolapse. Using a stethoscope, a clicking sound is heard soon after the ventricle begins to contract. This clicking is felt to reflect tightening of the abnormal valve leaflets against the pressure load of the left ventricle. If there is associated leakage (regurgitation) of blood through the abnormal valve opening, a ""whooshing"" sound (murmur) can be heard immediately following the clicking sound.''Echocardiography'' (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart) is the most useful test for mitral valve prolapse. Echocardiography can measure the severity of prolapse and the degree of mitral regurgitation. It can also detect areas of infection on the abnormal valves. Valve infection is called ''endocarditis'' and is a very rare, but potentially serious complication of mitral valve prolapse. Echocardiography can also evaluate the effect of prolapse and regurgitation on the functioning of the muscles of the ventricles.''Abnormally rapid or irregular heart rhythms can occur in patients with mitral valve prolapse, causing palpitations. A 24-hour Holter monitor is a device that takes a continuous recording of the patient\'s heart rhythm as the patient carries on his/her daily activities. Abnormal rhythms occurring during the test period are captured and analyzed at a later date. If abnormal rhythms do not occur every day, the Holter recording may fail to capture the abnormal rhythms. These patients then can be fitted with a small ""event-recorder"" to be worn for up to several weeks. When the patient senses a palpitation, an event button can be pressed to record the heart rhythm prior to, during, and after the palpitations.''Abnormally rapid or irregular heart rhythms can occur in patients with mitral valve prolapse, causing palpitations. A 24-hour Holter monitor is a device that takes a continuous recording of the patient\'s heart rhythm as the patient carries on his/her daily activities. Abnormal rhythms that occur during the test period are captured on the device and then are analyzed later. If abnormal rhythms do not occur every day, the Holter recording may fail to capture the abnormal rhythms. These patients then can be fitted with a small ""event-recorder"" that can be worn for several weeks. When the patient senses a palpitation, an event button can be pressed to record the heart rhythm prior to, during, and after the palpitations.''The American Heart Association describes two types of recorders, looping memory monitors and symptom event monitors. Looping monitors are activated by pushing a button, and can be programed to record your ''EKG'' a few minutes before and after you push the button.''Event monitors can be put on your wrist or chest and will record your EKG, but will not record those few minutes before you activate it, like the looping memory monitor does. However, both can transmit your recorded EKG to a hospital or doctor‘s office.'  "
What is the treatment for mitral valve prolapse?,"'The majority of people with mitral valve prolapse have an excellent prognosis and need no treatment. For these individuals, routine examinations including echocardiograms every few years may suffice. Mitral regurgitation in patients with mitral valve prolapse can lead to heart failure, heart enlargement, and abnormal rhythms. Therefore, those patients with mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation often are evaluated annually.''A rare, but potentially serious complication of mitral valve prolapse is endocarditis (valve infection or valve leakage,); therefore, individuals with mitral valve prolapse usually are prescribed antibiotics prior to any procedure that can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream. Examples of procedures include routine dental work, minor surgery, and procedures that can traumatize body tissues such as ''colonoscopy'' or gynecologic or urologic examinations. Examples of antibiotics used include oral ''amoxicillin'' and ''erythromycin'' as well as intramuscular or intravenous ''ampicillin'', gentamycin, and ''vancomycin''.''People with severe prolapse, abnormal heart rhythms, ''fainting'' spells, significant palpitations, chest ''pain'', and ''anxiety'' attacks may need medication. ''Beta-blockers'', such as ''atenolol'' (''Tenormin''), ''metoprolol'' (''Lopressor''), and ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), are the ''drugs'' of choice. These act by increasing the size of the left ventricle, thereby reducing the degree of prolapse. The calcium blockers ''verapamil'' (''Calan'') and ''diltiazem'' (''Cardizem'') are useful in people who cannot tolerate beta-blockers.'  "
Mitral valve prolapse surgery,"'Although most patients with mitral valve prolapse require no treatment or treatment with oral medications, the prognosis is usually good. Rarely, surgery for mitral valve replacement or repair may be require. People who require surgery usually have severe mitral regurgitation causing worsening heart failure and progressive heart enlargement. Rarely, rupture of one or more chordae can cause sudden, severe mitral regurgitation and heart failure requiring surgical repair.''Mitral valve repair is preferable, if possible, to mitral valve replacement as the surgical treatment for mitral valve regurgitation. After mitral valve replacement, lifelong blood thinning medications are necessary to prevent blood from clotting on the artificial valves. After mitral valve repair, these blood-thinning medications are unnecessary. Due to the success of valve repair, it is being performed earlier in people with mitral regurgitation, thus reducing the risk of abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, and death.' "
What are the complications of mitral valve prolapse?,"'Often the severity of symptoms in patients with mitral prolapse is inversely correlated to the degree of anatomic abnormality. Many patients with severe symptoms have barely detectable prolapse, and the small minority with severe prolapse and valve dysfunction have no symptoms.' Palpitations are sensations of fast or irregular heartbeats. In most patients with mitral valve prolapse, palpitations are harmless. In very rare cases, potentially serious heart rhythm abnormalities (for example, atrial fibrillation) may underlie palpitations and require further evaluation and treatment. Moreover, pulmonary hypertension may develop and lead to heart failure. Sharp chest pains are reported in some patients with mitral valve prolapse, which can be prolonged. Unlike angina, chest pain with mitral valve prolapse rarely occurs during or after exercise, and may not respond to nitroglycerin. Anxiety, panic attacks, and depression may be associated with mitral valve prolapse. Like fatigue, these symptoms are believed to be related to imbalances of the autonomic nervous system. Migraine headaches have been occasionally linked to mitral valve prolapse. They are probably related to abnormal nervous system control of the tension in the blood vessels in the brain. Mitral valve prolapse may be rarely associated with strokes occurring in young people. These patients appear to have increased blood clotting tendencies due to abnormally sticky blood clotting elements, called platelets."
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for mitral valve prolapse?,"'Although some people with mitral valve prolapse may experience a variety of complications, most have no symptoms and can lead healthy, active, and normal lives. More importantly, the overwhelming majority of people with mitral valve prolapse have bothersome symptoms, but not life-threatening problems. Rarely, a person may need surgery or other aggressive therapies. Moreover, the symptoms may be very episodic, and come in waves and then disappear for some time. Symptoms of mitral valve prolapse may be aggravated by ''pregnancy'', ''stress'', pregnancy, fatigue, menstrual cycles (''menstruation''), or other illnesses.''Life expectancy for people with mitral valve prolapse usually is normal, which includes young people that require surgery. People that develop complications from the condition or have other medical problems may have a reduced life expectancy related to the complication.' "
What is Barrett's esophagus?,"""Barrett's esophagus is a complication of chronic ""'gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (GERD), primarily in white men. GERD is a disease in which there is reflux of acidic fluid from the stomach into the esophagus (the swallowing tube). GERD most commonly causes ''heartburn''.'""There are two requirements for the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus.""' The requirements necessitate an endoscopy of the esophagus. During endoscopy, a long flexible tube with a light and camera at its tip (an endoscope) is inserted through the mouth and down into the esophagus to view and biopsy (sample tissue from) the lining of the esophagus. The two requirements are:''Barrett\'s esophagus is officially coded by the Library of Congress for electronic searches of the literature as Barrett esophagus, but Barrett\'s esophagus (with the apostrophe ""s"") is the name used universally. The condition is named after a surgeon, Norman Barrett, who described the condition. However, it turns out that his interpretation of the findings was not correct. In 1953, Doctors\' Allison and Johnstone actually described this condition as we now understand it, namely that metaplasia was occurring. (Metaplasia, which is discussed below, is the term used when one adult tissue replaces another.) Nevertheless, the condition has been immortalized with Barrett\'s name.'""Initially, it was thought that the Barrett's esophagus consisted of stomach (gastric) tissue replacing the usual squamous tissue lining the esophagus. However, in the mid 70's, Dr. Paull and colleagues published a paper in which they described the mucosa (inner lining) of Barrett's esophagus in greater detail than had been done previously. They pointed out that Barrett's esophagus consisted of a metaplasia in which the normal cells lining the esophagus were replaced by a mixture of gastric and intestinal lining cells. The intestinal-type lining cells also are called specialized columnar cells which include goblet cells. For a number of years, some scientists thought that there were two types of Barrett's; one in which the normal lining was replaced with stomach (gastric) type cells only, and the second in which intestinal cells were present. However, the current belief is that only the presence of intestinal-type goblet cells establishes the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, regardless of what other cell types are present.""   At endoscopy, an abnormal pink or salmon-colored lining should be seen as replacing the normal whitish lining of the esophagus. This abnormal lining extends a short distance (usually less than 2.5 inches) up the esophagus from the gastroesophageal junction (the GE junction, which is where the esophagus joins the stomach). Microscopic evaluation of the biopsy of this abnormal lining should shows that the normal lining cells of the esophagus have been replaced by intestinal type lining cells, including mucus-producing cells called goblet cells. Other cells also are present, some of which resemble cells that line the stomach. However, if intestinal goblet cells are not present, the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus should not be made."
Why is there so much interest in Barrett's esophagus?,"""The reason for the great interest in Barrett's esophagus is that it is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the esophagus. The type of cancer that occurs in patients with Barrett's is adenocarcinoma, which arises from the metaplastic intestinal tissue. The usual cancer of the esophagus that is not associated with Barrett's is squamous ""'carcinoma'"", which arises from the squamous cell lining that is normally present in the esophagus. The connection between adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and Barrett's esophagus is now clear, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is increasing in frequency in most countries in the Western hemisphere.""""The good news, however, is that the cancer occurs in relatively few patients with Barrett's esophagus. Still, the main challenge in this condition is to watch for early warning signs of cancer by taking biopsies at regular intervals during endoscopy. This practice is called surveillance and is similar, in principle, to the surveillance in women for ""'cancer of the cervix'', wherein PAP smears are taken at regular intervals.' "
What causes Barrett's esophagus?,"""GERD causes Barrett's esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular tube that is located in the chest and serves to transfer food from the mouth to the stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is a valve that is located at the junction of the stomach with the esophagus. Its function is to prevent acid and other contents of the stomach from coming back into the esophagus. GERD is a condition in which excessive acid-containing fluid refluxes (flows) back into the esophagus, in part because the lower esophageal sphincter is weak. The ""'weakness'' of the LES may be related, in part, to the fact that virtually all GERD patients have ''hiatal hernia''. In patients with hiatal ''hernia'', the upper few centimeters of the stomach slides back and forth between the abdomen and the chest through the ''diaphragm''. This sliding may interfere with how the sphincter works as a barrier to reflux from the stomach to the esophagus.''Previously, the term hernia was used instead of GERD in explaining to patients the basis of their symptoms (usually heartburn) because virtually all GERD patients have hiatal hernias. GERD, however, is the more accurate term. While hiatal hernias are extremely common in the population,\xa0 only a small number of people with hiatal hernia develop GERD. In other words, the presence of a hiatal hernia does not mean that the person will develop GERD. On the flip side, however, if a person has GERD, hiatal hernia is almost always present.'""Thus, Barrett's esophagus is caused by chronic (of many years duration) and usually severe ""'acid reflux'"". In some patients with GERD, the esophagus reacts to the repeated injury from the acidic fluid by changing the type of cells lining it from squamous (normal cells) to columnar (intestinal-type cells). This transformation, called metaplasia, is believed to be a protective response because the specialized columnar epithelium (epithelium means lining) in Barrett's esophagus is more resistant to injury from acid than the squamous epithelium.""'The fluid in the stomach contains acid that is produced by the stomach. In addition, however, the fluid may contain bile acids (from bile produced by the ''liver'') and enzymes (produced by the pancreas) that have refluxed back from the duodenum into the stomach. (The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine just beyond the stomach.) The acid that refluxes from the stomach to the esophagus is injurious to the esophagus. There is some evidence, however, that the bile and pancreatic enzymes combined with the acid may be more injurious than acid alone.' "
Who develops Barrett's esophagus?,"'A significant percentage of individuals with chronic ''symptoms of GERD'"" develop Barrett's esophagus, and it is most common in Caucasian male populations. Not everyone with GERD has symptoms of GERD, however. Therefore, some people with Barrett's are unaware that they have Barrett's because they have GERD without any symptoms at all or have very mild and infrequent symptoms.""""It is unclear why Barrett's esophagus is so overwhelmingly more common in white males than in any other group. For example, although women and African-Americans do not seem to be protected from developing GERD, they are largely protected (especially African-Americans) from developing Barrett's esophagus and Barrett's cancer (adenocarcinoma). There is evidence that in the western hemisphere, ""'esophageal cancer'' and cancer of the gastroesophageal junction (called cardia cancer) are increasing in frequency, perhaps more so than any other gastrointestinal tract cancer. (However, ''colon cancer'' is still very much more common than esophageal cancer.)'""Barrett's esophagus may run in some families and be genetically determined. Studies are underway to determine if any genes or markers can be found in these families that would predict the development of Barrett's esophagus in the general population. In these families with Barrett's as well as with Barrett's in the general population, GERD is the common denominator. However, the question is why the Barrett's occurs more commonly in these families than in others with comparably severe GERD, but with no family association."" "
What is the specific abnormality in the inner lining (epithelium) of Barrett's esophagus?,"""To repeat, the first criterion for the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is the finding at endoscopy of a pink lining in the esophagus where it is normally not seen. This abnormal lining may appear  circumferentially like a band, tongue-like or as islands. The second criterion is that biopsies from the pink lining reveal the characteristic intestinalized mucosa (the lining normally seen in the ""'intestines'') with the typical goblet cells. The esophageal biopsies are obtained during an endoscopy. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a procedure in which the doctor inserts a long flexible tube (endoscope) through the mouth and down into the esophagus to directly visualize the lining of the esophagus. During the same endoscopic examination, the stomach and duodenum also can be visualized. Multiple small samples (biopsies) of the lining epithelial tissue can be obtained through the endoscope. ''As mentioned previously, the process of the replacement of one type of tissue lining by another is called metaplasia. In the stomach and intestines, metaplasia is a common response to certain types of injury. As Henry Appelman, a pathologist, stated: ""When the gut is under ''stress'' it wants to be something else."" Other examples of metaplasia in which one lining replaces another are: (1) in the stomach where chronic inflammation (''gastritis'') may result in an intestinal-type lining replacing parts of the normal stomach lining; and (2) in the duodenum (just beyond the stomach in the intestine) where peptic ulcers occur and the intestinal lining surrounding the ulcer transforms into stomach-type lining.'""We believe that the process of metaplasia is a protective or adaptive response to injury of the lining. However, the downside of metaplasia is that in Barrett's esophagus, it carries a small but definite increase in the risk of becoming cancerous. Not all metaplasias have an increased risk of cancer. For example, of the two metaplasias referred to in the previous paragraph, intestinal metaplasia in the stomach can lead to cancer, but intestinal metaplasia in the duodenum does not.""""The process of developing Barrett's begins at the junction of the stomach and esophageal linings. The esophagus normally is lined by a squamous epithelium or lining layer. This squamous epithelium has a pearly white appearance, whereas the lining in the stomach and intestines has a more salmon pink color because it is a columnar epithelium rather than a squamous epithelium. The squamous epithelium is made up of flat squamous cells, which are similar to skin cells. The stomach or gastric lining consists of taller columnar cells as seen under the microscope. The junction of the squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the gastric columnar epithelium occurs at the junction of the esophagus and stomach where, as you recall, the lower esophageal sphincter is located. The common border (interface) of these two linings is often referred to as the Z line, because when examined during an endoscopy, it has a zig zag appearance.""'With progressive injury to the esophagus, metaplasia occurs and the metaplastic tissue moves up the esophagus for a distance which varies from person to person, usually from about 0.5 to 2.5 inches (about 1 to 6 centimeters). The type of cell that gives rise to the metaplastic tissue is not known. '""Barrett's esophagus often is categorized into short- or long-segment Barrett's, based on the length of the esophagus that is affected. Short segment Barrett's generally refers to involvement of 3 centimeters or less while long segment means involvement of more than 3 centimeters of the esophagus. Interestingly, once Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed in a patient, the metaplastic lining does not seem to progress further up into the esophagus if the patient is being treated for GERD. Thus, over time, the length of involvement with Barrett's  generally remains the same.""""If biopsies are taken from patients with GERD who have a normal appearing Z line (no visible evidence of Barrett's esophagus), up to 30% will show the same intestinal type metaplasia with goblet cells as those that are seen in Barrett's esophagus. However, we do not routinely biopsy normal appearing Z lines to look for this change, nor do we do surveillance when we find it there. The reason is that limited intestinal metaplasia of the gastroesophageal junction region in GERD seems to occur with similar frequency in women and African Americans as in white men, yet the risk of overt Barrett's esophagus is much less than in white men.""""Therefore, the presence of metaplasia on a routine biopsy of a normal appearing Z line in GERD should not lead to any change in management. What's more, the finding of goblet cells in this context should not be labeled, as some have suggested, as ultrashort segment Barrett's. The main reason for not labeling it as Barrett's is that the term Barrett's implies an increased risk of cancer, and there is no evidence that this finding is associated with an increased cancer risk."" "
What about the cancer that occurs in Barrett's esophagus?,"""The type of cancer that occurs with Barrett's esophagus is adenocarcinoma. Cancer arising from the squamous lining of the esophagus is called squamous cancer or carcinoma. Among Caucasians, the rate (frequency over time) of squamous cancer is decreasing relative to Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma. Other racial groups (for example, African Americans) however, have not experienced the same rate of decline in squamous cancer relative to adenocarcinoma.""'Smoking'' and excessive ''alcohol'' ingestion are definite risk factors for squamous ''cancers'"". They also are risk factors for adenocarcinoma seen in Barrett's esophagus. In this situation, however, it is not clear if ""'smoking'' and alcohol increase the risk for adenocarcinoma by making GERD more severe or if ''smoking'' and alcohol have a more direct cancer-causing effect, as occurs in squamous cancer. Squamous cell cancers have become increasingly less common, while adenocarcinoma diagnoses have risen. Adenocarcinoma incidence in white males has risen more steeply than in other ethnic groups.'""Throughout the remainder of this section, the term esophageal cancer will refer to adenocarcinoma arising from the Barrett's esophagus.""""Cancer of the gastroesophageal junction is also called cardia cancer because the region where the esophagus meets the stomach is called the cardia. This cancer, like Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma, is found predominantly in white males, is apparently increasing in frequency at the same rate as esophageal cancer, and is associated with chronic GERD. Therefore, it has been speculated that cardia cancer starts from short segments (for example, 1-2 cm) of Barrett's. By the time the diagnosis of cancer is made, however, the  ""'tumor'"" may have spread beyond the short segment of Barrett's and may appear to be in the cardia. This speculation about the origin of cancer of the cardia, however, remains to be proven.""'An increase in the frequency of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been observed for at least 20 years, primarily in white males. One clue to the reason for this trend may be related to a decrease in the frequency of ''H. pylori'"" infection of the stomach. In other words, people with Barrett's cancer, including cardia cancer, seem to have lower rates of ""'H. pylori'' infection than others of the same age and sex in the same population.''H. pylori ''is a type of bacteria that is a major cause of ulcers. It is a very common infection worldwide and causes no symptoms in the vast majority of affected people. However, some people with ''H. pylori'' develop ''peptic ulcer'' of the stomach and duodenum. These ulcers are treated by eliminating the bacteria, which in turn, prevents relapse of the ulcers.''If ''H. pylori'' goes untreated, it causes progressive inflammation of the stomach (gastritis) which is associated with reduction in acid secretion and possibly less reflux of acid into the esophagus. In many areas of the world, this infection is decreasing in frequency, presumably because of better public health measures. Therefore, it is possible that the protective effect (such as decreased acid production) of chronic ''H. pylori'' infection has decreased. In other words, with less ''H. pylori'' gastritis, the stomach produces more acid and there is more acid to reflux into the esophagus. At the same time, we are more predisposed to reflux in our senior years. Although this is not a settled issue, the decreasing frequency of ''H. pylori'"" infection may be one reason for the increasing frequency of Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma."" "
What is dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus?,"'Dysplasia is a change in the cells lining the esophagus in which the cells actually show abnormal changes in their structure and appearance. When these changes become severe enough, (going from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia) the cells begin to appear ''malignant'"" (like cancer cells). However, unlike cancer these cells remain in place and don't invade tissues outside of the lining. Dysplasia occurs as a series of cell changes as Barrett's esophagus progresses to Barrett's-associated cancer. Patients with Barrett's are monitored with endoscopy and biopsies (surveillance) to detect these cellular changes (the dysplasia) or at worst, early cancer so that they may be treated. Currently, there is no way to predict which patients with Barrett's esophagus will develop dysplasia.""'Dysplasia also has been identified adjacent to tumors of the gastrointestinal tract other than esophageal adenocarcinoma. For example, dysplasia is found in half the cases of ''stomach cancer'' and in colon cancer, in which the dysplasia is visible as so-called adenomatous polyps. Additionally, dysplasia is the same early warning cell change that pathologists look for in PAP smears of the cervix that predict ''cervical cancer''.''Dysplasia is considered ''premalignant''. This means that if dysplasia has been demonstrated on several occasions, it is believed that the patient will develop cancer if he or she lives long enough. Dysplasia is categorized as being high grade or low grade. When high grade dysplasia is diagnosed, cancer may already be present, and if not, the risk of developing cancer sooner is greater than with the lesser grades of dysplasia.''In follow-up biopsies of patients with dysplasia, the condition may not be detected again in some patients, whereas in others, low grades of dysplasia are found. This absence or decrease of dysplasia may be due factors such as sampling variations, the removal of tiny foci (groups of cells) of dysplasia with the initial biopsy, or actual biological reversal. The exact reason(s) are unknown.''Using molecular techniques, some changes referred to as biomarkers, can be detected in biopsy specimens before dysplasia develops. These changes are similar to those that are observed in other cancers. Biomarkers include changes in the DNA content of cells, in the genes and chromosomes, and in growth factors. A number of these biomarkers can be shown to appear before and during the occurrence of dysplasia. The ultimate goal is to find a magic marker that can tell us which patients among those with no dysplasia or low grade dysplasia are more likely to develop high grade dysplasia or cancer. Such patients then can be followed by surveillance more closely than others.'""At present, all patients with Barrett's esophagus, from the surveillance point of view, are treated in the same manner. The availability of biomarkers would separate (stratify) Barrett's patients based on their risk for cancer. Such stratification would allow doctors to do surveillance endoscopy and biopsies more frequently in the minority of patients who are at greater risk of cancer and less frequently in those predicted to have a lower risk of cancer.""""Another use for proven biomarkers would be to help confirm the pathologist's interpretation of dysplasia on biopsies."" "
What is the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in Barrett's?,"""When patients with Barrett's esophagus are assessed as a group, the risk of cancer has been found to be as low as one in 300 patients yearly. This means that if we examined 300 patients yearly, one patient would be found to have cancer every year. What we really need to know is the risk of cancer if no dysplasia is found after one or two years of surveillance. Our belief is that this risk would be much less than the previously-quoted figures of one in 300 patients yearly.""'Patients with high grade dysplasia may often be found to have cancer. Therefore, the first order of management when high grade dysplasia is found is to exclude the presence of an adenocarcinoma.'""Low grade dysplasia is much less threatening than high grade dysplasia, but we don't know just how much less. In fact, we don't have precise data to indicate just what the cancer risk is in patients with Barrett's and low grade dysplasia.""""The diagnosis of dysplasia should be as precise as possible because this diagnosis can prompt a change in the treatment or the intensity of follow-up of patients with Barrett's esophagus. It requires a great deal of experience to be able to make a precise diagnosis of the presence and grade of dysplasia. Therefore, it is a common and useful practice to ask a second pathologist (or even a third, if necessary) to review the biopsies. The idea is to see if there is an agreement between the pathologists and/or to get a more experienced opinion about the presence and grade of dysplasia.""""If a person has longer segment Barrett's, one would guess that the cancer risk is greater than with shorter segment Barrett's. The data, however, is controversial in this regard. For that reason, the current practice is to do endoscopic biopsy surveillance with similar frequency in patients with short and long segment Barrett's esophagus."" "
What are the symptoms of Barrett's esophagus?,"""Barrett's esophagus has no unique symptoms. Patients with Barrett's have the symptoms of GERD (for example, heartburn, regurgitation, ""'nausea'"", etc.). The general trend is for Barrett's patients to have more severe GERD. However, not all Barrett's have marked symptoms of GERD, and some patients are detected accidentally with minimal or no symptoms of GERD.""'Heartburn is a burning sensation behind the breastbone, usually in the lower half, but may extend all the way up to the throat. Sometimes, it is accompanied by burning or ''pain'' in the pit of the stomach just below where the breastbone ends. The second most common symptom is regurgitation (backup) of bitter tasting fluid. ''GERD symptoms'' often are worse after meals and when lying flat.''The refluxed, regurgitated fluid occasionally may enter the ''lungs'' or the voice box (larynx), resulting in what are called extraesophageal (outside the esophagus) symptoms (manifestations) of GERD. These symptoms include:''For reasons not fully understood, some GERD patients have minimal heartburn but experience other GERD symptoms, for example, extraesophageal symptoms.''GERD may result in strictures and ulceration of the esophagus. A stricture or narrowing is due to scarring (fibrosis) of the esophagus that may cause difficulty in swallowing (''dysphagia''). The ''dysphagia'' is sensed as a sticking (stopping) of solid food in the chest (in the esophagus), and liquids when the narrowing is severe. Strictures can be treated by stretching them with dilators during endoscopy. Untreated, strictures may promote more spillage of food and/or gastric fluids into the lungs. Uncommonly, massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding caused by inflammation of the esophagus may occur. Such bleeding results in ''vomiting'' of blood or passage of black or maroon stools. More commonly, however, an inflamed esophagus can cause slow bleeding that is detected when ''anemia'' (a ''low red blood cell count'') is found and/or stools are tested for blood.'   new onset adult asthma, frequent bronchitis, chronic cough, sore throats, and hoarseness."
How is GERD with or without Barrett's esophagus treated?,"""The medical treatments for the symptoms of Barrett's esophagus are the same as those for GERD.""'The suppression of acid is the backbone of treatment for GERD. For mild reflux symptoms, over the counter medications are commonly used, ranging from antacids to low doses of drugs called H-2 receptor antagonists or H2 blockers. Examples of over the counter H2 blockers are ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet'') and ''famotidine'' (''Pepcid''). For more persistent symptoms, higher (prescription-strength) doses of the H-2 receptor antagonist drugs may be used, for example:''However, for persistent symptoms requiring maintenance (ongoing) therapy or for complicated GERD with strictures or bleeding, ''proton pump inhibitors'' (''PPIs'') are used. Examples of PPIs are:''Some patients need to take only one pill daily, while others need two pills (a double dose) to control the symptoms. The double dose can be taken as one pill twice daily or 2 pills once daily.''PPIs are potent inhibitors of acid secretion from the stomach. They are effective in relieving heartburn and healing esophageal inflammation (''esophagitis'') and esophageal ulcers that are induced by acid reflux. The PPIs are well tolerated with few side effects. After stopping these medications, ''symptoms of acid reflux'' usually recur, sometimes with increased intensity. This increase in symptoms occurs, in part, because of a rebound secretion of acid (acid hypersecretion), which is a response prompted by recovery from the inhibition of secretion of acid by the PPI.''The long-term safety of the PPIs is an important consideration. Although certain stomach tumors (carcinoids) were reported in experiments with older female rats, similar tumors have not been observed in people after more than 15 years of PPI use. In some people on long term PPI therapy, small benign polyps (fundic gland polyps) may develop in the upper half of the stomach. However, these polyps do not require follow-up or biopsy because they remain benign (do not become malignant) and cause no problems. Long-term use also is associated with a slight increased risk of hip ''fractures'' in people older than 50 years, and poor absorption of vitamin B12.''The main point to remember about PPIs is that patients should never abruptly stop them. When PPIs are discontinued, the dose should be gradually decreased (tapered). Tapering the dose minimizes the rebound hypersecretion that can occur when PPIs are stopped. If a patient is hospitalized and cannot eat (or take pills), intravenous acid-suppressing drugs at higher doses should be given. Gradual lowering (tapering) of the dose of PPIs should be done when these drugs are to be discontinued after fundoplication (''anti-reflux surgery'') operations for GERD.''In addition to drug therapy, certain lifestyle maneuvers are very important. These include:''A number of drugs, including ''tricyclic antidepressants'' and ''calcium channel blockers'', may promote gastroesophageal reflux. Therefore, if an alternative medication can be substituted for these drugs, this may help in the management of reflux. Patients with GERD should consult their physicians regarding medications that can promote reflux, and if alternatives are available.''Adjunctive (supplementary) drug therapy has been used in the past for patients whose symptoms are not easily controlled with double daily dose of a PPI. The supplementary drugs commonly used are called prokinetics. These drugs work by accelerating gastric emptying so that there is less food and fluid in the stomach for reflux. Cisapride (Propulsid) was the most commonly used drug in this class, but it was taken off the market because of adverse cardiac effects. ''Metoclopramide'' (''Reglan'') is another prokinetic agent, but it is approved only for short term use and can cause drowsiness, restlessness and more important neurological complications. Although other prokinetic drugs are available, none have had the kind of scrutiny in GERD as did cisapride. One drug that has similar actions as cisapride is ''domperidone'' (Motilium). It is available in many countries, but has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S.'""GERD, with or without the presence of Barrett's esophagus, sometimes is treated by anti-reflux surgery. This operation, called fundoplication, is done to stop the reflux of acid. Fundoplication is not done for the Barrett's esophagus itself. The operation involves wrapping the upper stomach (the fundus) around the lower end of the esophagus. The purpose of the wrap is to tighten the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in order to prevent the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus.There is no evidence that anti-reflux surgery, or for that matter, acid suppression therapy with drugs, decreases the risk of esophageal cancer among patients with Barrett's. This doesn't mean that the possibility is not affected, but it would take long term studies to prove that either medical or surgical treatment decreases the risk of cancer, and such studies are not likely to be done.""'Candidates for the fundoplication operation are patients with GERD who:''Today, this surgery is usually done laparoscopically without the need for a large incision. Therefore, patients have a much shorter recovery time and can be discharged home within a few days. In some patients, for technical reasons, the laparoscopic surgery cannot be done, and the conventional open operation is necessary.''A number of new ''endoscopic'' approaches are being evaluated to replace surgery (fundoplication) for the treatment of GERD. The idea is to endoscopically tighten up the junction between the stomach and esophagus to prevent reflux. The tightening is done during upper GI endoscopy by, for example, internally sewing (suturing) or clipping the region of the lower esophageal sphincter. As more data has become available showing that these techniques are as effective as fundoplication, they are increasingly being used as an option for managing these patients..' cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), ranitidine (Zantac), and nizatidine (Axid). omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and esomeprazole (Nexium).

Have serious complications, such as recurring strictures; or Require high doses of acid suppressing medications, and want to stop taking these medications."
Why is it important to screen patients with GERD to diagnose Barrett's esophagus?,"'Unfortunately, most cancers of the esophagus are detected too late to be treated effectively. By the time cancer-related symptoms of ''chest pain'', ''weight loss'"", and progressive difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) lead to the diagnosis, the cancer has already spread beyond the esophagus to other organs. Indeed, there is evidence that survival is markedly improved in cancers detected during the course of surveillance for dysplasia or cancer in Barrett's esophagus as compared with survival in cancers detected after ""'cancer symptoms'"" prompted medical attention. Therefore, physicians want to make the diagnosis of Barrett's in GERD patients and then begin surveillance for cancer in such patients.""""The problem is that only a small percentage of all patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or cardia have had an endoscopy to show that they have Barrett's esophagus. The challenge is to identify those GERD patients who have Barrett's by screening patients with chronic GERD. Yet, sufficient research has not been done to establish guidelines for selecting which patients with GERD should be screened by endoscopy.""""For now, until more data becomes available, it seems reasonable that if a patient with GERD cannot be taken off acid suppressing drugs after two to three years (because of persistent symptoms), an endoscopy should be done to see if Barrett's esophagus is present. One endoscopy per lifetime in patients with GERD may be sufficient to screen for Barrett's."" "
Why is it critical to be accurate in the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus?,"""When a patient is referred for endoscopy in which screening for Barrett's esophagus is to be done, it is important that any inflammation or ulcerations first be healed  with the help of acid-suppressing drugs given for at least six weeks. Most commonly this is a double daily dose of a PPI. There are two reasons to eliminate the inflammation first before diagnosing Barrett's. One is that Barrett's can be hidden beneath the inflamed, ulcerated lining. The second is that the changes that occur with inflammation of the esophageal lining may mimic dysplasia and, therefore, may lead to a falsely positive diagnosis of dysplasia.""""In the initial diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, the endoscopist (the doctor performing endoscopy) needs to provide the pathologist with three landmarks so that a precise diagnosis of Barrett's can be made.""""The reason that such precise descriptions need to be made is because a false positive diagnosis of Barrett's may have serious implications. Thus, the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus can lead to higher cost of  obtaining life, health, and disability insurance. On the other hand, it's important to know when Barrett's is, in fact, present so that the patient can be enrolled in a proper surveillance program.""""If the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is uncertain or equivocal, it is worthwhile obtaining a second opinion with specialists in a center that has extensive experience with Barrett's. There are at least three reasons for obtaining additional consultation:"" One is the location of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) or gastroesophageal junction. The second is the upper end of the squamo-columnar junction (Z line),which now (with Barrett's) is in the esophagus (moved north). The third is the location of the biopsies. To avoid concern about long term cancer risk if the diagnosis of Barrett's was incorrectly made.  To avoid difficulties with insurance that may arise with an incorrect diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus.  To begin cancer surveillance if the diagnosis of Barrett's is confirmed."
What does endoscopic biopsy surveillance in Barrett's esophagus involve?,"""In established Barrett's esophagus, endoscopic surveillance is done at periodic intervals to look for dysplasia. At the time of endoscopy, many biopsies are taken of the Barrett's mucosa. The recommended approach is to do four mucosal biopsies (one in each quadrant of the circumference of the esophagus) at the junction of the stomach and esophagus, and four more biopsies (again, one in each quadrant) should be repeated every two centimeters (about 3/4 inch) proximally until the length of the Barrett's has been completely biopsied. If available, a large forceps (the so-called jumbo forceps) is desirable to procure biopsy specimens.""'The current trend is to increase the surveillance intervals in patients who do not have dysplasia. For example, the approach may be to do the surveillance biopsies initially and then a year later. If no dysplasia is found, the surveillance can be done every three years. Other doctors would do it every two years. The bottom line for endoscopists doing surveillance, however, is: ""Do it right so we can do it less often."" There is some evidence showing that patients with cancers found during the course of surveillance have a better survival rate than those who come to the doctor because of cancer symptoms without any previous surveillance. The ultimate proof that surveillance works, however, will be obtained only when surveillance is applied to a large population at risk and not just to those who seek medical attention. The same issues pertain to other ''cancer screening'' tests (such as, ''mammography'' and  ''prostate cancer screening'').'""The problem is that onlya small percentage of patients who undergo surgery for esophageal adenocarcinoma had been diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus preoperatively. Thus, only the 5% with known Barrett's were eligible for surveillance before their surgery. The challenge is not to do more surveillance, but to conduct more screening to identify those who have Barrett's esophagus in the population with chronic GERD.""""There is great interest in developing techniques that would use targeted, rather than random biopsies in identifying areas of dysplasia or early cancer. Dysplasia often is endoscopically invisible, which means that it can't be seen just by looking at the esophageal lining through the endoscope. So, different optical enhancing techniques are being evaluated. The idea is to highlight the areas of dysplasia so that targeted biopsies can be obtained. These optical methods include the use of dye sprays (chromoendoscopy), spectrophotometry to measure light wave intensity, and a technique called optical coherence tomography. These procedures, however, remain experimental at present."" "
How is low grade dysplasia managed?,"""Low grade dysplasia is managed by continuing endoscopic biopsy surveillance. For these patients, however, the follow-up interval is shortened from every two to three years (which is done for Barrett's with no dysplasia) to every six months for an indefinite period of time. Esophagectomy is not considered for low grade dysplasia unless the patient develops high grade dysplasia or cancer during the surveillance."" "
How is high grade dysplasia managed?,"'The most common standard by which treatments for cancer or related disorders, such as dysplasia, are measured is by the five-year outcome. Esophagectomy (surgical removal of the esophagus) improves the five-year survival rate.'""The finding of high grade dysplasia in Barrett's may mean that cancer already is present. For this reason, when high grade dysplasia is found, the next step is to repeat the endoscopy and take more biopsies. For this purpose, the recommendation is to take four biopsies (one from each quadrant) every one centimeter rather than every two centimeters. If the biopsy findings again reveal just high grade dysplasia, there are a number of management options, including esophagectomy, continued biopsy surveillance, and experimental approaches.""'Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is invaluable in the staging of early cancers to determine the depth of their penetration into surrounding tissue. It also can be used to determine if dysplastic tissue has become a cancer. One sign of this would be if the EUS shows there is invasion of the surrounding tissue. This technique uses endoscopes as dedicated ''ultrasound'"" devices. In other words, these endoscopes are used only for doing endoscopic ultrasound. In other words, these endoscopes are used only for doing endoscopic ultrasound. These instruments can see through the wall of the esophagus using sound waves with much greater accuracy than, for example, a computerized tomographic (CT) scan. Endoscopic ultrasound is available in most centers that specialize in Barrett's esophagus and/or esophageal cancer.""""The gold standard for the management of high grade dysplasia is esophagectomy. Esophagectomy involves total removal of the esophagus except for a very short cuff of esophagus at its upper end. The esophagus is replaced with a segment of colon, or stomach is brought up under the breastbone and attached to the remaining cuff of the esophagus. Patients with Barrett's awaiting an esophagectomy should seek an experienced surgeon with a good reputation. This is a major operation which should only be done by a surgeon experienced in this type of procedure. They should interview the surgeon about his/her results. There is no validated or magic annual number of operations that provides enough surgical experience, but some surgeons believe it should be at least 20 per year. What is also important is not just the experience with the actual surgery, but also the experience of the team involved in the pre and post operative care.""'The operative death rate (mortality) associated with esophagectomy for high grade dysplasia and early cancer is very low. However, in the postoperative period, a host of complications (operative morbidity) may occur, most of which are transient (self-limited). These complications may include delayed gastric emptying of food, temporary ''hoarseness'', leaks where the reconstruction is performed, and strictures of the esophagus (narrowed areas caused by scarring).''Follow-up biopsy surveillance, and esophagectomy ONLY if cancer is found''Some patients with high grade dysplasia opt to have a close follow-up rather than to proceed directly to major surgery. In these individuals, endoscopic biopsy surveillance is done initially every three months for at least a year and then less often (for example, every four to six months). The understanding is that surgery (esophagectomy) will be done if carcinoma were found during the course of the follow-up. This has not been a universally popular approach except at a few centers. It requires a commitment on the part of the endoscopist to do meticulous surveillance biopsies frequently. It also requires that the patient be reconciled with the frequent follow-up procedures and with the attendant uncertainty for what the future holds.' "
What are the experimental approaches for treatment of high grade dysplasia?,"'Several experimental options are available. Patients considering\xa0these experimental treatments should seek out a research team that is doing studies with these techniques. For example, with these treatments, some patients need to be retreated, but long-term studies are needed to define how often retreatment is needed. Nevertheless, because they avoid the need for esophagectomy, these techniques may eventually prove to be ideal for patients who are medically not fit for surgery.'""Ablation therapy involves the removal of the target tissue (for example, Barrett's mucosa, high grade dysplasia, or cancer) by procedures (such as, laser or electrocoagulation) that literally destroy the tissue. The results of ablation therapy in Barrett's with dysplasia (as well as without dysplasia, which is discussed in the next section) have produced two conclusions. One is that ablation succeeds in more than half the cases. The second is that the recurrence rates at different centers differ widely.""'Photodynamic therapy'"" is a powerful method of ablation therapy. This technique involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent (for example, sodium porfimer) that is taken up by the dysplastic Barrett's cells. Approximately 48 hours later, a laser is used to ""'burn'"" the photosensitized Barrett's cells which are sensitive to the laser because of the photosensitizing agent. Normal tissue is not burned because it has not taken up the photosensitizing agent and is not sensitive to the laser. The dysplasia is eliminated in a majority of patients. However, some Barrett's esophagus remains untreated and need biopsy follow-up or additional ablation. Long-term studies will be necessary to demonstrate whether this technique prevents esophageal adenocarcinoma on a long term basis (for example, five years and longer after treatment).""'One disadvantage of photosensitizing therapy is that skin takes up some of the photosensitizing agent, and this makes the skin sensitive to normal sunlight. The sensitivity may persist for six weeks or more and can result in ''sunburn'' even with minimal exposure to direct sunlight. Patients, therefore, must remain out of the sunlight for this period. Other photosensitizing agents being tested have much less skin sensitivity, but studies are needed to determine if they are effective in eliminating the dysplasia. Esophageal narrowings (strictures) are a common complication of PDT but can be managed by endoscopically stretching (dilating) them.'""Other experimental methods of ablation are less powerful than PDT and have, therefore, been applied more often to low grade dysplasia and shorter segments of Barrett's with dysplasia (as well as to Barrett's without dysplasia, which is discussed in the next section). These methods of ablation include argon (flame) plasma coagulation (APC) and multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC). They work by burning off the dysplasia and the Barrett's lining cells using devices that are introduced through the endoscope.""'Another experimental method to treat dysplasia, especially high grade dysplasia, is the removal of dysplastic or cancerous areas of the mucosa by cutting (resecting) them out. The resection is done using snares at endoscopy, in a manner similar to the way polyps of the colon are removed at ''colonoscopy''. Again, 5-year follow-up data is necessary to determine if EMR is effective.''The newer drugs used to treat ''arthritis'', the ''COX-2 inhibitors'"", have been studied in Barrett's-associated dysplasia. The purpose of these studies is to see if these drugs can downgrade the severity of dysplasia or prevent dysplasia. This approach, which is called ""'chemoprevention'', is based upon the observation that adenomatous polyps of the colon in patients with familial polyposis (hereditary multiple colonic polyps) decrease (regress) after treatment with these drugs or even with the older nonsteroidal antii-nflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'').''The theoretical reason to try ''COX-2'"" inhibitors in Barrett's dysplasia is that the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which these drugs inhibit, ispresent in large amounts in Barrett's dysplasia, as it is in adenomatouspolyps of the colon.""""It should be stressed that long-term therapy with these drugs in Barrett's esophagus should remain in the experimental arena because of the complications or side effects associated with these drugs (for example, cardiac, kidney and gastrointestinal problems)."" "
What experimental options are there for Barrett's esophagus WITHOUT dysplasia?,"""In an ideal world, all Barrett's esophagus, with or without dysplasia, would be ablated for life. Thereby, both Barrett's and its attendant risk of cancer would be eliminated. Experimental ablation (as described above for dysplasia) is being evaluated in Barrett's without dysplasia. However, long-term studies are needed to prove the durability of the ablation (for example, with antireflux surgery or acid-suppressing drugs).""""Barrett's mucosa without dysplasia can be destroyed by using argon plasma coagulation  and multipolar electrocoagulation techniques. (As already mentioned, the more powerful PDT has been used most commonly for high grade dysplasia and cancer.) To prevent recurrence of Barrett's after ablation, however, requires the elimination of reflux for life, either with high dose acid suppressing drugs or anti-reflux surgery (fundoplication).""""After an ablation procedure, the normal squamous lining in the esophagus grows back. Sometimes, however, after ablation therapy, the residual Barrett's mucosa remains under the new lining. The outcome and importance of this subterranean Barrett's is not known. It should be stressed that ablation therapy is experimental and should be restricted to formal studies."" "
What does the future hold for Barrett's esophagus?,"""Most of the future developments in the field of Barrett's esophagus will depend on the results of research studies. The goals of such studies would be to:"" Standardize the diagnosis of Barrett's, especially to avoid over-diagnosis. Standardize how surveillance biopsies are done so that we can ""do it right and do it less often,"" and devote more resources to the next step, which is screening. Develop strategies for determining whom to screen and when to screen for the presence of Barrett's esophagus among patients with chronic GERD. At present, most GERD patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus have never had an endoscopy to determine whether they had Barrett's esophagus. • Look for biomarkers (molecular tests on tissues or in blood) that are able to separate (stratify) patients with the highest risk of cancer and who would need closer follow-up than the majority of Barrett's patients who do not. Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the techniques for ablation and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of Barrett's with and without dysplasia, and carry out long term follow-up studies to determine whether cancer is prevented. Evaluate better techniques for targeting biopsies to areas of dysplasia in order to avoid the currently used method of taking random biopsies. Evaluate better techniques for staging early cancer with refinements of endoscopic ultrasound and other imaging techniques."
What is Barrett's esophagus?,"""Barrett's esophagus is a complication of chronic ""'gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (GERD), primarily in white men. GERD is a disease in which there is reflux of acidic fluid from the stomach into the esophagus (the swallowing tube). GERD most commonly causes ''heartburn''.'""There are two requirements for the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus.""' The requirements necessitate an endoscopy of the esophagus. During endoscopy, a long flexible tube with a light and camera at its tip (an endoscope) is inserted through the mouth and down into the esophagus to view and biopsy (sample tissue from) the lining of the esophagus. The two requirements are:''Barrett\'s esophagus is officially coded by the Library of Congress for electronic searches of the literature as Barrett esophagus, but Barrett\'s esophagus (with the apostrophe ""s"") is the name used universally. The condition is named after a surgeon, Norman Barrett, who described the condition. However, it turns out that his interpretation of the findings was not correct. In 1953, Doctors\' Allison and Johnstone actually described this condition as we now understand it, namely that metaplasia was occurring. (Metaplasia, which is discussed below, is the term used when one adult tissue replaces another.) Nevertheless, the condition has been immortalized with Barrett\'s name.'""Initially, it was thought that the Barrett's esophagus consisted of stomach (gastric) tissue replacing the usual squamous tissue lining the esophagus. However, in the mid 70's, Dr. Paull and colleagues published a paper in which they described the mucosa (inner lining) of Barrett's esophagus in greater detail than had been done previously. They pointed out that Barrett's esophagus consisted of a metaplasia in which the normal cells lining the esophagus were replaced by a mixture of gastric and intestinal lining cells. The intestinal-type lining cells also are called specialized columnar cells which include goblet cells. For a number of years, some scientists thought that there were two types of Barrett's; one in which the normal lining was replaced with stomach (gastric) type cells only, and the second in which intestinal cells were present. However, the current belief is that only the presence of intestinal-type goblet cells establishes the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, regardless of what other cell types are present.""   At endoscopy, an abnormal pink or salmon-colored lining should be seen as replacing the normal whitish lining of the esophagus. This abnormal lining extends a short distance (usually less than 2.5 inches) up the esophagus from the gastroesophageal junction (the GE junction, which is where the esophagus joins the stomach). Microscopic evaluation of the biopsy of this abnormal lining should shows that the normal lining cells of the esophagus have been replaced by intestinal type lining cells, including mucus-producing cells called goblet cells. Other cells also are present, some of which resemble cells that line the stomach. However, if intestinal goblet cells are not present, the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus should not be made."
Why is there so much interest in Barrett's esophagus?,"""The reason for the great interest in Barrett's esophagus is that it is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the esophagus. The type of cancer that occurs in patients with Barrett's is adenocarcinoma, which arises from the metaplastic intestinal tissue. The usual cancer of the esophagus that is not associated with Barrett's is squamous ""'carcinoma'"", which arises from the squamous cell lining that is normally present in the esophagus. The connection between adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and Barrett's esophagus is now clear, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is increasing in frequency in most countries in the Western hemisphere.""""The good news, however, is that the cancer occurs in relatively few patients with Barrett's esophagus. Still, the main challenge in this condition is to watch for early warning signs of cancer by taking biopsies at regular intervals during endoscopy. This practice is called surveillance and is similar, in principle, to the surveillance in women for ""'cancer of the cervix'', wherein PAP smears are taken at regular intervals.' "
What causes Barrett's esophagus?,"""GERD causes Barrett's esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular tube that is located in the chest and serves to transfer food from the mouth to the stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is a valve that is located at the junction of the stomach with the esophagus. Its function is to prevent acid and other contents of the stomach from coming back into the esophagus. GERD is a condition in which excessive acid-containing fluid refluxes (flows) back into the esophagus, in part because the lower esophageal sphincter is weak. The ""'weakness'' of the LES may be related, in part, to the fact that virtually all GERD patients have ''hiatal hernia''. In patients with hiatal ''hernia'', the upper few centimeters of the stomach slides back and forth between the abdomen and the chest through the ''diaphragm''. This sliding may interfere with how the sphincter works as a barrier to reflux from the stomach to the esophagus.''Previously, the term hernia was used instead of GERD in explaining to patients the basis of their symptoms (usually heartburn) because virtually all GERD patients have hiatal hernias. GERD, however, is the more accurate term. While hiatal hernias are extremely common in the population,\xa0 only a small number of people with hiatal hernia develop GERD. In other words, the presence of a hiatal hernia does not mean that the person will develop GERD. On the flip side, however, if a person has GERD, hiatal hernia is almost always present.'""Thus, Barrett's esophagus is caused by chronic (of many years duration) and usually severe ""'acid reflux'"". In some patients with GERD, the esophagus reacts to the repeated injury from the acidic fluid by changing the type of cells lining it from squamous (normal cells) to columnar (intestinal-type cells). This transformation, called metaplasia, is believed to be a protective response because the specialized columnar epithelium (epithelium means lining) in Barrett's esophagus is more resistant to injury from acid than the squamous epithelium.""'The fluid in the stomach contains acid that is produced by the stomach. In addition, however, the fluid may contain bile acids (from bile produced by the ''liver'') and enzymes (produced by the pancreas) that have refluxed back from the duodenum into the stomach. (The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine just beyond the stomach.) The acid that refluxes from the stomach to the esophagus is injurious to the esophagus. There is some evidence, however, that the bile and pancreatic enzymes combined with the acid may be more injurious than acid alone.' "
Who develops Barrett's esophagus?,"'A significant percentage of individuals with chronic ''symptoms of GERD'"" develop Barrett's esophagus, and it is most common in Caucasian male populations. Not everyone with GERD has symptoms of GERD, however. Therefore, some people with Barrett's are unaware that they have Barrett's because they have GERD without any symptoms at all or have very mild and infrequent symptoms.""""It is unclear why Barrett's esophagus is so overwhelmingly more common in white males than in any other group. For example, although women and African-Americans do not seem to be protected from developing GERD, they are largely protected (especially African-Americans) from developing Barrett's esophagus and Barrett's cancer (adenocarcinoma). There is evidence that in the western hemisphere, ""'esophageal cancer'' and cancer of the gastroesophageal junction (called cardia cancer) are increasing in frequency, perhaps more so than any other gastrointestinal tract cancer. (However, ''colon cancer'' is still very much more common than esophageal cancer.)'""Barrett's esophagus may run in some families and be genetically determined. Studies are underway to determine if any genes or markers can be found in these families that would predict the development of Barrett's esophagus in the general population. In these families with Barrett's as well as with Barrett's in the general population, GERD is the common denominator. However, the question is why the Barrett's occurs more commonly in these families than in others with comparably severe GERD, but with no family association."" "
What is the specific abnormality in the inner lining (epithelium) of Barrett's esophagus?,"""To repeat, the first criterion for the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is the finding at endoscopy of a pink lining in the esophagus where it is normally not seen. This abnormal lining may appear  circumferentially like a band, tongue-like or as islands. The second criterion is that biopsies from the pink lining reveal the characteristic intestinalized mucosa (the lining normally seen in the ""'intestines'') with the typical goblet cells. The esophageal biopsies are obtained during an endoscopy. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a procedure in which the doctor inserts a long flexible tube (endoscope) through the mouth and down into the esophagus to directly visualize the lining of the esophagus. During the same endoscopic examination, the stomach and duodenum also can be visualized. Multiple small samples (biopsies) of the lining epithelial tissue can be obtained through the endoscope. ''As mentioned previously, the process of the replacement of one type of tissue lining by another is called metaplasia. In the stomach and intestines, metaplasia is a common response to certain types of injury. As Henry Appelman, a pathologist, stated: ""When the gut is under ''stress'' it wants to be something else."" Other examples of metaplasia in which one lining replaces another are: (1) in the stomach where chronic inflammation (''gastritis'') may result in an intestinal-type lining replacing parts of the normal stomach lining; and (2) in the duodenum (just beyond the stomach in the intestine) where peptic ulcers occur and the intestinal lining surrounding the ulcer transforms into stomach-type lining.'""We believe that the process of metaplasia is a protective or adaptive response to injury of the lining. However, the downside of metaplasia is that in Barrett's esophagus, it carries a small but definite increase in the risk of becoming cancerous. Not all metaplasias have an increased risk of cancer. For example, of the two metaplasias referred to in the previous paragraph, intestinal metaplasia in the stomach can lead to cancer, but intestinal metaplasia in the duodenum does not.""""The process of developing Barrett's begins at the junction of the stomach and esophageal linings. The esophagus normally is lined by a squamous epithelium or lining layer. This squamous epithelium has a pearly white appearance, whereas the lining in the stomach and intestines has a more salmon pink color because it is a columnar epithelium rather than a squamous epithelium. The squamous epithelium is made up of flat squamous cells, which are similar to skin cells. The stomach or gastric lining consists of taller columnar cells as seen under the microscope. The junction of the squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the gastric columnar epithelium occurs at the junction of the esophagus and stomach where, as you recall, the lower esophageal sphincter is located. The common border (interface) of these two linings is often referred to as the Z line, because when examined during an endoscopy, it has a zig zag appearance.""'With progressive injury to the esophagus, metaplasia occurs and the metaplastic tissue moves up the esophagus for a distance which varies from person to person, usually from about 0.5 to 2.5 inches (about 1 to 6 centimeters). The type of cell that gives rise to the metaplastic tissue is not known. '""Barrett's esophagus often is categorized into short- or long-segment Barrett's, based on the length of the esophagus that is affected. Short segment Barrett's generally refers to involvement of 3 centimeters or less while long segment means involvement of more than 3 centimeters of the esophagus. Interestingly, once Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed in a patient, the metaplastic lining does not seem to progress further up into the esophagus if the patient is being treated for GERD. Thus, over time, the length of involvement with Barrett's  generally remains the same.""""If biopsies are taken from patients with GERD who have a normal appearing Z line (no visible evidence of Barrett's esophagus), up to 30% will show the same intestinal type metaplasia with goblet cells as those that are seen in Barrett's esophagus. However, we do not routinely biopsy normal appearing Z lines to look for this change, nor do we do surveillance when we find it there. The reason is that limited intestinal metaplasia of the gastroesophageal junction region in GERD seems to occur with similar frequency in women and African Americans as in white men, yet the risk of overt Barrett's esophagus is much less than in white men.""""Therefore, the presence of metaplasia on a routine biopsy of a normal appearing Z line in GERD should not lead to any change in management. What's more, the finding of goblet cells in this context should not be labeled, as some have suggested, as ultrashort segment Barrett's. The main reason for not labeling it as Barrett's is that the term Barrett's implies an increased risk of cancer, and there is no evidence that this finding is associated with an increased cancer risk."" "
What about the cancer that occurs in Barrett's esophagus?,"""The type of cancer that occurs with Barrett's esophagus is adenocarcinoma. Cancer arising from the squamous lining of the esophagus is called squamous cancer or carcinoma. Among Caucasians, the rate (frequency over time) of squamous cancer is decreasing relative to Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma. Other racial groups (for example, African Americans) however, have not experienced the same rate of decline in squamous cancer relative to adenocarcinoma.""'Smoking'' and excessive ''alcohol'' ingestion are definite risk factors for squamous ''cancers'"". They also are risk factors for adenocarcinoma seen in Barrett's esophagus. In this situation, however, it is not clear if ""'smoking'' and alcohol increase the risk for adenocarcinoma by making GERD more severe or if ''smoking'' and alcohol have a more direct cancer-causing effect, as occurs in squamous cancer. Squamous cell cancers have become increasingly less common, while adenocarcinoma diagnoses have risen. Adenocarcinoma incidence in white males has risen more steeply than in other ethnic groups.'""Throughout the remainder of this section, the term esophageal cancer will refer to adenocarcinoma arising from the Barrett's esophagus.""""Cancer of the gastroesophageal junction is also called cardia cancer because the region where the esophagus meets the stomach is called the cardia. This cancer, like Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma, is found predominantly in white males, is apparently increasing in frequency at the same rate as esophageal cancer, and is associated with chronic GERD. Therefore, it has been speculated that cardia cancer starts from short segments (for example, 1-2 cm) of Barrett's. By the time the diagnosis of cancer is made, however, the  ""'tumor'"" may have spread beyond the short segment of Barrett's and may appear to be in the cardia. This speculation about the origin of cancer of the cardia, however, remains to be proven.""'An increase in the frequency of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been observed for at least 20 years, primarily in white males. One clue to the reason for this trend may be related to a decrease in the frequency of ''H. pylori'"" infection of the stomach. In other words, people with Barrett's cancer, including cardia cancer, seem to have lower rates of ""'H. pylori'' infection than others of the same age and sex in the same population.''H. pylori ''is a type of bacteria that is a major cause of ulcers. It is a very common infection worldwide and causes no symptoms in the vast majority of affected people. However, some people with ''H. pylori'' develop ''peptic ulcer'' of the stomach and duodenum. These ulcers are treated by eliminating the bacteria, which in turn, prevents relapse of the ulcers.''If ''H. pylori'' goes untreated, it causes progressive inflammation of the stomach (gastritis) which is associated with reduction in acid secretion and possibly less reflux of acid into the esophagus. In many areas of the world, this infection is decreasing in frequency, presumably because of better public health measures. Therefore, it is possible that the protective effect (such as decreased acid production) of chronic ''H. pylori'' infection has decreased. In other words, with less ''H. pylori'' gastritis, the stomach produces more acid and there is more acid to reflux into the esophagus. At the same time, we are more predisposed to reflux in our senior years. Although this is not a settled issue, the decreasing frequency of ''H. pylori'"" infection may be one reason for the increasing frequency of Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma."" "
What is dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus?,"'Dysplasia is a change in the cells lining the esophagus in which the cells actually show abnormal changes in their structure and appearance. When these changes become severe enough, (going from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia) the cells begin to appear ''malignant'"" (like cancer cells). However, unlike cancer these cells remain in place and don't invade tissues outside of the lining. Dysplasia occurs as a series of cell changes as Barrett's esophagus progresses to Barrett's-associated cancer. Patients with Barrett's are monitored with endoscopy and biopsies (surveillance) to detect these cellular changes (the dysplasia) or at worst, early cancer so that they may be treated. Currently, there is no way to predict which patients with Barrett's esophagus will develop dysplasia.""'Dysplasia also has been identified adjacent to tumors of the gastrointestinal tract other than esophageal adenocarcinoma. For example, dysplasia is found in half the cases of ''stomach cancer'' and in colon cancer, in which the dysplasia is visible as so-called adenomatous polyps. Additionally, dysplasia is the same early warning cell change that pathologists look for in PAP smears of the cervix that predict ''cervical cancer''.''Dysplasia is considered ''premalignant''. This means that if dysplasia has been demonstrated on several occasions, it is believed that the patient will develop cancer if he or she lives long enough. Dysplasia is categorized as being high grade or low grade. When high grade dysplasia is diagnosed, cancer may already be present, and if not, the risk of developing cancer sooner is greater than with the lesser grades of dysplasia.''In follow-up biopsies of patients with dysplasia, the condition may not be detected again in some patients, whereas in others, low grades of dysplasia are found. This absence or decrease of dysplasia may be due factors such as sampling variations, the removal of tiny foci (groups of cells) of dysplasia with the initial biopsy, or actual biological reversal. The exact reason(s) are unknown.''Using molecular techniques, some changes referred to as biomarkers, can be detected in biopsy specimens before dysplasia develops. These changes are similar to those that are observed in other cancers. Biomarkers include changes in the DNA content of cells, in the genes and chromosomes, and in growth factors. A number of these biomarkers can be shown to appear before and during the occurrence of dysplasia. The ultimate goal is to find a magic marker that can tell us which patients among those with no dysplasia or low grade dysplasia are more likely to develop high grade dysplasia or cancer. Such patients then can be followed by surveillance more closely than others.'""At present, all patients with Barrett's esophagus, from the surveillance point of view, are treated in the same manner. The availability of biomarkers would separate (stratify) Barrett's patients based on their risk for cancer. Such stratification would allow doctors to do surveillance endoscopy and biopsies more frequently in the minority of patients who are at greater risk of cancer and less frequently in those predicted to have a lower risk of cancer.""""Another use for proven biomarkers would be to help confirm the pathologist's interpretation of dysplasia on biopsies."" "
What is the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in Barrett's?,"""When patients with Barrett's esophagus are assessed as a group, the risk of cancer has been found to be as low as one in 300 patients yearly. This means that if we examined 300 patients yearly, one patient would be found to have cancer every year. What we really need to know is the risk of cancer if no dysplasia is found after one or two years of surveillance. Our belief is that this risk would be much less than the previously-quoted figures of one in 300 patients yearly.""'Patients with high grade dysplasia may often be found to have cancer. Therefore, the first order of management when high grade dysplasia is found is to exclude the presence of an adenocarcinoma.'""Low grade dysplasia is much less threatening than high grade dysplasia, but we don't know just how much less. In fact, we don't have precise data to indicate just what the cancer risk is in patients with Barrett's and low grade dysplasia.""""The diagnosis of dysplasia should be as precise as possible because this diagnosis can prompt a change in the treatment or the intensity of follow-up of patients with Barrett's esophagus. It requires a great deal of experience to be able to make a precise diagnosis of the presence and grade of dysplasia. Therefore, it is a common and useful practice to ask a second pathologist (or even a third, if necessary) to review the biopsies. The idea is to see if there is an agreement between the pathologists and/or to get a more experienced opinion about the presence and grade of dysplasia.""""If a person has longer segment Barrett's, one would guess that the cancer risk is greater than with shorter segment Barrett's. The data, however, is controversial in this regard. For that reason, the current practice is to do endoscopic biopsy surveillance with similar frequency in patients with short and long segment Barrett's esophagus."" "
What are the symptoms of Barrett's esophagus?,"""Barrett's esophagus has no unique symptoms. Patients with Barrett's have the symptoms of GERD (for example, heartburn, regurgitation, ""'nausea'"", etc.). The general trend is for Barrett's patients to have more severe GERD. However, not all Barrett's have marked symptoms of GERD, and some patients are detected accidentally with minimal or no symptoms of GERD.""'Heartburn is a burning sensation behind the breastbone, usually in the lower half, but may extend all the way up to the throat. Sometimes, it is accompanied by burning or ''pain'' in the pit of the stomach just below where the breastbone ends. The second most common symptom is regurgitation (backup) of bitter tasting fluid. ''GERD symptoms'' often are worse after meals and when lying flat.''The refluxed, regurgitated fluid occasionally may enter the ''lungs'' or the voice box (larynx), resulting in what are called extraesophageal (outside the esophagus) symptoms (manifestations) of GERD. These symptoms include:''For reasons not fully understood, some GERD patients have minimal heartburn but experience other GERD symptoms, for example, extraesophageal symptoms.''GERD may result in strictures and ulceration of the esophagus. A stricture or narrowing is due to scarring (fibrosis) of the esophagus that may cause difficulty in swallowing (''dysphagia''). The ''dysphagia'' is sensed as a sticking (stopping) of solid food in the chest (in the esophagus), and liquids when the narrowing is severe. Strictures can be treated by stretching them with dilators during endoscopy. Untreated, strictures may promote more spillage of food and/or gastric fluids into the lungs. Uncommonly, massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding caused by inflammation of the esophagus may occur. Such bleeding results in ''vomiting'' of blood or passage of black or maroon stools. More commonly, however, an inflamed esophagus can cause slow bleeding that is detected when ''anemia'' (a ''low red blood cell count'') is found and/or stools are tested for blood.'   new onset adult asthma, frequent bronchitis, chronic cough, sore throats, and hoarseness."
How is GERD with or without Barrett's esophagus treated?,"""The medical treatments for the symptoms of Barrett's esophagus are the same as those for GERD.""'The suppression of acid is the backbone of treatment for GERD. For mild reflux symptoms, over the counter medications are commonly used, ranging from antacids to low doses of drugs called H-2 receptor antagonists or H2 blockers. Examples of over the counter H2 blockers are ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet'') and ''famotidine'' (''Pepcid''). For more persistent symptoms, higher (prescription-strength) doses of the H-2 receptor antagonist drugs may be used, for example:''However, for persistent symptoms requiring maintenance (ongoing) therapy or for complicated GERD with strictures or bleeding, ''proton pump inhibitors'' (''PPIs'') are used. Examples of PPIs are:''Some patients need to take only one pill daily, while others need two pills (a double dose) to control the symptoms. The double dose can be taken as one pill twice daily or 2 pills once daily.''PPIs are potent inhibitors of acid secretion from the stomach. They are effective in relieving heartburn and healing esophageal inflammation (''esophagitis'') and esophageal ulcers that are induced by acid reflux. The PPIs are well tolerated with few side effects. After stopping these medications, ''symptoms of acid reflux'' usually recur, sometimes with increased intensity. This increase in symptoms occurs, in part, because of a rebound secretion of acid (acid hypersecretion), which is a response prompted by recovery from the inhibition of secretion of acid by the PPI.''The long-term safety of the PPIs is an important consideration. Although certain stomach tumors (carcinoids) were reported in experiments with older female rats, similar tumors have not been observed in people after more than 15 years of PPI use. In some people on long term PPI therapy, small benign polyps (fundic gland polyps) may develop in the upper half of the stomach. However, these polyps do not require follow-up or biopsy because they remain benign (do not become malignant) and cause no problems. Long-term use also is associated with a slight increased risk of hip ''fractures'' in people older than 50 years, and poor absorption of vitamin B12.''The main point to remember about PPIs is that patients should never abruptly stop them. When PPIs are discontinued, the dose should be gradually decreased (tapered). Tapering the dose minimizes the rebound hypersecretion that can occur when PPIs are stopped. If a patient is hospitalized and cannot eat (or take pills), intravenous acid-suppressing drugs at higher doses should be given. Gradual lowering (tapering) of the dose of PPIs should be done when these drugs are to be discontinued after fundoplication (''anti-reflux surgery'') operations for GERD.''In addition to drug therapy, certain lifestyle maneuvers are very important. These include:''A number of drugs, including ''tricyclic antidepressants'' and ''calcium channel blockers'', may promote gastroesophageal reflux. Therefore, if an alternative medication can be substituted for these drugs, this may help in the management of reflux. Patients with GERD should consult their physicians regarding medications that can promote reflux, and if alternatives are available.''Adjunctive (supplementary) drug therapy has been used in the past for patients whose symptoms are not easily controlled with double daily dose of a PPI. The supplementary drugs commonly used are called prokinetics. These drugs work by accelerating gastric emptying so that there is less food and fluid in the stomach for reflux. Cisapride (Propulsid) was the most commonly used drug in this class, but it was taken off the market because of adverse cardiac effects. ''Metoclopramide'' (''Reglan'') is another prokinetic agent, but it is approved only for short term use and can cause drowsiness, restlessness and more important neurological complications. Although other prokinetic drugs are available, none have had the kind of scrutiny in GERD as did cisapride. One drug that has similar actions as cisapride is ''domperidone'' (Motilium). It is available in many countries, but has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S.'""GERD, with or without the presence of Barrett's esophagus, sometimes is treated by anti-reflux surgery. This operation, called fundoplication, is done to stop the reflux of acid. Fundoplication is not done for the Barrett's esophagus itself. The operation involves wrapping the upper stomach (the fundus) around the lower end of the esophagus. The purpose of the wrap is to tighten the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in order to prevent the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus.There is no evidence that anti-reflux surgery, or for that matter, acid suppression therapy with drugs, decreases the risk of esophageal cancer among patients with Barrett's. This doesn't mean that the possibility is not affected, but it would take long term studies to prove that either medical or surgical treatment decreases the risk of cancer, and such studies are not likely to be done.""'Candidates for the fundoplication operation are patients with GERD who:''Today, this surgery is usually done laparoscopically without the need for a large incision. Therefore, patients have a much shorter recovery time and can be discharged home within a few days. In some patients, for technical reasons, the laparoscopic surgery cannot be done, and the conventional open operation is necessary.''A number of new ''endoscopic'' approaches are being evaluated to replace surgery (fundoplication) for the treatment of GERD. The idea is to endoscopically tighten up the junction between the stomach and esophagus to prevent reflux. The tightening is done during upper GI endoscopy by, for example, internally sewing (suturing) or clipping the region of the lower esophageal sphincter. As more data has become available showing that these techniques are as effective as fundoplication, they are increasingly being used as an option for managing these patients..' cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), ranitidine (Zantac), and nizatidine (Axid). omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and esomeprazole (Nexium). Losing weight, if overweight. Change the diet, by reducing fat, chocolate, caffeine, and acid food and fluids (for example, citrus). Stop smoking. Avoid excessive alcohol. Avoid food and fluids for 90 to 120 minutes before going to bed. Elevate the upper body when lying in bed by (for example, putting blocks under the head of the bed). Have serious complications, such as recurring strictures; or Require high doses of acid suppressing medications, and want to stop taking these medications."
Why is it important to screen patients with GERD to diagnose Barrett's esophagus?,"'Unfortunately, most cancers of the esophagus are detected too late to be treated effectively. By the time cancer-related symptoms of ''chest pain'', ''weight loss'"", and progressive difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) lead to the diagnosis, the cancer has already spread beyond the esophagus to other organs. Indeed, there is evidence that survival is markedly improved in cancers detected during the course of surveillance for dysplasia or cancer in Barrett's esophagus as compared with survival in cancers detected after ""'cancer symptoms'"" prompted medical attention. Therefore, physicians want to make the diagnosis of Barrett's in GERD patients and then begin surveillance for cancer in such patients.""""The problem is that only a small percentage of all patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or cardia have had an endoscopy to show that they have Barrett's esophagus. The challenge is to identify those GERD patients who have Barrett's by screening patients with chronic GERD. Yet, sufficient research has not been done to establish guidelines for selecting which patients with GERD should be screened by endoscopy.""""For now, until more data becomes available, it seems reasonable that if a patient with GERD cannot be taken off acid suppressing drugs after two to three years (because of persistent symptoms), an endoscopy should be done to see if Barrett's esophagus is present. One endoscopy per lifetime in patients with GERD may be sufficient to screen for Barrett's."" "
Why is it critical to be accurate in the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus?,"""When a patient is referred for endoscopy in which screening for Barrett's esophagus is to be done, it is important that any inflammation or ulcerations first be healed  with the help of acid-suppressing drugs given for at least six weeks. Most commonly this is a double daily dose of a PPI. There are two reasons to eliminate the inflammation first before diagnosing Barrett's. One is that Barrett's can be hidden beneath the inflamed, ulcerated lining. The second is that the changes that occur with inflammation of the esophageal lining may mimic dysplasia and, therefore, may lead to a falsely positive diagnosis of dysplasia.""""In the initial diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, the endoscopist (the doctor performing endoscopy) needs to provide the pathologist with three landmarks so that a precise diagnosis of Barrett's can be made.""""The reason that such precise descriptions need to be made is because a false positive diagnosis of Barrett's may have serious implications. Thus, the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus can lead to higher cost of  obtaining life, health, and disability insurance. On the other hand, it's important to know when Barrett's is, in fact, present so that the patient can be enrolled in a proper surveillance program.""""If the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is uncertain or equivocal, it is worthwhile obtaining a second opinion with specialists in a center that has extensive experience with Barrett's. There are at least three reasons for obtaining additional consultation:"" One is the location of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) or gastroesophageal junction. The second is the upper end of the squamo-columnar junction (Z line),which now (with Barrett's) is in the esophagus (moved north). The third is the location of the biopsies. To avoid concern about long term cancer risk if the diagnosis of Barrett's was incorrectly made.  To avoid difficulties with insurance that may arise with an incorrect diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus.  To begin cancer surveillance if the diagnosis of Barrett's is confirmed."
What does endoscopic biopsy surveillance in Barrett's esophagus involve?,"""In established Barrett's esophagus, endoscopic surveillance is done at periodic intervals to look for dysplasia. At the time of endoscopy, many biopsies are taken of the Barrett's mucosa. The recommended approach is to do four mucosal biopsies (one in each quadrant of the circumference of the esophagus) at the junction of the stomach and esophagus, and four more biopsies (again, one in each quadrant) should be repeated every two centimeters (about 3/4 inch) proximally until the length of the Barrett's has been completely biopsied. If available, a large forceps (the so-called jumbo forceps) is desirable to procure biopsy specimens.""'The current trend is to increase the surveillance intervals in patients who do not have dysplasia. For example, the approach may be to do the surveillance biopsies initially and then a year later. If no dysplasia is found, the surveillance can be done every three years. Other doctors would do it every two years. The bottom line for endoscopists doing surveillance, however, is: ""Do it right so we can do it less often."" There is some evidence showing that patients with cancers found during the course of surveillance have a better survival rate than those who come to the doctor because of cancer symptoms without any previous surveillance. The ultimate proof that surveillance works, however, will be obtained only when surveillance is applied to a large population at risk and not just to those who seek medical attention. The same issues pertain to other ''cancer screening'' tests (such as, ''mammography'' and  ''prostate cancer screening'').'""The problem is that onlya small percentage of patients who undergo surgery for esophageal adenocarcinoma had been diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus preoperatively. Thus, only the 5% with known Barrett's were eligible for surveillance before their surgery. The challenge is not to do more surveillance, but to conduct more screening to identify those who have Barrett's esophagus in the population with chronic GERD.""""There is great interest in developing techniques that would use targeted, rather than random biopsies in identifying areas of dysplasia or early cancer. Dysplasia often is endoscopically invisible, which means that it can't be seen just by looking at the esophageal lining through the endoscope. So, different optical enhancing techniques are being evaluated. The idea is to highlight the areas of dysplasia so that targeted biopsies can be obtained. These optical methods include the use of dye sprays (chromoendoscopy), spectrophotometry to measure light wave intensity, and a technique called optical coherence tomography. These procedures, however, remain experimental at present."" "
How is low grade dysplasia managed?,"""Low grade dysplasia is managed by continuing endoscopic biopsy surveillance. For these patients, however, the follow-up interval is shortened from every two to three years (which is done for Barrett's with no dysplasia) to every six months for an indefinite period of time. Esophagectomy is not considered for low grade dysplasia unless the patient develops high grade dysplasia or cancer during the surveillance."" "
How is high grade dysplasia managed?,"'The most common standard by which treatments for cancer or related disorders, such as dysplasia, are measured is by the five-year outcome. Esophagectomy (surgical removal of the esophagus) improves the five-year survival rate.'""The finding of high grade dysplasia in Barrett's may mean that cancer already is present. For this reason, when high grade dysplasia is found, the next step is to repeat the endoscopy and take more biopsies. For this purpose, the recommendation is to take four biopsies (one from each quadrant) every one centimeter rather than every two centimeters. If the biopsy findings again reveal just high grade dysplasia, there are a number of management options, including esophagectomy, continued biopsy surveillance, and experimental approaches.""'Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is invaluable in the staging of early cancers to determine the depth of their penetration into surrounding tissue. It also can be used to determine if dysplastic tissue has become a cancer. One sign of this would be if the EUS shows there is invasion of the surrounding tissue. This technique uses endoscopes as dedicated ''ultrasound'"" devices. In other words, these endoscopes are used only for doing endoscopic ultrasound. In other words, these endoscopes are used only for doing endoscopic ultrasound. These instruments can see through the wall of the esophagus using sound waves with much greater accuracy than, for example, a computerized tomographic (CT) scan. Endoscopic ultrasound is available in most centers that specialize in Barrett's esophagus and/or esophageal cancer.""""The gold standard for the management of high grade dysplasia is esophagectomy. Esophagectomy involves total removal of the esophagus except for a very short cuff of esophagus at its upper end. The esophagus is replaced with a segment of colon, or stomach is brought up under the breastbone and attached to the remaining cuff of the esophagus. Patients with Barrett's awaiting an esophagectomy should seek an experienced surgeon with a good reputation. This is a major operation which should only be done by a surgeon experienced in this type of procedure. They should interview the surgeon about his/her results. There is no validated or magic annual number of operations that provides enough surgical experience, but some surgeons believe it should be at least 20 per year. What is also important is not just the experience with the actual surgery, but also the experience of the team involved in the pre and post operative care.""'The operative death rate (mortality) associated with esophagectomy for high grade dysplasia and early cancer is very low. However, in the postoperative period, a host of complications (operative morbidity) may occur, most of which are transient (self-limited). These complications may include delayed gastric emptying of food, temporary ''hoarseness'', leaks where the reconstruction is performed, and strictures of the esophagus (narrowed areas caused by scarring).''Follow-up biopsy surveillance, and esophagectomy ONLY if cancer is found''Some patients with high grade dysplasia opt to have a close follow-up rather than to proceed directly to major surgery. In these individuals, endoscopic biopsy surveillance is done initially every three months for at least a year and then less often (for example, every four to six months). The understanding is that surgery (esophagectomy) will be done if carcinoma were found during the course of the follow-up. This has not been a universally popular approach except at a few centers. It requires a commitment on the part of the endoscopist to do meticulous surveillance biopsies frequently. It also requires that the patient be reconciled with the frequent follow-up procedures and with the attendant uncertainty for what the future holds.' "
What are the experimental approaches for treatment of high grade dysplasia?,"'Several experimental options are available. Patients considering\xa0these experimental treatments should seek out a research team that is doing studies with these techniques. For example, with these treatments, some patients need to be retreated, but long-term studies are needed to define how often retreatment is needed. Nevertheless, because they avoid the need for esophagectomy, these techniques may eventually prove to be ideal for patients who are medically not fit for surgery.'""Ablation therapy involves the removal of the target tissue (for example, Barrett's mucosa, high grade dysplasia, or cancer) by procedures (such as, laser or electrocoagulation) that literally destroy the tissue. The results of ablation therapy in Barrett's with dysplasia (as well as without dysplasia, which is discussed in the next section) have produced two conclusions. One is that ablation succeeds in more than half the cases. The second is that the recurrence rates at different centers differ widely.""'Photodynamic therapy'"" is a powerful method of ablation therapy. This technique involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent (for example, sodium porfimer) that is taken up by the dysplastic Barrett's cells. Approximately 48 hours later, a laser is used to ""'burn'"" the photosensitized Barrett's cells which are sensitive to the laser because of the photosensitizing agent. Normal tissue is not burned because it has not taken up the photosensitizing agent and is not sensitive to the laser. The dysplasia is eliminated in a majority of patients. However, some Barrett's esophagus remains untreated and need biopsy follow-up or additional ablation. Long-term studies will be necessary to demonstrate whether this technique prevents esophageal adenocarcinoma on a long term basis (for example, five years and longer after treatment).""'One disadvantage of photosensitizing therapy is that skin takes up some of the photosensitizing agent, and this makes the skin sensitive to normal sunlight. The sensitivity may persist for six weeks or more and can result in ''sunburn'' even with minimal exposure to direct sunlight. Patients, therefore, must remain out of the sunlight for this period. Other photosensitizing agents being tested have much less skin sensitivity, but studies are needed to determine if they are effective in eliminating the dysplasia. Esophageal narrowings (strictures) are a common complication of PDT but can be managed by endoscopically stretching (dilating) them.'""Other experimental methods of ablation are less powerful than PDT and have, therefore, been applied more often to low grade dysplasia and shorter segments of Barrett's with dysplasia (as well as to Barrett's without dysplasia, which is discussed in the next section). These methods of ablation include argon (flame) plasma coagulation (APC) and multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC). They work by burning off the dysplasia and the Barrett's lining cells using devices that are introduced through the endoscope.""'Another experimental method to treat dysplasia, especially high grade dysplasia, is the removal of dysplastic or cancerous areas of the mucosa by cutting (resecting) them out. The resection is done using snares at endoscopy, in a manner similar to the way polyps of the colon are removed at ''colonoscopy''. Again, 5-year follow-up data is necessary to determine if EMR is effective.''The newer drugs used to treat ''arthritis'', the ''COX-2 inhibitors'"", have been studied in Barrett's-associated dysplasia. The purpose of these studies is to see if these drugs can downgrade the severity of dysplasia or prevent dysplasia. This approach, which is called ""'chemoprevention'', is based upon the observation that adenomatous polyps of the colon in patients with familial polyposis (hereditary multiple colonic polyps) decrease (regress) after treatment with these drugs or even with the older nonsteroidal antii-nflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'').''The theoretical reason to try ''COX-2'"" inhibitors in Barrett's dysplasia is that the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which these drugs inhibit, ispresent in large amounts in Barrett's dysplasia, as it is in adenomatouspolyps of the colon.""""It should be stressed that long-term therapy with these drugs in Barrett's esophagus should remain in the experimental arena because of the complications or side effects associated with these drugs (for example, cardiac, kidney and gastrointestinal problems)."" "
What experimental options are there for Barrett's esophagus WITHOUT dysplasia?,"""In an ideal world, all Barrett's esophagus, with or without dysplasia, would be ablated for life. Thereby, both Barrett's and its attendant risk of cancer would be eliminated. Experimental ablation (as described above for dysplasia) is being evaluated in Barrett's without dysplasia. However, long-term studies are needed to prove the durability of the ablation (for example, with antireflux surgery or acid-suppressing drugs).""""Barrett's mucosa without dysplasia can be destroyed by using argon plasma coagulation  and multipolar electrocoagulation techniques. (As already mentioned, the more powerful PDT has been used most commonly for high grade dysplasia and cancer.) To prevent recurrence of Barrett's after ablation, however, requires the elimination of reflux for life, either with high dose acid suppressing drugs or anti-reflux surgery (fundoplication).""""After an ablation procedure, the normal squamous lining in the esophagus grows back. Sometimes, however, after ablation therapy, the residual Barrett's mucosa remains under the new lining. The outcome and importance of this subterranean Barrett's is not known. It should be stressed that ablation therapy is experimental and should be restricted to formal studies."" "
What does the future hold for Barrett's esophagus?,"""Most of the future developments in the field of Barrett's esophagus will depend on the results of research studies. The goals of such studies would be to:"" Standardize the diagnosis of Barrett's, especially to avoid over-diagnosis. Standardize how surveillance biopsies are done so that we can ""do it right and do it less often,"" and devote more resources to the next step, which is screening. Develop strategies for determining whom to screen and when to screen for the presence of Barrett's esophagus among patients with chronic GERD. At present, most GERD patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus have never had an endoscopy to determine whether they had Barrett's esophagus. • Look for biomarkers (molecular tests on tissues or in blood) that are able to separate (stratify) patients with the highest risk of cancer and who would need closer follow-up than the majority of Barrett's patients who do not. Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the techniques for ablation and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of Barrett's with and without dysplasia, and carry out long term follow-up studies to determine whether cancer is prevented. Evaluate better techniques for targeting biopsies to areas of dysplasia in order to avoid the currently used method of taking random biopsies. Evaluate better techniques for staging early cancer with refinements of endoscopic ultrasound and other imaging techniques."
What are barrier methods of birth control (contraception)?,"'Barrier methods of contraception work by creating a physical barrier between sperm and egg cells so that fertilization cannot occur. The most common forms of barrier contraception are:''Spermicides, a form of chemical contraceptive that work by killing sperm, are often combined with barrier methods of contraception for greater effectiveness.''Barrier methods of contraception generally do not have the side effects of hormonal contraceptives, and some forms of barrier contraception (contraceptive sponges and condoms) may be obtained without a prescription and easily purchased over the counter at pharmacies.''The only medical contraindication to the use of barrier contraception is ''latex allergy'' (when using latex condoms). However, with the exception of male and female condoms that can provide some protection against infection with sexually-transmitted diseases (''STDs''), most methods of barrier contraception are not effective in preventing STDs.'  condoms (male and female), diaphragm, cervical cap, and contraceptive sponge."
Spermicides,"""During sexual intercourse, hundreds of millions of sperm are normally released into a woman's vagina. The large majority of these sperm die. They die because of the vagina's unfriendly environment, which is acidic, and because the ""'mucus'"" in the cervix above the vagina acts as a selective filter for the sperm. Only about 1% of all the sperm released in an ejaculation successfully pass through the woman's vagina and cervix to reach the uterus (the womb). However, it only takes one sperm to fertilize the ovum (the egg) and to achieve ""'conception''.''Spermicides are a type of contraceptive agent that work by killing sperm.'""Spermicides need to be placed in a woman's vagina prior to intercourse if they are to prevent viable sperm from reaching her uterus. Spermicides come in a wide variety of forms, including jellies, creams, foams, films, and suppositories. The active ingredient in essentially all spermicides is Nonoxynol-9. This is a detergent-like chemical that kills sperm (i.e. spermicidal).""'Once placed inside the vagina, the spermicide melts into a liquid that coats the vagina in order to provide a chemical barrier between the sperm and the cervix. Spermicidal foams are more effective than creams or jellies. Not only is it possible to achieve a better distribution with foam, but foam adheres better to the vaginal walls and cervix.''Suppositories are solid or semi-solid inserts which must be inserted in the vagina 15 minutes before intercourse in order to bind with vaginal moisture and liquefy.''Vaginal contraceptive film needs to be in place in the vagina about 5 minutes prior to sexual intercourse in order to liquefy and become effective.'""Spermicides resemble other methods of birth control in that they must be used properly in order to prevent pregnancy. Each type of spermicide has a unique method of use. For example, spermicidal creams, gels, and foams need to be deposited high up in the vagina near the cervix. Spermicidal suppositories must be unwrapped and inserted in the vagina. Squares of spermicidal film should be inserted into the vagina with the user's finger. It is important to follow the package's exact instructions.""""A spermicide should be placed in the vagina prior to the man's penis entering the vagina. It is a common mistake for a couple to wait too long before using the spermicide.""'There are two basic concerns with any given spermicide. 1) How long the spermicide stays in the desired place; and 2) how long the spermicide is active in killing sperm. Therefore, the timing of spermicide use must take into account both of these factors.''In general, spermicides tend to be effective soon after their application. They can be inserted 15 minutes or more before intercourse. However, if there is a significant delay before intercourse (for example an hour), more spermicide must be added.''A fresh application of spermicide must also be used for each act of intercourse.''Douching'' should be avoided for at least 8 hours after the last intercourse.''The effectiveness of spermicides in preventing pregnancy varies from 70 to 90%. This depends on the amount of spermicide and how it is used, the timing of use prior to intercourse, and how well the instructions on the package are followed.''Spermicides should not be used as protection for the woman or man against sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs). While spermicides may be partially protective against certain organisms that cause sexually transmitted infections, (e.g. ''Chlamydia'' and ''gonorrhea''), they also do not protect against the ''human Immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') infection.''The main objection voiced concerning spermicides is that they are ""messy."" A small percent (2% to 4%) of people may have an adverse reaction to Nonoxynol-9, which is experienced as an irritation or a burning sensation within the vagina or on the external genitalia.''Spermicides have some positive features. They are relatively inexpensive and they are available over-the- counter (OTC) without a prescription.''Note that some lubricating jellies available ''over-the-counter'' do not contain spermicide and are not meant to be used as a form of birth control. It is important to check the information on the package to be sure that the product contains spermicide or that the word ""contraceptive"" appears on the label.' "
Male condom,"'Male condoms are far more common than female condoms. A ''male condom'"" is a thin sheath that is worn over the man's penis during sexual intercourse. The ""'condom'' collects sperm so that it is not released into the vagina. Condoms are known as rubbers, sheaths, prophylactics, and many other names.''Condoms are made from a variety of materials including latex, rubber, ''plastic'' polyurethane, and animal tissue. They are also available in a variety of sizes, colors, styles, and thicknesses. They may be dry, lubricated, or treated with a spermicide. Although convenient, a wallet is not the best place to store condoms. Condoms last longer when they are stored under less moist conditions. In general, condoms have a shelf life of about five years if stored unopened in a cool, dry place.'""A condom must be the correct size and fit the man's erect penis properly. There should be 1/2 inch (about 1.25 cm) at the tip of the condom to provide a space for the sperm-filled semen to collect. Some condoms have this feature built in.""'Prior to any contact between the penis and the vagina, the condom is unrolled over the erect penis, ensuring the condom is not turned backwards or inside out. Some condoms come pre-lubricated. If additional lubrication is desired, a water-based product should be used. Spermicides may be used as lubricants with condoms and may thus increase the efficacy of the condom. Oil-based products such as Vaseline, vaginal creams, or mineral oil, may damage the condom and should never be used.''There is an obvious problem of lack of barrier protection if the condom breaks, slips, or comes off the penis. Condoms are quality controlled in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for manufacturing defects that could result in breakage. Condom failure can also be caused by the user and/or his partner. For example, long fingernails or jewelry can tear condoms.''Immediately after ejaculation, the condom should be removed from the vagina. It should be held firmly in place at the base of his penis, as it is withdrawn from the vagina. Care must be taken not to spill any of the ejaculate from the condom.''Each condom must be discarded after a single use. A new condom must be used for the next act of intercourse. Male condoms are not reusable.''Condoms can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. Most of those on the market are made of latex. The estimated effectiveness of the latex condom is 87% to 90% or 10 to 13 ''pregnancies''/100 women per year of sexual activity.''About 1% to 3% of people are ''allergic'' to latex. In such cases, they may be able to use condoms made of polyurethane, a type of plastic, can often be used. However, polyurethane condoms may break more easily than latex condoms and they do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs).''Latex condoms afford the maximum protection against sexually transmitted infections including ''HIV'' (human immunodeficiency virus) and ''herpes'' virus. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), consistent and correct usage of latex condoms:''Animal membrane condoms, made from the ''intestines'' of sheep, when used with contraceptive foam, can be effective in preventing pregnancy, but they may not provide adequate protection against all sexually transmitted infections. This is because the pores in the animal tissue permit small organisms such as ''viruses'' to pass through.''The most frequent complaint lodged regarding condoms is that their usage decreases sexual pleasure for the male. This is an unfortunate attitude because male condoms are an effective, acceptable, inexpensive, and safe method of birth control.' is highly effective in preventing sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. reduces the risk for many STDs that are transmitted by genital fluids (STDs such as Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis). reduces the risk for genital ulcer diseases, such as genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid, only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected. may reduce the risk for genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-associated diseases (for example, genital warts and cervical cancer)."
Female condom,"""The female condom is not well known in the United States. It is essentially a cylindrical vaginal pouch made of soft polyurethane (a type of plastic) with a ring at either end. One end of the pouch is open. The other end is closed. A woman inserts the closed end high up in her vagina over her cervix. The open end remains on the outside of her vagina. The vagina is now lined with the condom. When she has intercourse, the man inserts his penis into the open end of the woman's condom. Once intercourse is over and the man withdraws his penis, the condom containing the semen can now be removed and discarded.""'The female condom can be put in up to 8 hours before intercourse. A significant amount of practice may be necessary before a woman can properly insert and position a female condom. The sides of the internal ring can be folded together and inserted into the vagina much like a diaphragm is inserted. The female condom is thinner than the male condom and is resistant to degradation by oil-based lubricants.''A female condom should never be used when the man is also wearing a condom. The two condoms can stick together and tear, resulting in a total loss of protection.''The female condom (Reality) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993. The Reality Condom is made of polyurethane, but other types of female condoms are available in other areas of the world. Its estimated effectiveness is 85% (15 pregnancies/100 women per year) as compared to 87% to 90% for the male condom.''Problems associated with the female condom include irritation and allergic reactions to the polyurethane. Other concerns are that the female condom is cumbersome, difficult to insert, may not remain in place, and is unattractive. It may also produce unpleasant noises if there is not enough lubrication. For this reason, most female condoms are now generously pre-lubricated with silicone and packets of additional lubricant are included. The lubricant does not contain spermicide.''The female condom (Reality) can be purchased over-the counter (OTC) without a prescription, but it may cost more than a male condom. Package instructions currently advise single use but studies are underway to determine if the female condom can be safely washed and reused up to five times.''The main disadvantage of the female condom is that it is not as effective as its male latex counterpart.''The main disadvantage of the female condom is that it is not as effective as the male latex condom in preventing pregnancy.' "
Contraceptive sponge,"'The contraceptive sponge is a doughnut-shaped ring of polyurethane foam and is impregnated with the spermicide Nonoxynol-9. This chemical confers most of the contraceptive efficacy of this product.''Before intercourse, a woman inserts the sponge high into the vagina in the manner similar to the insertion of a tampon. The spermicidal sponge should then act as a barrier in order to prevent sperm from reaching the cervix. Once in place, the sponge provides protection for up to 24 hours without the need for additional spermicide.''The sponge must remain in the vagina for at least 6 hours following intercourse in order to provide optimum contraception. However, the same sponge should never remain in the vagina for more than a total of 30 hours because of the risk of ''toxic shock syndrome''. (''Toxic shock syndrome'' is an uncommon and potentially very serious illness that is caused by a type of bacteria. This illness occurs when certain types of products, such as tampons,are left in place for excessive periods of time. Package inserts for these products are careful to specify how long they may be safely kept in place. Each sponge is discarded after a single use.''The sponge is generally an effective birth control. Some users of the contraceptive sponge may experience irritation and allergic reactions. The sponge can also be difficult to remove from the vagina. Removal has been made easier by the addition of a woven polyester loop which can be more easily grasped with the fingers.''The estimated contraceptive efficacy of the sponge is estimated to be between 64% and 82%. The spermicide may provide some protection against ''Chlamydia'' and gonorrhea, but otherwise, the degree of this protection is unknown.' "
Diaphragm,"'The diaphragm is a soft, flexible, dome-shaped latex cup which is inserted into the vagina prior to intercourse. The rim of the cup contains a coil spring of metal which serves to hold it in place. The diaphragm blocks access to the cervix so that sperm cannot pass from the vagina into the uterus. The diaphragm must be covered on both sides and especially around its rim with spermicidal jelly, cream, or foam in order to form a tight seal with the vaginal walls.''A woman should insert the diaphragm into her vagina no more than 4 hours prior to intercourse. Following ''coitus'', she should check the diaphragm should be checked to ensure that it was not mechanically dislodged. The diaphragm must be left in place for at least 6-8 hours following intercourse, at which time it should be removed. Additional spermicidal jelly or foam must be inserted into the vagina each act of intercourse.''Since diaphragms are only available with a prescription, a woman must see a health care practitioner to have a diaphragm properly fitted (they come in a range of sizes), and to learn proper insertion techniques. There are no known long-term health risks associated with using the diaphragm and spermicide method of birth control. Some women may find spermicides to be irritating, but changing brands of spermicides may help. There is also an increased risk of ''urinary tract infections'' with diaphragm use. One possible reason is that the diaphragm puts increased pressure on the urethra or the spermicide may contribute to irritation leading to infection. (The cervical cap is not associated with increases in ''urinary tract infections''.)''The diaphragm may be appealing to women because it offers a safe temporary (not permanent) birth control that is under her control.''When the diaphragm and spermicide are used correctly, they are thought to have over an 82% success rate (18 pregnancies/100 women per year). To ensure protection, it is important to check the diaphragm after every use for rips or holes after each usage. This is best accomplished by filling the diaphragm with water and then holding it up to the light to observe for leakage. Also, the fit of the diaphragm should be checked annually, following pregnancy, and after significant ''weight loss''.''Using a diaphragm does not confer protection against sexually transmitted infections, although the spermicide does give partial protection against gonorrhea and Chlamydia. It can, however, be used with condoms in order to confer some protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
Cervical cap,"'The cervical cap is a small (1-1/2 inches or about 3 cm.), thimble-shaped dome made of latex or silicone rubber (it is much smaller than a diaphragm) which fits directly over the cervix. The cervical cap is used in conjunction with a spermicide. One small application of spermicide is placed inside the cap at the time of insertion. The cap plus spermicide prevent sperm from going through the cervix and entering the uterus.''The cervical cap is gently inserted into the vagina and positioned over her cervix. It can be inserted as long as 8 hours prior to intercourse, and can be allowed to remain in place for up to 48 hours. Unlike the diaphragm, fresh spermicidal jelly or foam does not need to be added with each act of intercourse as long as the cervical cap is correctly positioned over the cervix.''As with the diaphragm, a cervical cap requires a prescription. A woman must see a health care practitioner to determine the correct size and to ensure that she understands the proper insertion and removal techniques.''There are no known significant health risks associated with using the cervical cap and spermicide. The cervical cap can be difficult to insert, but it may be helpful for women who are unable to use a diaphragm because of poor muscle tone. Women who suffer from recurring urinary tract infections related to diaphragm usage may also want to elect to try the cervical cap.''It is important to remember that using a cervical cap does not protect from sexually transmitted infections, although spermicides may give some protection against Chlamydia and gonorrhea.''When the cervical cap and spermicide are used properly, they are more than 80% effective in achieving reliable contraception.' "
What are natural methods of contraception?,"'Natural methods of ''contraception'' are considered ""natural"" because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.''The ''fertility'' awareness methods'' (FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicate ''ovulation'' has occurred or is about to occur.'""On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next ""'menstrual period''. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days in ''fertile'' mucus), the actual time during which a woman may become ''pregnant'' is measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.''FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control. Although these methods were developed to prevent pregnancy, they can equally be well used by a couple to increase fertility and promote ''conception''.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of natural birth control?,"'Natural methods are typically very inexpensive compared to other methods of birth control unless a woman chooses to purchase ovulation test kits.' A woman does not need to take medication or use hormonal manipulation. No procedures or fittings by a physician are required. It can be difficult to estimate or know precisely when a woman is fertile, allowing increased chances for unplanned conception. Natural methods are not as effective as some forms of contraception. Ovulation test kits are used by some couples using natural methods of contraception, and the cost of these kits is another potential disadvantage. Being unable to have intercourse at certain times of the month is a disadvantage for some women."
Calendar rhythm method,"""The calendar rhythm method to avoid pregnancy relies upon calculating a woman's fertile period on the calendar. Based upon her 12 previous menstrual cycles, a woman subtracts l8 days from her shortest menstrual cycle to determine her first fertile day, and 11 days from her longest menstrual cycle to determine her last fertile day. She can then calculate the total number of days during which she may ovulate. If a woman's menstrual cycles are quite irregular from month to month, there will be a greater number of days during which she might become pregnant.""'The calendar method is only about 80% effective in preventing pregnancy and when used alone, it is considered outdated and ineffective.' "
Basal body temperature method,"""The basal body temperature (BBT) method is based upon the fact that a woman's temperature drops 12 to 24 hours before an egg is released from her ovary and then increases again once the egg has been released. Unfortunately, this temperature difference is not very large. It is less than 1 degree F (about a half-degree C) when the body is at rest.""'The basal body temperature method requires that a woman take her temperature every morning before she gets out of bed. A special thermometer that is more accurate and sensitive than a typical oral thermometer must be used, and the daily temperature variations carefully noted. This must be done every month. Online calculators are available to help a woman chart her basal body temperature.''To use the basal body temperature as a birth control method, a woman should refrain from having sexual intercourse from the time her temperature drops until at least 48 to 72 hours after her temperature increases again.' "
Mucus inspection method,"'The mucus inspection method depends on the presence or absence of a particular type of cervical mucus that a woman produces in response to estrogen. A woman will generate larger amounts of more watery mucus than usual (like raw egg white) just before release of an egg from her ovary. This so-called egg-white cervical mucus (EWCM) stretches for up to an inch when pulled apart. A woman can learn to recognize differences in the quantity and quality of her cervical mucus by examining its appearance on her underwear, pads, and toilet tissue; or she may gently remove a sample of mucus from the vaginal opening using two fingers.''She may choose to have intercourse between the time of her ''last menstrual period'' and the time of change in the cervical mucus. During this period, it is recommended that she have sexual intercourse only every other day because the presence of seminal fluid makes it more difficult to determine the nature of her cervical mucus. If the woman does not wish to become pregnant, she should not have sexual intercourse at all for 3 to 4 days after she notices the change in her cervical mucus.' "
Symptothermal method,"'The symptothermal method combines certain aspects of the calendar, the basal body temperature, and the mucus inspection methods. Not only are all these factors taken into consideration, but also are other symptoms such as slight cramping and breast tenderness. Some women experience lower abdominal discomfort (in the area of the ovaries) during the release of an egg (ovulation).' "
Ovulation indicator testing kits,"""A woman can use an ovulation prediction kit to determine when she is most likely to ovulate. This special kit measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. Because luteinizing hormone promotes the maturation of an egg in the ovary, the amount of LH usually increases 20 to 48 hours before ovulation. This increase is called the luteinizing hormone surge, which can then be detected in a woman's urine 8 to 12 hours later. The ovulation prediction kit is designed to measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine.""'There are a number of ovulation prediction kits sold at pharmacies that range from simple to complex. In the simplest, the woman urinates onto a test stick and the amount of luteinizing hormone is indicated by a color change. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of luteinizing hormone in her urine. A woman begins testing her urine 2 to 3 days before she expects to ovulate based upon the dates of her previous monthly cycles.''The optimum days for ''fertilization'' are the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. The greatest chance of ''becoming pregnant'' is if intercourse occurs within 24 hours after the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovulation prediction kits are used primarily to increase the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, but they can also indicate to the woman that she is about to ovulate and should take appropriate ''contraceptive'' precautions.' "
Withdrawal method,"""Using the withdrawal method, the man withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina before he ejaculates so that the sperm released from his penis does not enter her vagina. Withdrawal is also called ""'coitus interruptus''.'""There are problems with using withdrawal as a contraceptive method. First, a man may release small amounts of sperm before actual ejaculation. Secondly, a man needs self-control and a precise sense of timing to be able to withdraw his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. Because this can be difficult for the man to complete successfully, the withdrawal method is only about 75%-80% effective in preventing pregnancy."" "
Lactational infertility,"'Lactational ''infertility'' is based upon the idea that a woman cannot become pregnant as long as she is ''breastfeeding'' her baby. It is true that a woman may not ovulate quite as soon after giving birth as she would if she were not breastfeeding. Women who are breastfeeding usually start ovulating again between 10-12 weeks after delivery.''However, the method is not considered appropriate as a sole contraceptive measure. A ''nursing'' mother may start ovulating again and not realize she is fertile, as ovulation can occur prior to the return of her menstrual period. If this happens and the mother has unprotected sexual intercourse, she can become pregnant at the same time she is still breastfeeding her baby. If a nursing mother does not wish to become pregnant again, she must start to use an appropriate method of contraception.' "
Douching and urination,"'Vaginal ''douching'"" is the use of a liquid solution to wash out mucus and other types of bodily debris from a woman's vagina. Many women choose to make regular douching a part of their routine for maintaining vaginal hygiene. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not recommend the practice.""""Regardless of whether a woman does it for hygienic reasons, vaginal douching does not work as a contraception method. During intercourse, active sperm can reach a woman's cervix and even the upper part of her uterus within five minutes of ejaculation. Douching after intercourse cannot be done soon enough to have any contraceptive benefits, and the douching could even force sperm higher up into the uterus. In addition, if a woman douches within a 6-8 hour period after using a spermicide, she may actually reduce the effectiveness of this contraceptive method.""'Some women used to think that standing up and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse might reduce the chances of them becoming pregnant. They hoped that gravity might make it more difficult for sperm to swim ""uphill"" to the uterus and that the stream of urine ''running'' over their vaginal area would wash away sperm, similar to the process of douching. However, just like douching, urination after intercourse does not have any contraceptive value.' "
Abstinence,"""Abstinence from sexual activity means not having any sexual intercourse at all. No sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex means that there is no chance that a man's sperm can fertilize a woman's egg.""""A man or a woman can practice abstinence from sexual activity for a specific period of time, or continuously throughout one's lifetime. Abstinence is essentially 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Another significant benefit of abstinence is that it markedly reduces the likelihood of contracting a ""'sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').''In this context, abstinence means refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity because sexually transmitted infections can be passed from one person to another in any and all of these ways. It should be noted that sexual activity such as mutual ''masturbation'"" and touching of the other partner's genitals can, in some instances, transfer sperm during heavy mutual foreplay possibly leading to pregnancy."" "
What is Graves' disease?,"""Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes ""'hyperthyroidism'', or overactive thyroid. With this disease, your immune system attacks the thyroid and causes it to make more ''thyroid hormone'' than your body needs. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. Thyroid hormones control how your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body - even the way your heart beats.''If left untreated, ''hyperthyroidism'' can cause serious problems with the heart, bones, muscles, ''menstrual cycle'', and ''fertility''. During pregnancy, untreated ''hyperthyroidism'"" can lead to health problems for the mother and baby. Graves' disease also can affect your eyes and skin."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of Graves' disease?,"""If you have Graves' disease, you may have common ""'symptoms of hyperthyroidism'' such as'""Rarely, people with Graves' disease develop a reddish thickening of the skin on the shins, a condition called pretibial myxedema or Graves' dermopathy. This skin problem is usually painless and mild, but it can be painful for some.""""Graves' ophthalmopathy (Graves' orbitopathy) can cause retracted eyelids, meaning the eyelids are pulled back from the eye. Graves' orbitopathy can also cause ""'bulging eyes'', ''double vision'', and ''swelling around the eyes''.'   fast and irregular heartbeat frequent bowel movements or diarrhea goiter heat intolerance nervousness or irritability tiredness or muscle weakness trembling hands trouble sleeping weight loss"
What causes Graves' disease?,"""Researchers aren't sure why some people develop autoimmune disorders such as Graves' disease. These disorders probably develop from a combination of genes and an outside trigger, such as a virus.""""With Graves' disease, the immune system makes an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that attaches to thyroid cells. TSI acts like thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a hormone made in the ""'pituitary gland'' that tells the thyroid how much ''thyroid hormone'' to make. TSI causes the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.'  "
Is Graves' disease a problem during pregnancy?,"""Thyroid hormone levels that are just a little high are usually not a problem in pregnancy. However, more severe hyperthyroidism that isn't treated can affect both the mother and the baby. If you have Graves' disease, be sure your hyperthyroidism is under control before ""'becoming pregnant''.'  "
Who gets Graves' disease? Is it common?,"""Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. The disease affects about 1 in 200 people.""""Graves' disease usually affects people between ages 30 and 50, but can occur at any age. The disease is seven to eight times more common in women than men.3 A person’s chance of developing Graves’ disease increases if other family members have the disease.""""People with other autoimmune disorders are more likely to develop Graves' disease than people without these disorders. Conditions linked with Graves' disease include"" rheumatoid arthritis, a disorder that affects the joints and sometimes other body systems pernicious anemia, a condition caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency lupus, a chronic, long-term disorder that can affect many parts of your body Addison's disease, a hormonal disorder celiac disease, a digestive disorder vitiligo, a disorder in which some parts of the skin are not pigmented type 1 diabetes"
What tests diagnose Graves' disease?,"""Your health care provider may suspect Graves' disease based on your symptoms and findings during a physical exam. One or more blood tests can confirm that you have hyperthyroidism and may point to Graves' disease as the cause.""""Other clues that hyperthyroidism is caused by Graves' disease are""""If the diagnosis is uncertain, your doctor may order further blood or imaging tests to confirm Graves' disease as the cause."" an enlarged thyroid signs of Graves' eye disease, present in about one out of three people with Graves' disease a history of other family members with thyroid or autoimmune problems A blood test can detect TSI. However, in mild cases of Graves' disease, TSI may not show up in your blood. The next step may be one of two imaging tests that use small, safe doses of radioactive iodine. Your thyroid collects iodine from your bloodstream and uses it to make thyroid hormones; it will collect radioactive iodine in the same way. Radioactive iodine uptake test. This test measures the amount of iodine the thyroid collects from the bloodstream. If your thyroid collects large amounts of iodine, you may have Graves' disease. Thyroid scan. This scan shows how and where iodine is distributed in the thyroid. With Graves' disease, the entire thyroid is involved, so the iodine shows up throughout the gland. With other causes of hyperthyroidism such as nodules - small lumps in the gland - the iodine shows up in a different pattern."
What is the treatment for Graves' disease? Can it be cured?,"""You have three treatment options: medicine, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy is the most common treatment for Graves' disease in the United States, but doctors are beginning to use medicine more often than in the past. Based on factors such as your age, whether you are ""'pregnant'', or whether you have other medical conditions, your doctor may recommend a specific treatment and can help you decide which one is right for you.' "
Is there a diet for Graves' disease? What foods should you avoid?,"""People with Graves' disease may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine - such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed - may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism. Taking iodine ""'supplements'' can have the same effect.''Talk with your health care professional about what foods you should limit or avoid, and let him or her know if you take iodine ''supplements''. Also, share information about any ''cough syrups'' or ''multivitamins'' that you take because they may contain iodine.' "
Radioiodine therapy for Graves' disease,"'For radioiodine therapy, you take radioactive iodine-131 (I-131) by mouth as a capsule or liquid. I-131, at a higher dose than the dose used for imaging tests, slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. The dose of I-131 usually used for radioiodine therapy does not affect other body tissues. You take radioactive iodine-131 as a capsule or liquid.'""Although it's unlikely, you may need more than one radio-iodine treatment to bring your thyroid hormone levels into the normal range. In the meantime, treatment with medicines called ""'beta blockers'' can control your symptoms.''Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops ''hypothyroidism'', or ''underactive thyroid'', because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. However, ''hypothyroidism'' is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. People with hypothyroidism can completely control the condition with daily thyroid hormone medicine.'""Doctors don't use radioiodine therapy to treat ""'pregnant'' women or women who are ''breastfeeding'"". Radioactive iodine can harm the fetus' thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in ""'breast milk''.'  "
Beta blockers,"'Beta blockers don’t stop your thyroid from producing thyroid hormone but can reduce symptoms until other treatments take effect. These medicines act quickly to relieve many of the ''symptoms of hyperthyroidism'', such as trembling, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. Most people feel better within hours of taking beta blockers.' "
Antithyroid medications,"'Antithyroid therapy is the simplest way to treat hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid medicines cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. These medicines usually don’t provide a permanent cure, but in some people, the effects last a long time after they stop taking the medicine. Doctors most often use the antithyroid medicine ''methimazole''.''Doctors usually treat pregnant and ''breastfeeding'' women with antithyroid medicine, since this treatment may be safer for the baby than other treatments. Doctors use ''propylthiouracil'' more often than methimazole during the first 3 months of pregnancy because methimazole may harm the fetus, although this happens rarely. Also rarely, propylthiouracil may affect the fetus, but any effects are less harmful than having uncontrolled hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.'""Once treatment with antithyroid medicine begins, your thyroid hormone levels may not move into the normal range for several weeks or months. The total average treatment time is about 12 to 18 months, but treatment can continue for many years in people who don’t want radioiodine or surgery to treat their Graves' disease.""'Antithyroid medicines can cause side effects in some people, including''Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms:' allergic reactions such as rashes and itching a decrease in the number of white blood cells in your body, which can lower resistance to infection liver failure, in rare cases Fever Constant sore throat Tiredness Weakness Dull pain in your abdomen Loss of appetite Skin rash or itching Easy bruising Yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes, called jaundice"
Surgery for Graves' disease,"""The least-used treatment for Graves' disease is surgery to remove the thyroid gland. Sometimes doctors use surgery to treat people with large goiters, or pregnant women who are ""'allergic'' to or have side effects from antithyroid medicines.''Before surgery, your doctor will prescribe antithyroid medicines to bring your thyroid hormone levels into the normal range. This treatment prevents a condition called ''thyroid storm'' - a sudden, severe worsening of symptoms - that can occur when people with hyperthyroidism have general anesthesia.''After surgery to remove your thyroid, you will develop hypothyroidism and need to take thyroid hormone medicine every day for life. After surgery, your doctor will continue to check your thyroid hormone levels and adjust your dose as needed.' "
What complications (death) are caused by untreated Graves' disease?,"""Without treatment, Graves' disease can cause some serious and potentially fatal health problems, including:"" An irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems An eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy or Graves' orbitopathy (GO), which can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and Eye pain - and, rarely, can lead to vision loss Thinning bones Osteoporosis Death"
What are the four stages of wound healing?,"'Wound healing is a complex process that gets completed in four stages in an organized manner. The phases of wound healing are:' Hemostasis: This is the stage after the blood oozes out of the wound. The bleeding stops by the formation of a blood clot (thrombus). This thrombus is mainly made up of components of blood, which are known as platelets. Inflammation: During this phase, the injured blood vessels in the wound discharge fluid that causes the wound to swell. During the inflammatory phase, the wound repair process starts, and the damaged cells and bacteria get cleared from the wound. This process stops further bleeding and also wards off infection. Proliferation: During this phase, new tissue formation (known as granulation tissue) takes place as the wound contracts. A new network of blood vessels also develops to supply oxygen for the growth of new tissues in the wound. Maturation (tissue remodeling): The cells that had aggregated in the wound to repair it get removed and the wound gets closed."
Which factors affect wound healing?,"'Not all wounds heal at the same pace. Some factors affect the way how a wound heals:' Age: The inflammatory response of the body generally decreases with aging. This may slow the process of wound healing. Type of wound: Deeper and longer wounds take time to heal. Also, irregular or contaminated wounds may take longer to heal as compared with clean-cut wounds. Infection: Invasion of the open wound by microbes such as bacteria hampers the wound healing process. Poor nutrition: Lack of proteins and other nutrients in the diet can delay wound healing. Skin moisture: Moisture at the wound is an essential factor necessary for the proliferative phase of wound healing. Hence, it is necessary to drink lots of water during the healing process that will hydrate the wound.  Poor blood circulation: As the blood supplies all the essential nutrients to the wound required for its healing, poor blood circulation can lead to delayed wound healing. Health issues such as diabetes and obesity may delay wound healing. Certain medications may affect wound healing. Stress may retard wound healing. Smoking may decrease blood flow, thus retarding wound healing. Alcohol abuse harms general health and can delay wound healing. Weakened immunity such as in AIDS may slow the wound healing process."
When to call the doctor for your wound?,"'After you get the wound and follow all the steps of ''wound care'', you need to observe your wound for a few days till it heals completely. Call the doctor if you feel that your wound has become infected. Watch for signs of infection:' Redness, swelling, warmth, or increase in pain around the wound Oozing of pus from the wound Bleeding from the wound that fails to stop even with pressure Fever"
"What are bath salts, and how do people abuse bath salts?","'Bath salts are a type of ""designer"" drug of abuse. The reason these drugs are commonly called bath salts is that they tend to be in the form of white or off-white powder or crystals. However, these substances are not at all the same as Epsom salts or the other bath salts in which people bathe. Many of the bath salt drugs include alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone (alpha-PVP), mephedrone, methylone, and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV or MDPK) and are synthetic drugs called cathinones, which exist in plants commonly called ''khat'' plants. These drugs and are chemically similar to stimulant chemicals like cocaine or amphetamines. MDPV or MDPK also have chemical similarities to hallucinogens like Ecstasy, which is a street name for methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).''Some of the other many street or slang names for bath salts include plant food, Red Dove, Blue Silk, Vanilla Sky, Purple Wave, Ivory Wave, Bliss, White Lightning, White Dove, Super Coke, Tranquility, Zoom, Flakka, Cannibal, and Magic. Mephedrone also has street names like meow, drone, and meph. People take these so-called designer drugs by ingesting, ''smoking'', sniffing, or injecting them.''The rate of abuse of bath salts rapidly increased from 2010 to 2011. For example, poison-control centers in the United States reportedly received 304 calls for the abuse of this drug in 2010. That number increased to 1,782 calls in just the first four months of 2011 and to more than 6,000 calls by the end of that year. Interestingly, there were fewer calls to poison-control centers in 2012 and 2013 (2,691 and 996, respectively). Through October 2015, that number further decreased to 451. The areas where these drugs are used have also seemed to expand; originally, most of the calls to poison-control centers came from Louisiana, Florida, and Kentucky but later came from 33 states.''Bath salts users tend to be male slightly more often than female and younger than the users of other drugs, and most use it at least weekly. Most bath salts users snort or otherwise inhale the drug, causing a more intense high and higher risk of addiction and complications.' "
What is the history of bath salts?,"'Substances that cause the ""high"" (intoxication) often referred to as ""bath salts"" include methylone, mephedrone, and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV or MDPK). These active ingredients come from drugs called cathinones, which come from the East African plant called the ''Catha edulis''. China manufactures bath salts, in tablet or powder form. These substances are often sold over the Internet, as well as over the counter (without prescription and having no medical use) in convenience and tobacco stores, gas stations, truck stops, pawn shops, in ''tattoo'' parlors, and on the street. In an attempt to avoid the legal consequences of the banned substances found in bath salts, drug dealers have apparently developed bath salts with other active ingredients. One of those is Cosmic Blast. Bath salts are sometimes referred to as ""zombie"" or ""cannibal"" because it was speculated that a person who engaged in cannibalism as part of an assault might have been intoxicated on the substance.'

Are bath salts addictive?,"'Given the similarities in effects that these drugs have to cocaine, methamphetamines, and other stimulant drugs of abuse, bath salts should be considered very addictive. Despite the newness of these drugs and resulting lack of sufficient research on bath salt-specific addiction in humans, animal research has already shown that these substances can be quite addicting. Therefore, health care professionals consider bath salts capable of wreaking the same addictive havoc on the lives of users as other stimulant drugs.' "
Are bath salts legal?,"""A majority of states has made a number of the active ingredients in bath salts illegal on the state level, and the United States federal government has made MDPV (an active ingredient in many bath salts) illegal due to the drug's tendency to cause symptoms of psychosis, like ""'hallucinations'', ''paranoia'', as well as violence, in those who take it. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) now lists a number of the active ingredients found in bath salts as schedule I drugs, meaning they are illegal because they are understood to have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States, and no accepted safe use, so are deemed not fit for human consumption.' "
What are risk and protective (prevention) factors for bath salts use disorder?,"""As opposed to any specific direct causes, there are a number of biological, psychological, and social factors, called risk factors, which can increase a person's likelihood of developing a substance use disorder. The frequency that addictions to any drug, including bath salts, occur within some families seems to be higher than can be explained by the addictive environment of the family. Therefore, most substance-abuse professionals recognize a genetic aspect to the risk of this and other drug addictions. Mental health symptoms caused by bath salt use disorder include mood disorders like ""'depression'' or ''anxiety''. Social risk factors for bath salt use, as for any type of ''drug use'' disorder, include male gender, age 18 to 44 years old, unmarried marital status, and lower socioeconomic status and high levels of community violence. According to statistics by state, people residing in the West tend to be at higher risk for chemical dependency. As with substance use disorder in general, circumstances like receiving appropriate supervision, as well as clear messages from family members that drug use is unacceptable help prevent bath salt abuse and addiction.'

What are the symptoms and signs of bath salts intoxication?,"'The signs and symptoms of bath salts intoxication include:''Feeling very let down for several hours to days thereafter tends to follow those symptoms.'  feeling euphoric (""high""), sexually stimulated, thinking one is more focused, and having high energy levels for two to four hours after taking the drug."
"What are the side effects, complications, and prognosis of abusing bath salts?","'Possible side effects and complications of even low doses of bath salts abuse include:''The agitation and delirium can last for days. Other possible effects on the body from using these drugs, particularly with overdose, include:''Emotional complications of bath salts abuse can include ''panic attacks'' and violence against oneself (''suicidal thoughts'' or actions, or self-mutilation, as in cutting or burning oneself). Unfortunately, any of the complications described do not require long-term use of the drug in order to occur.''The bath salts abuser may develop thoughts, attempts, or acts of homicide or violence against others. Deaths from the medical problems associated with bath salts have occurred, as well.' rapid heart rate, chest pain, high blood pressure, feeling jittery or agitated, and having hallucinations, paranoia, or delirium. liver failure, seizures, heart attack, brain swelling, and severe fever (hyperthermia)."
How do health care professionals diagnose bath salts use disorder?,"""As with any drug use disorder, bath salts use disorder is a condition that is characterized by a destructive pattern of using the drug(s) that leads to significant problems or distress, significant problems involving tolerance to or withdrawal from it, as well as other problems that the use of bath salts can cause for the sufferer, socially or in terms of the person's work or school performance. This pattern is manifested by at least two of the following warning signs or symptoms of drug use or abuse in the same one-year period:""""There is no single test that indicates someone has bath salts use disorder with complete certainty. Therefore, health care professionals diagnose this condition by thoroughly gathering medical, family, and mental health information. The practitioner will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor do so. The medical assessment usually includes lab tests to assess the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual is using other drugs, has experienced exposure to any environmental toxins, or has a medical condition that includes mental health symptoms.""'In asking questions about mental health symptoms, mental health practitioners are often trying to determine if the person suffers from depressive and/or ''manic'' symptoms, as well as whether the individual is anxious or suffers from, hallucinations, ''delusions'', or some behavioral disorder. Health care professionals may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test to screen for substance use disorder. Since some of the symptoms of bath salts use disorder can also occur in other mental illnesses, the mental health screening helps determine if the individual suffers from ''bipolar disorder'', an ''anxiety disorder'', ''schizophrenia'', ''schizoaffective disorder'', or other psychotic disorder. Any disorder that is associated with sudden changes in behavior, mood, or thinking, like ''bipolar disorder'', a psychotic disorder, ''borderline personality disorder'', or ''dissociative identity disorder'"" (DID), may be particularly challenging to distinguish from some symptoms of bath salts use disorder. In order to assess the person's current emotional state, health care professionals perform a mental-status examination, as well.""'In addition to providing treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis and to the person in need of it, determining the presence of mental illnesses that may co-occur (co-morbid/dual diagnosis) with bath salts use disorder is important in promoting the best possible outcome. Dual diagnosis of bath salts addicted individuals indicates the need for treatment that addresses both issues in an integrated fashion by practitioners with training and experience with helping this specific population.' Recurrent bath salts use that results in a lack of meeting important obligations at work, school, or home Repeated bath salts use in situations that can be dangerous Continued bath salts use despite continued or repeated social or relationship problems as due to the drug's effects Tolerance, which is either significantly decreased effect of bath salts or a need to increase the amount used in order to achieve the same high or other desired effects Withdrawal, which is either physical or psychological signs or symptoms that characterize withdrawal from bath salts, or taking it or a substance that is chemically related in order to avoid developing symptoms of withdrawal Larger amounts of bath salts are taken or for longer than intended The individual experiences persistent desire to take the drug or has unsuccessful attempts to lessen or control its use People spend substantial amounts of time getting, using, or recovering from the effects of bath salts The person markedly reduces or stops participating in important social, recreational, work, or school activities because of using bath salts. The individual continues to use bath salts despite being aware that he or she suffers from ongoing or recurring physical or psychological problems caused or worsened by the use of the drug.

What is the treatment for bath salts use disorder?,"'The treatment of bath salts intoxication involves providing intensive medical monitoring and attention to address the specific symptoms of the individual. It also often involves using medications to alleviate medical symptoms of intoxication like ''nausea'', ''insomnia'' and ''lack of appetite'', as well as emotional symptoms like agitation.''The primary goals for the treatment of addiction symptoms (also called recovery) are abstinence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation. When the addicted person first abstains from using drugs, he or she may need help avoiding or lessening the effects of withdrawal. That process is detoxification or detox. Medical professionals conduct that part of treatment in a hospital or other inpatient setting (often called detox centers), where medications used to decrease withdrawal symptoms and frequent medical assessments and care can be provided. As with many other drugs of abuse, the detox process from bath salts is likely the most difficult aspect of coping with the physical symptoms of addiction and tends to last for days.''People who may have less severe psychological symptoms of bath salts dependency may be able to be maintained in an outpatient treatment program. Those who have a more severe addiction, have relapsed after engaging in outpatient programs, or who also suffer from a severe ''mental illness'' might need the higher level of structure, guidance, and monitoring provided in an inpatient drug-treatment center, often referred to as ""rehab."" After inpatient treatment, many bath salts addicts may need to live in a sober-living community, that is, a group-home setting where counselors provide continued sobriety support and daily structure.'""Another important aspect of treating bath salts addiction is helping family members and friends of the addicted person refrain from encouraging addictive behaviors (codependency). Whether codependent loved ones provide financial support, excuses, or refrain from acknowledging the addictive behaviors of the addict, discouraging such codependency of friends and family is a key part of the recovery of the affected individual. Focusing on the bath salts-addicted person's role in the family likely becomes even more urgent when that person is a child or teenager. Bath salts-dependency treatment for children and adolescents differs further from that in adults by the younger addict's tendency to need help finishing their education and achieving higher education or job training compared to addicts who may have completed those parts of their lives before acquiring the addiction.""

What should you know about bedbugs?,"'Bedbugs'' (''Cimex lectularius'') are small, oval insects that feed by sucking blood from humans or other warm-blooded animals. The effect of ''bedbugs'' on human health and reports of bedbug infestations of certain hotels has received media attention in recent years.''Bedbugs'' do not fly. Adult bedbugs are 5-7 mm in length.''Bedbugs are pests that can live anywhere in the home. They can live in cracks in furniture or in any type of textile, including upholstered furniture. Bedbug infestations are most common in beds, including the mattress, box springs, and bed frames. Bedbugs are most active at night. These pests may bite any exposed areas of skin while an individual is sleeping. Common locations for ''bedbug bites'' are the face, neck, hands, and arms.''A bedbug bite is painless and is generally not noticed. The bites may be mistaken for a ''rash'' of another cause. Small, flat, or raised ''bumps on the skin'' are the most common sign. Symptoms include redness, swelling, and ''itching''.''Fecal stains or rust-colored dark spots, egg cases, and shed skins (exuviae) of bedbugs in crevices and cracks on or near beds are suggestive of infestations, but only observing the bugs themselves can confirm an active infestation. A professional pest-control company may be required to help identify and remove bedbugs from the home.''Home remedies for bedbug bites include measures to control ''itching'', such as oatmeal baths or cool compresses. Typically, no treatment is required for bedbug bites. If itching is severe, steroid creams or oral ''antihistamines'' may be used for symptom relief.' "
What are bedbugs? What do bedbugs look like?,"'Bedbugs are small oval-shaped non-flying insects that belong to the insect family ''Cimicidae'', which includes three species that bite people. Adult bedbugs reach 5 mm-7 mm in length, while nymphs (juveniles) are as small as 1.5 mm. Bedbugs have flat bodies and may sometimes be mistaken for ''ticks'' or small cockroaches. Bedbugs feed by sucking blood from humans or animals. ''Cimex lectularius'' is the scientific name for bedbugs.''Adult bedbugs are reddish brown in color, appearing engorged and more reddish after feeding on a blood meal. Nymphs are light-colored and appear bright red after feeding. The wings of bedbugs are vestigial, so they cannot fly. However, they are able to crawl rapidly.''Temperatures between 70 F-80 F are most favorable for bedbugs, allowing them to develop into adults most rapidly and produce up to three generations per year.'  "
Where are bedbugs found?,"'Bedbugs are found all over the world. Bedbug infestations were common in the U.S. before World War II and became rare after widespread use of the pesticide DDT for pest control began in the 1940s and 1950s. They remained prevalent in other areas of the world and, in recent years, have been increasingly observed again in the U.S. Increases in immigration and travel from the developing world as well as restrictions on the use of stronger insecticides may be factors that have led to the relatively recent increase in bedbug infestations. While bedbug infestations are often reported to be found when sanitation conditions are poor or when birds or mammals (particularly bats) are nesting on or near a home, bedbugs can also live and thrive in clean environments. Crowded living quarters also facilitate the spread of bedbug infestations.''Bedbugs can live in any area of the home and use tiny cracks in furniture as well as on textiles and upholstered furniture as hiding places. They tend to be most common in areas where people ''sleep'' and generally concentrate in beds, including mattresses or mattress covers, box springs, and bed frames. They do not infest the sleeping surfaces of beds as commonly as cracks and crevices associated with the bed frame and mattress, including mattress seams. Other sites where bedbugs often reside and potential infested items include curtains, edges of carpet, corners inside dressers and other furniture, cracks in wallpaper (particularly near the bed), and inside the spaces of wicker furniture.''Since bedbugs can live for months or even longer under favorable conditions without feeding, they can also be found in vacant homes.'

What are the symptoms and signs of bedbug bites?,"'Bedbugs bite and suck blood from humans. Bedbugs are most active at night and bite any exposed areas of skin while an individual is sleeping. The face, neck, hands, and arms are common sites for bedbug bites. The bite itself is painless and is not noticed. Small, flat, or raised ''bumps'' on the skin are the most common sign; redness, swelling, and itching commonly occur. If scratched, the bite areas can become infected. A peculiarity of bedbug bites is the tendency to find several bites lined up in a row that may appear as ''itchy'' welts after scratching. Infectious-disease specialists refer to this series of bites as the ""breakfast, lunch, and dinner"" sign, signifying the sequential feeding that occurs from site to site. In some people, the bites can take several days to develop. The signs may become apparent up to 14 days after the bite has occurred.''Bedbug bites may go unnoticed or be mistaken for flea or mosquito bites or other types of ''rash'' or ''skin conditions'', since the signs of bedbug bites are difficult to distinguish from other bites or skin conditions. Bedbugs also have glands whose secretions may leave musty odors, and they also may leave dark fecal spots on bed sheets and around places where they hide (in crevices or protected areas around the bed or anywhere in the room).''Researchers have not conclusively proven that bedbugs carry or transmit diseases. However, health researchers have suggested that bedbugs may be possible vectors of ''American trypanosomiasis'' (''Chagas disease'') in areas where this disease is endemic, but they have not conclusively proven this.'

What is the treatment for bedbug bites?,"'Typically, no treatment is required for bedbug bites. If itching is severe or if an ''allergic reaction'' to the bites occurs, topical steroid creams or oral antihistamines may be used for symptom relief. Secondary ''bacterial infections'' that develop over heavily scratched areas may require antibiotics.'  "
What are home remedies for bedbug bites?,"'Home remedies for bedbug bites include anything that relieves and controls itching, such as cool compresses, oatmeal baths, or a paste made of baking soda and water. Home remedies can also include ''over-the-counter'' medications to combat itching, such as antihistamines.' "
How do I detect a bedbug infestation in my home or in a hotel?,"'Check to see if you can identify the rust-colored fecal stains, egg cases, and shed skins (exuviae) in crevices and cracks on or near beds. A sweet, musty odor is sometimes present. You should also look at other areas such as under wallpaper, behind picture frames, in couches and other furniture, in bedsprings and under mattresses, and even in articles of clothing. While fecal stains and skin casts suggest that bedbugs have been present, these do not confirm that the infestation is still active. Observing the bedbugs themselves is definitive confirmation that an area is infested. You may require professional assistance from a pest-control company in determining whether your home has a bedbug problem.' "
How do you get rid of bedbugs in your home?,"'Getting rid of bedbugs is not an easy process, and most cases of bedbug infestation will require bedbug control treatment by a pest control expert or exterminator. Bedbugs can survive for up to a year without feeding, so they may persist even in unoccupied rooms.'""A variety of low-odor sprays, dusts, and aerosol insecticides help with bedbug control. People must apply these insecticides to all areas where the bugs are observed as well as hiding places or spaces where they may crawl. The pest control firm can help you determine if an infested mattress can be disinfected or must be discarded. Since beds cannot readily be treated with insecticides, it's often necessary to discard infested mattresses and beds.""'A pest control expert may recommend certain forms of deep-cleaning such as scrubbing infested surfaces with a stiff brush to remove eggs, steaming or heat treatment, diatomaceous earth treatments, pressurized carbon dioxide snow, dismantling bed frames and furniture, filling cracks in floors, walls, and moldings, encasing mattresses within special bags, or using a powerful vacuum on cracks and crevices. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency offers a thorough guide to methods for bedbug control in the reference listed at the end of this article. Long-term control of bedbug infestations requires diligence and a combination of non-chemical methods and pesticides.' "

Can You Prevent Bedbug Infestations and Bedbug Bites?,"'Avoidance of infested areas is the method for ''prevention'' of bedbug bites. Recognition of bedbug infestation and proper treatment of affected rooms (usually with the help of a pest control operator) is the best way to prevent bedbugs in the home. Prevention tips can include sealing your mattress in a bedbug-prevention casing can be beneficial.''Sleeping with the lights on has not been shown to be effective in preventing bedbug bites. Conventional insect and tick repellents are also not useful against bedbugs, so one should not try to avoid being bitten by using insect repellent at night.''For those concerned about bedbug infestations in hotels, an important tip is that you can inspect any hotel room for the presence of the telltale signs of bedbugs. It is important to check the mattress and headboard, and luggage racks. In hotels, keeping your suitcase away from the bed and on a luggage rack can help prevent bedbugs from infesting your luggage. When you return home, inspect your luggage and put clothes immediately into the washer. While washing clothes in hot water does not kill bedbugs, drying clothes at a high temperature can eliminate them.''At home, do not store luggage under your bed. Ideally, luggage should be stored in a basement or garage. Other tips you can take to reduce the chances of bedbugs infesting your home include removing clutter, vacuuming frequently, and keeping belongings separate when taken to school or work.'  "

Neither is considered a public health hazard, and except for body lice, they do not spread disease.\xa0''Bedbugs infestations are becoming a worldwide problem, and it is resurging.'  Both bedbugs and lice bites can cause considerable itching, and scratching the bites may result in sores that can become infected. Always see a doctor if you suspect you have been bitten by bedbugs or lice.  Lice can spread rapidly in schools, so it is often helpful to notify your child's school so they can take appropriate precautions to prevent the lice from spreading to other children.  Body lice can spread certain illnesses including epidemic typhus, trench fever, and louse-borne relapsing fever. These diseases are not common in more developed countries but can be a problem in places where there are chronic poverty and people live together in unsanitary conditions."
Can you prevent bedbug and lice bites and infestations?,"'To prevent bed bug infestations:''Prevention'' of\xa0lice infestations:''Additional prevention of head lice infestation include:''Additional prevention of body lice infestation include:''Additional prevention of public (""crab"") lice infestation include:' Inspect mattresses in hotel rooms for bedbugs Check all used beds, couches, and furniture for signs of bed bug infestation before bringing them home Use protective covers for mattresses and box springs to eliminate bed bug hiding places Keep your home clean and uncluttered so bedbugs have fewer places to hide Vacuum frequently  Be careful when using shared laundry facilities. Bring items to be washed in plastic bags, and if you have an active infestation use a new bag for the clean clothing when done. Use the dryer on high heat to kill bedbugs.  If you live in a multi-family home, keep your unit isolated by installing door sweeps and sealing any cracks and crevices Do not share beds, couches, pillows, carpets, or stuffed animals with an infested person. Machine wash and dry clothing, bed sheets, and other items an infested person wore or used during the 2 days before treatment using the hot water (130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle.  Vacuum the floor and furniture. Avoiding head-to-head (hair-to-hair) contact during play, sports, on the playground, at slumber parties or camp Do not share clothing, especially head wear and hair accessories Do not share hair care items such as brushes, combs, or towels.  Bathing regularly and wearing properly laundered clean clothes at least once a week Fumigation or dusting with chemical insecticides may be necessary to control and prevent the spread of body lice for certain diseases  Avoid sexual contact between the infested persons and their sexual partner(s) until all have been treated as necessary Persons with pubic lice should be examined and treated for other possible sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) . "
What should you know about bedbugs?,"'Bedbugs'' (''Cimex lectularius'') are small, oval insects that feed by sucking blood from humans or other warm-blooded animals. The effect of ''bedbugs'' on human health and reports of bedbug infestations of certain hotels has received media attention in recent years.''Bedbugs'' do not fly. Adult bedbugs are 5-7 mm in length.''Bedbugs are pests that can live anywhere in the home. They can live in cracks in furniture or in any type of textile, including upholstered furniture. Bedbug infestations are most common in beds, including the mattress, box springs, and bed frames. Bedbugs are most active at night. These pests may bite any exposed areas of skin while an individual is sleeping. Common locations for ''bedbug bites'' are the face, neck, hands, and arms.''A bedbug bite is painless and is generally not noticed. The bites may be mistaken for a ''rash'' of another cause. Small, flat, or raised ''bumps on the skin'' are the most common sign. Symptoms include redness, swelling, and ''itching''.''Fecal stains or rust-colored dark spots, egg cases, and shed skins (exuviae) of bedbugs in crevices and cracks on or near beds are suggestive of infestations, but only observing the bugs themselves can confirm an active infestation. A professional pest-control company may be required to help identify and remove bedbugs from the home.''Home remedies for bedbug bites include measures to control ''itching'', such as oatmeal baths or cool compresses. Typically, no treatment is required for bedbug bites. If itching is severe, steroid creams or oral ''antihistamines'' may be used for symptom relief.' "
What are bedbugs? What do bedbugs look like?,"'Bedbugs are small oval-shaped non-flying insects that belong to the insect family ''Cimicidae'', which includes three species that bite people. Adult bedbugs reach 5 mm-7 mm in length, while nymphs (juveniles) are as small as 1.5 mm. Bedbugs have flat bodies and may sometimes be mistaken for ''ticks'' or small cockroaches. Bedbugs feed by sucking blood from humans or animals. ''Cimex lectularius'' is the scientific name for bedbugs.''Adult bedbugs are reddish brown in color, appearing engorged and more reddish after feeding on a blood meal. Nymphs are light-colored and appear bright red after feeding. The wings of bedbugs are vestigial, so they cannot fly. However, they are able to crawl rapidly.''Temperatures between 70 F-80 F are most favorable for bedbugs, allowing them to develop into adults most rapidly and produce up to three generations per year.'  "
Where are bedbugs found?,"'Bedbugs are found all over the world. Bedbug infestations were common in the U.S. before World War II and became rare after widespread use of the pesticide DDT for pest control began in the 1940s and 1950s. They remained prevalent in other areas of the world and, in recent years, have been increasingly observed again in the U.S. Increases in immigration and travel from the developing world as well as restrictions on the use of stronger insecticides may be factors that have led to the relatively recent increase in bedbug infestations. While bedbug infestations are often reported to be found when sanitation conditions are poor or when birds or mammals (particularly bats) are nesting on or near a home, bedbugs can also live and thrive in clean environments. Crowded living quarters also facilitate the spread of bedbug infestations.''Bedbugs can live in any area of the home and use tiny cracks in furniture as well as on textiles and upholstered furniture as hiding places. They tend to be most common in areas where people ''sleep'' and generally concentrate in beds, including mattresses or mattress covers, box springs, and bed frames. They do not infest the sleeping surfaces of beds as commonly as cracks and crevices associated with the bed frame and mattress, including mattress seams. Other sites where bedbugs often reside and potential infested items include curtains, edges of carpet, corners inside dressers and other furniture, cracks in wallpaper (particularly near the bed), and inside the spaces of wicker furniture.''Since bedbugs can live for months or even longer under favorable conditions without feeding, they can also be found in vacant homes.'

How do bedbugs spread?,"'Bedbugs live in any articles of furniture, clothing, or bedding, so they or their eggs may be present in used furniture or clothing. They spread by crawling and may contaminate multiple rooms in a home or even multiple dwellings in apartment buildings. They may also hide in boxes, suitcases, or other items that are moved from residence to residence or from a hotel to home. Bedbugs can live on clothing from home infestations and may be spread by a person unknowingly wearing infested clothing.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of bedbug bites?,"'Bedbugs bite and suck blood from humans. Bedbugs are most active at night and bite any exposed areas of skin while an individual is sleeping. The face, neck, hands, and arms are common sites for bedbug bites. The bite itself is painless and is not noticed. Small, flat, or raised ''bumps'' on the skin are the most common sign; redness, swelling, and itching commonly occur. If scratched, the bite areas can become infected. A peculiarity of bedbug bites is the tendency to find several bites lined up in a row that may appear as ''itchy'' welts after scratching. Infectious-disease specialists refer to this series of bites as the ""breakfast, lunch, and dinner"" sign, signifying the sequential feeding that occurs from site to site. In some people, the bites can take several days to develop. The signs may become apparent up to 14 days after the bite has occurred.''Bedbug bites may go unnoticed or be mistaken for flea or mosquito bites or other types of ''rash'' or ''skin conditions'', since the signs of bedbug bites are difficult to distinguish from other bites or skin conditions. Bedbugs also have glands whose secretions may leave musty odors, and they also may leave dark fecal spots on bed sheets and around places where they hide (in crevices or protected areas around the bed or anywhere in the room).''Researchers have not conclusively proven that bedbugs carry or transmit diseases. However, health researchers have suggested that bedbugs may be possible vectors of ''American trypanosomiasis'' (''Chagas disease'') in areas where this disease is endemic, but they have not conclusively proven this.'  "
What is the treatment for bedbug bites?,"'Typically, no treatment is required for bedbug bites. If itching is severe or if an ''allergic reaction'' to the bites occurs, topical steroid creams or oral antihistamines may be used for symptom relief. Secondary ''bacterial infections'' that develop over heavily scratched areas may require antibiotics.'  "
What are home remedies for bedbug bites?,"'Home remedies for bedbug bites include anything that relieves and controls itching, such as cool compresses, oatmeal baths, or a paste made of baking soda and water. Home remedies can also include ''over-the-counter'' medications to combat itching, such as antihistamines.' "
How do I detect a bedbug infestation in my home or in a hotel?,"'Check to see if you can identify the rust-colored fecal stains, egg cases, and shed skins (exuviae) in crevices and cracks on or near beds. A sweet, musty odor is sometimes present. You should also look at other areas such as under wallpaper, behind picture frames, in couches and other furniture, in bedsprings and under mattresses, and even in articles of clothing. While fecal stains and skin casts suggest that bedbugs have been present, these do not confirm that the infestation is still active. Observing the bedbugs themselves is definitive confirmation that an area is infested. You may require professional assistance from a pest-control company in determining whether your home has a bedbug problem.' "
How do you get rid of bedbugs in your home?,"'Getting rid of bedbugs is not an easy process, and most cases of bedbug infestation will require bedbug control treatment by a pest control expert or exterminator. Bedbugs can survive for up to a year without feeding, so they may persist even in unoccupied rooms.'""A variety of low-odor sprays, dusts, and aerosol insecticides help with bedbug control. People must apply these insecticides to all areas where the bugs are observed as well as hiding places or spaces where they may crawl. The pest control firm can help you determine if an infested mattress can be disinfected or must be discarded. Since beds cannot readily be treated with insecticides, it's often necessary to discard infested mattresses and beds.""'A pest control expert may recommend certain forms of deep-cleaning such as scrubbing infested surfaces with a stiff brush to remove eggs, steaming or heat treatment, diatomaceous earth treatments, pressurized carbon dioxide snow, dismantling bed frames and furniture, filling cracks in floors, walls, and moldings, encasing mattresses within special bags, or using a powerful vacuum on cracks and crevices. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency offers a thorough guide to methods for bedbug control in the reference listed at the end of this article. Long-term control of bedbug infestations requires diligence and a combination of non-chemical methods and pesticides.' "
What is the prognosis for bedbug bites?,"'The majority of bedbug bites are not serious and heal completely. The only known serious consequences are severe ''allergic'' reactions, which have been reported in some people after bedbug bites.' "
Can You Prevent Bedbug Infestations and Bedbug Bites?,"'Avoidance of infested areas is the method for ''prevention'' of bedbug bites. Recognition of bedbug infestation and proper treatment of affected rooms (usually with the help of a pest control operator) is the best way to prevent bedbugs in the home. Prevention tips can include sealing your mattress in a bedbug-prevention casing can be beneficial.''Sleeping with the lights on has not been shown to be effective in preventing bedbug bites. Conventional insect and tick repellents are also not useful against bedbugs, so one should not try to avoid being bitten by using insect repellent at night.''For those concerned about bedbug infestations in hotels, an important tip is that you can inspect any hotel room for the presence of the telltale signs of bedbugs. It is important to check the mattress and headboard, and luggage racks. In hotels, keeping your suitcase away from the bed and on a luggage rack can help prevent bedbugs from infesting your luggage. When you return home, inspect your luggage and put clothes immediately into the washer. While washing clothes in hot water does not kill bedbugs, drying clothes at a high temperature can eliminate them.''At home, do not store luggage under your bed. Ideally, luggage should be stored in a basement or garage. Other tips you can take to reduce the chances of bedbugs infesting your home include removing clutter, vacuuming frequently, and keeping belongings separate when taken to school or work.'  "
What are bedbugs?,"'Bedbugs'"" are parasites (insects) that survive by feeding on blood from humans. They are small, brownish-colored, and live in furniture cracks, beds (especially the mattress, box springs, and other structures such as the bed frame) but also can be found in travelers' suitcases and other items. Their highest ""'concentration'' is usually within about 8 ''feet'' of a location where people ''sleep''. They are active (seek a blood meal) at nighttime and just before dawn; they usually bite any exposed area of the skin (for example, the arms, hands, neck, and face). The bite is usually painless, but eventually multiple bite sites resemble a ''rash'' and become itchy. ''Bedbugs'' are not known to readily transmit other diseases, although a few investigators suggest that rarely, ''hepatitis B'' and/or ''Chagas disease'' may use ''bedbugs'' as a vector for these diseases.' "
Are bedbugs contagious?,"'Bedbugs'' are not ''contagious'"" in the sense that they live on people and are transmitted directly from person to person. What happens is that bedbugs utilize humans for a blood meal and then leave the person's body. It seems like bedbugs may be contagious because they can live in some people's clothing, bedding, and furniture. These items, when utilized or transported during travel, can contain bedbugs waiting to encounter another warm body for a blood meal. Most experts suggest that the main hosts for bedbugs are humans and indicate that pets like ""'dogs'' and cats usually are not bitten (not all experts agree on this); however, bedding material used for pets may serve as a site for bedbugs especially if the pet bed is located close to bedding used by pet owners.' "
How do I know if I have bedbugs?,"'Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a person has been bitten by bedbugs. Because the insects leave the person\'s body after a bite, and bites usually occur when a person is sleeping, many people do not know how they got this ""itchy ''rash''."" In most instances, there are no lab tests used to detect bedbugs; however, simply using a magnifying glass while examining items such as mattresses or clothing (especially the seams in mattresses and cracks in furniture) for bedbugs, their eggs, or droppings is usually the quickest and best way to determine a ''bedbug'' infestation.' "
How do bedbugs spread?,"'Bedbugs are not spread directly from person to person. As stated above, they are spread by travelers and/or people who come in contact with bedding, clothing, or furniture that contains bedbugs. Travelers can have bedbugs infest their luggage and thus can transport bedbugs back to their home. Bedbugs, once established in a residence, can travel to reach individuals through ventilation ducts, water pipes, and even gutters. Bedbugs have even been shown to cross over ceilings and then drop down onto a person to get a blood meal from an individual.' "
How will I know when I am cured of bedbugs?,"'Bedbugs usually require the services of an exterminator to kill the insects. Exterminators may use various methods such as chemical insecticides and/or heat treatments to kill the insects. Once the insects are killed, the biting stops and the person is ""cured"" of ''bedbug bites''.' "
When should I call a medical caregiver about bedbugs?,"'Individuals who have been bitten by bedbugs and who have other diseases that may be rarely transmitted by these insects (for example, ''hepatitis B'') should inform their caregivers and ask for advice about bedbugs being a vector for their disease. Similarly, family members of such individuals should contact their physician if they get bedbug bites as they may be exposed to the disease in a family member. Anyone developing ''shortness of breath'' and/or swelling of the neck or tongue after a bedbug bite should go to an emergency department.' "
What is bedwetting?,"'Bedwetting is the involuntary passage of urine (''urinary incontinence'') while asleep. Inherent in the definition of bedwetting is satisfactory bladder control while the person is awake. Therefore, urination while awake is a different condition and has a variety of different causes than bedwetting.''Bedwetting is medically termed ''nocturnal'' ''enuresis''.' "
What are the types of bedwetting?,'There are two types of bedwetting:' Primary enuresis: bedwetting since infancy Secondary enuresis: wetting developed after being continually dry for a minimum of six months
What is primary bedwetting?,"'Primary bedwetting is viewed as a delay in maturation of the nervous system. At 5 years of age, approximately 16% of children wet the bed at least once a month. Males are twice as likely as females to wet the bed. By 6 years of age, only about 13% of children are bedwetters -- the large majority being boys. The percentage of all children who are bedwetters continues to diminish by 30% each year after 5 years of age. The primary risk factor for developing primary bedwetting is having a parent who also had bedwetting.' "
What is the basic problem in primary bedwetting?,"'The fundamental problem for children with primary bedwetting is the inability to recognize messages of the nervous system sent by the full bladder to the ''sleep'' arousal centers of the brain while asleep. In addition, bladder capacity is often smaller in bedwetting children than in their peers.' "
What is the cause of primary bedwetting?,"'Parents sometimes believe that their child\'s primary bedwetting is emotional. No medical or scientific literature exists to support this impression. There is evidence, however, that children with ""''sleep'' disordered ''breathing''"" (ranging from ''snoring'' to ''sleep apnea'') are at an increased risk for developing primary bedwetting. There are some studies that suggest that some children with symptomatic adenotonsillar hypertrophy and bedwetting may benefit from surgical removal of ''tonsils'' and ''adenoids'' (adenotonsillectomy) as a treatment. But more research is needed in this area.' "
What is the treatment for primary bedwetting?,"'The ""cure"" for primary bedwetting is ""tincture (or passage) of time."" However, since many parents and children are frustrated with bedwetting as it starts to interfere with self-esteem or social events (for examples, sleepovers, camp attendance, etc.) a patient step-by-step approach is best. Fortunately, the treatments are more often successful than not. One should always discuss treatment options with a child\'s physician, since it is important to differentiate between primary and secondary enuresis prior to starting specific treatments.''It is also important to remember that different children develop at different rates and that primary enuresis can be a normal developmental stage. Toilet training a child requires special patience. While most children are fully toilet trained by 3-4 years of age, many will not stay dry overnight, even though they can during the day. Reassurance and encouragement often will work in time, but for some children, there are steps that can be taken to address the issues.''Some common recommended management and treatment options include the following:'  Encourage voiding prior to bedtime, and restrict fluid intake before bed. Cover the mattress with plastic. Bedwetting alarms: There are generally reserved for older school-age children. There are commercial alarms that are available at most pharmacies. When the device senses urine, it alarms and wakes up the child so he/she can use the toilet. The cure rate is variable. Bladder-stretching exercises are aimed at increasing the bladder volume and increasing the periods between daytime urinations. Medications, such as desmopressin acetate or antidiuretic hormone (DDAVP) and imipramine (Tofranil), have been shown to be very effective and are used to temporarily treat the nighttime urination, but they do not ""cure"" the enuresis. Many pediatricians will prescribe one of these medications, especially if the child is engaged in behavioral conditioning as well. Medications are very helpful when a child is not sleeping at home (camp or sleepovers), since the trauma of bedwetting in those settings is predictable."
How common is secondary bedwetting?,'Few children with bedwetting have a medical cause for the condition.' 
What causes secondary bedwetting?,"'Urinary tract infections'', metabolic disorders (such as ''diabetes''), external pressure on the bladder (such as from a rectal ''stool'' mass), and spinal cord disorders are among the causes of secondary bedwetting.' "
How is the cause of secondary bedwetting diagnosed?,'A complete history and thorough physical examination are central to the initial evaluation of a child with primary bedwetting. A ''urinalysis'' and urine culture generally complete the workup. Further laboratory and radiological studies are for the child with secondary bedwetting.' 
What is the treatment for secondary bedwetting?,"'Therapy of secondary bedwetting is directed at the primary problem causing the symptom of wetting the bed. As expected, cure rates vary depending on the cause of the loss of control.' "
What is the prognosis for children with bedwetting?,"'In the medical world of today, both primary and secondary bedwetting can be a manageable condition. Treatment programs can successfully eliminate both parental and patient ''anxiety'', frustration, and embarrassment.''http://www.aap.org''http://www.aafp.org' "
Insect stings overview,"'Bee and wasp stings are common causes of medical problems. Bees and wasps, together with fire ants, are all related insects that belong to the ''Hymenoptera'' order. Bee and wasp stings can cause significant reactions, ranging from localized ''pain'' and swelling to serious and even potentially fatal conditions. At least 90 to 100 deaths occur each year in the U.S. as a result of serious anaphylactic sting reactions.'  "
What are the types of wasps?,"'There are over 25,000 species of wasps found throughout the world. Some of the most common wasps include:' The yellow jacket and hornet, both of which live in groups, or colonies, in temperate climates. Yellow jackets, which have black and yellow stripes on the abdomen, form underground nests.  Hornets are predominantly black with some yellow markings on the head and thorax. Hornets form paper-like nests that are attached to trees, bushes, or buildings."
What are the types of bees?,"'Bees include the honey bee, the so-called Africanized honey bee (also known as ""killer bee""), and the bumble bee. Bumble bees are large, furry-appearing bees that fulfill the beneficial role of pollinating many plants. Honeybees, also active plant pollinators, are found all over the world. While honey bees are not usually aggressive, they will sting if bothered or threatened. Because their wings flap so rapidly, their presence is associated with a buzzing sound. Although the venom of the ""killer bees"" found in the Western and Southern U.S. is no more potent than that of regular honeybees, their behavior may be more aggressive. Killer bees may chase victims when agitated and may also attack in greater numbers, thereby increasing the chances of a severe reaction to their stings. Overall, there are more than 20,000 species of bees found worldwide.' "
What are causes of bee and wasp stings?,"'Most stings arise because an insect perceives a threat to their colony. Bees and wasps commonly sting because an intruder has neared the ''hive'' or nest. Loud noises (such as lawn mowers), bright or dark colors, and certain perfumes or perfumed body products may also encourage stings. Some types of insect venom contain pheromones, which attract other members of the colony and induce them to sting.''When bees or wasps sting an individual, they inject venom under the skin of their victim. ''Bee and wasp venoms vary according to species but typically contain toxic components as well as antigens that stimulate an immune response.'   Honey bees, including killer bees, have barbed stingers that tear off when they try to fly away after stinging, so these bees die after the sting and thus can sting only one time. In this case the stinger and venom sac typically remain embedded in the skin of the victim. Bumble bees, hornets, yellow jackets, and wasps are able to sting multiple times, since their stingers are smooth and can be easily withdrawn from the victim's skin. "
What are the symptoms of a bee or wasp sting?,"'Insect stings'' may produce four types of reactions, each with characteristic symptoms as below:'   Local reactions are the most common type of reaction to a bee or wasp sting. Symptoms include pain, swelling, warmth, and redness at the site of the sting. Itching may also be present. These symptoms begin immediately following the sting and often last for only a few hours. Depending upon the type of insect, the stinging apparatus may still be visible in the affected skin. Large local reactions have a greater degree of swelling that can last for up to a week, sometimes associated with nausea and/or tiredness. These reactions are not allergic reactions. Systemic (body-wide) allergic reactions occur in people who have produced a type of antibody known as IgE antibody against the same insect venom as a result of a previous sting. Systemic allergic reactions are estimated to occur in a very small percentage of stings. Symptoms include hives and flushing of the skin and difficulty breathing due to swelling of the pharynx and epiglottis and narrowing of the bronchial passages. The reaction may vary in severity from mild skin hives to life-threatening reactions. The most severe immunologic reactions are known as anaphylaxis and occur more commonly in males and in people under 20 years of age. In severe reactions, hypotension (low blood pressure), circulatory disturbances, and breathing difficulty can progress to fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. Most people who develop anaphylactic reactions have experienced previous stings with few problems. Once an individual has experienced an anaphylactic reaction, the risk of having a recurrent episode is about 60%. Toxic reactions are a direct result of toxins in the venom rather than the body's immune response. Most often these are due to multiple simultaneous stings that introduce an unusually large amount of venom into the body. Symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fainting or dizziness, and convulsions. Hives, rash, and skin symptoms are less common in toxic reactions than in allergic reactions. Because bee and wasp venom are strong stimulants of the immune response, people who have experienced toxic reactions may produce antibodies to the venom and be at risk for future systemic anaphylactic reactions to stings.  Delayed reactions are uncommon and occur even days to weeks after the sting. These reactions constitute less than 0.3% of all reactions to insect stings. The individual's own medical history and condition may play a role in determining whether delayed reactions occur. Symptoms can vary widely and may include inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), the nerves (neuritis), blood vessels (vasculitis), or kidneys (nephritis) as well as blood clotting disturbances. Serum sickness is a type of delayed reaction that occurs a week to 10 days after a sting and may cause itching, rash, fever, joint pain, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes."
When should I call a doctor about a bee or wasp sting?,"'Most bee and wasp stings can be treated at home, but some require medical attention. If there is any suspicion at all that a person is having a systemic ''allergic reaction'', seek immediate emergency medical assistance. Signs that a person may be having a systemic reaction include widespread hives or rash, ''wheezing'', difficulty breathing, and swelling in the mouth and throat areas. If a person is stung by an insect whose sting has previously caused an anaphylactic reaction, he or she should also access emergency medical care even if no symptoms are present.''You should also seek medical care if any of the following conditions are present:'   If you have received multiple stings  If the sting is located in the eye or eye area  If symptoms of infection (pus, drainage, fever, increasing pain and redness) develop  If the initial symptoms worsen or persist for longer than 24 to 48 hours  If a sting produces severe symptoms in young children, the elderly, or those with chronic medical problems"
How is a bee or wasp sting diagnosed?,"'In most cases the victim or an observer will have witnessed the sting. Depending upon the type of insect, the stinging apparatus may be found embedded in the skin, but this is not the case with wasps and some types of bees. The characteristic symptoms for each type of reaction along with the history of a sting are typically sufficient to establish a diagnosis.'  "
What is the treatment for a bee or wasp sting?,"'Treatment for a mild allergic reaction (such as a rash without any breathing difficulty) usually involves the administration of ''antihistamine'' medications and sometimes steroid medications to reduce inflammation.''The treatment of choice for life-threatening anaphylactic reactions is epinephrine. Emergency medical treatments may also include steroid and antihistamine medications and insertion of a ''breathing tube''. Intravenous fluids and medications to support cardiovascular function may also be required. Treatment may be begun at the scene by emergency medical personnel and continued in the hospital.''Doctors can prescribe an ''allergy'' kit containing self-administered epinephrine (Epi-Pen) for persons at risk for a ''severe allergic reaction'', including those with known ''allergy'' to bee or wasp stings. These self-administered injectable epinephrine treatments can be life-saving in many cases. It is important to have kits readily available at home, in the car, at work, etc. and to know how to use them properly.''Immunotherapy is sometimes recommended for those with a history of severe allergic reactions to stings. In this treatment, a series of shots (""''allergy shots''"") are used to provide low-dose exposure to venom. This type of treatment may significantly reduce the chance of future severe allergic reactions.'   First aid for a bee sting involves cleansing the site, immediate removal of the stinging apparatus (if present). Home remedies include application of ice or cold packs to the affected area. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may be taken to relieve itching and burning. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin), Advil) may be taken for pain relief. If the sting site becomes infected, your doctor may prescribe a course of antibiotics. If it has been more than 10 years since your last tetanus booster immunization, get a booster within the next few days."
What are the complications of a bee or wasp sting?,"'Complications can include the development of infection at the sting site requiring treatment with antibiotics. Systemic allergic reactions can be life-threatening, as discussed above.' "
How can I prevent a bee or wasp sting?,"'You can take preventive measures to decrease your chance of being stung by an insect. Effective ''prevention'' tips include the following:'   Avoid, and do not disturb, hives and nests  When participating in outdoor activities, avoid fragranced body products, bright colors, and sugary drinks Wear long sleeves and long pants outdoors  Do not walk barefoot outdoors  Do not swat at swarming bees or wasps  Exercise caution around fruit trees and blooming flowers  Keep garbage away from outdoor activity areas"
What is Behçet's syndrome?,"""Behçet's syndrome is classically characterized as a triad of symptoms that include recurring crops of mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers, ""'canker sores''), genital ulcers, and inflammation of a specialized area around the pupil of the eye termed the uvea. The inflammation of the area of the eye that is around the pupil is called ''uveitis'"". Behçet's syndrome is also sometimes referred to as Behçet's disease.""  "
What causes and contagious of Behçet's syndrome?,"""The cause of Behçet's syndrome is not known. The disease is relatively rare but is more frequent and severe in patients from the Eastern Mediterranean and Asia than those of European descent. Both ""'inherited'"" (genetic) and environmental factors, such as microbial infections, are suspected to be factors that contribute to the development of Behçet's. Behçet's is not known to be ""'contagious''.' "
What are symptoms of Behçet's syndrome?,"""The symptoms of Behçet's syndrome depend on the area of the body affected. Behçet's syndrome can involve inflammation of many areas of the body. These areas include the arteries that supply blood to the body's tissues. Behçet's syndrome can also affect the veins that take the blood back to the lungs to replenish oxygen. Other areas of body that can be affected by the inflammation of Behçet's syndrome include the back of the eyes (retina), brain, joints, skin, and bowels.""'The ''mouth and genital ulcers'"" of Behçet's syndrome are generally painful and tend to recur in crops (many shallow ulcers occur at the same time). They range in size from a few millimeters to 20 millimeters in diameter. The mouth ulcers occur on the gums, tongue, and inner lining of the mouth. The genital ulcers occur on the scrotum and penis of males and vulva of women and can leavescars.""'Inflammation of the eye'', which can involve the front of the eye (uvea) causing ''uveitis'', or the back of the eye (retina) causing retinitis, can lead to ''blindness''. Symptoms of eye inflammation include ''pain'', ''blurred vision'', tearing, redness, and ''pain'"" when looking at bright lights. It is very important for patients with Behçet's syndrome to have this sensitive area monitored by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).""'If the arteries become inflamed (''arteritis'"") from Behçet's syndrome, it can lead to death of the tissues whose oxygen supply depends on these vessels. This could cause a ""'stroke'' if it is affecting the brain vessels, belly pain if affecting the bowel, etc. When veins become inflamed (''phlebitis''), the inflammation can involve large veins that develop ''blood clots'' which can loosen and migrate to cause pulmonary embolisms.''Symptoms of ''inflammation of the brain'' or tissue that covers the brain (meninges) include ''headaches'', ''neck stiffness'', and is often associated with ''fever''. Inflammation of the brain (''encephalitis'') and/or the meninges (meningitis) can cause damage to nervous tissue and lead to ''weakness'' or impaired function of portions of the body. This can result in ''confusion'' and ''coma''. Typically these features occur later in the disease course, years after the diagnosis.''Joint inflammation'' (''arthritis'') can lead to swelling, ''stiffness'"", warmth, pain, and tenderness of joints with Behçet's syndrome. This occurs in about half of patients with Behçet's syndrome at sometime during their lives. Knees, wrists, ankles, and elbows are the most common joints affected. The skin of patients with Behçet's syndrome can develop areas of inflammation that spontaneously appear as raised, tender, reddish nodules (""'erythema nodosum'""), typically on the front of the legs. Some patients with Behçet's syndrome develop a peculiar red or blistery skin reaction in places where they have been pierced by blood-drawing needles (see pathergy test in diagnosis section). Research has found that ""'acne'"" occurs more frequently in patients with Behçet's syndrome that also have arthritis as a manifestation.""'Ulcerations'"" can occur at any location in the stomach, large or small bowel in patients with Behçet's disease.""  "
How is Behçet's syndrome diagnosed?,"""Behçet's syndrome is diagnosed based on the finding of recurrent mouth ulcerations combined with any two of the following: eye inflammation, genital ulcerations, or skin abnormalities mentioned above. ""'A special skin test called a ''pathergy test'"" can also suggest Behçet's syndrome. (The other criteria above are still required for ultimate diagnosis.) This test consists of pricking the skin of the forearm with a sterile needle. The test is called positive and suggests Behçet's syndrome when the puncture causes a sterile red nodule or ""'pustule'' that is greater than two millimeters in diameter at 24 to 48 hours after the test.''Tests such as ''skin biopsy'', ''lumbar puncture'', ''MRI'' scan of the brain, and bowel tests are considered for individual patients based upon symptoms that are present.'  "
What is the treatment of Behçet's syndrome?,"""The treatment of Behçet's syndrome depends on the severity and the location of its manifestations in an individual patient. ""'Steroid (cortisone) gels, pastes (such as Kenolog in Orabase) and creams can be helpful for the mouth and genital ulcers. ''Colchicine'' (''Colcrys'') can also minimize recurrent ulcerations. ''Trental'' (''pentoxifylline'') has also been used in the treatment of oral and genital ulcers. ''Joint inflammation can require nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (such as ''ibuprofen'' and others) or oral steroids. Colchicine and oral and injectable cortisone are used for inflammation involving the joints, eyes, skin, and brain. ''Sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine) has been effective in some patients for arthritis. Bowel disease is treated with oral steroids and sulfasalazine.''Diligent treatment of eye inflammation is essential. Patients with eye symptoms or a history of eye inflammation should be monitored by an ophthalmologist. Resistant eye inflammation can often respond to new biologic medications that block a protein that plays a major role in initiating inflammation, called TNF. These TNF-blocking medications, including ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') and ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), can also be helpful for severe mouth ulcerations.'""Severe disease of the arteries, eyes, and brain can be difficult to treat and require powerful medications that suppress the immune system called immunosuppressive agents. Immunosuppressive agents used for severe Behçet's syndrome include ""'chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), and ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''). ''Cyclosporine'' has been used for resistant disease.''Studies suggest that ''thalidomide'' (''Thalomid'"") may be of benefit for certain patients with Behçet's syndrome in treating and preventing ulcerations of the mouth and genitals. Side effects of thalidomide include promoting abnormal development of fetal growth, nerve injury (neuropathy), and hypersedation. Trials are currently underway evaluating ""'interferon'"" alpha for the treatment of eye disease in patients with Behçet's syndrome.""  "
What is the facial nerve?,"'The facial nerve is a nerve that controls the muscles on the side of the face. It allows us to show expression, smile, cry, and wink. Injury to the facial nerve can cause a socially and psychologically devastating physical defect; although most cases resolve spontaneously, treatment may ultimately require extensive rehabilitation or multiple procedures.''The facial nerve is the seventh of the twelve cranial nerves. Everyone has two facial nerves, one for each side of the face. The facial nerve travels with the ''hearing'' nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) as it travels in and around the structures of the middle ear. It exits the front of the ear at the stylomastoid foramen (a hole in the skull base), where it then travels through the parotid gland. In the parotid gland it divides into many branches that provide motor function for the various muscles and glands of the head and neck.'  "
What are symptoms of a facial nerve problem?,"'Facial nerve problems may result in facial muscle ''paralysis'', ''weakness'', or twitching of the face. Dryness of the eye or the mouth, alteration of taste on the affected side, or even excessive tearing or salivation can be seen as well. However, the finding of one of these symptoms does not necessarily imply a specific facial nerve problem; the physician needs to make a careful investigation in order to make a precise diagnosis. Symptoms of a facial nerve problem can vary in severity depending upon the extent of the injury to the nerve. Symptoms may range from mild twitching to full paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face.'  "
What conditions affect the facial nerve?,"'There are numerous causes of facial nerve disorder:' Trauma such as birth trauma, skull base fractures, facial injuries, middle ear injuries, or surgical trauma Nervous system disease including stroke involving the brain stem Infection of the ear or face, or herpes zoster of the facial nerve (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) Tumors including acoustic neuroma, schwannoma, cholesteatoma, parotid tumors, and glomus tumors Toxins due to alcoholism or carbon monoxide poisoning Bell's palsy, which is also called idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (see below); this condition is sometimes associated with diabetes mellitus or pregnancy"
How are the causes of facial nerve dysfunction diagnosed?,"'Causes of facial nerve disorder vary from unknown to life threatening. Sometimes, there is a specific treatment for the problem. Accordingly, it is important to investigate why the problem has occurred. The specific tests used for diagnosis will vary from patient to patient, but include:' Hearing tests: Hearing tests are done to assess the status of the auditory nerve. The stapedial reflex test can evaluate the branch of the facial nerve that supplies motor fibers to one of the muscles in the middle ear. Balance tests: Will help find out if part of the auditory nerve is involved. Tear tests: The loss of the ability to form tears may help to locate the site and severity of a facial nerve lesion. Taste tests: The loss of taste in the front of the tongue may help locate the site and severity of a facial nerve lesion. Salivation test: Decreased flow of saliva may help locate the site and severity of a facial nerve lesion. Imaging studies: These tests help determine if there is infection, a tumor, a bone fracture, or any other abnormality. These studies usually include a CT scan and/or a MRI scan. Electrical nerve stimulation tests: Stimulation of the nerve by an electrical current tests whether the nerve can still cause muscles to contract. It can be used to evaluate progression of the disease. For example, if testing indicates equal muscle response on both sides of the face, the patient can be expected to have complete return of facial function in three to six weeks without significant deformity."
What is Bell's palsy?,"'Bell\'s palsy (sometimes referred to as Bell palsy) is paralysis of the facial nerve of unknown cause. The diagnosis is made when no other cause can be identified. Although Bell\'s palsy is thought to be caused by a viral infection of the facial nerve, this hasn\'t been proven. Other names for this condition are ""idiopathic facial palsy"" or Antoni\'s palsy.' "
How does a person get Bell's palsy? ,"""While the actual mechanism of injury of the facial nerve in Bell's palsy is unknown, one proposed mechanism of injury includes:"" Primary viral infection (herpes) sometime in the past. The virus lives in the nerve (geniculate ganglion) from months to years. The virus becomes reactivated at a later date. The virus reproduces and travels along the nerve. The virus infects the cells surrounding the nerve (Schwann cells) resulting in inflammation. The immune system responds to the damaged Schwann cells, which causes inflammation of the nerve and subsequent weakness or paralysis of the face. The course of the paralysis and the recovery will depend upon the degree and amount of damage to the nerve."
Bell's palsy symptoms,"""The typical symptoms of Bell's palsy include:"" Acute unilateral paralysis of facial muscles is present; the paralysis involves all muscles, including the forehead. About half the time, there is numbness or pain in the ear, face, neck or tongue. There is a preceding viral illness in a majority of patients. There is a family history of Bell's palsy in some of patients. Very few patients have bilateral problems. There may be a change in hearing sensitivity (often increased sensitivity)."
Who gets Bell's palsy? How long does it last?,"""Bell's palsy is usually a self-limiting, non-life-threatening condition that resolves spontaneously, usually within six weeks. There is no predominant age or racial predilection; however, it is more common during pregnancy and slightly more common in menstruating females. In general, the incidence increases with advancing age. Children under the age of 13 seem less at risk of developing Bell's palsy than older individuals."" "
How is Bell's palsy treated? How is facial nerve paralysis treated?,"""There are no medications specifically approved to treat Bell's palsy. Underlying medical conditions that lead to facial nerve disorder are treated specifically according to the specific condition that is responsible for the damage to the nerve. Steroid medications (""'corticosteroids'"") are the best treatment for Bell's palsy, and it is recommended that all patients be treated. The usual amount is one milligram per kilogram body weight of ""'prednisone'' (or steroid alternative) per day for 7 to 14 days. Recently, antiviral medications like ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax'') given in conjunction with steroids have been demonstrated to increase recovery. Doses of the antiviral agent will vary with the drug chosen.'""Although physical therapy and electrotherapy probably have no significant benefit, facial exercises can help prevent contractures of affected muscles. Surgical facial nerve decompression is controversial in Bell's palsy. Some physicians recommend surgical decompression during the first two weeks in patients showing the most severe nerve degeneration; however, there can be a substantial risk of ""'hearing loss'' with this surgery.'  "
Treatment options for eye problems,"'Patients with facial nerve paralysis have difficulty keeping their eye closed because the muscles which close the eye cannot work. Serious complications can occur if the ''cornea'' of the eye becomes too dry. Treatment consists of:' protective glasses which can prevent dust from entering the eye; manual closure of the eye with a finger to keep it moist -- patients should use the back of their finger rather than the tip to insure that the eye is not injured; artificial tears or ointments to help keep the eye lubricated; taping or patching the eye closed with paper tape while asleep; and in cases in which recovery is incomplete, a temporary or permanent narrowing of the eye opening (tarsorrhaphy) may be necessary."
Surgical reconstruction options,"'Reconstructive options for patients with facial muscle weakness or paralysis include one or more of the following:' Nerve repair or nerve grafts: Facial nerve regeneration occurs at a rate of one millimeter per day. If a nerve has been cut or removed, direct microscopic repair is the best option. Nerve transposition: Often the tongue nerve (hypoglossal nerve) or the other facial nerve can be connected to the existing facial nerve. For example, the patient can then train themselves to move their face by moving their tongue. Muscle transposition or sling procedures: The temporalis muscle or masseter muscle (some of the only muscles on the face not supplied by the facial nerve), can be moved down and connected to the corner of the mouth to allow movement of the face. Muscle transfers: Free muscles from the leg (gracilis) can be used to provide both muscle bulk and function. Often a cross facial nerve transposition is done to provide similar nerve supply to the donor muscle flap. Ancillary eyelid or oral procedures: In addition to one of the above, often it is necessary to include a brow lift or facelift, partial lip resection, eyelid repositioning, lower eyelid shortening, upper eyelid weights, or eyelid springs in reconstructive surgery following severe facial nerve palsies."
Is there a cure for Bell's palsy? What is the prognosis for other facial nerve problems?,"""The prognosis for facial nerve damage depends on the underlying cause. Many patients who have required surgery to remove tumors may have unavoidable permanent injury to the facial nerve, whereas a majority of persons who experience Bell's palsy will have complete recovery. The best outcomes occur with rapid diagnosis and treatment."" "
Can Bell's palsy and other facial nerve problems be prevented?,"'At one time it was thought that exposure to ''cold'"" air or a strong wind were predisposing factors leading to idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy); we now know that these ideas were incorrect. As the majority of causes for idiopathic facial nerve problems are unknown, it is difficult to predict with any accuracy specific items to avoid. Choosing a healthy lifestyle to decrease the risk of ""'diabetes'', ''cancer'', or infection may help prevent some cases of facial nerve palsy.' "
What is percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty?,"'The heart has four chambers, the upper two are called atria and the lower two chambers are called ventricles. The flow of blood into and from the heart and from the atria to the ventricles is guarded by four valves.''These valves ensure an adequate flow of blood in a single direction and prevent any backflow. In some diseases, a valve may become abnormally stiff and narrow (stenosed valve). This will hamper an adequate blood flow from the heart to other body parts. The heart must work harder to pump blood and eventually grows weak. This may produce several complications depending on the extent of stenosis.''Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is a surgical procedure to repair a stenotic heart valve. In this procedure, one or more large balloons are inserted through the skin (percutaneously) and then inflated across a stenotic valve to decrease the extent of narrowing/obstruction.' Tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. Pulmonary valve is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery (the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs). Mitral valve is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle. Aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta (the blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood from the heart)."
What happens during a percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty?,"'During a percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty:' The anesthesiologist gives a local anesthetic injection at the site of catheter insertion. They administer intravenous sedative medicines to help you relax before the procedure. The surgeon identifies the site of catheter insertion just above the blood vessel in the groin. They insert a device called introducer into the vessel. This device helps with the introduction of the catheter through the vessel into the heart. After catheterization, the surgeon begins injecting contrast dye from the intravenous line to check the exact place of catheter and valve. After the catheter reaches the required position, the surgeon inflates the balloon. This forces the stenotic valve leaflets to open. The inflated balloon relieves the stenosis by breaking the hard deposits within the valve leaflets. The surgeon deflates the balloon and removes the catheter."
What are the risks of a percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty surgery?,"'The complications of percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty include:' Bleeding  Embolus (blood clot, which may travel to lung or other parts of the body) Blood vessel injury Infection  Abnormal heart rhythm Kidney failure Stroke New or worsening of an existing valve regurgitation (leakage) Valve rupture"
Facts you should know about enlarged prostate (BPH),"  The prostate gland is a gland surrounding the neck of the bladder (the bladder outlet) that produces a fluid that becomes part of the semen. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. The treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia is usually reserved for patients with bothersome symptoms that affect quality of life and may affect sexual function. Medical and surgical approaches are available to treat BPH. Surgical treatment is recommended if there are kidney problems related to BPH, urinary retention that fails to improve, recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent bladder stones, bloody urine (gross hematuria), or failure to improve with medical therapy. BPH is very common and can cause bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms, including frequent urge to urinate, getting up at night to urinate, difficulty urinating, and dribbling of urine at the end of urination."
What is the prostate gland?,'The prostate is a small organ about the size of a walnut. It lies below the bladder (where urine is stored) and surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder). The prostate makes a fluid that helps to nourish sperm as part of the semen (ejaculatory fluid).''Prostate problems are common in men 50 and older. Most can be treated successfully without harming sexual function.' 
What is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?,"'Benign prostatic hyperplasia'"" (BPH) is nonmalignant (noncancerous) enlargement of the prostate gland, a common occurrence in older men. It is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia and abbreviated as BPH and benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). It's also referred to as an ""'enlarged prostate'' gland. BPH must be differentiated from ''prostate cancer''. ''Prostate cancer'' can cause symptoms like BPH but is more commonly associated with an increase in PSA and an abnormal prostate on rectal examination or ''ultrasound'' evaluation.'  "
What causes BPH? At what age do men develop the condition?,"'Medical professionals do not have a good understanding of what causes an ''enlarged prostate''.'""BPH generally begins in a man's 30s, evolves slowly, and most commonly only causes symptoms after 50."" "
How common is the condition? Are there any risk factors?,"'BPH is extremely common. Advanced age is a risk factor for an ''enlarged prostate''. BPH affects 40%-50% of men aged 51-60 years, but only 10% need medical or surgical intervention.' "
What happens in BPH? What are BPH symptoms and signs?,"'In benign prostatic hyperplasia, the prostate gland grows in size. It may compress the urethra, which courses through the center of the prostate. This can impede the flow of urine from the bladder through the urethra to the outside. Lower urinary tract symptoms from BPH can be due to one of the factors: (1) dynamic, (2) static, and (3) compensatory. Dynamic factors are related to the tone of the muscle surrounding the prostate and the outlet of the bladder whereas static factors are related to the enlargement of the prostate tissue. Dynamic and static symptoms are prostate-related symptoms. Compensatory factors are the result of changes that occur in the bladder as a result of the bladder working harder to push urine past the bladder neck and prostate.''Signs and symptoms of BPH include lower urinary tract symptoms (LUT) of weak urine stream, difficulty starting the urine stream (hesitancy), straining to urinate, inability to completely empty the bladder, ''inability to urinate'' (''urinary retention''), ''blood in the urine'' (hematuria), leakage of urine (''urinary incontinence''), decreased urine flow (slow urine stream), and post-void dribbling of urine.''BPH may also be related to the development of bladder stones, recurrent ''urinary tract infections'', and backup of urine in the kidneys (''hydronephrosis'').'  "
Is BPH a type of cancer?,'No! BPH is completely benign. It is ''not'' a precursor (a forerunner) to prostate ''cancer''. A man can have both BPH and prostate ''cancer''.' 
What procedures or tests diagnose this prostate problem?,"'A doctor or other health care professional usually can detect an enlarged prostate by rectal examination. A medical professionals may perform a rectal examination to ensure that there are no ""nodules,"" which are hard, irregular areas in the prostate suspicious for prostate ''cancer'', as well as to assess the size of the prostate. Assessment of prostate size and shape is better assessed with an abdominal or transrectal ultrasound or ''cystoscopy''. A cystoscope is a long, thin telescope-like instrument that has a light source and ''lens'' allowing one to look at the urethra, the prostate, and the bladder when inserted through the opening at the tip of the penis. Cystoscopy and/or ultrasound is recommended prior to surgical treatment of BPH. Other tests that medical professionals may perform include: (1) bladder scanner postvoid residual determination (this is often performed in the office after urination to determine the amount of urine left behind in the bladder after urination and determines if one is emptying completely) and (2) uroflowmetry (a test in which one voids into a special urine collection device that can measure the rate and pattern of urine flow). Lastly, a PSA is often obtained and if abnormal may require further evaluation to rule out prostate cancer.''The American Urological Association (AUA) recommends that men with BPH complete the AUA-symptom index (AUA-SI), which assesses the degree to which symptoms bother. It is a useful way to assess changes in bothersome symptoms with treatment.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat the problem?,"'Primary care providers (PCP) may start medical management of BPH associated with bothersome symptoms in the absence of severe symptoms (urinary retention, hematuria, kidney problems). A referral to a ''urologist'' is indicated if symptoms do not improve on medical therapy, if severe symptoms are present, or there is risk of prostate cancer.''A urologist is a specialist in diseases of the urinary system, including diagnosing and treating problems of the prostate gland.' "
Are there natural or home remedies to treat BPH or enlarged prostate?,"'Watchful waiting often is chosen by men who are not bothered by signs or symptoms of BPH. They have no treatment except to get regular checkups with assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms and signs and wait to see whether the condition gets worse. Several ''over-the-counter products'' and phytotherapies have been tried to treat BPH. Beta sitosterol is a phytosterol found in vegetable oil, nuts, and avocados. There are limited studies evaluating its effect on BPH. Other studied therapies include ''pygeum'' africannum, cernilton, and serenoa repens (saw palmetto). Although these therapies do not require a prescription, it is important that you discuss the use with your primary care physician, as interactions with other medications or medical problems may exist.''Dietary and lifestyle changes may help with symptoms and signs. Strategies to help improve symptoms include limiting the amount of ''alcohol'' and ''caffeine'' consumed, decreasing fluid intake 2 hours before bedtime, going to the bathroom before ''sleep'', and minimizing long trips or other activities where a restroom is not readily available. Double voiding, voiding once then waiting 1 minute and trying to void again may help with bladder emptying. ''Constipation'' can aggravate symptoms and thus eating more ''fiber'' and exercising can help prevent ''constipation''. Talk with your doctor about medications prescribed and ''over-the-counter'' medications that you use, as commonly used medications such as ''antihistamines'' and decongestants can aggravate symptoms and signs. Studies suggest that diets high in meat or dairy products may increase the risk of prostate enlargement thus increasing the intake of fruits, vegetables, and healthy ''fats'' may be helpful.'  "
What are medications and surgery procedures that treat BPH?,"'There are several different ways to treat BPH, and the treatment may vary with the different factors. Alpha-blockers and PDE-5 inhibitors commonly treat the dynamic factors associated with BPH, whereas 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and surgical interventions treat the static factors, and anticholinergics and beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists treat the compensatory factors.''Men should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each of these options. Although surgical intervention tends to produce the most significant impact on symptoms, it is associated with greater risk and is typically reserved for individuals who fail medical therapy, either by lack of adequate symptom improvement or side effects of the medication.''Medical treatment'' of BPH is usually reserved for men who have an elevated AUA-SI (bothersome symptoms):''Surgery or office procedures'' may also be used to treat BPH, most commonly in men who have not responded satisfactorily to medicine or those who have more severe problems, such as a complete inability to urinate, kidney problems due to the BPH, recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent bladder stones, or gross hematuria (''bloody urine'').' Alpha-blockers treat the dynamic part of BPH by relaxing the smooth muscles of the prostate and the bladder neck, which helps to relieve urinary obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate in BPH. Several alpha-blockers treat BPH, some of which are more selective for the prostate and bladder neck smooth muscles. Medication side effects can include headaches, fatigue, problems ejaculating, decreased semen volume, or lightheadedness. Commonly used alpha-blockers in BPH include tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (Uroxatral), silodosin (Rapaflo), and older medications such as terazosin (Hytrin) or doxazosin (Cardura). Silodosin is a more selective alpha-blocker, which is specific to the lower urinary tract. It has a similar efficacy as other alpha-blockers but may have a higher risk of sexual side effects. Naftopidil is an alpha-blocker that is like tamsulosin. It is approved in several countries throughout the world but not currently in the U.S. These medicines generally lead to improvement in symptoms within several weeks and have no effect on prostate size and do not produce any permanent changes. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitor) treat the dynamic part of BPH by decreasing the tone of the smooth muscle in the bladder, prostate, and the urethra. They appear to be less effective on improving maximal urine flow rate than alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors have been used cautiously in combination with alpha-blocker therapy. Tadalafil (Cialis) is the only FDA-approved PDE5 inhibitor for treatment of BPH. PDE5 inhibitors are more commonly used for erectile dysfunction. Side effects of PDE5 inhibitors include facial flushing, headaches, upset stomach, nasal congestion, dizziness, and backache. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors treat the static component of BPH by blocking the conversion of the male hormone testosterone into its active form in the prostate (DHT). The prostate enlargement in BPH is directly dependent on DHT, so these drugs lead to an approximate 25% reduction in prostate size over 6 to 12 months. For this reason, improvement in urinary symptoms most commonly takes this long to occur. Examples of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors include the drugs finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart). Side effects of finasteride may include declining interest in sex, problems getting an erection, and problems with ejaculation. The reduction in DHT is the cause of the decrease in libido and erectile troubles, but these symptoms appear to decrease over time on the medication. Combination therapy with alpha blocker and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors has been demonstrated to result in greater improvements in lower urinary tract symptoms compared to monotherapy as well as decrease the risk of urinary retention or need for BPH-related surgery, but there is an increased risk of adverse events such as sexual dysfunction (erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculatory dysfunction). Anticholinergic and beta 3 adrenoceptor agonists treat the compensatory factors. Both anticholinergic agents and beta 3 adrenoceptor agonists are FDA approved for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of frequency and urgency with or without urgency incontinence. Men with BPH may develop changes in the bladder that result in OAB symptoms. These medications are not used alone to treat men with BPH and LUT, rather they may be used in men on alpha-blocker therapy with improvement in their obstructive symptoms (decreased urine stream, straining to void, incomplete emptying) but who still have storage-related symptoms (frequency and urgency). It is important that one is monitored on combination therapy to ensure adequate bladder emptying. Anticholinergic agents decrease overactivity of the bladder muscle. Several anticholinergics are available, differing in the mode of administration, the duration of action and muscarinic receptor affinity and side effects. Such agents include oxybutynin (Ditropan, Ditropan XL, Oxytrol, Gelnique), tolterodine (Detrol, Detrol LA), trospium chloride (Sanctura, Sanctura XR), darifenacin (Enablex), fesoterodine (Toviaz), and solifenacin (Vesicare). Side effects of anticholinergic agents include dry mouth, facial flushing, constipation, blurred vision, urinary retention, and cognitive problems. Beta 3 adrenoceptors agonists work to relax the bladder muscle. Currently, there is only one FDA-approved beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist, mirabegron (Myrbetriq). Beta 3 adrenoceptor agonists have comparable efficacy to anticholinergic agents. Side effects of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists include increased blood pressure, urinary retention, sinus pain, dry mouth, and constipation. Physicians have used transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the longest period and consider it the gold standard procedure. After giving a patient anesthesia, the doctor inserts a special instrument (a resectoscope) into the urethra through the penis. The resectoscope is similar to a cystoscope but has a small instrument that is connected to an electrical current, which allows the urologist to resect (cut away) the prostate tissue that is bulging into the urethra under direct visualization. Risks of TURP include hematuria (blood in urine), injury to bladder, electrolyte abnormalities, painful or difficult urination, retrograde ejaculation (the ejaculate going backwards into the bladder), and rarely erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Transurethral incision of the prostate. Doctors perform this procedure using a resectoscope, but instead of removing the prostate tissue, deep incisions are made into the prostate. This procedure has fewer side effects than a TURP, however is only useful for small prostate glands. Laser procedures: A number of different laser procedures are available to treat BPH. These include transurethral vaporization of the prostate (TUVP), photo selective vaporization of the prostate (PVP), and laser enucleation of the prostate by holmium laser (HOLEP) or by thulium (THuLEP). Laser procedures have less risk of bleeding, however, require specific equipment and skills. HOLEP, PVP, and THuLEP are procedures that should be considered in men who are at higher risk of bleeding such as those taking blood thinners (anticoagulants). Transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT): Medical professionals generally perform this procedure in the office, and it involves the use of microwave energy delivered to the prostate to kill some of the cells leading eventually to shrinkage of the prostate. TUMT is associated with a higher need for retreatment than TURP. Prostate urethral lift (PUL) is a minimally invasive procedure in which four to five sutures are placed to hold back prostate tissue on both sides of the urethra. The procedure is performed by guiding a device into the urethra through the tip of the penis. The device moves the prostate tissue away from the urethra and uses a needle to the sutures to hold the prostate tissue back. A medical professional often performs a cystoscopy to ensure that the prostate is not too large and that there is no ""middle lobe,"" an enlargement of the prostate in the middle of the urethra. The improvements in urine flow rate and LUT are less than with a TURP, however, it is not associated with the sexual side effects of TURP. Water vapor thermal therapy can be used if the prostate is not too large. It is not as efficacious as TURP and is associated with an increased retreatment rate compared to TURP. Aquablation is a new procedure that is more restricted with prostate size, and there are currently limited long-term results available regarding its efficacy and retreatment rates. Further clinical trials are needed to determine its role in the management of BPH. Simple prostatectomy is a more invasive procedure typically reserved for men with very large prostate glands. It can be performed through an incision on the lower abdomen, laparoscopically or robotic-assisted. Due to its more invasive nature, simple prostatectomy has a higher risk of complications than the minimally invasive treatments and takes longer to recover. Simple prostatectomy does not remove the entire prostate and is not a procedure performed for prostate cancer and thus differs from radical prostatectomy, a cancer-related procedure."
Are there other non-cancerous prostate problems?,"'Yes, aside from BPH, there are a number of prostate problems that also have nothing at all to do with prostate cancer. Among these benign disorders of the prostate are acute ''prostatitis'' and ''chronic prostatitis'' and, rarely, prostatic infarct (a localized area of dead prostate tissue as a result of inadequate blood supply).''Acute prostatitis is a bacterial infection of the prostate. It can occur in men at any age. Symptoms include ''fever'', ''chills'', and ''pain'' in the lower back and between the legs. This problem also can make it hard or painful to urinate. Doctors prescribe antibiotic medicines for acute prostatitis and recommend that the patient drink more liquids. Treatment is usually successful.''Chronic prostatitis is a ''prostate inflammation'' that tends to recur over time. It is usually not associated with true bacterial infection but causes similar symptoms of pain and discomfort, without ''fevers'' or chills. Chronic prostatitis is difficult to treat, and the exact cause is not well understood. Antibiotics may be used in some cases as well as anti-inflammatory medicines such as ''ibuprofen''. In many cases, symptoms will resolve on their own.''Prostate infarct is a localized area of dead prostate tissue as a result of inadequate blood supply. Prostate infarct is uncommon and may cause sudden increases in the ''PSA test''.' "
Is it possible to prevent prostate problems?,"'The best protection against prostate problems is to have regular medical checkups that include a careful prostate exam. See a doctor promptly if the following symptoms occur:''Regular checkups are important even for men who have had surgery for BPH. Surgery does not protect against prostate cancer because only part of the prostate is removed. In all cases, the sooner a doctor finds a problem, the better the chances that treatment will work.' A frequent urge to urinate Painful urination Bloody urine Difficulty in urinating Dribbling of urine"
What is Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,"'The Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (B-SS) is a rare ''inherited'' ''bleeding disorder'' caused by abnormal platelets and subsequent abnormal clotting.  It is one of the giant platelet syndromes. This syndrome was originally described in 1948 by two physicians who were treating a patient with a bleeding problem.  They discovered that this patient had a prolonged bleeding time, fewer platelets, and larger platelets than the normal individual.  Since then, the platelet abnormality has been described and determined to be due to the platelets lacking the ability to stick adequately to injured blood-vessel walls. This is a crucial aspect of the process of forming a ''blood clot'', and as a result of this problem, there is excessive bleeding.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,"'Bernard-Soulier syndrome usually presents in the ''newborn'' period, infancy, or early childhood with ''bruises'', ''nosebleeds'' (epistaxis), and/or gum (gingival) bleeding.  Later problems can occur with anything that can induce bleeding such as ''menstruation'', ''trauma'', surgery, or stomach ulcers.' "
What is the cause of Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,"'Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a rare ''inherited disease'' and is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that both parents must carry a gene for the Bernard-Soulier syndrome and transmit that gene to the child for the child to have the disease. The prevalence is believed to be less than one in 1 million individuals. The molecular basis is now known and is due to a defect in the platelet glycoprotein complex 1b-IX-V. This is referred to as an adhesion complex and forms a receptor that enables platelets to stick together to form a clot. Normal platelets circulate in the blood and are the primary cells responsible for initiating clotting. Without this receptor, platelets cannot stick together and clotting does not occur normally. The parents of a child with B-SS will have a decrease in the glycoprotein but no impairment of platelet function and no abnormal bleeding. The Bernard-Soulier gene has been mapped to the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 (in the region 17pter-17p12).' "
How is Bernard-Soulier syndrome diagnosed?,"'Patients are often diagnosed with B-SS after seeking medical attention following prolonged or recurring bleeding episodes. Some infants are diagnosed after excessive bleeding following ''circumcision''. Other children and adults may be diagnosed after bleeding excessively following trauma or tooth extraction. Very frequently there is a history of another family member with similar symptoms, and the physician evaluating the patient will often document a detailed family history to assist in the diagnosis. B-SS ultimately is a laboratory diagnosis and usually requires a specialized laboratory to confirm the suspicion of the disease and involves platelet aggregation studies (testing for the ""stickiness"" of platelets) and flow cytometry. It is important to distinguish this syndrome from other platelet disorders (such as von Willebrand disease and immune ''thrombocytopenia'' purpura), since the treatments and management differ.' "
What is the treatment for Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,"'There is no specific treatment for Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Patients should avoid any ''drugs'' which may interfere with clot formation, such as ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'', and ''naproxen''.  Severe bleeding episodes may require platelet and blood transfusions.  Recombinant clotting factors and a coagulation drug known as ''DDAVP'' may also be of short-term benefit in selected patients. Affected individuals should avoid participation in contact sports.  ''Iron supplements'' are often recommended to patients with the disease to help minimize the ''anemia'' often observed in patients with frequent blood loss.' "
Is there a cure for Bernard-Soulier syndrome?,'Currently there is no cure for B-SS; however researchers are studying the efficacy of bone-marrow transplantation and have had some success in treating the syndrome in several severely affected patients.' 
Why do people get gout?,"'Gout'' is a type of ''arthritis'' causing ''pain'' and swelling in the joints. The symptoms usually occur as flares lasting for a week or two and then go away. ''Gout'' flares usually start in the big toe or a lower limb.''The disease happens when the body has high levels of a substance called uric acid or urate. When high levels of uric acid build up, the needle-shaped urate crystals form in and around the joints. This causes inflammation and arthritis of the affected joint. Many people with high serum uric acid, however, may not develop ''gout''.''Some factors may increase a person’s risk for ''gout'', including''Gout'' is a lifelong disease and cannot be cured. The disease, however, is one of the most controllable forms of arthritis. It can be effectively managed with early diagnosis, medications and lifestyle changes.' Male gender Obesity Certain health conditions, such asHeart failureHigh blood pressureInsulin resistanceMetabolic syndromeDiabetesPoor kidney function Heart failure High blood pressure Insulin resistance Metabolic syndrome Diabetes Poor kidney function Certain medications like diuretics or water pills Alcohol consumption Foods or drinks rich in fructose (a type of sugar) A diet rich in purines including red meat, organ meat, anchovies, sardines, mussels, scallops and tuna"
What foods are good for gout?,"'Dietary management of gout focuses on reducing the amount of uric acid in the system and attaining and maintaining a healthy body weight. \xa0''Foods that may help keep gout in check are' Fresh fruits and vegetables such as berries, oranges, bell pepper and pineapple Low-fat dairy products, such as yogurt and skimmed milk Nuts including nut butters such as almond butter and peanut butter Whole grains Potatoes, rice, whole-grain bread and pasta Eggs (in moderation) Oils such as olive oil  Flax and other seeds Plenty of water and other non-sugary and non-alcoholic drinks"
What can you not eat with gout?,"'Foods rich in purines must be avoided if you have gout. Purines are a type of chemical that produce uric acid in the body. They are naturally found in the body and can also be found in\xa0certain foods. The main modification in the ''diet'' traditionally involves eating a low-purine diet. Although avoiding purines completely is not possible, you should strive to limit them.\xa0''Both moderate and high-purine foods and drinks must be avoided if you have gout. These include\xa0' Alcohol is a major trigger for gout attacks. This is because when you drink alcohol your kidneys filter it out instead of uric acid. This leads to the build-up of uric acid in the body. All alcoholic beverages are bad for gout. Beer is especially bad for gout since it is rich in purines.  Certain fish, seafood and shellfish, including anchovies, trout, sardines, herring, codfish, mussels, codfish, scallops and haddock Organ meats such as liver, kidney, sweetbreads and brain. People with gout, however, can have a moderate intake of lean meats such as chicken and turkey.  Red meat including bacon, turkey, veal and venison  Dried beans and peas Food products containing a high amount of fructose (a type of sugar) such as soda and some juices, cereal, ice cream, candy and junk food"
What is the best exercise to get rid of love handles?,"'Love handles refer to the layers of fat present around the middle (waist) of a person’s body. They appear as folds or flab on the back and sides above the hips. They are also called muffin tops and are often stubborn despite ''exercise''. They are present over a group of muscles called obliques. As they change the overall appearance of a person, people often struggle to get rid of them. Love handles, like fat accumulation anywhere else in the body, appear when you consume more calories than you ''burn'' in a day. The excess calories get stored in the body as fat. This fat accumulates in various parts of the body. Love handles are just one manifestation of these sites. Thus, to get rid of this stubborn fat, you need to ''burn'' calories. Love handles may appear in people who have hormonal issues such as an excess or deficiency of the hormone cortisol in their body.''Targeted ''weight loss'', where a particular area of the body is focused upon, may not be practically achievable. To get rid of love handles, you need to achieve overall fat loss from the body. There are several ways to achieve that in a healthy way. You must consult your doctor to know what will work best for you. There is no single best ''exercise'' for tackling the problem of love handles. A combination of a healthy ''diet'' and physical activity is important. Some of the ways you can achieve a healthy weight and get rid of love handles include' Drink plenty of water and non-sugary fluids. Do regular weight-bearing exercises under expert guidance. Practice mindful eating so that you burn more calories than you eat to achieve a healthy weight loss. Perform regular cardio workouts such as walking, jogging, running or dancing. Try to keep stress away by practicing regular yoga or meditation, listening to music or pursuing hobbies. Cut down on your sugar intake. Also, beware of hidden sugars in junk food and soft drinks. Increase your fiber intake by regularly eating at least two to three servings of vegetables, salads, fruit and psyllium husk. Keep moving throughout your day, not just for an hour or two while exercising. Limit your intake of fats and fatty foods. Consume healthy fats such as olive oil, avocados, nuts and seeds. Get adequate sleep every day to keep stress hormones in check. Perform floor exercises and functional workouts such as burpees, mountain climbing and jumping jacks. Increase your protein intake, as protein helps you stay full for a long duration and provides raw material for healthy muscles to enable you to keep moving. You can consult with a dietician so you know how much protein you need to have in a day. Replace processed carbohydrates such as biscuits and pastries with complex carbohydrates such as oats, brown rice, whole-grain breads and sweet potatoes. Avoid alcohol consumption. Snack on low-calorie foods such as cucumbers and apples instead of chips and cookies. Do weight training three times a week under proper supervision to  strengthen core muscles and reduce the appearance of love handles."
What is constipation? What causes it?,"   Constipation is a feeling of being unable to empty your bowels completely or regularly. A person is generally considered to have constipation if bowel movements are fewer than three times per week. Constipation is a common problem, and everyone experiences it occasionally. Symptoms of constipation include feeling unable to empty your bowels completely, stools appearing dry/hard/lumpy, stomach upset or cramps, bloating, and loss of appetite. There are numerous causes of constipation including diseases of the digestive system and side effects of medications, but for most people, a diet low in fiber may be the cause. There are many foods a person can eat to help relieve constipation, for example, kiwi, popcorn, nuts, flaxseed, berries, dried fruit, and broccoli. To prevent constipation, avoid foods that can make it worse, for example, bananas, gluten, caffeine, alcohol, and chewing gum. Here is a list of 12 foods to eat to help relieve constipation. When planning a healthy diet, it helps to include plenty of high-fiber choices to help you stay regular and provide relief of constipation."
1. Beans for constipation relief,"""Beans have more than 10 grams of fiber per cup serving that's more than almost any other fiber source. Beans have a great mixture of soluble and insoluble fiber, both of which helps the food keep moving through the ""'intestines'' to relieve constipation.''Take your pick:''Add any of these to salads, soups, casseroles, or pasta.' baked beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, lima beans, pinto beans, or kidney beans."
2. Kiwi for constipation relief," The luscious green flesh of the kiwi may be just what the doctor ordered for constipation relief. One medium kiwi has about 2.5 grams of fiber and lots of vitamins and nutrients that are important for good health, including the intestines. A kiwi is a berry. And like most berries, it has edible seeds. You can even eat the peel, although most people prefer to eat just the flesh. A 2013 study of adults reported in Advances in Food and Nutrition Research found that eating kiwi promotes regular bowel movements. A previous study by researchers in Taipei also found eating two kiwis a day increased the number of bowel movements in adults with constipation."
3. Sweet potatoes for constipation relief," One medium baked sweet potato with skin has 3.8 grams of fiber, which can help get things moving along. This high fiber content in sweet potatoes helps prevent and relieve constipation. The skin contains most of the fiber so leave it on for the biggest benefits. Regular baked potatoes are also a good source of fiber, with 3 grams in a small baked potato. Leave the skin on, and high-calorie toppings such as butter or sour cream off."
4. Popcorn for constipation relief,"'Stay away from movie theater popcorn or popcorn laden with butter as the high fat content not only contains lots of calories, the fat can cause constipation.' Air-popped popcorn is a good choice for a high-fiber snack that can help provide relief from constipation. A filling 3 cups of air-popped popcorn contains 3.5 g fiber, and less than 100 calories."
5. Nuts and seeds for constipation relief,"'Nuts are a filling food that is also packed with fiber to help ease constipation.''Remember that nuts and seeds are high in calories, so keep portions small. Choose nuts and seeds that are raw or dry roasted, rather than roasted in oil.' Almonds, pecans, and walnuts have more fiber than other nuts. Just 1 ounce of almonds (about 23 nuts) contains 3.5 g fiber, 1 ounce of pecans (about 19 halves) contains 2.7 g fiber, and 1 ounce of walnuts (14 halves) has 1.9 g fiber. Seeds are another good fiber-filled choice for constipation relief. A scant 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds contains 1.1 g fiber, while 1 ounce of pumpkin seeds (about 85 seeds) has a whopping 5 g fiber. Sprinkle seeds on top of salads for added fiber and crunch."
"7. Pears, plums, and apples for constipation relief"," With the skin, an average pear provides 5 to 6 grams of dietary fiber to regulate the digestive system. Pears also are great for babies with constipation. Look for baby foods with pears as an ingredient, and pear juice can also aid constipation in infants. Fresh plums do not have much fiber, but dried plums – prunes – have as many as 12 g fiber per cup and are excellent for relieving constipation. One large apple has more than 5 g fiber."
6. Whole grain bread for constipation relief,"'Whole grains have lots of fiber, which is a good choice not only for the bowels, but also the ''heart''.' Researchers at the University of Finland in Helsinki found whole grain rye bread to be better than wheat bread and laxatives for relieving constipation. They reported their findings in the Journal of Nutrition in 2010. Their subjects ate enough slices (12.3 grams each) to get 30 grams of fiber a day, but you don't have to eat that much for it to work. Arabinoxylan, the main component of dietary fiber in rye, helps keep food moving through the intestine. Ezekiel bread is another good choice for relief of constipation. It is bread made of sprouted whole grains and legumes, which provides a good dose of fiber and nutrients."
8. Berries for constipation relief," Berries are tasty and easy to eat so take your pick: raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries - all are easy to snack on and full of fiber. For example just ½ cup of raspberries contains 4 g fiber to help relieve constipation. Eat them alone as a snack, try them on salads, or puree and freeze them for a cool summertime dessert."
9. Flaxseed for constipation relief," Flaxseed (or flax seed) can help with constipation and is a great source of fiber, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids. Just one tablespoon of both brown and golden flax seed has 2.8 g fiber, both soluble and insoluble. Most of the fiber is found in the husk of the flax seed, and ground flax seed is generally recommended for easier absorption of the fiber. It's easy to add flax seed to smoothies, on top of salads, or in oatmeal."
10. Broccoli for constipation relief," Just ½ cup of cooked broccoli contains 2.8 grams of fiber to aid with constipation relief, and it's also chock full of vitamin C. Broccoli makes a great side dish, and it can be eaten raw as a snack with hummus or a low-fat dip."
11. Dried fruit for constipation relief,"'Just remember that while dried fruit has more fiber than fresh fruit, it also has more calories.' Dried fruit is a smart choice if you're feeling constipated, as it actually contains more fiber than fresh fruit per serving. An easy snack is raisins, with 7 g fiber per cup (compared to 1 g in 1 cup of grapes). Aside from prunes, dried fruits such as figs, raisins, and dried apricots are excellent sources of fiber. Add dried fruit to cereal, or bake it into bran muffins. Soak it in water to soften it if it's hard to chew."
12. Prunes for constipation relief," Prunes were grandma's remedy. They could be yours, too. Prunes are high in insoluble fiber as well as the natural laxative sorbitol, which can help you ""go."" Researchers at the University of Iowa tested dried, pitted plums (prunes) against psyllium (a laxative) in 40 adults who were constipated. Those given the plums had measurably higher spontaneous bowel movements than those given the laxative. Prunes juice is also helpful at relieving constipation in babies."
What is gastritis?,"'Gastritis is a condition in which the lining of the stomach gets red and swollen (inflamed) due to various causes. The lining of the stomach makes acid and\xa0enzymes\xa0that help break down food to nutrients. The lining also protects itself from acid damage by secreting ''mucus''. In gastritis, the lining gets inflamed and starts making less acid, enzymes, and mucus. Gastritis is a common condition with a wide range of causes. For most people, gastritis may not be serious and improves quickly if treated. However, gastritis if left untreated may last for years.\xa0' "
What are the causes of gastritis?,"'The causes of gastritis include:' Bacterial infection: Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori is a type of bacteria that lives in the mucous lining of the stomach; without treatment, the infection can lead to ulcers and stomach cancer. Bile reflux: This is a backflow of digestive juices called bile into the stomach from the bile tract (it connects to the liver and gallbladder). Excessive use of cocaine or alcohol Smoking Regular intake of spicy food may also irritate the stomach lining Regularly taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or other painkillers Stressful events (such as a bad injury or critical illness, intentional or accidental ingestions of toxins or poisons, or major surgery) An autoimmune reaction—when the immune system mistakenly attacks own cells and tissues (in this case, the stomach lining) Pernicious anemia: This is a form of anemia that happens when the stomach can’t absorb vitamin B-12 and can irritate the stomach lining."
How is gastritis treated?,"'The treatment goal of gastritis aims to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach to relieve symptoms, allowing the stomach lining to heal and tackle any underlying cause.' Antacids: These over-the-counter medicines neutralize the acid in the stomach, which can provide rapid pain relief. Histamine 2 (H2) blockers: These medicines reduce acid production allowing the stomach lining to heal. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): These medicines reduce acid production even more effectively than H2 blockers (such as omeprazole). If the gastritis is caused by pernicious anemia, B12 vitamin shots may be given. For gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, your doctor will prescribe a regimen of several antibiotics plus an acid-blocking drug (used for heartburn)."
How to prevent blackheads?,"'Try the following tips to prevent blackheads:' Use alcohol-free skin products Wash your face after waking up, before going to bed, and after exercising Shampoo oily hair regularly Use sunscreen or sunblock before stepping out in the sun Change pillowcases often Limit the number of times you touch your face Apply nonabrasive cleansers on the skin gently Use water-based makeup products"
What is altitude sickness?, 
What causes altitude sickness?,"'Altitude sickness occurs when a person moves to a higher altitude too quickly. This does not give time to the body to adjust to the low air pressure and low oxygen at high altitudes. The symptoms happen due to low oxygen (''hypoxia'') in the air and blood causing the blood vessels of the brain to swell (dilate). The dilated blood vessels in the brain may cause ''headaches'' and swelling of the brain. The swelling puts pressure on the brain, squeezing it against the skull.\xa0''Altitude sickness may rarely advance to a more severe form of the illness called high altitude cerebral edema (HACE). HACE occurs when brain swelling becomes severe manifesting as severe ''headache'', ''confusion'', lethargy, lack of coordination, irritability, ''vomiting'', ''seizures'', ''coma'' and eventually death if untreated.''In some cases, the low oxygen causes the ''lungs'' to become leaky and accumulate fluid. This is called ''high altitude pulmonary edema'' (HAPE). This may cause ''cough'', chest discomfort, pink frothy sputum and ''heart failure''.' "
Who is at risk for altitude sickness?,"'Altitude sickness may affect anyone regardless of their age, gender or level of physical ''fitness''. Altitude sickness is directly related to how rapid the climb to high altitude is. It is more likely to occur if the climbs are more difficult and take more strength and energy than with a slow and easy climb.''Some of the factors that determine a person’s risk for altitude sickness are:' Genetic makeup A history of previous altitude sickness Residing at an altitude below 3,000 ft Presence of respiratory infections or diseases Obesity A rapid rate of ascent Over-exertion before the climb Alcohol consumption  Taking sleeping pills"
What is TMJ?,"'The ''temporomandibular joint (TMJ)'' connects the jawbone and skull. It is situated just in front of the ears. TMJ moves while talking, chewing, and swallowing; hence, TMJ is essential for these functions to take place normally.''TMJ disorders'' occur when TMJ and/or muscles around TMJ get affected. This could be due to ''trauma'', ''joint swelling'', or joint ''arthritis'' due to joint overuse.' "
What are the symptoms of TMJ disorders?,"'Symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe and debilitating, such as:' Pain while talking, chewing, or swallowing  Pain in the ear, face, jaw, or neck Clicking, popping, or grating sounds during jaw movements Locking of TMJ"
Exercises for TMJ pain relief,"'Mechanism of action:''The exact mechanism of how temporomandibular joint (TMJ) exercises help in relieving pain is unknown. The following benefits of TMJ exercises could possibly help in pain relief:''There are several exercises that can be done for TMJ disorders. There are no guidelines on the frequency of the exercises. Hence, it is advised to consult a doctor or dentist to analyze the type of exercise and frequency depending on the extent of TMJ disorders and to help design an exercise regimen. Overdoing exercises can lead to joint overuse, worsening inflammation, and pain. Most exercises can be done 6-10 times, two to three times a day.''Along with exercises, these additional home remedies and lifestyle changes may help relieve TMJ pain:' Strengthening of the muscles around the joint Stretching and relaxing the jaw Increased jaw mobility Increased range of mouth opening Promoting healing of the jaw Joint rest and limit large movements of the joint Avoid chewing hard foods Switch to a soft diet till the joint heals Avoid chewing gum or chewy sweets such as gummy bears Avoid biting of nails and pen/pencil tops Avoid constant biting of the lower lip Change posture by avoiding sleeping on the affected side or switching to a softer pillow Use mouth guards to realign the jaw and prevent teeth grinding and jaw clenching Use warm compress towels Apply ice to the affected ear for no longer than 15 minutes per hour Apply pain-relieving ointments containing painkillers such as diclofenac over the affected area Take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen Perform stress-relief techniques help prevent jaw tension caused because of stress Acupuncture or acupressure may help relieve TMJ pain and pressure"
What is beta thalassemia?, Thalassemias are inherited blood disorders. Thalassemia patients make defective hemoglobin. There are two forms of beta thalassemia: thalassemia minor and thalassemia major (also called Cooley's anemia). Beta thalassemia is classically described in people of Italian and Greek origin.
What are the thalassemias?,"'The thalassemias are a group of genetic (inherited) blood disorders that share in common one feature, the defective production of hemoglobin, the protein that enables ''red blood cells'' to carry and deliver oxygen. There are many different mechanisms of defective hemoglobin synthesis and, hence, many types of thalassemia.'  "
What is the most common type of thalassemia?,"'The most familiar type of thalassemia is beta thalassemia. It involves decreased production of normal adult hemoglobin (Hb A), the predominant type of hemoglobin from soon after birth until death. (All hemoglobin consists of two parts: heme and globin). The globin part of Hb A has 4 protein sections called polypeptide chains. Two of these chains are identical and are designated the alpha chains. The other two chains are also identical to one another but differ from the alpha chains and are termed the beta chains. In persons with beta thalassemia, there is reduced or absent production of beta globin chains.' "
What is the difference between thalassemia minor and major?,"""There are two forms of beta thalassemia. They are thalassemia minor and thalassemia major (which is also called Cooley's ""'anemia'').''Thalassemia minor: The individual with thalassemia minor has only one copy of the beta thalassemia gene (together with one perfectly normal beta-chain gene). The person is said to be heterozygous for beta thalassemia.''Persons with thalassemia minor have (at most) mild anemia (slight lowering of the hemoglobin level in the blood). This situation can very closely resemble that with mild iron-deficiency anemia. However, persons with thalassemia minor have a normal blood iron level (unless they are iron deficient for other reasons). No treatment is necessary for thalassemia minor. In particular, iron is neither necessary nor advised.'""Thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia): The child born with thalassemia major has two genes for beta thalassemia and no normal beta-chain gene. The child is homozygous for beta thalassemia. This causes a striking deficiency in beta chain production and in the production of Hb A. Thalassemia major is a significant illness.""""The clinical picture associated with thalassemia major was first described in 1925 by the American pediatrician Thomas Cooley. Hence, the name Cooley's anemia in his honor.""'At birth the baby with thalassemia major seems entirely normal. This is because the predominant hemoglobin at birth is still fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbF has two alpha chains (like Hb A) and two gamma chains (unlike Hb A). It has no beta chains so the baby is protected at birth from the effects of thalassemia major.''Anemia begins to develop within the first months after birth. It becomes progressively more and more severe. The infant fails to thrive (to grow normally) and often has problems feeding (due to easy ''fatigue'' from lack of oxygen due to the profound anemia), bouts of ''fever'', ''diarrhea'', and other intestinal problems.' "
What is Mediterranean anemia?,"'The gene for beta thalassemia is not evenly distributed among peoples. It is, for example, relatively more frequent in people of Italian and Greek origin, both of which are peoples from the Mediterranean. Because of this, thalassemia major has been called Mediterranean anemia.''The name thalassemia was coined at the University of Rochester in upstate New York by the Nobel Prize-winning pathologist George Whipple and the professor of ''pediatrics'' William Bradford from the Greek thalassa for sea and -emia, meaning the blood. Thalassemia means ""sea in the blood."" But for the Greeks, the sea was the Mediterranean, so thalassemia also conveys the idea of the Mediterranean in the blood.''The reason that the gene for beta thalassemia is relatively common, for example, among people of Italian and Greek origin is that parts of Italy and Greece were once full of ''malaria''. The presence of thalassemia minor (like sickle cell trait in Africa) afforded protection against ''malaria'', and therefore, this gene thrived.' "
What is the genetic pattern of inheritance of beta thalassemia?,"'The pattern of genetic transmission of beta thalassemia (and ''sickle cell disease'') was deciphered by James V. Neel when he was at the University of Rochester (and later at the University of Michigan). Dr. Neel recognized that the parents of children with thalassemia major had thalassemia minor with one beta thalassemia gene. When these parents had children, they have a 25% chance of having a thalassemia major child (with both genes for beta thalassemia), a 50% chance of having children with thalassemia minor (with only one gene for beta thalassemia), and a 25% chance of having a child without thalassemia major or minor (with both genes for normal beta chains). This form of inheritance is medically referred to as an autosomal recessive pattern.' "
The diagnosis of thalassemia major and minor,"'Persons with thalassemias have smaller sized red blood cells than unaffected people as well as low red blood cell counts (anemia). Thalassemia major and thalassemia minor can now be diagnosed (and distinguished from one another) not only by conventional clinical and blood testing, but also by molecular and genetic tests. These tests permit accurate diagnosis to be made at any time, even before birth (in fact, well before the beta chains are even synthesized).' "
The treatment of thalassemia major,"'Infants with thalassemia major are well at birth because of a special form of hemoglobin present in the fetus and ''newborn''. Eventually, however, this hemoglobin is replaced by defective hemoglobin. Symptoms emerge late in the first year of life. The child develops ''pale skin'', irritability, growth retardation, swelling of the abdomen due to enlargement of the ''liver'' and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) with ''jaundice''. This is associated with severe anemia with rupture of the red blood cells (hemolytic anemia). The child with thalassemia major becomes dependent on blood transfusions and, although they do help, they create further problems including ''iron overload''. ''Folic acid'' supplementation is often given. At this time, the primary treatments are directed at relieving symptoms of the illness. Selected patients may qualify for bone marrow or stem cell transplants. Gene therapy remains a potential treatment for the future.''The long-term hope is that thalassemia major will be cured by insertion of the normal beta-chain gene through gene therapy or by another modality of molecular medicine.''Additional information is also available through the following organizations:''The National Institutes of Health (NIH)''Cellular Hematology Scientific Research Group''Blood Diseases Program''National ''Heart'', Lung, and Blood Institute''6701 Rockledge Drive, MSC-7950''Bethesda, MD 20892-7950.

"What is methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type?","'Beta-globin type methemoglobinemia is an inherited blood disorder. It disrupts the function of ''hemoglobin'', the molecule in ''red blood cells'' that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body. Methemoglobinemia is characterized by increased levels of an atypical form of hemoglobin that is unable to deliver oxygen efficiently.''In most individuals with beta-globin type methemoglobinemia, the only symptom is cyanosis, which is a bluish appearance of the skin, mucous membranes, or the area underneath the fingernails due to a lack of oxygen in the blood. Symptoms may appear as early as age 3 to 4 months. Methemoglobinemia symptoms do not improve when affected individuals are given additional oxygen, because oxygen cannot bind effectively to the abnormal hemoglobin.' "
"How common is methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type?",'The incidence of beta-globin type methemoglobinemia is unknown.' 
"What genes are related to methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type?","'Mutations in the HBB gene cause methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type.''Hemoglobin consists of four protein subunits and four iron-containing molecules called heme. Heme molecules are necessary for red blood cells to pick up oxygen in the ''lungs'' and release oxygen to other cells in the body. Hemoglobin typically has two protein subunits call alpha-globin and two protein subunits called beta-globin. The HBB gene provides instructions for making beta-globin. Mutations in specific regions of the HBB gene lead to an atypical version of beta-globin known as hemoglobin M. Hemoglobin M interacts abnormally with heme molecules, which impairs the uptake of oxygen by red blood cells. As a result, a reduced amount of oxygen is delivered to cells throughout the body.''Other types of methemoglobinemia can be caused by abnormal alpha-globin, a shortage of a particular enzyme called NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, or unusual reactions to certain ''drugs'' or chemicals.' "
"How do people inherit methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type?","'This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.' "
"What other names do people use for methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type?", blue baby syndrome congenital methemoglobinemia hemoglobin M disease
What triggers heartburn?,"'Heartburn'' is the burning sensation in the chest due to backflow or reflux of the acidic stomach contents into the food pipe (''esophagus''). Heartburn is a major symptom of ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' or ''GERD''. The food pipe or esophagus is a tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. The lower end of the esophagus has a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter or LES. The LES guards the reflux of stomach contents into the food pipe. In ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''), the LES does not close properly allowing the stomach contents to leak back or reflux into the food pipe and irritate it.''Certain foods and ''drinks'' have been recognized to trigger heartburn. They include spicy and fatty foods, ''alcohol'', coffee (including decaf), tomatoes, ''chocolate'', and carbonated ''beverages''.''Besides certain foods, several other factors may cause heartburn. They include:' Overeating Sleeping or lying down right after a meal Smoking Rigorous exercise especially after a meal Obesity or being overweight Hiatal hernia (a condition in which the stomach bulges up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the two areas) Certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), blood pressure medications, and medications used to treat asthma, heart diseases, anxiety, depression, and cancer Stress and anxiety"
Can multivitamins cause heartburn?,"'Multivitamins'', especially the ones containing zinc, iron, or calcium, can aggravate the ''symptoms of GERD'' including heartburn. To avoid heartburn caused by multivitamins:' Avoid taking multivitamins in empty stomach Take multivitamins with food Do not take multivitamins right before exercise Try the easy to digest forms of multivitamins, such as chewable tablets, powders, and dissolvable forms Avoid mega doses of multivitamins, such as the once a month or once a week dose Take smaller daily doses of multivitamins Try meeting your daily nutrient needs through diet"
How do you treat heartburn?,"'The treatment for heartburn involves:' Lifestyle and home remedies:Eat small mealsEat your food slowlyAvoid certain foods and beverages, such as spicy and oily foods, citrus, tomato, mint, garlic, chocolate, tea, coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcoholDo not lie down right after eatingDo not snack close to bedtimeMaintain a healthy weightDo not smoke Eat small meals Eat your food slowly Avoid certain foods and beverages, such as spicy and oily foods, citrus, tomato, mint, garlic, chocolate, tea, coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcohol Do not lie down right after eating Do not snack close to bedtime Maintain a healthy weight Do not smoke Medications:Antacids to neutralize stomach acidH2 blockers to decrease acid productionFoaming agents to coat the stomach to prevent refluxProton pump inhibitors to reduce the amount of acid the stomach makesProkinetics to help strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter (LES); they empty the stomach faster and reduce acid reflux Antacids to neutralize stomach acid H2 blockers to decrease acid production Foaming agents to coat the stomach to prevent reflux Proton pump inhibitors to reduce the amount of acid the stomach makes Prokinetics to help strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter (LES); they empty the stomach faster and reduce acid reflux Surgery: If the medications do not provide lasting relief and the symptoms are severely interfering with everyday activities, your doctor may recommend surgery options, which include:LINX device placement: The procedure involves surgically placing a ring (LINX device) around the outside of the lower end of the esophagus.Fundoplication: The procedure creates an artificial valve using the upper part of the stomach. LINX device placement: The procedure involves surgically placing a ring (LINX device) around the outside of the lower end of the esophagus. Fundoplication: The procedure creates an artificial valve using the upper part of the stomach."
What is a ganglion?,"'A ''ganglion'' is a sac-like swelling or ''cyst'' formed from the tissue that lines a joint or tendon. The tissue, called synovium, normally functions to produce lubricating fluid for these areas. A ganglion is a ''cyst'' formed by the synovium that is filled with a thick jelly-like fluid. While ganglia can follow local ''trauma'' to the tendon or joint, they usually form for unknown reasons. Occasionally, ganglia are early signs of ''arthritis'' that will become more obvious in the future.'  "
What are ganglion causes and risk factors?,'Ganglions can be caused by inflammation of the tissue lining joints and tendons. This inflammation can be a result of local injury or underlying arthritis.' 
Where do ganglia form and what symptoms do they cause?,"'Ganglia can form around any joint, but they are most frequently found in the wrist and ankles. They are usually painless and often barely visible as localized swellings. They typically do not appear to be inflamed. The largest ganglions form behind the back of the knee, causing a sense of fullness or tightness. A ganglion here is referred to as a ''Baker cyst'', after the doctor who originally described the condition.' "
What specialists treat a ganglion?,"'Specialists who treat ganglions include primary-care providers such as general medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as ''rheumatologists'' and general and orthopedic surgeons.' "
How do doctors diagnose and assess a ganglion?,"'Doctors diagnose a ganglion by physical examination. These ganglions can usually be felt on examination. A ganglion can be a result of underlying arthritis of the adjacent joint, and X-ray analysis is often used to determine the integrity of joints affected.' "
What are treatment options and home remedies for ganglia?,"'A ganglion can spontaneously rupture and go away. Sometimes gentle ''massage'' is all that is necessary. Other treatment options include removal of the ganglion fluid with a needle and syringe (aspiration) with or without an injection of cortisone medication. Occasionally, the entire ganglion is resected with surgery. People with a persisting or recurring ganglion should be evaluated for signs of systemic forms of arthritis, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis''.'  "
What is the prognosis of a ganglion?,"'The prognosis of a ganglion is generally excellent. Usually, a ganglion does not affect joint function and is painless. They can resolve spontaneously, but can require injection or resection for complete recovery.' "
Is it possible to prevent a ganglion?,"'No, it is not possible to prevent a ganglion.' "
What are electrolytes?,"'Chemically, electrolytes are substances that become ions in solution and acquire the capacity to conduct electricity. Electrolytes are present in the ''human body'', and the balance of the electrolytes in our bodies is essential for normal function of our cells and our organs. ''Common electrolytes that are measured by doctors with blood testing include sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The functions and normal range values for these electrolytes are described below. ' "
Sodium,"'Sodium is the major positive ion (cation) in fluid outside of cells. The chemical notation for sodium is Na+. When combined with chloride, the resulting substance is table salt. Excess sodium (such as that obtained from dietary sources) is excreted in the urine. Sodium regulates the total amount of water in the body and the transmission of sodium into and out of individual cells also plays a role in critical body functions. Many processes in the body, especially in the brain, nervous system, and muscles, require electrical signals for communication. The movement of sodium is critical in the generation of these electrical signals. Therefore, too much or too little sodium can cause cells to malfunction, and extremes in the blood sodium levels (too much or too little) can be fatal.''A Normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased sodium (hypernatremia) in the blood occurs whenever there is excess sodium in relation to water. There are numerous causes of hypernatremia; these may include kidney disease, too little water intake, and loss of water due to diarrhea and/or vomiting. A decreased concentration of sodium (hyponatremia) occurs whenever there is a relative increase in the amount of body water relative to sodium. This happens with some diseases of the liver and kidney, in patients with congestive heart failure, in burn victims, and in numerous other conditions."
Potassium,"'Potassium is the major positive ion (cation) found inside of cells. The chemical notation for potassium is K+. The proper level of potassium is essential for normal cell function. Among the many functions of potassium in the body are regulation of the heartbeat and the function of the muscles. A seriously abnormal increase in potassium (''hyperkalemia'') or decrease in potassium (''hypokalemia'') can profoundly affect the nervous system and increases the chance of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), which, when extreme, can be fatal.''The normal blood potassium level is 3.5 - 5.0 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 3.5 - 5.0 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased potassium is known as hyperkalemia. Potassium is normally excreted by the kidneys, so disorders that decrease the function of the kidneys can result in hyperkalemia. Certain medications may also predispose an individual to hyperkalemia. Hypokalemia, or decreased potassium, can arise due to kidney diseases; excessive losses due to heavy sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, eating disorders, certain medications, or other causes."
Chloride,"'Chloride is the major anion (negatively charged ion) found in the fluid outside of cells and in the blood. An anion is the negatively charged part of certain substances such as table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) when dissolved in liquid.\xa0Chloride plays a role in helping the body maintain a normal balance of fluids.''The balance of chloride ion (Cl-) is closely regulated by the body. Significant increases or decreases in chloride can have deleterious or even fatal consequences:''The normal serum range for chloride is 98 - 108 mmol/L.' Increased chloride (hyperchloremia): Elevations in chloride may be seen in diarrhea, certain kidney diseases, and sometimes in overactivity of the parathyroid glands. Decreased chloride (hypochloremia): Chloride is normally lost in the urine, sweat, and stomach secretions. Excessive loss can occur from heavy sweating, vomiting, and adrenal gland and kidney disease."
Bicarbonate,"'The bicarbonate ion acts as a buffer to maintain the normal levels of acidity (pH) in blood and other fluids in the body. Bicarbonate levels are measured to monitor the acidity of the blood and body fluids. The acidity is affected by foods or medications that we ingest and the function of the kidneys and ''lungs''. The chemical notation for bicarbonate on most lab reports is HCO3- or represented as the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). The normal serum range for bicarbonate is 22-30 mmol/L. ''The bicarbonate test is usually performed along with tests for other blood electrolytes. ''Disruptions in the normal bicarbonate level'' may be due to diseases that interfere with respiratory function, kidney diseases, metabolic conditions, or other causes.' "
Facts you should know about bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma),"'Bile duct cancer''\xa0arises from the cells that line the bile ducts, the drainage system for bile that is produced by the ''liver''. Bile ducts collect this bile, draining it into the gallbladder and finally into the small intestine where it aids in the ''digestion'' process. Bile duct ''cancer'' is also called cholangiocarcinoma.''Bile duct ''cancer'' is a rare form of ''cancer'', with approximately 2,500 new cases diagnosed in the United States each year. There are three general locations where this type of ''cancer'' may arise within the bile drainage system:''Bile duct ''cancers'' are most commonly found just outside of the liver in the perihilar area and least commonly found within the liver.' Within the liver (intrahepatic) affecting the bile ducts located within the liver Just outside of the liver (extrahepatic or perihilar) located at the notch of the liver where the bile ducts exit Far outside of the liver (distal extrahepatic) near where the bile ducts enter the intestine (called the ampulla of Vater)"
What are causes and risk factors for bile duct cancer?,"'The incidence of bile duct cancer increases with age. It is a slow-growing cancer that invades local structures and for that reason, the diagnosis is often made late in the disease process when the bile ducts become blocked. This blockade prevents bile drainage from the liver into the gallbladder and intestine. Depending upon where the blockage occurs, this can lead to inflammation of the liver (''hepatitis'') and/or pancreas (''pancreatitis'').''Most patients who develop bile duct cancer have no risk to do so. However, chronic inflammation of the bile ducts may be a risk factor for this cancer. Diseases that can cause this type of chronic inflammation include ''primary sclerosing cholangitis'' (especially when associated with ''ulcerative colitis''), chronic ''liver disease'', including ''hepatitis B'', ''hepatitis C'', chronic alcoholic ''hepatitis'', and ''cirrhosis''.''Certain parasitic infections found in the Far East that cause liver infections are associated with an increased risk.''Gallstones'' are not a risk factor for developing bile duct cancer, but stones within the liver do pose an increased risk. Liver stones are not often seen in the North American population but are more common in Asian countries.''There are rare congenital diseases that increase the risk of bile duct cancer, including Lynch II syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis ''colorectal cancer'"" associated with biliary tree and other cancers) and Caroli's syndrome (""'portal hypertension'', hepatic fibrosis, and biliary tree ''cysts'').''Native Americans are six times more likely to develop bile duct cancer. Asian Americans may also be at higher risk. Bile duct cancer is also more prevalent in Israel and Japan, but it is a very rare disease in North America.' "
What are bile duct cancer symptoms and signs?,"'The initial symptoms of bile duct cancer occur because of inability of bile to drain normally from the liver where it is produced. This causes liver inflammation (hepatitis). Cholangiocarcinoma symptoms include yellow coloring of the skin and eyes (''jaundice''), ''itching'', ''abdominal pain'', ''bloating'', and ''weight loss''. Low-grade ''fever'' may be present, and there can be darkening in the color of urine and ''stool''.''Unfortunately, bile duct tumors may not cause any symptoms until they have grown in size and the cancer has spread (metastasized) from beyond its original location. ''Abdominal pain'' is often a late symptom and is usually located in the right upper quadrant of the belly and may be associated with a tender, ''enlarged liver''.'  "
How do physicians diagnose bile duct cancer?,"'History and physical examination are key clues for the diagnosis of bile duct cancer. Painless ''jaundice'' (yellow/orange coloring of the skin and eyes) may be the only initial clue. The history often includes reviewing ''alcohol'' use, ''drug use'', or recent illnesses that may be associated with hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver. Other cholangiocarcinoma symptoms may include ''weight loss'', ''loss of appetite'', ''weakness'', loss of energy, and easy ''bruising'' or bleeding (factors that clot the blood are manufactured in the liver and loss of ''liver function'' may decrease the clotting factors in the bloodstream).''The physical examination may be useful in detecting tenderness in the abdomen, especially in the right upper quadrant beneath the ribs (where the liver is located). A quarter of patients with bile duct cancer will have an ''enlarged liver'' that can be palpated or felt on exam. During general exam, the patient is often jaundiced, having yellow-tinged skin. This may be seen most easily in the white portion (sclera) of the eyes or under the tongue.''Blood tests are often ordered to assess ''liver function''. ''Liver enzymes'' (AST, ALT, GGT, ''alkaline phosphatase''), ''bilirubin'' levels, ''complete blood count'', ''electrolytes'', BUN and ''creatinine'', and INR/PTT (international normalized ratio/partial thromboplastin time), and PT (prothrombin time).''There is no blood test that can specifically diagnose bile duct cancer. The diagnosis is confirmed by tissue sample obtained by biopsy by a surgeon, ''gastroenterologist'', or interventional radiologist and a pathologist using a microscope to exam the cells obtained by that biopsy sample.''Imaging may be used to evaluate the structure of the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, and other surrounding organs. Tests like ''ultrasound'', ''CT scan'', and ''MRI'' may be performed to look for a ''tumor'' and its location.''Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (''ERCP'') is a specialized test used to examine the bile duct as it enters the duodenum. ''ERCP'' is performed by a gastroenterologist using a fiberoptic camera at the end of a flexible viewing tube. The tube is passed through the mouth and threaded through the stomach into the first part of the small intestine where the common bile duct enters. This test is commonly performed to examine the lining of the ''esophagus'' and stomach, but is also very effective in detecting conditions that affect the bile ducts, including bile duct cancer, ''gallstones'' stuck in the bile duct, and abnormal narrowing of the bile duct. Dye can be injected through the tube into the bile duct opening to outline the bile ducts and detect obstruction. Biopsies or cell washings can be obtained to look for cancer cells. If a blockage is found, during the same procedure the gastroenterologist may be able to place a ''stent'' to keep the duct open and allow bile to drain.''Sometimes, an interventional radiologist may obtain a tissue biopsy by threading a needle through the skin into the liver.''Once the diagnosis of bile duct cancer is made, it is important to stage the cancer to help direct potential treatment. The three parts of TNM staging include the following:''Cancer can be staged from 0 to 4, where 0 is no tumor, 1 is local tumor with no spread to ''lymph nodes'' or other parts of the body, and 4 is significant local growth and ''lymph node'' involvement and spread to other parts of the body.''While staging is important, as well as detecting tumor spread beyond the liver and bile duct, often the critical staging questions can only be answered at surgery. During an operation, the surgeon can decide whether or not the whole tumor can be resected or removed. Survival rates are markedly improved if complete resection is possible.' T is for the primary tumor and how much it has grown locally and invaded other structures. For a bile duct tumor, this includes the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, stomach, and intestine. N is for the lymph nodes that are involved. The more nodes involved and the farther the distance from the bile duct, the more severe the cancer. M is for metastasis. Has the tumor spread to other parts of the body?"
What is the treatment for bile duct cancer?,"'Treatment for bile duct cancer depends upon where the cancer is located and whether it is possible for it to be completely removed by surgery. Unfortunately, those afflicted with this cancer tend to be older and may be unable to tolerate and recover from a significant operation. The decision regarding surgery needs to be individualized for the specific patient and their situation.''Other treatment options tend to be palliative, not curative, and are meant to preserve quality of life. ''Chemotherapy'' and ''radiation therapy'' may be options that are suggested to treat bile duct cancer.''Photodynamic therapy'' is another alternative to help shrink the tumor and control symptoms.''Radioembolization is an option if the tumor cannot be removed by surgery. With radioembolization, small amounts of radioactive material are injected into the arteries that supply the tumor in hopes of shrinking the tumor size by impeding its blood supply.''ERCP may be used to ''stent'' the bile duct, keeping it open to allow bile drainage from the liver and gallbladder into the intestine. This is often very helpful in controlling symptoms but does not treat the tumor itself.''Pain'' control may be an issue because the enlarging tumor can cause significant ''pain'' in the abdomen and back. Regional anesthetic blocks may be useful in controlling pain.'""As with all cancers, the treatment is individualized for the patient. Discussion between the patient, health-care professional, and family are important to help understand treatment options, including cure versus palliative care or symptom control and quality of life. The patient's wishes are key.""  "
What are the complications of bile duct cancer?,"'Obstruction of the bile duct can lead to infection of the bile drainage system or cholangitis.''Cirrhosis'' may develop in bile duct cancer. This may be due to the tumor obstructing the bile duct and causing liver cell destruction and scarring. This is especially true in patients with primary ''sclerosing cholangitis''. Both cirrhosis and ''sclerosing cholangitis'' are listed as potential risk factors for bile duct cancer.''Other complications may be a consequence of the procedures used to diagnose and treat the cancer. These include complications of surgery, ''chemotherapy'', and ''radiation'' therapy.' "
What is the prognosis for bile duct cancer? What is the life expectancy for bile duct cancer?,"""How well a patient does after the diagnosis of bile duct cancer depends upon many factors, including where the tumor is located, if and how much it has spread, and the patient's underlying general health. Patients have a better prognosis the farther away from the liver hilum the tumor is located, and according to certain aspects of shape and cell type within the tumor. Prognosis is worse for those patients whose tumor has invaded adjacent tissues, has ""'lymph node'' involvement, or has spread to distant places in the body.''If untreated, bile duct ''cancer survival'' is 50% at one year, 20% at two years, and 10% at three years with virtually no survival at five years.''Being able to completely remove the tumor increases survival but this mostly depends upon the location of the tumor and whether it has invaded other tissues.' "
Is it possible to prevent bile duct cancer?,"'Since the cause of bile duct cancer is uncertain, specific methods of ''prevention'' do not exist. However, preventing liver inflammation and cirrhosis may decrease the risk of developing this cancer. This includes moderating the use of alcohol, being vaccinated for the ''hepatitis B'' virus, and abstaining from risky behaviors that might cause infection with ''hepatitis C''.''As with all diseases that tend to develop at an older age, living a healthy lifestyle may extend lifespan, as well. This includes not ''smoking'', eating a balanced ''diet'', keeping physically active, and maintaining a healthy weight.'  "
What are the statistics for bile duct cancer?,"'There are approximately 2,500 new cases of bile duct cancer diagnosed each year in the United States or one case per 100,000 people.''In patients who have bile duct cancer located in the liver hilum, 40%-60% of patients undergo surgery that completely removes the tumor and the average survival is 24 months. For patients with tumor in the same location, but cannot be completely removed, average survival is 21 months.' "
Facts you should know about schistosomiasis," Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma organisms that can cause acute and chronic infection. Many symptoms of schistosomiasis infection frequently include fever, blood in stools or urine, and abdominal discomfort. The immune response and Schistosoma egg migration through tissues and their deposition in body organs cause the disease. Schistosomiasis has an acute and chronic phase. Health care professionals diagnose schistosomiasis by identifying characteristic eggs in feces, urine, or biopsy samples. Serologic (blood) tests may aid the diagnosis. The antiparasitic drug praziquantel (Biltricide) often effectively treats schistosomiasis, especially in acute phase disease. Chronic schistosomiasis often produces complications in various organ systems (for example, the gastrointestinal system, urinary system, heart, and liver). Currently, there is no vaccine available for schistosomiasis."
What is schistosomiasis?,"'Schistosomiasis is a disease that is caused by parasites (genus ''Schistosoma'') that enter humans by attaching to the skin, penetrating it, and then migrating through the venous system to the portal veins where the parasites produce eggs and eventually, the symptoms of acute or chronic disease (for example, ''fever'', abdominal discomfort, blood in stools). Health officials consider the disease to be a worm infection, or helminthiasis.''Bilharziasis, bilharzia, bilharziosis, and snail ''fever'' or, in the acute form, Katayama ''fever'' are alternate names for schistosomiasis. Theodore Bilharz identified the parasite ''Schistosoma hematobium'' in Egypt in 1851. Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent tropical disease in the world; ''malaria'"" is the first. The disease is found mainly in developing countries in Africa, Asia, South America, the Middle East, and the Caribbean and is considered one of many tropical diseases that can be soil-transmitted (or water-transmitted). In the U.S., it is diagnosed in tourists who have visited these developing countries and in visitors from these countries, or from lab accidents. More than 200,000 people die each year in Sub-Saharan Africa from this infection. The type of snail that is part of the parasite's life cycle (see below) is not endemic (non-endemic) to U.S. freshwater sources in the U.S.""'In 2014, an outbreak occurred in Corsica, France, in people ''swimming'' in the Cavu River. This was the first reported locally acquired ''Schistosoma'' infection in France.'  "
What causes schistosomiasis?,"'Parasites of the genus ''Schistosoma'' (''S. mansoni'', ''S. mekongi'', ''S. intercalatum'', ''S. hematobium'', and ''S. japonicum'') cause the disease. The disease in humans is part of the complicated life cycle of the parasites that is illustrated in the figure below. Humans enter freshwater areas that contain snails that grow ''Schistosoma'' sporocysts that develop into free-''swimming'' cercariae shed by freshwater snails (''Biomphalaria'' and ''Bulinus'"" genus), considered to be an intermediate host. The cercariae can attach to and penetrate the human skin, migrate to blood vessels, and through lung blood capillaries reach the portal blood or vesicular (bladder) blood systems. During this migration, the cercariae change and develop from schistosomula into male and female adult parasitic worms. The worms incorporate human proteins into their surface structures, so most humans produce little or no immune response to the parasites. After parasite mating occurs in the portal or vesicular blood system, egg production occurs. In contrast to the adult parasites, the parasite's eggs stimulate a strong immune response by most humans. Some eggs migrate through the bowel or bladder tissue and are shed in feces or urine to soil or water, while other eggs are swept into the portal blood and lodge in other tissue sites. Eggs shed into urine or feces may reach maturity in freshwater (a hatched egg develops into a miracidium) and complete their life cycle by infecting susceptible snails. In addition, some adult worms may migrate to other organs (for example, eyes or ""'liver''). This life cycle is further complicated by ''S. japonicum'' species that may also infect domesticated and wild animals, which can then serve as another host system. ''S. hematobium'' is the species that usually infects the human bladder tissue, while the other species usually infect the bowel tissue.''The acute and chronic symptoms of schistosomiasis are thought to be mainly due to the egg migration through tissue and the human immune response to the eggs. Chronic symptoms are mainly due to eggs that are not shed from the body. Complications (for example, hepatomegaly or ''enlarged liver'' and ''bladder cancer'') related to the disease are thought to occur due to long-term exposure to the highly antigenic eggs.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of schistosomiasis?,"'Although a few patients may have minor skin irritation when the cercariae enter the skin, most people do not develop symptoms until the eggs develop (about one to two months after initial skin penetration). Then, fever, ''chills'', ''cough'', and muscle aches can begin within one to two months of infection. However, most people have no symptoms at this early phase of infection. Unfortunately, a few patients develop acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) during this one- to two-month period, and their symptoms resemble those for ''serum sickness'' and are as follows:''The majority of people who develop chronic schistosomiasis have symptoms develop months or years after the initial exposure to the parasites. The following is a list of most symptoms associated with chronic schistosomiasis. Patients usually have a few of these symptoms.'   Fever Abdominal pain (liver/spleen area) Bloody diarrhea or blood in the stools Cough Malaise Headache Rash Body aches Abdominal pain Abdominal swelling (ascites) Bloody diarrhea or blood in the stools Blood in the urine and painful urination Shortness of breath and coughing Weakness Chest pain and palpitations Seizures Paralysis Mental status changes Lesions on the vulva or the perianal area"
How do health care professionals diagnose schistosomiasis?,"'The presumptive diagnosis of schistosomiasis is based on the medical ''caregiver'""'s history and physical examination of the patient. It is important to know that a person has inhabited or visited areas of the world where the disease is endemic, especially if the person has had skin exposure to freshwater lakes and streams. If the patient has that history and has symptoms that are described above, a presumptive diagnosis may be made. However, because symptoms of schistosomiasis resemble those of ""'serum sickness'' and other diseases, definitive diagnostic tests are usually required. Thick fecal smears and urine concentration tests (for example, the Kato-Katz test) are used to determine if any ''Schistosoma'' eggs are present. If eggs are found, the patient is definitively diagnosed with schistosomiasis. In addition, most eggs from each species are shaped differently so it is possible to determine which ''Schistosoma'' is infecting the patient. Sometimes the definitive diagnosis is made by examination of biopsy samples of tissue, when the eggs are visualized in the infected tissue.''Blood tests and, more recently, ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') tests can help confirm the diagnosis, but positive results may only indicate past exposure. However, these tests are not usually positive until the patient has been infected for about six to eight weeks because it takes time for the eggs to develop and stimulate the human immune response. Each ''Schistosoma'' species has different egg proteins that can be detected by antibody tests. The ''PCR'' test is available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention''.''Many other tests and procedures may be necessary to establish the diagnosis, especially if no eggs are found in the feces or urine, which is often the situation in chronic schistosomiasis. ''Colonoscopy'', ''cystoscopy'', ''endoscopy'', and ''liver biopsy'' are all methods that can be used to obtain tissue biopsy material. In addition, ''ultrasound'', chest ''X-rays'', ''CT scan'', ''MRI'', and echocardiograms may be used to determine the extent of the infection in various organ systems. Most physicians will run additional blood tests (''complete blood count'' [''CBC''], ''liver function'' tests, renal function tests) to determine if organs have been damaged by the parasites.' "
What is the treatment for schistosomiasis?,"'Currently, the drug used in most people is ''praziquantel'' (''Biltricide'""); however, it only is effective against adult worms and does not affect eggs or immature worms. Treatment with this drug is simple and its dose is based on the patient's weight with two doses given on one day. However, the drug causes rapid disintegration of the worm which, in turn, allows the human immune system to attack the parasite. This immune response can cause localized reactions, which may increase the patient's symptoms. ""'Corticosteroids'' are often used to reduce the symptoms of this reaction. Unfortunately, this response limits the use of praziquantel. Praziquantel and oxaminquine or artemether are used by some clinicians early in infections, or to treat individuals infected with both ''malaria'' and schistosomes, respectively.''Ocular'' schistosomiasis should not be treated with this praziquantel. Other organs with heavy parasite infections may not function well and require supportive care until the hyperimmune response abates after drug administration. Other ''drugs'' (oxamniquine, metrifonate, artemisinins, and trioxolanes) have been used in some patients but have limited effectiveness. New ''drugs'' are in development. Infectious disease specialists, ophthalmologists, and surgeons may treat someone with a schistosomiasis infection.''Surgical care may include removal of ''tumor'' masses, ligation of esophageal varices, shunt surgeries, and granuloma removal.'  "
When should people with schistosomiasis seek medical care?,"'People associated with freshwater sources in areas where ''Schistosoma'' are endemic should seek medical care if they develop symptoms of acute schistosomiasis (see above, especially for ''abdominal pain'', blood in stools or urine, and fever). Those with diagnosed chronic schistosomiasis should seek medical care if their chronic symptoms increase (especially abdominal ''pain'', ''shortness of breath'', bloody ''diarrhea'' or ''bloody urine'', ''seizures'', or mental-status changes). Anyone with undiagnosed schistosomiasis who develops symptoms listed above should seek medical care and inform the caregivers that they have been exposed to freshwater sources in areas where the disease is endemic either as residents of the areas or as a tourist.'

What are the complications of schistosomiasis?,"'The complications that may develop with schistosomiasis usually occur in individuals harboring many parasites and eggs, especially when the eggs and parasites have migrated to other organs. In general, complications usually involve the cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems (CNS), the liver and spleen, and urinary tracts along with the liver and spleen. Some of the major complications are ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), ''seizures'', ''bacterial infections'', urinary obstruction, organ damage or destruction, and death.' "
Is it possible to prevent schistosomiasis?,"""Theoretically, the disease can be prevented by avoiding all human skin contact with freshwater sources where schistosomiasis and the snails that complete their life cycle are endemic. However, this is unlikely to occur in most developing countries. Disease control officials' reports of attempts to decrease or eliminate snails from some freshwater sources using molluscicides (snail bait) have cited a decrease in the number of people infected, but this often requires repeat treatments of contaminated environments and some efforts have been stopped because of limited success.""'Unfortunately, people who are treated and have no symptoms of the disease can easily become reinfected if exposed to the cercariae; as the human immune response to this disease often is not able to prevent reinfection. There is no commercially available ''vaccine'' against ''Schistosoma'', but research is ongoing and perhaps a vaccine may be available in a few years.''Children of school age are at risk or at high risk for the disease because they often have skin and bare ''feet'' exposed to contaminated water and soil.' "
What is the prognosis (outcome) for schistosomiasis?,"'Early antiparasitic treatment, especially with acute schistosomiasis, may allow people to recover completely without developing chronic disease. A few people get the disease but recover completely. Even patients with early chronic disease can improve with drug treatment. However, the prognosis is worse for people who have other health problems (for example, with a suppressed immune system, ''HIV'', or chronic infections such as ''malaria'') and subsequently get infected with ''Schistosoma''. People with chronic disease may improve with careful antiparasitic drug treatments and symptomatic treatment of the complications associated with schistosomiasis.' "
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) definition,"'Primary biliary ''cirrhosis'' (PBC) is a progressive disease of the ''liver'' caused by a buildup of bile within the liver (''cholestasis'') that results in damage to the small bile ducts that drain bile from the liver. Over time, this pressure build-up destroys the bile ducts leading to liver cell damage. As the disease progresses and enough liver cells die, ''cirrhosis'' and liver failure occur.''Bile is manufactured in the liver and then transported through the bile ducts to the gallbladder and intestine where it helps digest ''fats'' and fat soluble ''vitamins'' (A,D,E,K). When bile cannot be drained from the liver, it causes inflammation that leads to cell death. ''Scar tissue'' gradually replaces the areas of damaged liver and then the body cannot perform necessary functions.'  "
What are the causes of primary biliary cirrhosis?,"""The cause of PBC is unknown. It is most likely an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks its own cells. In this disease, the bile ducts are under attack and are destroyed."" "
What are the risk factors for primary biliary cirrhosis?," There may be a 
	genetic component to the development of PBC since a 
	person 
with the disease is likely to have a family member also afflicted. Women are nine times more likely than men to develop PBC. It most often 
develops in the middle age between the ages of 40 to 60. The disease is seen more often in white, northern Europeans, compared 
to African-Americans."
What are the signs and symptoms for primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'Up to a quarter of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are asymptomatic, meaning they do not have symptoms at the time of diagnosis and the disease is found incidentally because of abnormal ''liver blood tests''.''The most common initial symptoms are ''fatigue'' or a sense of being abnormally tired and, skin that itches. Because of the intense ''itching'' and scratching, the skin may become darkened and discolored in some areas. The person may also complain of ''dry mouth'' and eyes.''Because there may be liver inflammation, some people may experience right upper quadrant ''abdominal pain'', where the liver is located.''Should the liver damage progress, the symptoms of cirrhosis may develop. These include muscle wasting, ''ascites'' (swelling of the abdomen due to fluid accumulation), ''leg swelling'', ''jaundice'' (yellow coloration of the skin), and ''confusion''.'  "
How is the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis made?,"'The diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis is considered when the doctor suspects that there might be liver inflammation based upon the history and physical examination. Initially there may be few symptoms like ''itching'' or ''fatigue'' to help guide further testing''The diagnosis may be made incidentally when abnormal liver functions be found on routine blood tests drawn for another reason. ''Liver function'' tests include AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), ''alkaline phosphatase'' and ''bilirubin''. Blood levels tend to become elevated in ''liver disease'' and they may rise in specific patterns depending upon the underlying cause of inflammation.''Once the diagnosis is suspected, a blood test to check for antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) is usually done. This is positive in over 90% of patients with PBC.''Other blood tests may be considered including a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') and ''cholesterol levels''.''Imaging of the abdomen by ''ultrasound'', ''CT scan'' or ''MRI'' is often considered to look for structural changes in the liver and to search for tumors.''A ''liver biopsy'', where a thin needle is inserted through the skin to take a piece of liver tissue, may help confirm the diagnosis. This tissue is examined under a microscope by a pathologist to look for changes consistent with PBC. It is also useful to help stage the disease, deciding its severity at the time of diagnosis.'  "
What is the treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'The only ""cure"" for primary biliary cirrhosis is ''liver transplant'', but it is only considered as a treatment option if other less aggressive treatments have failed and the patient develops liver failure.''Ursodiol'' (Actigal) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first line treatment for PBC. It helps the liver transport bile into the gallbladder and intestine, in an attempt to prevent ''cholestasis''.''Depending upon the severity of the disease, immune suppression medications may be prescribed, including ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), ''cyclosporine'' and ''prednisone''.''Itching may be intense and difficult to control. ''Antihistamines'' like ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') may be helpful but other ''drugs'' may be considered including ''cholestyramine'' (''Questran'', ''Questran Light''), which helps bind bile and decrease the itching associated with elevated bilirubin levels in the blood.''Complications of PBC will need to be cared for. These include cirrhosis, ''portal hypertension'', gastrointestinal bleeding, ''osteoporosis'', and vitamin deficiencies.' "
What are the complications of primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'The complications of primary biliary cirrhosis develop as the ability of the liver to function decreases. Cirrhosis describes liver scarring and failure. The liver is responsible for helping to digest food, producing proteins, blood clotting factors, and enzymes that help digest food. Some complications include the following:''Ascites: ''Fluid collection within the abdomen that occurs because the liver cannot produce enough albumin, a protein that helps keep fluid within the blood vessels. Ascites fluid is prone to infection and a condition called spontaneous bacterial ''peritonitis'' (peritoneum=sac that contains the abdominal organs + itis=inflammation)''Edema'': Swelling of the legs may occur, again because of decreased albumin levels in the body''Easy bruising'' or bleeding: ''The liver is responsible for producing blood clotting factors. Without an adequate supply, there is an increased risk of bleeding. Patients may have a ''low platelet count'' because of an ''enlarged spleen'' causing ''easy bruising''.''Hepatic encephalopathy'': The liver also helps remove waste products from the bloodstream. Ammonia is the chemical waste product of protein metabolism and the body requires a healthy liver to metabolize it. If ammonia levels rise, confusion and lethargy (''encephalopathy'') may occur.''P''ortal ''hypertension'':'' An increase in pressure within the liver can cause blood flow issues leading to portal ''hypertension''. This may backup blood flow from other organs, causing ''splenomegaly'', an enlarged spleen, and varices, swollen veins, especially in the ''esophagus'' and stomach that can predispose to bleeding.''Osteoporosis'':'' PBC is also complicated by ''osteoporosis'', difficulty in absorbing nutrients, such as fat-soluble ''vitamin D'' and calcium, from the intestine.''Cancer'':''\xa0Some studies show patients with PBC are at an increased risk for hepatocellular ''carcinoma''.'  "
Can primary biliary cirrhosis be prevented?,"'Since the cause of the disease is not known, it is not possible to prevent PBC. However, medications may be able to slow the progression of the disease and control the symptoms.''Should a person develop PBC, all attempts should be made to prevent further potential damage. This may include limiting ''alcohol'' intake, avoiding the use of medications that contain ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'', Panadol), and ''cholesterol'' lowering agents.' "
What is the prognosis for someone with primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'PBC is a progressive disease that can be controlled but not cured. The prognosis depends upon a variety of factors including whether the patient has symptoms (especially ''fatigue''), liver function test abnormalities, and whether the patient has undergone treatment with medication or has required liver transplantation.''Advances in treatment have extended the life expectancy in the past many years. The average survival from diagnosis for a patient with PBC who is asymptomatic is 16 years, while that of patients with symptoms is 7 1/2 years.' "
What is duodenal biliary drainage?,'Duodenal biliary drainage is a little-used procedure that sometimes can be helpful in diagnosing ''gallstones''. This rare procedure has been out of common use since the late 1940s.' 
How is duodenal biliary drainage done?,"'For duodenal biliary drainage, a thin ''plastic'"" or rubber tube with several holes at its tip is passed through a patient's anesthetized nostril, down the back of the throat, through the ""'esophagus'' and stomach, and into the duodenum where the bile and pancreatic ducts enter the small intestine. This is accomplished with the help of fluoroscopy, a type of X-ray. Once the tube is in place, a synthetic hormone related to cholecystokinin is injected intravenously. The hormone causes the gallbladder to contract and squeeze out its concentrated bile into the duodenum. The bile then is sucked up through the tube and examined for the presence of ''cholesterol'' and pigment particles under a microscope.''A modification of duodenal biliary drainage involves collection of bile through an endoscope at the time of an upper gastrointestinal ''endoscopy'' - either by  ''EGD'' (''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'') or by ''ERCP'' (''endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography'').' "
Why might duodenal biliary drainage be done?,"'Gallstones'' begin as microscopic particles of cholesterol or pigment that grow in size. Once the particles grow large enough to become ''gallstones'', they can obstruct the bile ducts and cause problems. It is clear that some people who develop the symptoms and complications of gallstones -- ''biliary colic'', ''cholecystitis'', or ''pancreatitis'' - have only these microscopic particles in their gallbladders, particles too small to obstruct the bile ducts.''There are two possible explanations for how obstruction might be occurring in this situation. The first is that a small gallstone obstructed the bile ducts but finally passed through the bile ducts into the intestine. The second is that the particles passing through the bile ducts ""irritate"" the ducts, causing spasm of the muscle within the walls of the ducts (which obstructs the duct) or causing inflammation of the duct so that the wall of the duct  swells (which also obstructs the duct).' "
What are the risks of duodenal biliary drainage?,"'The risks to the patient of duodenal biliary drainage are almost nonexistent.  There have been no reports of reactions to the synthetic hormone.  Nevertheless, the presence of the tube in the throat is uncomfortable for the 30-60 minutes that are necessary to complete the test.' "
When is duodenal biliary drainage useful?,"""Once again, it's been decades since duodenal biliary drainage was the medical standard. Still, it can useful in diagnosing problems related to gallstones when other tests such as ""'ultrasonography'"" have not demonstrated gallstones, but suspicion is high that gallstones are the cause of the patient's problem. Cholesterol or pigment particles without gallstones may be present in individuals who have no medical problems or problems that are not due to gallstones. It is unclear whether these individuals ultimately are more likely to develop gallstones. Because such individuals exist, it also is important not to assume that particles mean that gallstones are the cause of a medical problem. The medical problem and its symptoms should be typical of the types of problems caused by gallstones."" "
What should I know about bilirubin and blood test?," Bilirubin is a reddish yellow pigment made during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. Normal levels vary slightly from lab to lab; they range from about 0.2 – 1.2 mg/dL. Signs and symptoms of high bilirubin levels in adults vary with the underlying cause; however, symptoms usually include jaundice and itching. High bilirubin levels in adults usually means that there may be an underlying problem involving the red blood cells, liver, or gallbladder; however, other problems also may be found. Symptoms of high bilirubin levels in newborns are skin and/or scleral jaundice. High bilirubin levels in a newborn means that the neonate is not processing red cell breakdown effectively or an underlying cause is responsible. The treatment for elevated bilirubin in adults depends on the underlying problems. Experts suggest avoiding alcohol. The bilirubin test can chemically determine the total and if needed, the conjugated and unconjugated levels of bilirubin in the blood. The bilirubin test is performed on a small sample of blood from the patient. You prepare for a bilirubin test by refraining from eating for a few hours and avoiding certain compounds that influence bilirubin levels before the test. Risks associated with a bilirubin test are minor. The prognosis for an adult with elevated bilirubin levels is related to the underlying cause, and may range from good to poor. The prognosis for a newborn with elevated bilirubin levels usually is good in the majority of newborns if they rapidly reduce their bilirubin levels. High bilirubin levels can be prevented in neonates by early treatment, and presented in adults by treating the underlying causes and avoiding alcohol or other substances that may damage the liver."
What is bilirubin?,"'Bilirubin is a bile pigment that is orange-yellow in color. It is formed during the normal breakdown of red blood cells (''hemoglobin''), and is excreted in the bile. Bilirubin can be classified as indirect (free or unconjugated) while it is circulating and is considered as direct after conjugation in the liver with glucuronic acid.' "
What are other names for bilirubin?,"'As stated previously, bilirubin usually exists in two forms in the body. Unfortunately, the two forms have several different names that appear frequently in the literature. Additionally, the medical literature frequently uses the single term ""bilirubin"" to describe the two forms. Frequently, the medical literature does not distinguish between the two forms, and this can be confusing to the reader. In an attempt to clarify the situation, below are listed the two forms and their names and synonyms:''Bilirubin'' – a term that means any form of a yellowish pigment made in the liver when red blood cells are broken down and normally excreted with the bile; also termed ""total bilirubin.""' Bilirubin can be classified as indirect

What is binge eating disorder?,"'Binge eating disorder is a ''mental health'' condition that is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating without efforts on the part of affected individuals to compensate by undoing the binge episodes. Examples of such undoing behaviors include purging food by inducing ''vomiting'', excessively exercising, and/or inappropriately using medications like laxatives or ''diet'' pills. This illness was often previously described by mental health professionals under the diagnosis of eating disorder, not otherwise specified rather than as its own separate entity, but the most recent revision of the widely accepted diagnostic manual used by mental health professionals has included binge eating disorder as a separate diagnosis.''Statistics about binge eating disorder indicate that this condition is the most common of all eating disorders, affecting about 3.5% of women and 2% of men over the course of a lifetime. As with other eating disorders like ''anorexia nervosa'' or ''bulimia nervosa'', there tends to be no significant difference in the age at which males and females develop binge eating disorder. Males with eating disorders like binge eating disorder tend to have a much higher body mass index (''BMI'') and are more likely to also suffer from ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') compared to males of similar age without the disorder. Females with eating disorders like binge eating disorders are at increased risk for also having ''celiac disease'' and ''diabetes''.''Binge eating disorder is apparently quite common in individuals who seek treatment for ''obesity'' in weight-loss programs that are affiliated with a hospital. About one-third of individuals with this condition are males. Most develop the disorder during adolescence or early adulthood, primarily in early adulthood. There seems to be no difference in the incidence of binge eating disorder among ethnic groups.''Binge eating disorder can have a significant impact on the health of those who suffer from it. Specifically, about 65% of people with binge eating disorder are obese (20% overweight or more), with even more being generally overweight. Individuals who develop binge eating disorder are at higher risk of also having another psychiatric illness, like ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and ''substance abuse''. Women with this illness tend to suffer from a negative ''body image'', whereas men are more likely develop a substance-use disorder. Other important facts about binge eating disorder include its tendency to last for more than 14 years, with only 7% resolving after the first year of having the illness. When compared to other eating disorders like ''bulimia'' nervosa or ''anorexia'' nervosa, which each tend to last less than six years, binge eating disorder has more of a chronic course.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for binge eating disorder?,"'As with most other mental disorders, there is no one specific cause for binge eating disorder. Rather it is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental contributing factors. People who are prone to obesity, either genetically or otherwise, tend to be more at risk for engaging in binge eating episodes and developing binge eating disorder compared to those who are not obese. There is increasing understanding that there can be a genetic component to binge eating disorder, and as with other eating disorders, there are often found to be abnormal levels of brain serotonin and often subtle changes in brain functioning.''Social risk factors for binge eating disorders include a history of being bullied or physically or sexually abused. For Caucasian women as opposed to African-American women, discrimination tends to be a risk factor for this disorder, as well. Other risk factors for binge eating disorder include more exposure to negative comments about shape, weight, and eating. People who participate in competitive sports at an elite level are at higher risk for developing eating disorders in general.''Psychologically, binge eating disorder is thought of by many professionals to be a form of food ''addiction'' that is characterized by compulsive overeating. This condition tends to be associated with increased perfectionism, obsessive-compulsiveness, ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and substance-use disorders. ''Phobias'' and ''panic disorder'' are the most common ''anxiety'' problems experienced by people with binge eating disorder. Eating binges tend to be triggered by a number of things, like dietary restrictions, hunger, and negative ''moods''.' "
What are binge eating disorder symptoms and signs?,"'Binge eating disorder symptoms and signs include recurring episodes of binge eating (consuming excessively large amounts of food) without purging (self-induced ''vomiting''), excessive exercising, the inappropriate use of medications, or any other unhealthy behaviors that are often used by bulimic individuals to attempt to compensate for the binge episodes. People with this mental illness tend to engage in ''stress'' or other ''emotional eating'', take longer to feel full, and are more likely to feel like they are starving when they are not. The binge episodes are associated with at least three of the following characteristics:''Also, the individual with binge eating disorder experiences marked distress regarding their binge eating.'  Eating faster than normal Eating large amounts of food when not physically hungry Eating until uncomfortably full Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed about their eating behaviors Feeling disgusted with oneself, sad, or guilty after overeating"
How do health care professionals diagnose binge eating disorder?,"""As is true with virtually any mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has binge eating disorder. Therefore, health care professionals assess this disorder by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information. The health care professional will also either conduct a physical examination or ask that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical assessment will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the person has a medical condition that has what appear to be mental health symptoms.""'In asking questions about psychological symptoms, mental health professionals are often exploring if the individual suffers from symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder or another eating disorder, like ''anorexia'' nervosa and ''bulimia'' nervosa, as described in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-V''). To qualify for the diagnosis of binge eating disorder, the person must engage in bingeing at least once per week for three months. The ''DSM-IV-TR'' and earlier editions of the diagnostic handbook did not include binge eating disorder as a diagnosis. Rather, it was captured under the diagnosis of Eating Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (''ED'', NOS).''Practitioners will also explore whether symptoms of ''depression'' and/or ''mania'', ''anxiety'', substance abuse, ''hallucinations'' or ''delusions'', as well as some behavioral disorders are occurring. People with binge eating disorder may seem to engage in compulsive eating, having symptoms in common with ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD''). Health care professionals may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test as a screening tool for binge eating disorder and other eating disorders. Since some of the ''symptoms of binge eating disorder'"" can also occur with other conditions, the mental health screening is designed to determine if the individual suffers from any emotional problem. In order to assess the person's current emotional state, health care professionals conduct a mental-status examination, as well."" "
What is the treatment for binge eating disorder?,"'As with obese individuals without binge eating disorder, people with this illness tend to ''lose weight'' from adopting a low-calorie diet and engaging in regular ''exercise'', and some will experience repeated ''weight gain'' in the long term. While considered adjunctive rather than primary forms of treatment, home remedies like meditation may help reduce the frequency and severity of binge eating disorder symptoms, thereby decreasing the impact of those symptoms on the self-rating scale.''Medications that have been found to be effective in reducing the number and amount of binge episodes in binge eating disorder include lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), which is used to treat ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat binge eating disorder, topiramate (Topamax), which is used to treat ''seizures'', as well as serotonergic (SSRI) medications that treat anxiety (antianxiety medications) or ''depression'' (''antidepressants''), like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix), and vilazodone (Viibryd). Sibutramine (Meridia) is an appetite suppressant that has been found to help decrease binge eating and enhance ''weight loss''. SSRIs tend to be well tolerated and have a low incidence of side effects like stomach upset, ''sleep problems'', and sexual dysfunction. Topiramate was first used to treat ''seizures'"" and is sometimes stopped by patients because of daytime sleepiness, difficulty thinking, and poor coordination. Sibutramine's most common side effects include ""'headache'', ''constipation'', stomach upset, ''insomnia'', and painful menstrual periods. Less common, more serious side effects of sibutramine include ''palpitations'', ''chest pain'', ''shortness of breath'', ''nausea'', and vomiting.''While psychotherapy alone does not tend to result in long-term ''weight loss'' in individuals with binge eating disorder, it can be a key part of the rehabilitation (""rehab"") and recovery from the emotional problems that are often associated with this disorder. Two forms of psychotherapy that have been found to be effective in that regard include ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT'') and ''interpersonal therapy'' (''ITP''). In cognitive behavioral therapy, the mental health practitioner works to help the person with binge eating disorder identify, challenge, and decrease negative thinking and otherwise dysfunctional belief systems that precipitate unwanted behaviors. Dialectical ''behavior therapy'"", which is a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on emotional regulation, has also been found to be an effective means of increasing the length of time between binge episodes (for example, binge abstinence) in preliminary studies. The goal of interpersonal therapy tends to be identifying and managing problems the sufferer of binge eating disorder may have in his or her relationships with others. Participation in one of a number of self-help support groups, like Overeaters Anonymous or Eating Disorders Anonymous, can also be an important part of managing this condition by enhancing the sufferer's self-control in regard to their food intake.""'Understanding and addressing how to treat other mental health problems that might co-occur (comorbidity) with binge eating disorder are important aspects of overcoming this illness. For example, as about 57% of men and 28% of women with binge eating disorder also have a substance-use disorder, treating both problems will enhance the successful recovery from each illness.' "
What are complications and the prognosis of binge eating disorder?,"'People with binge eating disorder seem to be at higher risk of developing substance abuse or another psychiatric illness, ''high blood pressure'' and other forms of ''heart disease'', type II ''diabetes'', ''gallbladder disease'', some forms of ''cancer'', and abnormal ''cholesterol'' levels (for example, high levels of total cholesterol and of so-called bad cholesterol types, plus low levels of good cholesterol) compared to similar-weight individuals without this eating disorder. The obesity that often results from binge eating disorder also puts sufferers at risk for problems like menstrual problems and joint and ''muscle pain''. ''Pregnant'' women are at risk for developing problems with the ''pregnancy'' like hyperemesis, having ''babies'' who have low birth weight, excessively small skulls (''microcephaly''), and are small for gestational age. Given these potentially life-threatening complications of binge eating disorders, the decreased likelihood that ethnic minorities in the United States seek and are referred for specific treatment is an important obstacle to overcome.''After about six years, a little more than half of individuals with binge eating disorder who have engaged in intensive treatment have been found to have some significant decrease in symptoms, while about one-third have only intermediate outcome, about 6% have poor outcome, and 1% may die during that period of time. Having one eating disorder increases the risk that the sufferer will develop another one. Eating disorders in general and binging behavior specifically can increase the likelihood that a person engages in self-injurious behaviors like cutting or has ''suicidal'' thoughts or actions. However, it is important to note that the prognosis of binge eating disorder seems to be quite changeable over time.' "
Is it possible to prevent binge eating disorder?,"""Teaching teens and adults about resisting society's pressure toward thinness, understanding what determines body weight, the negative effects of eating disorders, and encouraging good self-esteem, ""'stress'' management, healthy weight control, and acceptance of their body have been found to be helpful in the ''prevention'' of eating disorders. Educating the adults in the lives of youth about how to positively influence children regarding healthy eating habits, ''exercise'' and body image have also been determined to be helpful components in preventing binge eating disorder. In addition to parents, key adults in this approach can include teachers and other school staff, coaches, pediatricians, and other primary care doctors.' "

What is compulsive overeating? What is binge eating disorder?,"'While overeating is defined as eating more calories than are necessary to maintain health and can become hard to control the urge to do so (compulsive), binge eating disorder (BED) is a ''mental health'' condition that involves recurring episodes of compulsively (uncontrollably) eating far more than normal, often after feeling full or otherwise when not hungry. It leads to physical and emotional discomfort of some kind, like guilt, shame, embarrassment, remorse, and self-disgust. While both binge eating disorder and otherwise compulsive overeating may involve eating in reaction to certain feelings (''emotional eating''), not everyone who overeats suffers from binge eating or any other eating disorder. However, overeating is a symptom for everyone who has binge eating disorder. BED is understood to be an impulse control disorder and involves compulsive behaviors. It affects about 5% of adults in the United States over their lifetime, more than the number of people who have ''anorexia'' nervosa and ''bulimia'' combined.' "
What are causes and risk factors for compulsive overeating and binge eating disorder?,"'Like most mental disorders, binge eating disorder is not directly passed down genetically. Rather, it is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. People with BED are more likely to have family members with this and mood disorders (like ''depression'' or ''anxiety'') and impulse control disorders (like gambling or a ''drug use'' disorder) and can have differences in brain and brain chemical functioning compared to people who overeat to a lesser degree than in BED or otherwise do not have this illness. As with virtually any behavior that does not rise to the level of illness, overeating tends to occur more often in families where other household members engage in similar behaviors.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of compulsive overeating and of binge eating disorder?,"'In contrast to binge eating disorder, compulsive overeating involves consuming more calories than are necessary to maintain health but does not rise to the level of severity of binge eating. Someone may overeat from just once in a lifetime to multiple times per day. To qualify for the diagnosis of binge eating disorder, a person must experience the following:''Recurrent episodes of binge eating, in that the amount of food that is eaten in a specific period of time is clearly more than what most people would eat; as well as having poor control over their ability to stop eating or otherwise regulate what they eat. Episodes of bingeing include a number of the following symptoms:''The binge episodes must occur at least once per week for most weeks over the course of at least three months, and the person who has binge eating disorder feels upset that they engage in bingeing.'  Eating much faster than is normal (rapid eating) Consuming food to the point of becoming physically uncomfortable Eating large amounts of food even when not feeling hungry Eating when alone (secret eating) due to feeling embarrassed by how much food is consumed Feeling disgusted, sad, or very guilty following a binge episode"
How do health care professionals diagnose compulsive overeating and binge eating disorder?,"""Since there is no one test that determines that someone has binge eating disorder rather than having simple overeating, health care professionals diagnose BED by gathering medical, family, and mental health information. The doctor will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor do so, including lab tests to assess the person's general health and whether he or she has mental health symptoms that are due to a physical condition."" "
What are medications and other treatments for compulsive overeating and binge eating disorder?,"'People with binge eating disorder or who otherwise engage in compulsive overeating can expect their mental health professionals to consider several interventions, including medications, ''psychotherapy'', and lifestyle (for example, nutritional, ''exercise'', ''stress management'') advice. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, which involves combating the ways of thinking that promote BED, has been found to decrease the bingeing episodes but not as effective in resulting in ''weight loss''.''Lisdexamfetamine'' (''Vyvanse''), a stimulant medication, is the only medication that is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat binge eating disorder. It has been found to be effective for decreasing the frequency of bingeing episodes. While not FDA-approved specifically for the treatment of BED, medications that are described as serotonergic treatments can alleviate some of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms that often co-occur with the illness. Examples of those medications include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), as well as anti-''seizure'' medications like ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'') or ''divalproex'' (''Depakote'').' "
What are complications and the prognosis of compulsive overeating and binge eating disorder?,"'Complications of compulsive overeating not rising to the level of an eating disorder include increased weight and all the health problems that being ''overweight'' can bring over time, like ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', joint problems, and ''diabetes'', just to name a few. Due to the high amounts of food being consumed over short periods of time in binge eating disorder, these individuals may also be more prone to suffering from digestive problems compared to those who overeat but do not qualify for an eating disorder diagnosis.''While most people who purposely lose weight tend to gain it back over time, the prognosis for binge eating disorder tends to be fairly favorable over time, with up to 80% of people with the diagnosis recovering. Binge eating disorder sufferers who have supportive relationships tend to have better outcomes than those who do not.' "
Is it possible to prevent compulsive overeating and binge eating disorder?,"'Given the similarities that binge eating disorder has with substance addictions, approaches to prevention of drug ''addiction'' may be useful in preventing binge eating disorder or compulsive overeating that does not rise to the level of an eating disorder. Types of prevention programs include those that try to bolster protective factors while minimizing risk factors.' "

Introduction to Bioelectric Therapy,"'Bioelectric therapy is a safe, drug-free treatment option for people in ''pain''. It is used to treat some ''chronic pain'' and acute ''pain'' conditions. It relieves pain by blocking pain messages to the brain. When you are injured, pain receptors send a message to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). The message is registered as pain by certain cells in the body. Using bioelectric currents, bioelectric therapy relieves pain by interrupting pain signals before they reach the brain. Bioelectric therapy also prompts the body to produce endorphins which help to relieve pain.' "
What Conditions Are Treated With Bioelectric Therapy?,"'Bioelectric therapy can be used to treat chronic and acute pain conditions including:'""Bioelectric therapy isn't right for everyone. It is not recommended for people who:"" Complex regional pain syndrome, also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy or RSD. Back pain. Muscle pain. Headaches and migraines. Disorders of blood flow in the upper and lower limbs. Arthritis. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome (which affects the jaw). Disorders of the nervous system, such as diabetic neuropathy. Pain and ulcers of the skin resulting from poor circulation or scleroderma (a chronic condition that can cause thickening or hardening of the skin). Have a pacemaker. Are pregnant. Have thrombosis (blood clots in the arms or legs). Have a bacterial infection."
How Effective Is Bioelectric Therapy?,"'Bioelectric therapy is effective in providing temporary pain control, but it should only be a part of a total ''pain management'' program. When used along with conventional pain-relieving medications, bioelectric treatment may reduce the dose of some pain medications by up to 50%.' "
What Happens During Bioelectric Therapy?,"'During bioelectric therapy, several small, flat rubber adhesive discs (called electrodes) are applied to your skin at prescribed areas to be treated. Sometimes rubber suction cups (called vaso pneumatic devices) may be applied to your skin. The electrodes are hooked up to a computer that programs the precise treatment dosage required. High frequency alternating electrical currents are then applied to the electrodes. The currents move through the skin quickly with little discomfort. During treatment, your response to the electrical stimulation is measured.''When electricity is applied, a mild vibrating, tingling sensation is common. This sensation should not be uncomfortable; you should feel a relaxing, soothing pain relief. As the currents are applied, you will provide verbal feedback to the clinician. If the sensation becomes too strong, please tell the clinician right away so the treatment can be adjusted. You should be comfortable and enjoy the treatment, which lasts about 20 minutes.' "
What Are the Side Effects of Bioelectric Therapy?,"'In rare cases, skin irritation and redness can occur under the electrodes during bioelectric therapy.' "
How Often Should I Get Bioelectric Therapy?,"""The number of bioelectric therapy sessions required depends on each person's condition and response to treatment. One bioelectric therapy session does not usually result in pain relief. Therapy usually begins with about five sessions in one week, followed by three treatments per week. A normal course of treatment includes 16 to 20 treatments."" "
How Do I Prepare for Bioelectric Therapy?,"'If you are taking ''insulin'' or blood-thinning medications, your doctor may give you specific instructions to follow before getting bioelectric therapy.''You may be asked to fast before the procedure, and you may need to make arrangements for someone to drive you home after treatment.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is biological therapy?,"""Biological or biologic therapy is treatment designed to stimulate or restore the ability of the body's immune (natural internal defense) system to fight infection and disease. Biological therapy is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy and is commonly used to treat different kinds of ""'cancers'', as well as other conditions.' "
How does biological therapy work?,"""Biological therapy is a form of treatment that uses portions of the body's natural immune system to treat a disease. Biological therapy is also used to protect the body from some of the side effects of certain treatments.""'Biological therapy often involves the use of substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces these substances in small amounts in response to infection and disease. Using modern laboratory techniques, scientists can produce BRMs in large amounts for use in the treatment of ''cancer'' and other diseases, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease.""'Biological therapy may also target specific molecules on ''cancer'' cells to destroy the cells, or it may target proteins that facilitate the growth of ''cancer'' cells.''Depending on the agent, biological therapies can be given by mouth, intravenously, or as an injection.'

What are examples of biological therapies?,"'Monoclonal antibodies, ''interferon'', interleukin-2 (IL-2), and several types of colony-stimulating factors (CSF, GM- CSF, G-CSF) are forms of biological therapy. For example, interleukin-2 and interferon are two examples of BRMs being tested for the treatment of advanced ''malignant melanoma''.''Monoclonal antibodies are a common type of biological therapy for many different cancers and other conditions. These are laboratory-produced antibodies that are designed to attack specific proteins expressed by abnormal cells. Examples of monoclonal antibody ''drugs'' include ''rituximab'"", which is used to treat non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'', alemtuzumab (''Campath'') to treat ''chronic lymphocytic leukemia'' (CLL), and ipilimumab (Yervoy) for metastatic ''melanoma''.''Other kinds of monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancers target proteins that are responsible for cell growth. Examples of these drugs include bevacizumab (''Avastin''), which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix) to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and ''trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') and pertuzumab (Perjeta) to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER-2).''Modes of biologic therapy that involve blocking the action of specific proteins of inflammation, called ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF), are being used for the treatment of a number of diseases, including ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease. ""'Etanercept'' (''Enbrel'') and ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') are examples of commercially available injectable TNF-blocking treatments for patients with severe ''rheumatoid arthritis''.''Biological therapy is a very active and exciting area of cancer research.'

What type of specialists administer biological therapy?,"'Biological therapies are prescribed by specialists who treat cancers (oncologists or hematologist-oncologists), as well as other specialists, including ''rheumatologists'' and gastroenterologists.' "
What are the side effects of biological therapy?,"'The side effects of biological therapy depend on the type of treatment. Side effects include ''flu-like symptoms'' such as ''chills'', ''fever'', muscle aches, ''weakness'', ''loss of appetite'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. Some patients develop a ''rash'', and some bleed or bruise easily. In addition, interleukin therapy can cause swelling.''Depending on how severe these problems are, hospitalization during treatment may be required for some patients. Side effects are usually short-term and gradually subside after treatment ends.''The long-term side effects of the various currently available biological therapies will be better defined with future research from which will also surely emerge new and valuable forms of these treatments.'

Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
What is colposcopy?,"'Colposcopy is a gynecological procedure that illuminates and magnifies the vulva, vaginal walls, and uterine cervix in order to detect and examine abnormalities of these structures. The cervix is the base of the womb (uterus) and leads out to the birth canal (vagina). During colposcopy, special tests [acetic acid wash, use of color filters, and sampling (biopsy) of tissues] can be done. Colposcopy is not to be confused with culdoscopy, which is the insertion of an instrument through the wall of the vagina in order to view the pelvic area behind the vagina. '  "
Why is colposcopy done?,"'Colposcopy is usually done in one of two circumstances: to examine the cervix either when the result of a Pap smear is abnormal, or when the cervix looks abnormal during the collection of a Pap smear. Even if a Pap smear result is normal, colposcopy is sometimes necessary when the cervix appears visibly abnormal to the clinician performing the Pap smear. The purpose of the colposcopy is to determine what is causing the abnormal looking cervix or the abnormal Pap smear so that appropriate treatment can be given.' "
How is colposcopy done?,"'A colposcope is a microscope that resembles a pair of binoculars. The instrument has a range of magnification lenses. It also has color filters that allow the physician to detect tiny abnormal blood vessels on the cervix. The colposcope is used to examine the vaginal walls and cervix through the vaginal opening.''Colposcopy is a safe procedure with no complications other than vaginal ''spotting'' of blood.''The examiner wants to get a good look at the squamocolumnar junction, which is the area of the cervix that gives rise to most cases of ''cervical cancer''. The term squamocolumnar junction refers to the border between the two different types of cells (squamous cells that line the outer surface of the cervix and columnar cells that normally form the lining of the endocervical canal). The endocervical canal connects the cervix with the main part of the uterus. Most cases of cervical cancer originate from the squamous cells and, therefore, are referred to as squamous cell cervical cancer.''During colposcopy, the entire squamocolumnar junction is more likely to be seen in young women. The reason for this is that after ''menopause'', the squamocolumnar junction tends to migrate inside the endocervical canal. Colposcopy, therefore, is occasionally not adequate in women after ''menopause''. Therefore, if the whole squamocolumnar junction area of the cervix is not visible on colposcopy, another type of procedure may need to be performed that allows the entire squamocolumnar junction to be examined. (See cold knife cone biopsy below.)' The first step of the procedure is examining the vulva and vagina for signs of genital warts or other growths. (Genital warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is a sexually transmitted virus that can cause cervical cancer.) A Pap smear is then taken. The cervix is inspected and the special tests are done (see below)."
What special tests are done during colposcopy?,"'Three special tests are done during colposcopy: acetic acid wash, use of color filters, and sampling (biopsy) of the cervix tissues.' "
Acetic acid wash for colposcopy ,"'After the cervix is studied with the colposcope, the cervix is washed with a chemical called acetic acid, which is diluted 3% to 5%. The acetic acid (vinegar) washes away ''mucus'' and allows abnormal areas to be seen more easily with the colposcope. Moreover, the acetic acid stains the abnormal areas white. The areas that stain white after the acetic acid wash are called ""acetowhite lesions."" Sometimes, however, normal areas can also stain white, but these areas have vague or faint borders. In contrast, significant abnormalities, such as genital ''warts'', pre-''cancers'' (dysplasia), and cancers, generally produce acetowhite areas with distinct and clear boundaries.''Sometimes staining with a dilute ''iodine'"" solution (known as Lugol's solution or Schiller's solution) is also performed to further examine for abnormalities. Normal cells will generally take up the iodine stain (and turn brown) in a uniform manner, whereas severe precancers and cancerous areas will not."" "
Use of color filters for colposcopy,"'Another aspect of colposcopy involves the use of color filters. The filters help the physician examine tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the area of the squamocolumnar junction. Blue or green filtered light can cause abnormal capillaries to become more obvious, usually inside an acetowhite area.''Normal capillaries are slender and spaced out evenly. In contrast, abnormal capillaries can appear as red spots (thickened capillaries seen on end) or can produce a pattern resembling hexagonal floor tiles. The worse the cervical disease, the thicker and more widely spaced out are the capillaries. The abnormal capillary pattern ranges from mild, as with pre-cancer (dysplasia), to severe, as with established cancer. Thus, when cancer eventually develops, capillaries take on odd shapes, like punctuation marks.' "
Biopsy of the cervix,"'Finally, colposcopy allows tissue sampling (biopsy) that is targeted to the abnormal areas. In fact, the biopsy of abnormal areas is a critical part of colposcopy because treatment will depend on how severe the abnormality is on the biopsy sample. After colposcopy and biopsies, a chemical is applied to the biopsy area to prevent bleeding (spotting). As part of the biopsy procedure, endocervical curettage (sampling of the tissues within the endocervical canal, or the opening of the cervix to the uterine ''cavity'') is often performed.' "
"Based on the colposcopy results, what is the approach to treating cervical abnormalities?","""If the biopsy results show pre-cancer (dysplasia) or cancer, treatment might be recommended. The dysplasia may be mild, moderate, or severe. Almost all women with dysplasia can have their treatment procedures performed in the doctor's office. The physician chooses between two general types of treatment. The first type is destruction (ablation) of the abnormal area, and the second type is removal (resection). Both types of treatment cure 90% of patients with dysplasia, meaning that 10% of women will have a recurrence of their abnormality after treatment.""'The destruction (ablation) procedures are carbon dioxide laser photoablation and cryocautery. The removal (resection) procedures are loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), cold knife conization, and hysterectomy. Only certain, carefully chosen cases of cervical cancer are treated with LEEP or cold knife conization. Most cases of cervical cancer and occasional cases of severe dysplasia are treated by hysterectomy. Treatment for dysplasia or cancer is not usually done at the time of the initial colposcopy, since the treatment depends on the analysis of the biopsies done during colposcopy.' "
Carbon dioxide laser photoablation,"'This procedure, which is also known as CO2 laser, uses an invisible beam of infrared light. The laser actually vaporizes the abnormal area. ''Lidocaine'', a local anesthetic, is given to numb the area prior to the laser treatment. A chemical is applied afterwards to prevent delayed bleeding. A substantial amount of clear ''vaginal discharge'' and spotting of blood can occur for a few weeks after the procedure. To improve healing, sexual intercourse and tampon use should be delayed for several weeks.''The complication rate of this procedure is very low, about 1%. The most common complications are narrowing (stenosis) of the cervical opening and delayed bleeding. Disadvantages of this treatment include that this procedure does not allow sampling of the abnormal area and is not satisfactory for treating cervical cancer. It is useful, however, for milder dysplasia. It is generally not considered safe for use during ''pregnancy''.' "
Cryocautery,"'Cryocautery is a relatively simple procedure that uses nitrous oxide to freeze the abnormal area. This technique, however, is not optimal for large areas or areas where abnormalities are already advanced or severe. After the procedure, patients can experience a significant watery vaginal discharge for several weeks. To improve healing, sexual intercourse is best avoided for several weeks.''Significant complications of this procedure are rare and occur in about 1% of patients. They include narrowing (stenosis) of the cervix and delayed bleeding. Cryocautery does not allow sampling of the abnormal area and is generally felt to be inappropriate for women with advanced cervical disease. Thus, this procedure is not satisfactory for treating cervical cancer, but is useful for milder dysplasia.' "
Loop electrosurgical excision procedure,"'Loop electrosurgical excision procedure, also known as LEEP, uses a radio-frequency current to remove abnormal areas. It is by far the most common treatment for ''precancerous'' lesions of the cervix. It has an advantage over the destructive techniques (CO2 laser and cryocautery) in that an intact tissue sample for analysis can be obtained. LEEP also is popular because it is inexpensive and simple. A chemical is applied afterwards to prevent bleeding. Vaginal discharge and spotting commonly occur after this procedure. Sexual intercourse and tampon use should be avoided for several weeks to allow better healing.''Complications occur in about 1% to 2% of women undergoing LEEP, and include cervical narrowing (stenosis) and bleeding. This procedure is used most commonly for treating dysplasia, including severe dysplasia. LEEP also is used, although infrequently, to treat carefully chosen cases of cervical cancer.' "
Cold knife cone biopsy,"'Cone biopsy was once the major procedure used to treat ''cervical dysplasia'', but the other methods have now replaced it for this purpose. However, when a physician finds more serious lesions within the endocervix or inner area of the cervix, a cone biopsy continues to be recommended. It is also recommended if special sampling is needed to obtain more information regarding certain types of more advanced abnormalities. This technique allows the size and shape of the sampling to be tailored.''Complications of this procedure include postoperative bleeding in 5% of women and narrowing of the cervix. Cone biopsy has a slightly higher risk of cervical complications than the other treatments. This procedure is occasionally used to treat carefully chosen cases of cervical cancer.' "
Hysterectomy,"'Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. This operation is used to treat most cases of ''invasive cervical cancer''. Sometimes, a hysterectomy is done to treat severe dysplasia. It is also used if dysplasia recurs after any of the other treatment procedures.' "
What is a breast biopsy?,"'A breast biopsy is a procedure in which part or all of a suspicious area in the breast is removed and examined, usually for the presence of ''breast cancer''. The growth sample is suctioned out through a needle or cut out using a surgical procedure. A pathologist then examines and evaluates it under a microscope to identify noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (''malignant'') tissue.''Words used to refer to the abnormal area or growth before and after diagnosis may include lump, mass, lesion, calcification, and ''tumor''.''Imaging studies such as ''mammography'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI), or ultrasound may be used to guide the procedure, known as an image-guided breast biopsy. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses a special mammography machine to help guide the biopsy equipment to the site of the breast abnormality.''The following are the different types of breast biopsy procedures:'   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA): A thin needle suctions out cells from an abnormal area; a physician examines the cells to see if cancer cells are present. Hollow or core needle biopsy: This thicker needle is used to remove a small cylinder of tissue from the abnormal area. Biopsy with a vacuum-powered device Surgical excision of tissue: This may be an excisional biopsy, in which all the abnormal area is excised or removed, or an incisional biopsy, which removes only a portion of the abnormal area for examination by the pathologist."
What is the purpose of a breast biopsy?,"'The breast biopsy is used to determine whether or not a worrisome abnormality or area of calcification is ''cancer'' and, if it is ''cancer'', what type it is and how to develop a treatment plan. When no ''breast cancer'' is detected, the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring. The percentage of breast biopsies that are positive for cancer varies according to the individual hospital or clinic, but in general, only about 20% of ''breast lumps'' are cancerous. The majority of breast biopsies do not detect cancer.' "
"What specialties of physicians and 
other health care professionals perform breast biopsies?","'Many physicians and health care professionals can be involved in evaluating a woman for a breast biopsy.' For example, breast abnormalities during a physical examination might be noticed by a family physician, internist, gynecologist, or nurse practitioner. Women themselves are frequently the first to detect abnormalities in their breasts. Radiologists are specialists in interpreting X-rays such as mammograms, as well as other imaging studies. Radiologists or surgeons often perform the procedure to obtain these breast tissue samples. Anesthesiologists (specialists in administering anesthesia and monitoring a patient's vital signs) are sometimes necessary during some surgical procedures. Pathologists are physician specialists who examine and identify under a microscope the type of cells in the samples and determine whether or not cancer is present."
Who should have a breast biopsy?,"'Anyone, female or male, with a suspicious breast growth, abnormality detected on imaging study, or other ''symptoms of breast cancer'' should undergo a biopsy. Ninety-nine percent of all breast ''cancers'' occur in females, however, males can and do get breast cancer. Therefore, men should regularly examine their breasts as females do for lumps or other ''cancer symptoms''. (Males with the ''genetic disorder'' ''Klinefelter syndrome'', which is associated with increased breast development, have approximately the same risk of developing breast cancer as females.)'  "
In what setting is the breast biopsy done?,"""Breast biopsies are performed in the doctor's office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital operating room. The setting depends on the size and location of the growth, the patient's general health, and the type of biopsy performed. Because physicians can perform biopsies in a short time with minimal risk of serious complications, the patient usually does not need to remain hospitalized overnight unless an underlying health problem requires close monitoring. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses mammography images to guide the location of the biopsy. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may also be used to guide the breast biopsy procedure."" "
What may a benign result indicate?,"'Among the most common benign growths in the breast are ''cysts'' (sacs filled with fluid or semisolid material), intraductal papillomas (small wart-like growths that project above a tissue surface), and lumps formed by fat necrosis (the death of tissue often as a result of ''trauma'' to the breast). A fibroadenoma is the most common type of benign (noncancerous) breast tumor and is found in young women.' "
How is a suspicious breast growth discovered?,"""A suspicious breast growth may be found by a patient's self-examination, a physician's clinical examination, or a screening procedure such as a ""'mammogram''. Small calcium deposits, known as calcifications, are often identified in imaging studies of breast cancers and precancers. These may also be present in benign lesions.' "
What breast symptoms should I be concerned about?,"'Females and males (regardless of age) who discover a lump in a breast should see a doctor for testing. They also should see a doctor if they find a lump in an armpit or above a collarbone (either of which could indicate the presence of spreading cancer).''A doctor or health care professional should be consulted if a person has''It is important to remember that these signs and symptoms do not necessarily indicate the presence of cancer.' red or irritated breast skin, scaly skin on the breast, dimpling skin on the breast, swelling breast skin, nipple discharge other than milk, nipple retraction or inversion, nipple itching, a change in the size or shape of a breast, or breast pain."
What should the patient tell the doctor about the growth?,"'The patient should tell the health care professional when the growth appeared, what its size was at the time of discovery compared to its present size, and where it is located. The patient should also outline any family history of breast cancer, as well as any personal history of breast problems of any kind.' "
How does a health care professional confirm the presence of a breast growth?,"'A physician confirms the presence of a growth by taking a medical history (and asking numerous questions), performing a clinical examination that includes palpating (feeling) the breast, and interpreting the results of a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes other imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI.''Ultrasound sends sound waves into the breast that bounce back to a receiver that can record an image on a computer screen to visualize interior structures. This technique can help distinguish between a ''cyst'' and a solid growth. The physician may also order the laboratory analysis of any nipple discharge (other than milk) to examine for the presence of atypical or cancer cells. After confirming the presence of a suspicious growth or mass, the physician orders a biopsy.' "
"Is anesthesia needed for a 
breast biopsy?","'For nonsurgical biopsies, the patient may need no anesthesia at all or just a local anesthetic (one that numbs the suspicious area only). Sometimes, a patient receives a sedative (calming drug) with the local anesthesia.''For surgical biopsies, the patient may receive a local anesthetic (with or without a sedative) or general anesthesia (one that induces ''sleep''). Patients requiring general anesthesia may have to fast eight to 12 hours before undergoing a biopsy.' "
What are the possible complications from a breast biopsy?,"'Except for a minor sting from the injected anesthesia, patients usually feel no ''pain'' before or during a procedure.''The risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding, is small for nonsurgical procedures and slightly higher for surgical procedures.' "
How long is the recovery time after breast biopsy?,"'After a procedure, some patients may experience some soreness and ''pain'' as well as ''bruising'' and minor skin discoloration of the breast that usually resolves within a week or so. Usually, an ''over-the-counter'' drug such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is sufficient to alleviate any discomfort.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nonsurgical procedures versus surgical breast biopsies?,"'Generally, nonsurgical biopsies are less stressful, do not disfigure the skin, leave no internal ''scar'' to interfere with the accuracy of future mammograms, and minimize the risk of complications.''However, nonsurgical biopsies are not always as reliable as surgical biopsies in producing a diagnosis, and the results at times may be inconclusive. For this reason, some patients who undergo a nonsurgical biopsy must also undergo a follow-up surgical biopsy.' "
What are the different types of breast biopsy procedures and what do they involve?,"'Breast biopsy procedures include''These procedures are described in greater detail later in this article.'   fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and surgical biopsy."
How is a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) done?,"'A fine needle aspiration biopsy can be done in several different ways:''By analyzing the samples immediately after their withdrawal, a doctor may be able to determine that they came from a cyst and simply discard them, diagnosing the growth as benign. In all other cases, fluid and tissue samples are placed on slides and then analyzed by a pathologist in a laboratory. Atypical cells found in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may signal that cancer is present or that repeat biopsies are necessary.' Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for palpable growths: A palpable growth is one that can be felt. The patient usually sits up while the doctor inserts a small hollow needle with a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) fluid and cells from the growth for testing. The doctor simply feels (palpates) the suspicious area to the needle to the site. When the needle reaches the mass, the doctor suctions out a sample with the syringe. The doctor repeats this procedure several times. If the mass is a cyst, the withdrawn samples will consist mainly of fluid and the cyst may collapse, relieving any pain the patient feels. If the mass is solid, the samples will consist primarily of tissue cells. Guided FNA for non-palpable growths: When a growth is too small or deep to palpate (feel), the doctor must locate it with one of several imaging techniques. First, the patient lies face-down on a table with the breasts suspended through an opening. With stereotactic mammography, mammograms of the suspicious breast site are taken from different angles to form a virtual three-dimensional (stereotactic) image that precisely pinpoints the location of the suspicious area. The computer then uses a motor to guide a small hollow needle to the site to remove the samples. The withdrawn samples are then analyzed for the presence of cancer. Ultrasound and MRI are other imaging techniques that may be used to guide breast biopsies."
How is a core needle biopsy done?,"'A core needle biopsy can also be done in several different ways:' Core needle biopsy for palpable growths: This procedure is similar to FNA for palpable growths except that that the needle used has a wider diameter and is equipped with a cutter that removes cores of tissue up to a ½ inch long. A key advantage of this procedure is that the samples are larger than in FNA and thus enhance the possibility of making an accurate laboratory analysis. Guided core needle biopsy for non-palpable growths: This procedure also uses a wide needle with a cutter that removes cores of tissue large enough to enhance the accuracy of laboratory analysis. However, because the growth is deep in the breast or otherwise not palpable, stereotactic imaging, ultrasound, or MRI is used to locate the growth."
How is a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy done?,"'Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is procedure that uses a special instrument and imaging guidance to remove breast tissue samples through a single small skin incision. This technique allows the surgeon to remove more tissue through a single incision than is possible with a traditional core biopsy and is a much less invasive procedure than an open surgical biopsy.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy involves the placement of a biopsy probe using radiology imaging studies for guidance. Stereotactic mammography, ultrasound, and MRI have all been successfully used to identify the abnormal areas to be sampled by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Once the biopsy probe has been positioned, a vacuum pulls the breast tissue through an opening in the probe into the sampling chamber of the device. Then a rotating cutting device in the instrument removes the tissue sample, which is carried through the biopsy probe to a tissue collection receptacle.''The surgeon or radiologist then turns a control knob on the biopsy probe that moves the sampling chamber to a new position. This procedure is repeated until all desired areas have been sampled. In this way, samples can be taken all around a suspicious area through a single insertion of the biopsy probe. With a traditional core biopsy, sampling of multiple areas would involve repeated insertions of the biopsy instrument.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia and leaves a small incision that does not require ''stitches'' for closure. It takes less than an hour to perform, and patients can usually return to normal activities soon after the procedure.' "
"How is a 
surgical biopsy of the breast done?","'A surgical biopsy can be an excisional (removing the entire abnormal area) or an incisional (removing only part of the abnormal area) biopsy. The surgical biopsy can be done in different ways:''The doctor closes the opening with ''sutures'' or clips that remain in place for about a week. Patients who receive general anesthesia rather than a local will require about an hour to recover from drowsiness after the surgery.' Surgical biopsy of palpable growths (lumpectomy): This procedure removes part or all of a breast growth, or lump. The doctor makes an incision 1 or 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 cm) across and removes the sample. If the lump is small and measures 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less across, the doctor usually removes the entire lump for testing (excisional biopsy). If the lump is large, the doctor usually removes only a portion of it for testing (incisional biopsy). If cancer is found, the rest of the lump can be removed at the time of the biopsy or at a later time. Surgical biopsy for non-palpable lumps: This procedure is similar to lumpectomy except that the growth is first located by mammography or other imaging studies and then ""marked."" The doctor inserts a needle that conveys a wire with a hook on the end into the breast, all the while using the image as a guide. After anchoring the hooked wire to the lump, the doctor withdraws the needle and performs the surgery. Another option is to inject a dye to mark the spot rather than using a hooked wire."
What is the time frame for receiving the results of a breast biopsy?,"'For small biopsies and fine-needle aspirations, the results may be available the next day. The results of most breast biopsies will be available within a few days. Sometimes special testing must be performed, and the results may be delayed and take longer. This does not necessarily mean that a cancer is present. For example, sometimes the tissue sections must be recut to reveal deeper layers of the tissue to allow for optimal evaluation by the pathologist. In other cases, special tissue stains may be necessary to help the pathologist assess the tissue sample under the microscope. The radiologist or surgeon performing the procedure will be able to give you a better idea of the approximate time frame and how the result will be communicated to you.' "
What is a Liver Biopsy?,"'A ''liver'' biopsy is a procedure in which a small needle is inserted into the liver to collect a tissue sample. This is performed as an office or outpatient procedure or during surgery. The tissue is then analyzed in a laboratory to help doctors diagnose a variety of disorders and diseases in the liver. A liver biopsy is most often performed to help identify the cause of:' Persistent abnormal liver blood tests (liver enzymes). Unexplained yellowing of the skin (jaundice). A liver abnormality found on ultrasound, CT scan, or nuclear scan. Unexplained enlargement of the liver."
Is Liver Biopsy Safe?,"'In most instances, there are no complications in obtaining a liver biopsy. However, rarely ''internal bleeding'' may occur, as well as a leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder.' "
How Do I Prepare for a Liver Biopsy?,"'When preparing for a liver biopsy, there are several things to keep in mind.''Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor.' Tell your doctor if you're pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, are allergic to any medications, or have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medications such as Coumadin, Plavix, or Persantine. Your doctor may prescribe an alternate method for thinning your blood before the procedure. For the week before the procedure, do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Naprosyn, or Indocin) unless otherwise advised by your doctor."
What Happens on the Day of a Liver Biopsy?,"'Laboratory tests will be performed on the day of a liver biopsy or 2-3 days before the procedure, as directed by your doctor. These tests may include a blood count, a ''platelet count'"", and a measurement of your blood's ability to clot.""'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''After the procedure:' A doctor will explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications and answer any questions you may have. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back, with your right elbow out to the side and your right hand under your head. It is important that you remain as still as possible during the procedure. An ultrasound may be used to mark the location of your liver. You may receive a small dose of a sedative just prior to the procedure. The doctor cleans and numbs an area on your upper abdomen with a local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication). The doctor then makes a small incision on your upper abdomen and inserts a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis. The procedure takes about 5 minutes. You will stay in a recovery room for up to 4 hours for observation. You may feel minor discomfort or a dull pain in your shoulders or back. If necessary, a pain medication will be prescribed for you. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after the procedure. Avoid taking aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Naprosyn, Indocin, or Motrin) for one week after the procedure. You may takeacetaminophen (Tylenol) if needed. Do not perform vigorous physical activity for at least 24 hours after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the biopsy results with you several days after the procedure."
What other methods of liver biopsy are available?,"'Two other methods of liver biopsy may also be available: laparoscopic and transvenous.''During a laparoscopic biopsy'', a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the physician watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver.'' A transvenous biopsy'' may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver. A biopsy needle is placed into the catheter and then into the liver to obtain a sample.' "
Warning About Liver Biopsy,"'If you have a ''fever''; difficulty ''breathing''; ''chills''; ''dizziness''; or tenderness or severe pain at the site of a liver biopsy or in the chest, shoulder, or abdomen within 72 hours after the procedure, please call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.' "
What are biologic rhythms?,"""What are biologic rhythms? In essence, they're the rhythms of life. All forms of life on earth, including our bodies, respond rhythmically to the regular cycles of the sun, moon, and seasons.""'For example, as night turns into day, vital body functions, including ''heart'' rate and ''blood pressure'', speed up in anticipation of increased physical activity. These and other predictable fluctuations in body function, taking place during specific time cycles, are our biologic rhythms. They are regulated by ""biologic clock"" mechanisms located in the brain.''Although biologic rhythms can be ""reprogrammed"" by environmental influences (such as when a person regularly works the night shift and sleeps during the day), they are genetically ""hard-wired"" into our cells, tissues, and organs.'""Medical chronobiologists have found that biologic rhythms can affect the severity of disease symptoms, diagnostic test results, and even the body's response to drug therapy. Now these investigators are working to discover how the rhythms of life can be used to improve the practice of medicine -- and your health.""'These time-related medical observations, and others still in the exciting process of discovery, are rooted in chronobiology (chronos\xa0-- time; bios -- life; logos - science), the study of biologic rhythms.' "
"How does the ""body clock"" affect symptoms of illness?","'Among the various biologic rhythm cycles that medical chronobiologists study, the 24-hour day/night-activity/rest cycle is considered a key chronobiologic factor in medical diagnosis and treatment. Formally known as the circadian rhythm, it\'s also referred to as the ""body clock.""''Why is the 24-hour body clock so important? ''Because so many of our normal body functions follow daily patterns of speeding up and slowing down, intensifying and diminishing, in alignment with circadian rhythm. Interestingly, so do the symptoms of a number of chronic disorders:''Allergic rhinitis'':'' (nasal inflammation associated with ''hay fever'') Symptoms of ''sneezing'', ''runny nose'', and stuffy nose are typically worse in the early waking hours than later during the day.''Asthma'':'' In most patients, symptoms are more than 100 times more likely to occur in the few hours prior to awakening than during the day.''Stable ''angina'':'' ''Chest pain'' and electrocardiographic (''ECG'', ''EKG'') abnormalities are most common during the first 4 to 6 hours after awakening.'""Prinzmetal's angina:""' ECG abnormalities are most common during ''sleep''; ''chest pain'' can occur even while at rest.''Heart attack'':'' Heart attack most commonly occurs in the early waking hours.''Stroke'':'' ''Strokes'' most commonly occur in the early waking hours.''Hypertension'':'' The highest blood pressure readings typically occur from late morning to middle afternoon; lowest occur during early ''sleep''. Therapy now exists that works with your body clock; consult your physician about this treatment. Clinical studies are underway to further this research.''Rheumatoid arthritis'':'' ''RA symptoms'' are most intense upon awakening.''Osteoarthritis'':'' Symptoms of ''osteoarthritis'' worsen in the afternoon and evening.''Ulcer disease:'' The ''pain'' typically occurs after stomach emptying, following daytime meals, and in the very early morning, disrupting sleep.''Epilepsy'':'' ''Seizures'' often occur only at particular times of the day or night; individual patterns differ among patients.'  "
Angina,"'Angina is chest ''pain'' or pressure due to an insufficient supply of oxygenated blood to the heart muscle.''Patients who develop angina only during ''stress'' or physical exertion have ''stable, exertional angina''. When a coronary artery becomes critically narrowed, heart muscle ischemia or angina can occur with minimal or no exertion. These patients have ''unstable angina'', and are at imminent risk of heart attack (''myocardial infarction''). A heart attack occurs when a diseased coronary artery becomes completely obstructed by a ''blood clot'', leading to irreversible death of heart muscle. During the early hours of a heart attack, irregular heart rhythms can occur which commonly cause ''sudden cardiac death''.'""Heart ischemia resulting in angina can be caused by spasm of the coronary arteries. This is a rare condition called vasospastic angina (also known as Prinzmetal's angina) and is not associated with exertion.""'It has been known for some time that the symptoms of ischemic ''heart disease'' are more common in the morning hours than at any other time of day.' Oxygenated blood is normally delivered to the heart muscle by arteries to the heart (coronary arteries). Inadequate oxygenation of heart muscle (ischemia) can occur because of either narrowing or spasm of the coronary arteries. Narrowing of the coronary arteries (coronary artery disease or CAD) is usually caused byarteriosclerosis (cholesterol deposits on the inner wall of the arteries). In patients with narrowed coronary arteries, factors that increase work demand and oxygen consumption of the heart (such as exercise, excitement, increased blood pressure and heart rate) can precipitate heart muscle ischemia and angina. Patients experience episodes of stable angina with lower levels of exertion in the morning than in the afternoon. The occurrence of episodes of vasospastic angina is higher in the morning than in the afternoons. In patients with CAD, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicative of heart muscle ischemia are seen more frequently in the morning than in the afternoon."
Heart attack,"'Over one million Americans suffer a heart attack annually. Over four hundred thousand of these heart attack victims die as a result. Many of the heart attack deaths are due to sudden ventricular ''fibrillation'' occurring before the patient can reach any medical assistance or the emergency room. Ventricular fibrillation and other heart electrical disturbances can be treated with medications once the patient reaches the hospital. Therefore, 90% to 95% of those heart attack patients who make it to the hospital survive.''Heart attack (myocardial infarction) is the irreversible death of heart muscle due to complete blockage of a coronary artery, usually by a ''blood clot'' forming on a cholesterol plaque.''Numerous studies, including the classic Framingham study, have shown that the incidence pattern of sudden cardiac death parallels those of ''hypertension'', heart muscle ischemia, angina, and heart attack - a 70% greater risk between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., compared to the rest of the day.''Stroke'' resulting from ischemia occurs more frequently in the morning than at any other time of day. Like heart attack, ischemic ''stroke'' refers to permanent death of brain tissue because of blockage of the artery supplying blood to the brain, usually by a blood clot.' A coronary artery is an artery supplying blood to the heart muscle. A cholesterol plaque is an abnormal, hard thick deposit on the artery wall. The condition whereby cholesterol plaque deposits on coronary arteries is called coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD leads to narrowing of these coronary arteries, thus impairing the normal oxygen supply to the heart. Coronary artery narrowing can cause angina, chest pain or pressure due to an insufficient supply of oxygenated blood (ischemia) to the heart muscle. During a heart attack, heart muscle dies when a diseased coronary artery becomes completely blocked by a blood clot. Heart attack can cause chest pain, heart pump failure, and electrical disturbances in the heart. Electrical disturbances in the heart can cause ventricular fibrillation (a chaotic heart rhythm). A heart undergoing ventricular fibrillation simply quivers, and is incapable of pumping oxygenated blood to the rest of the body and the brain. Permanent brain damage usually occurs unless oxygenated blood is restored to the brain within minutes."
High blood pressure (hypertension),"'Hypertension'' or ''high blood pressure'' is a silent killer. Early ''high blood pressure'' produces no symptoms or discomfort. However, untreated long-term ''high blood pressure'' can lead to strokes, heart diseases, ''kidney disease'"", and eye damage. Medical scientists now know that a person's blood pressure varies according to the time of day (circadian rhythm). Such variations may have important implications in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients with ""'high blood pressure''.''It is important to understand a critical distinction: Circadian rhythms do not cause clinical hypertension in normotensives (people with normal blood pressure). Circadian rhythms do, however, result in a cyclic worsening of hypertension in hypertensive patients.'""In the majority of individuals - normotensive and hypertensive - blood pressure rises rapidly in the early morning hours, the time when most individuals wake up and begin their day. This morning rise in blood pressure is not caused by the act of getting out of bed and beginning activity. It is a genetically preset system that automatically increases a person's blood pressure at that time.""'For example, if a person goes to sleep at around 10 p.m., beginning in the very early morning - sometime between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. – the blood pressure begins to rise and continues to rise through the morning.''This increase, which is accompanied by an increase in heart rate, corresponds to the following biologic changes, which are also governed by circadian rhythms:''Catecholamines, norepinephrine, and renin are natural hormones produced by the kidneys and adrenal glands (small glands located near the top of both kidneys). These hormones cause tightening of blood vessels in the body (vasoconstriction). Vasoconstriction causes resistance to blood flow and elevates blood pressure.''The vasoconstricting effects of catecholamines may also be enhanced in the morning by the high levels of certain hormones which interact with catecholamines and increase their effects. Many high blood pressure medications are designed to counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of these hormones.''In the late morning or early afternoon, the natural rise in blood pressure reaches its peak. After that, blood pressure declines, falling 15 to 20 mmHg between about 8 p.m. and 2 a.m., the time at which blood pressure is normally at its lowest point.''The blood pressure pattern just described is typical of some individuals, whether the individual is hypertensive or normotensive. These people are referred to as ""dippers."" In other individuals (called ""nondippers""), there is no nightly decline in blood pressure. The blood pressure in these people remains high, even during sleep.''Disease of the heart and blood vessels (''cardiovascular disease''), including hypertension and the syndromes of ischemic ''heart disease'' (angina, heart attack, sudden death), also follow circadian rhythms. This pattern makes sense when you consider that heart rate and blood levels of enzymes and catecholamines that strongly influence blood pressure and ''heart function'' follow circadian rhythms.' Increased secretion of catecholamines, particularly norepinephrine, into the bloodstream. Increased plasma renin activity."
Hay fever (allergic rhinitis),"'Allergic'' ''rhinitis'' (hay ''fever'') is a very common condition, affecting 17.6 million Americans annually. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis (sneezing, runny nose, ''nasal congestion'', and ''itchy'' eyes) occur when an allergic individual is exposed to allergens. Allergens are tiny proteins that stimulate the ''allergic reaction''. Common allergens include:''The best way to treat allergic rhinitis is to avoid the allergens. Skin testing is often performed to identify the allergens which cause allergic reactions in a given individual. Scientists now believe that the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and even the skin testing results, can vary according to the time of day.''For sufferers of allergic rhinitis, the major symptoms of sneezing, runny nose, and stuffy nose are typically worse upon arising than during the middle of the activity span of a given day.' pollens from ragweed, trees, and grasses; mold spores; animal proteins; and mites."
Asthma,"'Asthma'' is a common ''breathing'' problem, affecting 16.1 million Americans. ''Asthma'' is a disease of the lung airways (bronchi). Narrowing of the openings of the airways (caused by spasm, swelling of the tissue lining, and/or ''mucus'' accumulation) can lead to ''shortness of breath'', ''wheezing'', or ''coughing''.''Causes of asthma attacks include:''Asthma attacks (rapid worsening of symptoms) typically occur in episodes. Intervals between attacks can be days, weeks, or years. With severe asthma, attacks can occur daily. Scientists now believe that asthma attacks vary according to the time of day.''The occurrence of asthma attacks is not random during the day. ''Asthma symptoms'' are frequently worse at night (''nocturnal'') for a majority of asthma sufferers. A group of active asthma patients recorded the occurrence of acute asthma attacks, manifested by dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and wheezing, during a medication trial.''The incidence of asthma attacks was more than 100 times greater during nighttime sleep, especially around 4 a.m., than it was during the middle of the day.' allergies, cold air, air pollutants, drugs, cigarette smoke, molds, exercise, and infections."
"Can the ""body clock""  affect diagnostic testing?","""The body clock's powerful influence can also be seen in the way it affects diagnostic test results. These results can vary significantly, possibly producing inaccurate readings, depending on the time of day when a test is done.""""Consider how the body clock affects blood pressure. Blood pressure isn't constant throughout the day and night; it normally rises in the morning, remains elevated during the day and early evening, and decreases to its lowest level during sleep. So a single reading taken during the day may not give a true picture of whether blood pressure is within the normal range or requires treatment. Some doctors now ask patients to wear special monitoring devices that provide a complete 24-hour blood pressure pattern by recording blood pressures a number of times during the day.""'The body clock also affects skin testing for ''allergies''. Results are lower in the morning, considerably higher in the evening, and greatest just before bedtime.''The body clock may complicate testing for asthma severity. ''Airway'' patency, or degree of openness, is poorest during the night and best during midday and evening. The same is generally true for forced expiratory volume and peak expiratory flow readings, which can be up to 50% higher at midday and in the afternoon than overnight or when the patient wakes up. Unless these circadian rhythms are taken into account, daytime evaluation of asthma patients could result in underestimating the severity of the disease.'""What's being done to help doctors obtain the most accurate results from diagnostic tests likely to be affected by the body clock? ""'Just heightening their awareness of chronobiology has been important. In addition, medical chronobiologists are working to develop test interpretation guidelines that take circadian rhythms into account for doctors.' "
"Can drug therapy be matched to the ""body clock?""","'The time of day also can affect the way our bodies respond to medical therapy, especially drug therapy. Investigators working in a special area of chronobiology, called chronotherapeutics or chronotherapy, are studying these effects. Their goal is to come up with new medications, or improve existing ones, that make the most of what we know about how the body clock works.''Already there is evidence that taking medication ""by the clock"" helps the drugs work better and reduces their side effects. Currently, some doctors are prescribing nighttime administration of medication for patients with ulcer disease or asthma (which worsen at night), ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (which worsens in the early morning hours), and high ''cholesterol levels'"" (most of the body's cholesterol production occurs at night). For patients with osteoarthritis, which worsens in the afternoon and evening, some doctors are prescribing midday medication.""'Drugs that may be given ""by the clock"" include ''corticosteroids'', ''nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), ''antihistamines'', theophyllines, and anticancer drugs.''These lists are growing as chronobiology, chronotherapy, and the diagnostic and treatment methods derived from them are slowly accepted by the medical community. However, the broad acceptance of chronobiology in medicine is expected to take (excuse the expression) some time.' "
What is bioterrorism?," Bioterrorism is a form of terrorism where there is the intentional release of biological agents (bacteria, viruses, or other germs). This is also referred to as germ warfare. Terrorism is defined by the United States government as the ""unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives."" The term ""terrorism"" does not imply what weapon is being used. In addition to biological agents, terrorists can also utilize traditional weapons (guns), chemical agents and nuclear bombs. While a biological agent may injure or kill people, animals, or plants, the goal for the terrorist is to further their social and political goals by making their civilian targets feel as if their government cannot protect them. Many biological agents are found in nature; however, they can be modified by the terrorist to make them more dangerous. Some of these agents can be transmitted from person to person, and the infection may take hours or days to become apparent."
What are the biological agents that can be utilized for bioterrorism?,"'While any germ, bacteria, or virus could potentially be utilized by terrorist, there are a number of biological agents that have been recognized as being more likely to be utilized. The reason for these agents being of concern is based on their availability to terrorists and the ease by which these agents can be disseminated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) has developed a classification system for biological terror agents, which is available on their web site (''Categories''). The classification is based on the likelihood of the agent being used and the risk posed by each agent. The agents (and the diseases they cause) are listed in table 1, including hyperlinks for those wishing to learn more about a specific agent or disease. However, it is almost impossible for most people to memorize all the details about each of these agents. It is more important for the general public to understand the risk of bioterrorism and the appropriate response to a terrorist attack.' "
What are the causes of bioterrorism in food?,"'There are a number of bacteria and bacterial toxins that could potentially be used to infect the food supply. These include ''Clostridium botulinum'' toxin, ''Clostridium perfringens'' toxin, ''Salmonella'' species, ''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7, ''Shigella'', and Staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The one that is most dangerous and most likely to be used in bioterrorism is ''Clostridium botulinum'' toxin, which causes ''botulism''.' "
What are other sources for detailed information on bioterrorism?,"'There are many different government-based web sites that have up-to-date information on bioterrorism. These include the following:' U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

How can I prepare myself for a bioterrorism attack?,"'The American Red Cross, in cooperation with the CDC, has developed a detailed plan that gives people the proper steps to take to prepare in the event there is a bioterrorism attack (''http://www.redcross.org/preparedness/''cdc_english/home.asp'""). The first step starts long before there is an attack. People must have appropriate supplies stored in a safe place in their house, where they work, and even in their cars. Although individuals may want to vary the list based on their particular needs, the list taken from the American Red Cross' web site (see below) is a good place to start. A similar list can be found on the U.S. Homeland Security web site (""'http://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit''). These supplies may also be invaluable to have on hand during natural disasters, which are actually more likely to occur than a terrorist attack.' Water: 3 gallons for each person who would use the kit and an additional 4 gallons per person or pet for use if you are confined to your home Food: a three-day supply in the kit and at least an additional four-day supply per person or pet for use at home (You may want to consider stocking a two-week supply of food and water in your home.) Items for infants, including formula, diapers, bottles, pacifiers, powdered milk, and medications not requiring refrigeration Items for seniors, disabled people or anyone with serious allergies, including special foods, denture items, extra eyeglasses, hearing aid batteries, prescription and nonprescription medications that are regularly used, inhalers, and other essential equipment Kitchen accessories: a manual can opener, mess kits or disposable cups, plates and utensils, utility knife, sugar and salt, aluminum foil and plastic wrap, resealable plastic bags A portable, battery-powered radio or television and extra fresh batteries Several flashlights and extra fresh batteries A first aid kit One complete change of clothing and footwear for each person, including sturdy work shoes or boots, rain gear, and other items adjusted for the season, such as hats and gloves, thermal underwear, sunglasses, and dust masks Blankets or a sleeping bag for each person Sanitation and hygiene items: shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrushes, comb and brush, lip balm, sunscreen, contact lenses, any medications regularly used, toilet paper, towelettes, soap, hand sanitizer, liquid detergent, feminine supplies, plastic garbage bags (heavy-duty) and ties (for personal sanitation uses), medium-sized plastic bucket with tight lid, disinfectant, and household chlorine bleach Other essential items: paper, pencil, needles, thread, small A-B-C-type fire extinguisher, medicine dropper, whistle, and emergency-preparedness manual Entertainment: including games, books, favorite dolls, and stuffed animals for small children A map of the area marked with places you could go and their telephone numbers An extra set of keys and IDs: including keys for cars and any properties owned and copies of driver's licenses, passports, and work-identification badges Cash, coins, and copies of credit cards Copies of medical prescriptions Matches in a waterproof container A small tent, compass, and shovel"
What are the warning signs of a bioterrorism attack?,"'Although the government continues to search for an early detection system for biological, chemical, and ''radiation'' terrorist attacks, none of these systems have been perfected. The medical community is advised to look out for unusual diseases not typically seen in the area. Other potential clues that raise suspicion for a bioterrorism attack include new types of ''antibiotic resistance'' in bacteria, because some biologic agents are modified (weaponized) to make them more lethal, unusual numbers of cases of a disease, and atypical presentation of diseases.''The general public should constantly be vigilant for bioterrorism. Events that might suggest an attack include a large number of ill or dead people in a small geographic area, multiple dead animals of different species, and patients with multiple different diseases, indicating a mixed attack.' "
What should I do if there has been a bioterrorism attack?,"'If you think that you have been exposed to a biological agent, the most important thing to do is to quickly remove your clothing and wash off your skin. Most biological agents cannot penetrate intact skin. Showering with soap and water will remove most agents from the skin. If you have already inhaled or ingested the agent, decontamination using soap and water may not help you but might help prevent exposing other family members or coworkers.''If the biological agent has been released into the air but you do not believe (or do not know) you have been exposed, you can utilize masks to help prevent ''inhalation'' of the agent. The problem is that standard surgical masks offer little protection. Specialized high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) masks are available that offer better protection; however, they are more expensive, not easily found, and should be fitted to the person using them.''The two most important tools used by public health officials will be isolation and quarantine. Isolation is keeping people known to be ill away from other people. Quarantine is keeping people who may have been exposed away from other people. The problem is that many times we may not know who has been exposed. In these cases, the public health officials will likely recommend that everyone stay in their homes and avoid all public gatherings. By doing this, we will isolate those sick and quarantine those infected but who do not yet have symptoms. Those cities that utilized this technique during the Spanish ''flu'' pandemic of 1918 had much lower rates of death than did cities that did not practice good quarantine procedures.''If there has been a bioterrorism attack, the first important step is to get information immediately from the news media as to the right course of action. For some terrorist attacks, it may be correct to try and leave the area; however, for other events, it may be more appropriate to shelter in place. With bioterrorism, there may be the possibility of transmission of disease from one human to another (for example, ''measles'', ''influenza'', avian flu, ''smallpox'', ''plague'', and viral hemorrhagic ''fevers''). In the case of either a bioterrorism attack or just a natural outbreak, it may be necessary to avoid contact with infected people or just remain inside for a period of time until the infected people are no longer ''contagious''. Again, the key action is to understand the recommendations from public health officials as delivered through the news media.' "
How do I know if I have been exposed to a bioterrorism agent?,"'The symptoms of illness caused by the different bioterrorism agents are frequently very nonspecific. Many of the agents cause a ""''flu-like''"" illness. These symptoms would include ''fever'', ''cough'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''headache''. It is very hard to differentiate many of the different diseases initially, and tests to confirm the diagnosis often must be done at specialized state laboratories and may require weeks until the results are received.''It is best to stay informed through news media on what symptoms to look for and when to seek medical care. The health care system simply cannot handle every member in the community demanding to be tested for the disease. Many diseases do not even have a treatment other than supportive care which can often be done at home.' "
Should I have some antibiotics on hand just in case I get exposed?,"'While there are a few biological agents that can be prevented by taking antibiotics (for example, ''anthrax''), it is not recommended that you stockpile antibiotics. Antibiotics have a limited shelf life and would likely be unusable by the time an attack might occur. Also, there are many different types of infectious agents, each requiring different antibiotics. All ''drugs'', including antibiotics, have side effects, and taking them inappropriately could cause more harm than good.''Because the likelihood of a biological attack is small, it is better to wait until there has been an attack before getting medications. The U.S. government has stockpiles of drugs that will be immediately flown into a community that has experienced a biological attack (these supplies are rotated to keep them current). Additionally, many large communities also have stockpiles of medications for emergency use.' "
What is biological therapy?,"""Biological or biologic therapy is treatment designed to stimulate or restore the ability of the body's immune (natural internal defense) system to fight infection and disease. Biological therapy is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy and is commonly used to treat different kinds of ""'cancers'', as well as other conditions.' "
How does biological therapy work?,"""Biological therapy is a form of treatment that uses portions of the body's natural immune system to treat a disease. Biological therapy is also used to protect the body from some of the side effects of certain treatments.""'Biological therapy often involves the use of substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces these substances in small amounts in response to infection and disease. Using modern laboratory techniques, scientists can produce BRMs in large amounts for use in the treatment of ''cancer'' and other diseases, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease.""'Biological therapy may also target specific molecules on ''cancer'' cells to destroy the cells, or it may target proteins that facilitate the growth of ''cancer'' cells.''Depending on the agent, biological therapies can be given by mouth, intravenously, or as an injection.'  "
What are examples of biological therapies?,"'Monoclonal antibodies, ''interferon'', interleukin-2 (IL-2), and several types of colony-stimulating factors (CSF, GM- CSF, G-CSF) are forms of biological therapy. For example, interleukin-2 and interferon are two examples of BRMs being tested for the treatment of advanced ''malignant melanoma''.''Monoclonal antibodies are a common type of biological therapy for many different cancers and other conditions. These are laboratory-produced antibodies that are designed to attack specific proteins expressed by abnormal cells. Examples of monoclonal antibody ''drugs'' include ''rituximab'"", which is used to treat non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'', alemtuzumab (''Campath'') to treat ''chronic lymphocytic leukemia'' (CLL), and ipilimumab (Yervoy) for metastatic ''melanoma''.''Other kinds of monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancers target proteins that are responsible for cell growth. Examples of these drugs include bevacizumab (''Avastin''), which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix) to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and ''trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') and pertuzumab (Perjeta) to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER-2).''Modes of biologic therapy that involve blocking the action of specific proteins of inflammation, called ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF), are being used for the treatment of a number of diseases, including ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease. ""'Etanercept'' (''Enbrel'') and ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') are examples of commercially available injectable TNF-blocking treatments for patients with severe ''rheumatoid arthritis''.''Biological therapy is a very active and exciting area of cancer research.' "
What type of specialists administer biological therapy?,"'Biological therapies are prescribed by specialists who treat cancers (oncologists or hematologist-oncologists), as well as other specialists, including ''rheumatologists'' and gastroenterologists.' "
What are the side effects of biological therapy?,"'The side effects of biological therapy depend on the type of treatment. Side effects include ''flu-like symptoms'' such as ''chills'', ''fever'', muscle aches, ''weakness'', ''loss of appetite'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. Some patients develop a ''rash'', and some bleed or bruise easily. In addition, interleukin therapy can cause swelling.''Depending on how severe these problems are, hospitalization during treatment may be required for some patients. Side effects are usually short-term and gradually subside after treatment ends.''The long-term side effects of the various currently available biological therapies will be better defined with future research from which will also surely emerge new and valuable forms of these treatments.'  "
What is bipolar disorder?,"'Bipolar disorder, also called bipolar I disorder and formerly called manic depression, is a ''mental illness'', specifically one of the affective (mood) disorders. It is characterized by severe mood swings, at least one episode of mania and may include repeated episodes of depression. This illness afflicts more than 1% of adults in the United States, up to as many as 4 million people. Some additional facts and statistics about bipolar disorder include the following:' Bipolar disorder is the fifth leading cause of disability worldwide. Bipolar disorder is the ninth leading cause of years lost to death or disability worldwide. The number of individuals with bipolar disorder who commit suicide is 60 times higher than that of the general population. There seems to be no increase in involvement with violent crime for people with bipolar disorder compared to the general population except for those bipolar disorder sufferers that also suffer from an alcohol or other substance use disorder. People who have bipolar disorder are at a higher risk of also suffering from substance abuse such as alcoholism as well as other mental health problems. A number of medical problems tend to co-occur with bipolar disorder, including some pain and neurological and genetic disorders. Males may develop bipolar disorder earlier in life compared to females. Blacks are sometimes diagnosed more often with bipolar disorder compared to whites."
What is the history of bipolar disorder?,"'Bipolar disorder was formally conceptualized by Emil Kraeplin more than 100 years ago, at which time he described it as manic-depressive insanity. However, mood problems that include depression alternating with symptoms that are now understood to be manic have been referenced in history as long ago as 200 A.D. At that time, this condition, like unipolar depression, was thought to be the result of bad blood, called black bile. In the 19th century, this illness was referred to by terms like biphasic illness, circular insanity, and dual-form insanity. Despite such negative terminology for this disease, bipolar disorder is also known to be associated with significant achievement in some individuals. Many historical figures and currently successful people suffer from this disorder, whose creativity and accomplishments can therefore be an inspiration for current sufferers of the disorder.' "
What are the types of bipolar disorder?,"'Bipolar disorder has a number of types, including bipolar I and bipolar II disorder. Depending on how rapidly the mood swings occur, the episodes of bipolar disorder can also be described as having mixed (mood disordered episodes that last less than the usual amount of time required for the diagnosis) features or rapid cycling (four or more mood disordered episodes per year) features. About two-fifths of people with bipolar disorder have at least one period of rapid cycling over the course of their lifetime. For every type and duration of the illness, the sufferer experiences significant problems with his or her functioning at school, at work, socially or otherwise in their community, may need hospitalization, or may have psychotic symptoms (for example, ''delusions'' or ''hallucinations''). The diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires that the individual has at least one manic episode but does not require a history of ''major depression''. Bipolar II disorder is diagnosed if the person has experienced at least one episode of major depression and at least one episode of ''hypomania'' (a milder form of mania). Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by at least a two-year period in adults, or one-year period in children and adolescents, of episodes of having symptoms of depression and episodes of ''hypomanic'' symptoms that do not qualify for having either a full major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode.''Mixed features are defined as meeting full diagnostic criteria for a manic episode while also suffering from at least three symptoms of a depressive episode, or meeting full diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode while also suffering from at least three symptoms of a manic or hypomanic episode. People who suffer from significant, debilitating seasonal ''mood changes'' year after year may be classified as having a seasonal pattern to their bipolar disorder.'  "
"What are bipolar disorder symptoms and signs in adults, teenagers, and children?","'As indicated in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-V''), in order to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, a person must experience at least one manic episode. Characteristics of mania must last at least a week (unless it is part of mixed features) and include''Symptoms of the manic episode of early onset bipolar disorder in childhood or adolescence tend to include outbursts of anger, rage, and aggression, as well as irritability, as opposed to the expansive, excessively elevated mood seen in adults. The adolescent with bipolar disorder is more likely to exhibit depression and mixed episodes with rapid changes in mood. Despite differences in the symptoms of ''bipolar disorder in teens'' and children compared to adults, many who are diagnosed with certain kinds of pediatric bipolar disorder continue to have those symptoms as adults.''Symptoms of bipolar disorder in women tend to include more depression and ''anxiety'' and a rapid cycling pattern compared to symptoms in men, and men with bipolar disorder are more at risk for having an alcohol or other substance use disorder compared to women with the mood disorder. Women bipolar disorder sufferers are also more prone to experience ''thyroid disease'' or ''obesity'' compared to men.''Although a major depressive episode is not required for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, such episodes often alternate with manic episodes. In fact, persistent sadness tends to occur more often than mania in many people with bipolar disorder.''Characteristics of depressive episodes (''bipolar depression'') include a number of the following symptoms: persistently ''depressed'' or irritable mood; feelings of apprehension; frequent crying, inability to feel pleasure; loss of interest in previously pleasurable activities; apathy, low motivation; increased or ''decreased appetite'', ''weight loss'' or ''weight gain'', difficulty falling asleep; excess sleepiness, agitation or lack of activity; ''fatigue''/low energy; feelings of worthlessness; lack of concentration; slowness in activity and thought; inappropriate feelings of guilt; hopelessness; thoughts of death, self-harm or ''suicidal thoughts'', plans, or actions.'   elevated, expansive, or irritable mood; racing thoughts; pressured speech (rapid, excessive, and frenzied speaking); decreased need for sleep; grandiose ideas (for example, false beliefs of superiority or failures); tangential speech (repeatedly changing conversational topics to topics that are hardly related); restlessness/increased goal-directed activity; impulsivity, poor judgment or engaging in risky activity (like spending sprees, promiscuity, or excess desire for sex)."
What are bipolar disorder causes and risk factors?,"'One frequently asked question about bipolar disorder is if it is hereditary. As with most other mental disorders, bipolar disorder is not directly passed from one generation to another genetically. Rather, it is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental vulnerabilities. Genetically, bipolar disorder and ''schizophrenia'' have much in common, in that the two disorders share a number of the same risk genes. However, both illnesses also have some genetic risk factors that are unique.''Other mental health disorders, like ''anxiety'' and behavior disorders, can increase the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder.''Stress'' has been found to be a significant contributor to the development of most mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder. For example, gay, lesbian, and bisexual people are thought to experience increased emotional struggles associated with the multiple social stressors that are linked to coping with societal reactions to their sexuality. People who have similar ''stress'' levels are equally prone to developing bipolar disorder regardless of nationality, race, or socioeconomic status.'  "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose bipolar disorder?,"""As is true with virtually any mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively assesses that someone has bipolar disorder. Therefore, health care clinicians, like psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, diagnose this disease by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information. The health care professional will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has mental health symptoms like ""'euphoria'', depression, ''agitated depression'', and rarely ''paranoia'' or other symptoms of psychosis that are associated with a medical condition.''In asking questions about mental health symptoms, mental health professionals are often exploring if the individual suffers from depression and/or manic disorders, but also ''anxiety'', substance abuse, hallucinations or delusions, as well as some personality and behavioral disorders. Health care professionals may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test as a screening tool for bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. Since some of the symptoms of bipolar disorder can also occur in other mental illnesses, the mental health screening is to determine if the individual suffers from bipolar disorder, a depressive disorder, or the less severe symptoms of depression and hypomania associated with ''cyclothymia''. The evaluation will also screen for an ''anxiety disorder'' like ''panic disorder'', ''generalized anxiety disorder'', or ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), as well as whether the person with bipolar disorder suffers from other mental illnesses like ''schizophrenia'', ''schizoaffective disorder'', and other ''psychotic disorders'', a substance abuse disorder like narcotic (for example, ''hydrocodone'') withdrawal or stimulant (for example, ''cocaine'') intoxication, or a personality or behavior disorder like attention-deficit ''hyperactivity'' disorder (''ADHD''). Any disorder that is associated with sudden changes in behavior, mood, or thinking, like a psychotic disorder, ''borderline personality disorder'', or ''multiple personality disorder'"" (MPD), may be particularly challenging to distinguish from bipolar disorder. In order to assess the person's current emotional state, health care professionals perform a mental status examination, as well.""  "
What illnesses coexist with bipolar disorder?,"'In addition to providing treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis, determining the presence of mental illnesses that may co-occur (be co-morbid) with bipolar disorder is important in improving outcomes. For example, people with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of committing suicide, particularly after engaging in previous episodes of cutting or other self-harm. Therefore, mental health care professionals will carefully assess for any warning signs that the person with bipolar disorder is thinking of harming himself or herself or others. Individuals who suffer from this condition, in addition to either alcohol or substance-abuse problems or ''borderline personality disorder'', are also at risk of committing suicide. People with bipolar disorder are at higher risk of having an anxiety disorder like panic disorder, ''phobias'', ''generalized anxiety disorder'', or ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD''). A number of medical problems tend to co-occur with bipolar disorder, including ''pain'' disorders like ''migraine'' ''headaches'', neurological problems like ''multiple sclerosis'', and genetic disorders like velocardiofacial syndrome.' "
What are bipolar disorder medications and other treatments? Are there any home remedies or alternative treatments for bipolar disorder?,"'Many people, whether they suffer from bipolar disorder or any medical or other mental illness, understandably wonder how they might help themselves to have the best outcome of treatment. While there is no cure for bipolar disorder, medications and psychotherapies remain mainstays of treatment of this illness. Also, lifestyle improvements can be important complementary measures to care for this population. For example, ''aerobic exercise'' has been found to help alleviate some of the thinking problems, like memory and ability to pay attention, that are associated with bipolar disorder and other mental health problems. While some home remedies or alternative/''over-the-counter'"" treatments like St. John's wort have been found to help mild depression, they may induce a manic episode. There remains insufficient evidence that such treatments successfully treat manic symptoms. Although alternative medicine treatments for bipolar disorder like St. John's wort or ""'ginkgo'' biloba are not recognized as standard care for bipolar disorder, as many as one-third of some patient groups being treated for this disorder report using them.''In terms of the overall approach to treatment, people with bipolar disorder can expect their mental health professionals to consider several medical interventions in the form of medications, psychotherapies, and lifestyle advice. Treatment of bipolar disorder with medications (psychopharmacology) tends to address two aspects: relieving already existing symptoms of the manic or depressive phases of the illness, and preventing symptoms from returning. Antipsychotic medications that are thought to be particularly effective in treating manic and mixed symptoms include ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify'', Abilify Maintena, Aristrada), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), lurasidone (''Latuda''), and brexpiprazole (Rexulti). Antipsychotic ''drugs'' belong to a group of medications called neuroleptics and are known for having the ability to work quickly (in one to two weeks) compared to many other psychiatric medications. For this group of medications, side effects that occur most often include sleepiness, ''dizziness'', and ''increased appetite''. Weight gain, which may be associated with elevated blood ''sugar'', elevated ''lipid'' levels, and sometimes increased levels of a hormone called ''prolactin'', may also occur. Although older drugs in this class, like ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''), ''thorazine'' (''Chlorpromazine''), and ''thioridazine'' (Mellaril), are more likely to cause muscle ''stiffness'', shakiness, and very rarely uncoordinated muscle twitches (''tardive dyskinesia'') that can be permanent, health care professionals appropriately monitor the people they treat for these potential side effects on a long-term basis, as well. Mood-stabilizer medications like ''lithium'' (''Lithobid''), as well as antiseizure (anticonvulsant) medications like ''divalproex'' (''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'', Tegretol XR, ''Equetro'', ''Carbatrol''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'') can be useful in treating active (acute) symptoms of manic or mixed episodes, as well as preventing the return of such symptoms. These medications may take a bit longer to work compared to the neuroleptic medications, some (for example, lithium, divalproex, and carbamazepine) require monitoring of medication blood levels, and some can be associated with ''birth defects'' when taken by pregnant women.''Antidepressant'' medications are the primary medical treatment for the depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder. Examples of ''antidepressants'' that are commonly prescribed for that purpose include serotonergic (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or SSRI) medications like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix), and vilazodone (Viibryd); there are also combination serotonergic/adrenergic medications (SNRIs) like ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), and levomilnacipran (Fetzima), as well as ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin''), which is a dopaminergic antidepressant. While antidepressant medication remains a mainstay of treatment for the sadness of bipolar disorder, the prescribing physician will remain watchful since there is some risk that antidepressants can induce a manic or near-manic (hypomanic) episode or to the rapid mood-cycling pattern of symptoms.''When using medicines to prevent symptoms of manic or mixed episodes, mood-stabilizer medications like lithium or lamotrigine (Lamictal) are often used. Health care professionals who prescribe lithium monitor blood levels of the medication to be sure it is within a therapeutic, safe range of levels. The functioning of other body systems is frequently followed to quickly address any abnormal changes that may be associated with the medication. When a neuroleptic like olanzapine is used in combination with lithium, symptoms of relapse may be prevented for a longer period of time compared to when lithium is used alone. While lamotrigine tends to cause few side effects, practitioners tend to question the people they treat closely about symptoms of persistent ''fever'', ''rash'', or ''sore throat'' that may be warning signs of a rare but potentially fatal side effect. Depakote is also associated with that rare but potentially dangerous side effect. Medications like ''topiramate'' (''Topamax'') are being researched as a potential treatment for people with bipolar disorder who engage in pedophilia, ''sexual addiction'', or are otherwise considered sexually deviant. While ''oxcarbazepine'' (''Trileptal'') is sometimes used by many in an attempt to manage the mood swings of both adult and pediatric bipolar disorder, its effectiveness remains a matter of debate.''Despite its stigmatized history, ''electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'') can be a viable treatment for people whose bipolar disorder is severe and has inadequately responded to psychotherapies and a number of drug trials. Transmagnetic stimulation (TMS) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mildly resistant depression and is thought to be a helpful addition to medication in the treatment of bipolar disorder in individuals who have not responded to at least one trial of medication. However, it is not yet considered to be an adequate treatment of this illness by itself.''Talk therapy (psychotherapy) is an important part of helping individuals who are living with bipolar disorder achieve the highest level of functioning possible by improving ways of coping with the illness from day to day, as well as on a long-term basis. These interventions are therefore seen by some as being forms of occupational therapy for people with bipolar disorder. Psychotherapy may also engage people with bipolar disorder who prefer to receive treatment without medication. While medications can be quite helpful in alleviating and preventing overt symptoms, they do not address the many complex social and psychological issues that can play a major role in how the person with this disease functions at work, home, and in his or her relationships. Since about 60% of people with bipolar disorder take less than 30% of their medications as prescribed, any supports that can promote compliance with treatment and otherwise promote the health of individuals in this population are valuable.''Psychotherapies that have been found to be effective in treating bipolar disorder include family focused therapy, psycho-education, ''cognitive behavioral therapy'', ''interpersonal therapy'', and social rhythm therapy. Family focused therapy involves education of family members about the disorder and how to provide appropriate support (psycho-education) to their loved one. This intervention also includes communication-enhancement training, and problem-solving skills training for family members. Psycho-education involves teaching the person with bipolar disorder and their family members about the symptoms of full-blown depressive and manic symptoms, as well as warning signs (for example, feeling sad, change in ''sleep'' pattern or appetite, general discontent, change in activity level or increased irritability) that the person is beginning to experience either a mood episode or the triggers for mood episodes (like lack of sleep, use of alcohol or other drugs, exposure to severe stress). In cognitive behavioral therapy, the clinician works to help the person with bipolar disorder identify, challenge, and decrease negative thinking and otherwise dysfunctional belief systems that may impair their functioning relationships and self-esteem. The goal of interpersonal therapy tends to be identifying and managing problems the sufferers of bipolar disorder may have in their relationships with others. Social rhythm therapy encourages stability of sleep-wake cycles, with the goal of preventing or alleviating the sleep disturbances often associated with this disorder.'

How is bipolar disorder treated during pregnancy and the postpartum period?,"""When treating pregnant or postpartum individuals with bipolar disorder, health care professionals take great care to balance the need to maintain the person's stable mood and behavior while minimizing the risks that medications used to treat this disorder may present to the patient, developing fetus, or nursing infant. While many medications that treat bipolar disorder may carry risks to the fetus in ""'pregnancy'' and during ''breastfeeding'', careful monitoring of the amount of medication that is administered as well as the health of the fetus or infant and of the mother can go a long way toward protecting the fetus or infant from any such risks, while maximizing the chance that the fetus or infant will grow in the healthier environment inside or outside the womb afforded by an emotionally healthy mother.' "
What are complications and the prognosis/effects over time of bipolar disorder?,"'While the prognosis for bipolar disorder indicates that individuals with this disorder can expect to experience episodes of some sort of mood problem (like depression, mania, or hypomania) up to 60% of the time, those episodes can be well managed by the combination of psychotherapy and medication treatment. ''Clinical trials'' indicate that people who have a mixed pattern of symptoms can be more difficult to stabilize with treatment and have a more problematic course than those who do not have mixed episodes. Individuals who were misdiagnosed with other mental illnesses, thereby delaying treatment for bipolar disorder, are at risk for a longer, more difficult duration of illness.''There are a number of potential complications of bipolar disorder, particularly if left untreated. This illness may be compounded by other mental health problems including substance abuse and ''addiction'', whether it be to legal substances like alcohol or tobacco, prescription medications like ''amphetamine and dextroamphetamine'' (''Adderall'') or ''hydrocodone/acetaminophen'' (''Vicodin''), or to illicit drugs like ''heroin'' or cocaine. Bipolar disorder sufferers tend to experience thinking (cognitive) problems and those who are repeatedly hospitalized psychiatrically have more trouble functioning throughout life. The risk of committing suicide is 60 times higher for people with bipolar disorder compared to the general population. That may be partly due to the chronic emotional pain that some people with this disorder experience, in that they endure years of depressive and manic symptoms, the consequences of their actions during those disease states, as well as potentially longing for the increased energy and sense of well-being of mania that may be quelled by psychiatric medications.''As with people with other mood disorders, those with bipolar disorder are at higher risk for developing a medical illness and for having a higher number of medical illnesses than people who do not have a mental illness. Bipolar disorder is the fifth leading cause of disability and the ninth leading cause of years lost to death or disability worldwide.' "
Is it possible to prevent bipolar disorder?,"'While far more seems to be known about the ''prevention'' of symptoms of bipolar disorder following its diagnosis, there is emerging research about ways to attempt to decrease the development of the full-blown disease altogether. For example, when family focused therapy is provided to children who have more subtle symptoms preceding bipolar disorder and who have bipolar relatives, they may be less likely to develop the full-blown disorder as adults.'

What is bipolar disorder?,"'Bipolar disorder'' is a serious brain illness. It is also called ''manic''-depressive illness or manic ''depression''. Children with ''bipolar disorder'' go through unusual mood changes. Sometimes they feel very happy or ""up,"" and are much more energetic and active than usual, or than other kids their age. This is called a manic episode. Sometimes children with ''bipolar disorder'' feel very sad and ""down,"" and are much less active than usual. This is called ''depression'' or a depressive episode.''Bipolar disorder is not the same as the normal ups and downs every kid goes through. Bipolar symptoms are more powerful than that. The ''mood swings'' are more extreme and are accompanied by changes in ''sleep'', energy level, and the ability to think clearly. Bipolar symptoms are so strong, they can make it hard for a child to do well in school or get along with friends and family members. The illness can also be dangerous. Some young people with bipolar disorder try to hurt themselves or attempt ''suicide''.''Children and ''teens'' with bipolar disorder should get treatment. With help, they can manage their symptoms and lead successful lives.' "
Who develops bipolar disorder?,"'Anyone can develop bipolar disorder, including children and teens. However, most people with bipolar disorder develop it in their late teen or early adult years. The illness usually lasts a lifetime.' "
Why does someone develop bipolar disorder?,"'Doctors do not know what causes bipolar disorder, but several things may contribute to the illness. Family genes may be one factor because bipolar disorder sometimes runs in families. However, it is important to know that just because someone in your family has bipolar disorder, it does not mean other members of the family will have it as well.''Another factor that may lead to bipolar disorder is the brain structure or the brain function of the person with the disorder. Scientists are finding out more about the disorder by studying it. This research may help doctors do a better job of treating people. Also, this research may help doctors to predict whether a person will get bipolar disorder. One day, doctors may be able to prevent the illness in some people.' "
What are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?,"'Bipolar ""mood episodes"" include unusual mood changes along with unusual ''sleep'' habits, activity levels, thoughts, or behavior. In a child, these mood and activity changes must be very different from their usual behavior and from the behavior of other children. A person with bipolar disorder may have manic episodes, depressive episodes, or ""mixed"" episodes. A mixed episode has both manic and depressive symptoms. These mood episodes cause symptoms that last a week or two or sometimes longer. During an episode, the symptoms last every day for most of the day.''Children and teens having a manic episode may:''Children and teens having a depressive episode may:'  Feel very happy or act silly in a way that's unusual for them and for other people their age Have a very short temper Talk really fast about a lot of different things Have trouble sleeping but not feel tired Have trouble staying focused Talk and think about sex more often Do risky things Feel very sad Complain about pain a lot, such as stomachaches and headaches Sleep too little or too much Feel guilty and worthless Eat too little or too much Have little energy and no interest in fun activities Think about death or suicide"
Can children and teens with bipolar disorder have other problems?,"'Young people with bipolar disorder can have several problems at the same time. These include:''Sometimes behavior problems go along with mood episodes. Young people may take a lot of risks, such as driving too fast or spending too much money. Some young people with bipolar disorder think about suicide. '""Watch for any signs of suicidal thinking. Take these signs seriously and call your child's doctor""'.'  Substance abuse. Both adults and kids with bipolar disorder are at risk of drinking or taking drugs. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children who have both bipolar disorder and ADHD may have trouble staying focused. Anxiety disorders, like separation anxiety."
How is bipolar disorder diagnosed?,"""An experienced doctor will carefully examine your child. There are no blood tests or brain scans that can diagnose bipolar disorder. Instead, the doctor will ask questions about your child's mood and sleeping patterns. The doctor will also ask about your child's energy and behavior. Sometimes doctors need to know about medical problems in your family, such as ""'depression'' or ''alcoholism'"". The doctor may use tests to see if something other than bipolar disorder is causing your child's symptoms."" "
How is bipolar disorder treated?,"'Right now, there is no cure for bipolar disorder. Doctors often treat children who have the illness in much the same way they treat adults. Treatment can help control symptoms. Steady, dependable treatment works better than treatment that starts and stops. Treatment options include:'  Medication. There are several types of medication that can help. Children respond to medications in different ways, so the right type of medication depends on the child. Some children may need more than one type of medication because their symptoms are so complex. Sometimes they need to try different types of medicine to see which are best for them. Children should take the fewest number of medications and the smallest doses possible to help their symptoms. A good way to remember this is ""start low, go slow."" Medications can cause side effects. Always tell your child's doctor about any problems with side effects. Do not stop giving your child medication without a doctor's help. Stopping medication suddenly can be dangerous, and it can make bipolar symptoms worse. Therapy. Different kinds of psychotherapy, or ""talk"" therapy, can help children with bipolar disorder. Therapy can help children change their behavior and manage their routines. It can also help young people get along better with family and friends. Sometimes therapy includes family members."
What can children and teens expect from treatment?,"'With treatment, children and teens with bipolar disorder can get better over time. It helps when doctors, parents, and young people work together.'""Sometimes a child's bipolar disorder changes. When this happens, treatment needs to change too. For example, your child may need to try a different medication. The doctor may also recommend other treatment changes. Symptoms may come back after a while, and more adjustments may be needed. Treatment can take time, but sticking with it helps many children and teens have fewer bipolar symptoms.""""You can help treatment be more effective. Try keeping a chart of your child's ""'moods'', behaviors, and sleep patterns. This is called a ""daily life chart"" or ""mood chart."" It can help you and your child understand and track the illness. A chart can also help the doctor see whether treatment is working.' "
How can I help my child or teen?,"'Help begins with the right diagnosis and treatment. If you think your child may have bipolar disorder, make an appointment with your family doctor to talk about the symptoms you notice.''If your child has bipolar disorder, here are some basic things you can do:' Be patient. Encourage your child to talk, and listen to your child carefully. Be understanding about mood episodes. Help your child have fun. Help your child understand that treatment can make life better."
How does bipolar disorder affect parents and family?,"'Taking care of a child or teenager with bipolar disorder can be stressful for you, too. You have to cope with the ''mood swings'' and other problems, such as short tempers and risky activities. This can challenge any parent. Sometimes the ''stress'' can strain your relationships with other people, and you may miss work or lose free time.''If you are taking care of a child with bipolar disorder, take care of yourself too. Find someone you can talk to about your feelings. Talk with the doctor about support groups for caregivers. If you keep your ''stress'' level down, you will do a better job.

What is bipolar disorder? What is schizophrenia?,"'Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that involves severe mood swings, at least one episode of mania (an exaggerated or heightened mood, see below) and may include repeated episodes of ''depression''. It is a mood disorder that afflicts up to as many as 4 million people. Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, debilitating mental illness that involves psychotic symptoms, meaning that one is out of touch with reality. People with either illness are at a higher risk of ''suicide'', ''substance abuse'', and other mental health problems.' "
What are causes and risk factors for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia?,"'Like most mental disorders, neither bipolar disorder nor schizophrenia is directly passed down genetically. Rather, each is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. These two illnesses share a number of the same risk genes but also have some unique genetic risk factors. ''Stress'' has been found to be a significant contributor to the development of most mental health conditions, including both of these disorders.' "
What are signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder and of schizophrenia?,"'To qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, a person must experience at least one ''manic'' episode. Symptoms of mania include''While a major depressive episode is not required for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, ''depression'' often alternates with manic episodes and tends to occur more often than mania in many people.''Symptoms of schizophrenia may include'  elevated, expansive, or irritable mood; racing thoughts; pressured speech (rapid, excessive, and frenzied speaking); decreased need for sleep; grandiose ideas (for example, false beliefs of superiority or failures); tangential speech (repeatedly changing topics to topics that are hardly related); restlessness/increased goal-directed activity; and impulsivity, poor judgment, or engaging in risky activity (like spending sprees, promiscuity, or excess desire for sex). delusions (beliefs not at all based in reality), hallucinations (seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, or tasting something that is not really there), catatonia, negative symptoms, like not talking (mutism, low motivation, and movement), and disorganized speech or behavior."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose bipolar disorder and schizophrenia?,"""Since there is no one test that determines that someone has bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, health care professionals diagnose these conditions by gathering medical, family, and mental health information. The mental health professional will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor do so, including lab tests to assess the person's general health and whether he or she has mental health symptoms that are due to a physical condition."" "
What are treatments and medications for bipolar disorder and for schizophrenia?,"'People with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia can expect their mental health professionals to consider several interventions, including medications, psychotherapies, and lifestyle advice. Medication treatment of bipolar disorder tends to address relieving already existing symptoms of the illness and preventing symptoms from returning. For schizophrenia, medications have been found to be effective in treating the positive symptoms (for example, delusions or hallucinations).''Antipsychotic medications that treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and the manic and mixed ''symptoms of bipolar disorder'' include ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), ''paliperidone'' (Invega), ''asenapine'' (Saphris), ''iloperidone'' (Fanapt), lurasidone (''Latuda''), and ''brexpiprazole'' (Rexulti). Older medications, like ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''), ''chlorpromazine'' (''Thorazine''), and ''thioridazine'' (Mellaril), are more likely to cause muscular side effects, rarely one that can be permanent.''Mood stabilizers like ''lithium'' (''Lithobid'') and antiseizure (anticonvulsant) medications like ''divalproex'' (''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'', Tegretol XR), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'') treat active manic or mixed symptoms and those symptoms from returning.

Assertive community treatment (ACT) involves members of the treatment team having daily meetings with the schizophrenia sufferer in community settings (for example, at home, work, or otherwise in the community) rather than just in an office or hospital.' "
What is the prognosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia?,"'Bipolar disorder sufferers tend to have mood problems up to 60% of the time but can be helped with psychotherapy and medication.

Facts you should know about birth control,"   Birth control methods can be broadly classified into barrier methods (that prevent sperm cells from reaching the egg), methods that prevent ovulation such as the birth control pill, and methods that allow fertilization of the egg but prevent implantation of the fertilized egg inside the uterus (womb) such as the IUD (intrauterine device). Condoms and diaphragms are examples of barrier birth control methods. Birth control pills are an example of a hormonal birth control method that prevents ovulation. The decision about what kind of birth control option to use is extremely personal, and there is no single choice that is safest or best for all women or couples. A woman should carefully weigh the risks and benefits, along with the effectiveness of each method before choosing a birth control method. A thorough and open discussion with a health care-professional can help in this decision process. Different forms of birth control have different side effects and risk profiles. The choice of birth control method depends on many factors, such as the desire for reversible birth control (preserving future fertility) or permanent birth control methods (surgical sterilization). Some birth control methods, such as barrier methods, may offer some protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), while most methods do not. No method of birth control is 100% effective in preventing STDs. Some birth control methods have higher effectiveness rates than others, but no method of birth control is 100% effective in every case."
"What is birth control, and how does it work?","'Birth control works to prevent ''pregnancy'' in different ways.' Hormonal birth control methods work by preventing ovulation, so that a woman is temporarily infertile. Barrier methods of birth control prevents the man's sperm from reaching an egg. Barrier methods includediaphragms,condoms, andcervical caps. diaphragms, condoms, and cervical caps. Spermicide is a chemical that destroys sperm to prevent them from reaching the egg. Birth control methods such as intrauterine devices work by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus and causing a pregnancy."
How long does it take for birth control to begin working?," Some kinds of birth control start to work with the first use, such as barrier methods. Hormonal methods of birth control such as pills, implants, or the patch may not begin working immediately. Their effectiveness depends upon the time in your monthly cycle when you begin using the contraception. Sometimes it is recommended that women use an alternate method of contraception for the first week after beginning the pill or hormonal contraception."
Can you get pregnant on birth control?,"'There is no form of birth control that is 100% effective, so it is possible to get ''pregnant'' while using most types of birth control. However, many types of birth control, when used correctly, are highly effective in preventing pregnancy. For example, the birth control pill is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy when taken correctly. For all forms of birth control it is important to have a basic understanding how they work and how to use them correctly.' "
What are the different types of birth control available?,"'Types of birth control methods include options that prevent sperm from reaching an egg, known as barrier methods, methods that prevent ovulation, and methods that prevent implantation of a fertilized egg into the uterus. Permanent methods (surgical sterilization) are also available for those who no longer desire to have children.''Types of birth control include:''Hormonal birth control methods include:''Barrier birth control methods include:''Natural birth control methods include the use of:''Other types of birth control options include:''Surgical sterilization methods for birth control include:'

Spermicides may be used in combination with barrier methods for greater effectiveness.''Side effects of barrier methods of birth control can include:''One of the advantages to the use of barrier methods is that they can decrease the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (especially properly used condoms). None of them eliminates this risk.' An increased risk for developing urinary tract infections (UTIs) if using a diaphragm and spermicide. Leaving a diaphragm or cervical cap in for longer than 24 hours increases your risk for toxic shock syndrome. Some people may have allergies to the chemicals used in spermicide creams or other spermicide products. They may develop irritation of the vagina or penis."
Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation or vasectomy) side effects and risks,"'Surgical sterilization is a form of permanent birth control that is available for both women (tubal ligation) and men (vasectomy). Sterilization implants (a small coil is inserted into the fallopian tubes to block them) are a more recent type of permanent birth control that is available for women that allows women to avoid the surgical procedure associated with tubal ligation.''Although women who have had tubal ligation do not have side effects after recovering from the procedure, any surgery itself carries a small risk of infection or bleeding as well as complications from the anesthetic agents.''Likewise, the vasectomy procedure is associated with small risks from the procedure as well as some swelling and ''pain'' in the days following the procedure. For a time period post vasectomy, a man can still be ''fertile'' and it is usually recommended that a barrier method or other birth control method is used for 10-12 weeks or 15 to 20 ejaculations post procedure.' "
Natural birth control methods,"""Natural methods involve tracking a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' to try to determine when ovulation is most likely to occur, and avoiding sexual intercourse (or using barrier contraceptives) during that time. There are different ways to detect ovulation, including the basal body temperature method (ovulation causes a slight increase in basal body temperature) and the use of home ovulation test kits. Checking and recording the consistency of cervical mucus is another way to help determine when ovulation occurs.''These methods tend to be the least successful methods as they require discipline in recording and tracking and understanding of the results.' "
Emergency contraception types and side effects,"'Emergency contraception is a medication or device used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse has occurred. Emergency hormonal contraceptives are sometimes known as ""morning after"" pills. These ''drugs'' prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours after intercourse. This is also known as emergency contraception. Insertion of a copper intrauterine device (IUD) is also an effective method of emergency contraception.''Side effects of emergency contraception or ""morning after"" pills can include' nausea, vomiting, headache, tiredness, dizziness, breast tenderness, and lower abdominal pain."
IUDs (intrauterine devices) side effects,"'IUDs or intrauterine devices are implantable devices that create an environment in the lining tissues of the womb that is unfavorable for implantation of a fertilized egg.''Side effects of IUDs depend on the type of IUD being used.'   Copper-containing IUDs may worsen menstrual bleeding and cramps. Puncture or perforation of the uterus is a rare complication of all IUDs. IUDs that contain hormones may cause similar side effects to hormonal contraceptives, like headaches, breast tenderness, or acne."
Facts you should know about birth control,"   Birth control methods can be broadly classified into barrier methods (that prevent sperm cells from reaching the egg), methods that prevent ovulation such as the birth control pill, and methods that allow fertilization of the egg but prevent implantation of the fertilized egg inside the uterus (womb) such as the IUD (intrauterine device). Condoms and diaphragms are examples of barrier birth control methods. Birth control pills are an example of a hormonal birth control method that prevents ovulation. The decision about what kind of birth control option to use is extremely personal, and there is no single choice that is safest or best for all women or couples. A woman should carefully weigh the risks and benefits, along with the effectiveness of each method before choosing a birth control method. A thorough and open discussion with a health care-professional can help in this decision process. Different forms of birth control have different side effects and risk profiles. The choice of birth control method depends on many factors, such as the desire for reversible birth control (preserving future fertility) or permanent birth control methods (surgical sterilization). Some birth control methods, such as barrier methods, may offer some protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), while most methods do not. No method of birth control is 100% effective in preventing STDs. Some birth control methods have higher effectiveness rates than others, but no method of birth control is 100% effective in every case."
"What is birth control, and how does it work?","'Birth control works to prevent ''pregnancy'' in different ways.' Hormonal birth control methods work by preventing ovulation, so that a woman is temporarily infertile. Barrier methods of birth control prevents the man's sperm from reaching an egg. Barrier methods includediaphragms,condoms, andcervical caps. diaphragms, condoms, and cervical caps. Spermicide is a chemical that destroys sperm to prevent them from reaching the egg. Birth control methods such as intrauterine devices work by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus and causing a pregnancy."
How long does it take for birth control to begin working?," Some kinds of birth control start to work with the first use, such as barrier methods. Hormonal methods of birth control such as pills, implants, or the patch may not begin working immediately. Their effectiveness depends upon the time in your monthly cycle when you begin using the contraception. Sometimes it is recommended that women use an alternate method of contraception for the first week after beginning the pill or hormonal contraception."
Can you get pregnant on birth control?,"'There is no form of birth control that is 100% effective, so it is possible to get ''pregnant'' while using most types of birth control. However, many types of birth control, when used correctly, are highly effective in preventing pregnancy. For example, the birth control pill is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy when taken correctly. For all forms of birth control it is important to have a basic understanding how they work and how to use them correctly.' "
What are the different types of birth control available?,"'Types of birth control methods include options that prevent sperm from reaching an egg, known as barrier methods, methods that prevent ovulation, and methods that prevent implantation of a fertilized egg into the uterus.

Facts you should know about hormonal methods of birth control,"'If a woman is sexually active and she is ''fertile'', meaning that she is physically able to become ''pregnant'', she needs to ask herself, ""Do I want to become pregnant now?"" If her answer is ""No,"" she must use some method of ''birth control'' (''contraception'').''Terminology for ""''birth control''"" includes contraception, ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from a variety of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of birth control available today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.'""In simple terms, all methods of birth control are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'Unfortunately, no birth-control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Types of hormonal methods of contraception,"'There are several different hormonal methods of birth control. The differences among them involve''The hormones can be estrogen and/or ''progesterone'', or preparations that contain a combination of these hormones. These hormones may be taken orally (taken by mouth), implanted into body tissue, injected under the skin, absorbed from a patch on the skin, or placed in the vagina. The mode of delivery determines whether the hormonal exposure is continuous or intermittent.'  the type of hormone, the amount of hormone, and the way the hormone enters a woman's body."
What are advantages and disadvantages of hormonal birth control methods?,"'Advantages of hormonal methods of birth control include that they are all highly effective and their effects are reversible. They do not rely on spontaneity and can be used in advance of sexual activity.''Disadvantages of hormonal methods for birth control include:' The necessity of taking medications continuously The cost of the medications Women must remember to take them regularly or use them exactly as prescribed A doctor’s visit and prescription are required. They do not protect a woman against STDs or sexually transmitted diseases Women must begin using hormonal contraceptives in advance before they become effective. For some women, hormonal preparations are associated with unpleasant side effects or increased health risks."
Oral hormones: The pill,"'The combination pill '""contains the hormones estrogen and progestin, a form of progesterone. When a woman uses the combination pill, the eggs in her ovaries do not mature and she does not ovulate. She doesn't become pregnant because no egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.""'The traditional combination pill comes in 21-day packs or 28-day packs depending on the manufacturer. The 21-pill pack has pills for 21 ""on"" days and no pills for the 7 ""off"" days that follow. The 28-pill pack has active pills for the first 21 ""on"" days and seven inactive (placebo) or reminder pills for the following 7 ""off"" days.''New preparations have been developed that allow for extended or continuous use of combination pills for months at a time. These products allow for a reduction in the number of menstrual periods a woman experiences.''The minipill'' only contains one hormone, progestin. Progestin thickens the cervical ''mucus'', making it more difficult for sperm to pass through the cervix. It also makes the lining of the uterus less receptive to the implantation of a fertilized egg. The progesterone-only pill is sometimes recommended for women who have medical reasons for which they must avoid taking estrogen hormones. (These reasons can include ''liver disease'', certain types of ''blood clots'' in the veins, ''breast cancer'', and ''uterine cancer''.) In addition, it is often recommended in ''nursing'' mothers because it has no adverse effects on ''breastfeeding''. Indeed, extended breastfeeding, as well as delay in the need for formula supplementation has been observed in breastfeeding users of the minipill.''The minipill is taken every day. There are no ""on"" or ""off"" days with the minipill.' "
What are the side effects of the pill?,"'Most side effects from the combination pill or the minipill decrease after two to three months of use. It is important to remember that because most side effects of oral contraceptives decrease in the first two to three months of use, women should try to avoid switching pills prior to an adequate trial. Trying to stick with any given product for two to three months may be necessary to really determine whether or not it will be tolerated over time. Switching too early to another brand may only needlessly subject the woman to the possibility of similar side effects starting all over again with the new pill.''There is no increased risk of ''birth defects'' in ''babies'' born to women who have taken the pill, but a woman should not use either type of pill if she is pregnant.''A woman who is breastfeeding should not use the combination pill because it can reduce the amount of her ''breast milk'' and the concentration of proteins and fat in her breast milk. Additionally, her breast milk will contain traces of the hormones from the pill. However, in contrast to the combination pill, the minipill is routinely used in lactating women.''Women who smoke and take the pill are at increased risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. There is no increased risk of ''heart attack'' or ''stroke'' among healthy nonsmoking women who use the pill.''Blood clots in the legs (''DVT'') and elsewhere are slightly more frequent with low-dose oral contraceptives, but the risk is very low, and lower than the increased risk of clotting that occurs with pregnancy. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives are ''not'' recommended for:''Smokers'' over 35 years of age should not use oral contraceptives, nor should women with a significant ''liver'' disorder.''A woman should contact her healthcare professional immediately if she experiences any of these side effects while taking the pill:' Some women experience temporary symptoms of spotting or light vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, and nausea during the first one to three months of taking the pill. Nausea can be helped if the pill is taken after a meal. While women sometimes fear weight gain with oral contraceptives, studies of the low-dose preparations demonstrate that there is no significant weight gain with oral contraception and no major difference in weight change comparing various contraception products. Negative mood changes, such as depression, and pigmented patches of skin on the face (melasma) may occur with oral-contraceptive use. Because the progesterone in women can cause thinning of the lining of the uterus, some women may experience loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea). Oral contraceptive-induced amenorrhea happens in about 1% of women in the first year of use. As long as the woman is properly taking her pills, amenorrhea is not harmful and it does not signal any loss of effectiveness of the pills. women with clotting tendencies (such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Leiden Factor 5), known coronary heart disease, stroke, unevaluated breast lumps, vaginal bleeding, or breast cancer. severe headache; leg cramps; change in vision, including blurred vision, vision loss, or flashing lights; abdominal pain; chest pain; shortness of breath; coughing up blood; or leg swelling or pain."
How is the pill taken?,"'No matter which type of birth-control pill a woman uses, she should take it every day at the same time in order to establish a routine. The woman needs to minimize the chance she will forget to take the pill, which is not an uncommon occurrence. This is especially critical in the case of the progestin-only pill (minipill). Forgetting to take the minipill, or taking it at varying times of the day, can significantly impair its effectiveness in contraception. This is due to the low dose of the minipill causing its effects to wear off rapidly if the pill is missed.' "
How long will it take before the pill prevents conception?," When a woman begins taking the pill, she may not be protected from pregnancy until she has been taking the pill for 10 consecutive days in a row. If a woman forgets to take a pill after she has started, she may be at risk for getting pregnant. If she only misses one pill, she should take it as soon as she remembers, even if it means taking two pills in the same day. If she misses two pills, she should take both of them as soon as she remembers, plus the pill for that day at her regular time. If she misses three pills, she should discontinue use of the pill for 4 more days to complete one week and then begin taking a new pack of birth control pills, whether she has a menstrual period or not. She must use an alternate form of birth control or abstain from sexual activity during the week that she stops taking her pills. If a woman continually forgets to take her pills, perhaps she should consider a different method of birth control."
What drugs or conditions reduce the effectiveness of the pill?,"'A woman should ask her healthcare professional about these matters and the necessity of using a backup method of birth control if any of these conditions exist.' The pill may partially lose its effectiveness if a woman vomits or has diarrhea for any reason. Some medications, including certain sedatives and some antibiotics such as penicillin and tetracycline, may reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Research in this area is ongoing."
What are the benefits of taking the pill?,"""There are a number of benefits to taking the pill. Both the combination pill and the minipill can regularize a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' and reduce her menstrual flow and ''menstrual cramps''. There is evidence that the pill protects against ''cancer of the ovary'' and uterus as well as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID) and ''iron deficiency anemia''.''The combination pill can reduce:''According to several studies, the combination pill confers no long-term risk of ''breast cancer'' for women at average risk. In addition, a woman who has taken the pill is less likely to develop ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''osteoporosis''.''Users of oral contraceptives have experienced significant decreases in excessive menstrual flow and in occurrence and severity of ''menstrual cramps''.' acne (although maximal acne reduction may take six months to occur), the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, noncancerous breast cysts, and ovarian cysts."
When will I start having periods again after I quit taking the pill?," A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within about 3 months of stopping the oral-contraceptive pill. However, the length of delay before a woman's period returns after stopping the pill varies from woman to woman. Oral contraceptives are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. The pill does not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections."
Injection: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA),"'Depot ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate  (DMPA) is a synthetic long-acting form of the hormone progesterone. DMPA is similar to the birth-control minipill in that it does not contain estrogen. Like other progesterone-based contraceptives, DMPA acts by preventing the release of the egg from the ovary (''ovulation'"") and by promoting thick cervical mucus that impedes the sperm's progress. Its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy is close to 100%.""""DMPA must be injected by a health care professional every three months (12 weeks). It is administered as a deep muscle (intramuscular) injection. A lower-dose formulation of the drug that is injected beneath the skin (subcutaneously) is also available. The injection must be administered within the first 5 days of a woman's menstrual period. She is then protected from pregnancy within 24 hours of receiving the injection.""'A woman may stop having periods altogether after using DMPA for one year. After two years of use, 70% of women will have no menstrual bleeding. Menstrual periods stop because the DMPA causes the ovaries to go into a ""resting"" state. When the ovaries do not release an egg every month, the regular growth of the lining of the uterus does not occur and no uterine lining is shed during the subsequent menstrual cycle.'""A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within six to 18 months after she stops taking the injections. A woman can also become pregnant, usually within 12 to 18 months, once she stops using DMPA. If a new mother does not breastfeed her baby, she can resume the injections right after ""'childbirth''. Mothers who are breastfeeding can safely begin the injections six weeks after ''childbirth''. The injections do not reduce the flow of her breast milk, and no harmful effects on the baby have been noted.''The most common side effects of DMPA injections are irregular menstrual cycles, cessation of menstrual periods, and weight gain. Other side effects may include nervousness, ''dizziness'', stomach discomfort, ''headaches'', ''fatigue'', or breast tenderness. It is important that a woman realize that once she has been injected with DMPA, any side effects she may experience cannot be neutralized or eliminated. She has to tolerate these side effects until the medication wears off, typically three months later.''DMPA has also been shown to have a negative effect on ''bone mineral density'', especially with longer-term use; however, studies have shown that her previous ''bone density'' is usually restored when the drug is discontinued.''Women may be able to use DMPA when avoidance of estrogen is prudent for medical reasons (see oral contraceptives). A qualified health care provider should be able to help make the proper distinction. DMPA should not be used by women who have a history of breast ''cancer'', blood clots, ''liver disease'', unexplained vaginal bleeding, or ''stroke''. A woman on DMPA should contact her health care professional if she experiences a heavy menstrual flow, severe ''abdominal pain'', ''headaches'', or ''depression''.'""DMPA injections are over 99% effective if the injections are received according to the correct schedule. A woman using injection contraceptives has the advantage of being capable of becoming pregnant at a later time, if desired, simply by discontinuing use. DMPA does not increase a woman's risk of ""'cancer'', including breast ''cancer'', and greatly reduces her risk of developing uterine cancer.''Injectable hormonal contraceptives do not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive patch: Ortho-Evra,"'An adhesive patch has been developed that provides hormonal contraception through the skin, which is known as a transdermal (through the skin) delivery system. The patch is about the size of a half-dollar and can be worn on the arm, abdomen, or buttocks. A woman wears the patch for a week and then replaces it with a new patch.''These patches are called Ortho-Evra (ethinyl ''estradiol''/norelgestromin patch-topical), and are similar to the pill in that they contain both estrogen and progesterone. Ortho-Evra should be just as effective in preventing pregnancy as the pill. Ortho-Evra is similar to the pill in that it suppresses ovulation and has the advantage of improved compliance and convenience due to weekly administration. A woman only needs to remember to replace the patch once a week instead of being required to remember taking a pill every day. However, some studies have shown that the contraceptive patch may be associated with a greater risk of negative side effects, such as blood-clotting problems, than oral contraceptive pills.''Women who have medical reasons why oral contraceptives are not recommended (such as already having an underlying tendency toward blood clotting) may find that their prescribing physician also recommends against Ortho-Evra because of the similarity in the hormone ingredients of both types of contraceptives.'""It is important to ensure that the patch makes good contact with the skin. The patch could be a problem for those women who perspire heavily, swim, and/or take frequent showers because moisture can interfere with the patch's contact with the skin. Some women may also experience skin irritation at the site of the patch. Furthermore, contraceptive failure may be a risk in heavier women (those who weigh over 198 pounds, or 90 kilograms).""'As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, the patch will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive implants,"'A contraceptive implant known as Implanon is available in the U.S. Implanon provides contraception by the slow release of the progestin etonogestrel over a period of three years. Implanon is a thin rod that is inserted in the upper arm under local anesthesia. Protection from pregnancy occurs within 24 hours of insertion of the rod, and the failure rate is comparable with surgical sterilization (tubal ligations). One advantage of the Implanon rod is that fertility rapidly returns after removal of the rod.''A two-rod implant containing the progestin ''levonorgestrel'' (Jadelle) was approved by the FDA for 5 years of use, although it has not been marketed in the United States. Similarly, the Sino-Implant II contraceptive implant is similar to Jadelle, but is designed to remain in place for 4 years.''Preliminary studies of the product showed that it was generally well tolerated and effective in preventing pregnancy. However, these studies showed that irregular bleeding is a possible side effect of the product.''As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, Implanon will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Vaginal ring: NuvaRing,"'A ring-shaped device that contains the hormones estradiol and etonogestrel (a progestin) can be placed in the vagina. It remains in place for three weeks continuously, then it is removed for one week to allow for a menstrual period. It continuously releases low levels of the hormone into the bloodstream for the entire three weeks.'' There is currently one brand available in the U.S., ''NuvaRing'' (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol-vaginal ring). It is about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy, having the same high effectiveness as the other hormonal methods of contraception. The incidence of hormone-related side effects is similar to those seen with other hormonal contraceptive methods such as the pill and the patch. ''Vaginal discharge'' can sometimes occur as a side effect of the ring preparation.''NuvaRing does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
How effective are hormonal birth control methods?,"'Hormonal methods of birth control are some of the most effective forms of birth control available. When used properly, their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy can approach 99%-100%. With typical use of ''birth control pills'', effectiveness is estimated to be about 95%. With any form of hormonal contraception, precisely following instructions for proper use will increase its effectiveness.' "
Facts you should know about the birth control pill vs. Depo-Provera,"   The choice of what birth control method is highly personal and depends upon many factors. It is important to consider your age, overall health status, and how long you would like the birth control method to last. It also is important to look at how well each method works (its effectiveness) in preventing pregnancy, how easy each method is for you to use, and any side effects or drug interactions it may cause. The birth control pill (""the pill"", oral contraceptives) and the Depo-Provera hormone injection (""shot"") are just two of the many choices a woman has to prevent pregnancy. This article compares birth control pills (known as oral contraceptives) with the birth control shot (Depo-Provera injection). Women who have been using the shot may also have some delay in their ability to get pregnant after stopping it, for up to about 10 months in contrast to about 6 months for birth control pills."
What is the effectiveness of the birth control vs. Depo-Provera?," Both the pill and the shot are very effective methods of birth control. When combination birth control pills are taken correctly, they are up to 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. Progestin-only pills are about 95% effective. The birth control shot (Depo-Provera) also is about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy (average annual failure rate is about 3%)."
Do birth control pills or Depo-Provera cause weight gain?,"'Yes, women have reported ''weight gain'' while taking oral contraceptives and using the Depo-''Provera'' shot.' "
What are the differences and similarities between how birth control pills and Depo-Provera work?,"'Birth control pills and the birth control Depo-Provera shot are both ''hormonal methods of birth control''. This means that they work by changing hormone levels in your body, preventing pregnancy from occurring. The hormones in birth control pills prevent release of an egg, or ''ovulation''.''Birth control pills are available as combination pills, containing the hormones estrogen and progestin, or as mini-pills containing progestin only.' Both typically come in packs of 28 pills, and you take one pill daily. With combination pills, the last 7 pills in the pack do not contain hormones, and while you are taking these non-hormone pills, your menstrual period occurs. The menstrual period also occurs during the last 7 days of the progestin-only pill packs. Some newer types of birth control pills are taken continuously for a few months without the inactive pills, before a menstrual period occurs. The pill also works to make the cervix (opening to the womb or uterus) and the uterus itself unfavorable for a pregnancy to begin. The birth control shot is known as Depo-Provera (and the newer low-dose Depo-SubQ Provera 104). The Depo-Provera shot contains the hormone progestin and prevents pregnancy for three months in a row. Like the hormones in birth control pills, the progestin in the shot make the environment in the uterus unfavorable to begin a pregnancy and may stop ovulation."
What are side effects of the pill and Depo-Provera?,   Nausea Vomiting Mood changes So called “breakthrough” bleeding or spotting at times other than the menstrual period. The side effects of the pill tend to get better after you have been using it a few months. Acne Depression Irregular periods Weakness Fatigue Both methods can cause tenderness or soreness of the breasts. Other side effects of oral contraceptives and the Depo-Provera shot include headaches and mood changes. Both methods can lead to a decreased interest in sex (decreased libido) in some women.
What are the risks of the birth control pill and Depo-Provera?,"'Both the pill and the shot do not offer any protection against sexually-transmitted diseases (''STDs''). Missing pills or taking longer than 12 weeks to get another shot increases the chances of ''becoming pregnant''.''Other health risks of oral contraceptives''Other health risks of the Depo-Provera shot'  Combination birth control pills have been linked to a small increase in the risk of heart attack. However, this is a very rare event in young women. Birth control pills that contain estrogen increase the risk of blood clots, and some types of pills may increase the risk of stroke. Because of these risks, it is recommended that women over age 35 who smoke cigarettes, hookahs, etc. (tobacco) not use birth control pills. Birth control pills appear to increase the risk of cervical cancer, but decrease the risk of ovarian and endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer. Data about their effect on breast cancer risk are not clear. Women with migraine headache also appear to have an increased risk of blood clots when taking the pill, particularly women over age 35. The birth control shot also may reduce bone density, perhaps raising the risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life. Many experts also recommend that women with a history of blood clots or risk factors for cardiovascular disease not use the birth control shot."
What are other birth control options?,"'There are many different kinds and choices of birth control to prevent from ''becoming pregnant'', for example, hormonal, for methods like birth control pills, and the birth control shot. Other ''birth control methods'' include:' Barrier methods like the cervical cap, spermicides, and the diaphragm for women or condoms for men.

Facts you should know about hormonal methods of birth control,"'If a woman is sexually active and she is ''fertile'', meaning that she is physically able to become ''pregnant'', she needs to ask herself, ""Do I want to become pregnant now?"" If her answer is ""No,"" she must use some method of ''birth control'' (''contraception'').''Terminology for ""''birth control''"" includes contraception, ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from a variety of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of birth control available today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.'""In simple terms, all methods of birth control are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'Unfortunately, no birth-control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Types of hormonal methods of contraception,"'There are several different hormonal methods of birth control. The differences among them involve''The hormones can be estrogen and/or ''progesterone'', or preparations that contain a combination of these hormones. These hormones may be taken orally (taken by mouth), implanted into body tissue, injected under the skin, absorbed from a patch on the skin, or placed in the vagina. The mode of delivery determines whether the hormonal exposure is continuous or intermittent.'  the type of hormone, the amount of hormone, and the way the hormone enters a woman's body."
What are advantages and disadvantages of hormonal birth control methods?,"'Advantages of hormonal methods of birth control include that they are all highly effective and their effects are reversible. They do not rely on spontaneity and can be used in advance of sexual activity.''Disadvantages of hormonal methods for birth control include:' The necessity of taking medications continuously The cost of the medications Women must remember to take them regularly or use them exactly as prescribed A doctor’s visit and prescription are required. They do not protect a woman against STDs or sexually transmitted diseases Women must begin using hormonal contraceptives in advance before they become effective. For some women, hormonal preparations are associated with unpleasant side effects or increased health risks."
Oral hormones: The pill,"'The combination pill '""contains the hormones estrogen and progestin, a form of progesterone. When a woman uses the combination pill, the eggs in her ovaries do not mature and she does not ovulate. She doesn't become pregnant because no egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.""'The traditional combination pill comes in 21-day packs or 28-day packs depending on the manufacturer. The 21-pill pack has pills for 21 ""on"" days and no pills for the 7 ""off"" days that follow. The 28-pill pack has active pills for the first 21 ""on"" days and seven inactive (placebo) or reminder pills for the following 7 ""off"" days.''New preparations have been developed that allow for extended or continuous use of combination pills for months at a time. These products allow for a reduction in the number of menstrual periods a woman experiences.''The minipill'' only contains one hormone, progestin. Progestin thickens the cervical ''mucus'', making it more difficult for sperm to pass through the cervix. It also makes the lining of the uterus less receptive to the implantation of a fertilized egg. The progesterone-only pill is sometimes recommended for women who have medical reasons for which they must avoid taking estrogen hormones. (These reasons can include ''liver disease'', certain types of ''blood clots'' in the veins, ''breast cancer'', and ''uterine cancer''.) In addition, it is often recommended in ''nursing'' mothers because it has no adverse effects on ''breastfeeding''. Indeed, extended breastfeeding, as well as delay in the need for formula supplementation has been observed in breastfeeding users of the minipill.''The minipill is taken every day. There are no ""on"" or ""off"" days with the minipill.' "
What are the side effects of the pill?,"'Most side effects from the combination pill or the minipill decrease after two to three months of use. It is important to remember that because most side effects of oral contraceptives decrease in the first two to three months of use, women should try to avoid switching pills prior to an adequate trial. Trying to stick with any given product for two to three months may be necessary to really determine whether or not it will be tolerated over time. Switching too early to another brand may only needlessly subject the woman to the possibility of similar side effects starting all over again with the new pill.''There is no increased risk of ''birth defects'' in ''babies'' born to women who have taken the pill, but a woman should not use either type of pill if she is pregnant.''A woman who is breastfeeding should not use the combination pill because it can reduce the amount of her ''breast milk'' and the concentration of proteins and fat in her breast milk. Additionally, her breast milk will contain traces of the hormones from the pill. However, in contrast to the combination pill, the minipill is routinely used in lactating women.''Women who smoke and take the pill are at increased risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. There is no increased risk of ''heart attack'' or ''stroke'' among healthy nonsmoking women who use the pill.''Blood clots in the legs (''DVT'') and elsewhere are slightly more frequent with low-dose oral contraceptives, but the risk is very low, and lower than the increased risk of clotting that occurs with pregnancy. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives are ''not'' recommended for:''Smokers'' over 35 years of age should not use oral contraceptives, nor should women with a significant ''liver'' disorder.''A woman should contact her healthcare professional immediately if she experiences any of these side effects while taking the pill:' Some women experience temporary symptoms of spotting or light vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, and nausea during the first one to three months of taking the pill. Nausea can be helped if the pill is taken after a meal. While women sometimes fear weight gain with oral contraceptives, studies of the low-dose preparations demonstrate that there is no significant weight gain with oral contraception and no major difference in weight change comparing various contraception products. Negative mood changes, such as depression, and pigmented patches of skin on the face (melasma) may occur with oral-contraceptive use. Because the progesterone in women can cause thinning of the lining of the uterus, some women may experience loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea). Oral contraceptive-induced amenorrhea happens in about 1% of women in the first year of use. As long as the woman is properly taking her pills, amenorrhea is not harmful and it does not signal any loss of effectiveness of the pills. women with clotting tendencies (such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Leiden Factor 5), known coronary heart disease, stroke, unevaluated breast lumps, vaginal bleeding, or breast cancer. severe headache; leg cramps; change in vision, including blurred vision, vision loss, or flashing lights; abdominal pain; chest pain; shortness of breath; coughing up blood; or leg swelling or pain."
How is the pill taken?,"'No matter which type of birth-control pill a woman uses, she should take it every day at the same time in order to establish a routine. The woman needs to minimize the chance she will forget to take the pill, which is not an uncommon occurrence. This is especially critical in the case of the progestin-only pill (minipill). Forgetting to take the minipill, or taking it at varying times of the day, can significantly impair its effectiveness in contraception. This is due to the low dose of the minipill causing its effects to wear off rapidly if the pill is missed.' "
How long will it take before the pill prevents conception?," When a woman begins taking the pill, she may not be protected from pregnancy until she has been taking the pill for 10 consecutive days in a row. If a woman forgets to take a pill after she has started, she may be at risk for getting pregnant. If she only misses one pill, she should take it as soon as she remembers, even if it means taking two pills in the same day. If she misses two pills, she should take both of them as soon as she remembers, plus the pill for that day at her regular time. If she misses three pills, she should discontinue use of the pill for 4 more days to complete one week and then begin taking a new pack of birth control pills, whether she has a menstrual period or not. She must use an alternate form of birth control or abstain from sexual activity during the week that she stops taking her pills. If a woman continually forgets to take her pills, perhaps she should consider a different method of birth control."
What drugs or conditions reduce the effectiveness of the pill?,"'A woman should ask her healthcare professional about these matters and the necessity of using a backup method of birth control if any of these conditions exist.' The pill may partially lose its effectiveness if a woman vomits or has diarrhea for any reason. Some medications, including certain sedatives and some antibiotics such as penicillin and tetracycline, may reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Research in this area is ongoing."
What are the benefits of taking the pill?,"""There are a number of benefits to taking the pill. Both the combination pill and the minipill can regularize a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' and reduce her menstrual flow and ''menstrual cramps''. There is evidence that the pill protects against ''cancer of the ovary'' and uterus as well as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID) and ''iron deficiency anemia''.''The combination pill can reduce:''According to several studies, the combination pill confers no long-term risk of ''breast cancer'' for women at average risk. In addition, a woman who has taken the pill is less likely to develop ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''osteoporosis''.''Users of oral contraceptives have experienced significant decreases in excessive menstrual flow and in occurrence and severity of ''menstrual cramps''.' acne (although maximal acne reduction may take six months to occur), the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, noncancerous breast cysts, and ovarian cysts."
When will I start having periods again after I quit taking the pill?," A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within about 3 months of stopping the oral-contraceptive pill. However, the length of delay before a woman's period returns after stopping the pill varies from woman to woman. Oral contraceptives are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. The pill does not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections."
Injection: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA),"'Depot ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate  (DMPA) is a synthetic long-acting form of the hormone progesterone. DMPA is similar to the birth-control minipill in that it does not contain estrogen. Like other progesterone-based contraceptives, DMPA acts by preventing the release of the egg from the ovary (''ovulation'"") and by promoting thick cervical mucus that impedes the sperm's progress. Its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy is close to 100%.""""DMPA must be injected by a health care professional every three months (12 weeks). It is administered as a deep muscle (intramuscular) injection. A lower-dose formulation of the drug that is injected beneath the skin (subcutaneously) is also available. The injection must be administered within the first 5 days of a woman's menstrual period. She is then protected from pregnancy within 24 hours of receiving the injection.""'A woman may stop having periods altogether after using DMPA for one year. After two years of use, 70% of women will have no menstrual bleeding. Menstrual periods stop because the DMPA causes the ovaries to go into a ""resting"" state. When the ovaries do not release an egg every month, the regular growth of the lining of the uterus does not occur and no uterine lining is shed during the subsequent menstrual cycle.'""A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within six to 18 months after she stops taking the injections. A woman can also become pregnant, usually within 12 to 18 months, once she stops using DMPA. If a new mother does not breastfeed her baby, she can resume the injections right after ""'childbirth''. Mothers who are breastfeeding can safely begin the injections six weeks after ''childbirth''. The injections do not reduce the flow of her breast milk, and no harmful effects on the baby have been noted.''The most common side effects of DMPA injections are irregular menstrual cycles, cessation of menstrual periods, and weight gain. Other side effects may include nervousness, ''dizziness'', stomach discomfort, ''headaches'', ''fatigue'', or breast tenderness. It is important that a woman realize that once she has been injected with DMPA, any side effects she may experience cannot be neutralized or eliminated. She has to tolerate these side effects until the medication wears off, typically three months later.''DMPA has also been shown to have a negative effect on ''bone mineral density'', especially with longer-term use; however, studies have shown that her previous ''bone density'' is usually restored when the drug is discontinued.''Women may be able to use DMPA when avoidance of estrogen is prudent for medical reasons (see oral contraceptives). A qualified health care provider should be able to help make the proper distinction. DMPA should not be used by women who have a history of breast ''cancer'', blood clots, ''liver disease'', unexplained vaginal bleeding, or ''stroke''. A woman on DMPA should contact her health care professional if she experiences a heavy menstrual flow, severe ''abdominal pain'', ''headaches'', or ''depression''.'""DMPA injections are over 99% effective if the injections are received according to the correct schedule. A woman using injection contraceptives has the advantage of being capable of becoming pregnant at a later time, if desired, simply by discontinuing use. DMPA does not increase a woman's risk of ""'cancer'', including breast ''cancer'', and greatly reduces her risk of developing uterine cancer.''Injectable hormonal contraceptives do not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive patch: Ortho-Evra,"'An adhesive patch has been developed that provides hormonal contraception through the skin, which is known as a transdermal (through the skin) delivery system. The patch is about the size of a half-dollar and can be worn on the arm, abdomen, or buttocks. A woman wears the patch for a week and then replaces it with a new patch.''These patches are called Ortho-Evra (ethinyl ''estradiol''/norelgestromin patch-topical), and are similar to the pill in that they contain both estrogen and progesterone. Ortho-Evra should be just as effective in preventing pregnancy as the pill. Ortho-Evra is similar to the pill in that it suppresses ovulation and has the advantage of improved compliance and convenience due to weekly administration. A woman only needs to remember to replace the patch once a week instead of being required to remember taking a pill every day. However, some studies have shown that the contraceptive patch may be associated with a greater risk of negative side effects, such as blood-clotting problems, than oral contraceptive pills.''Women who have medical reasons why oral contraceptives are not recommended (such as already having an underlying tendency toward blood clotting) may find that their prescribing physician also recommends against Ortho-Evra because of the similarity in the hormone ingredients of both types of contraceptives.'""It is important to ensure that the patch makes good contact with the skin. The patch could be a problem for those women who perspire heavily, swim, and/or take frequent showers because moisture can interfere with the patch's contact with the skin. Some women may also experience skin irritation at the site of the patch. Furthermore, contraceptive failure may be a risk in heavier women (those who weigh over 198 pounds, or 90 kilograms).""'As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, the patch will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive implants,"'A contraceptive implant known as Implanon is available in the U.S. Implanon provides contraception by the slow release of the progestin etonogestrel over a period of three years. Implanon is a thin rod that is inserted in the upper arm under local anesthesia. Protection from pregnancy occurs within 24 hours of insertion of the rod, and the failure rate is comparable with surgical sterilization (tubal ligations). One advantage of the Implanon rod is that fertility rapidly returns after removal of the rod.''A two-rod implant containing the progestin ''levonorgestrel'' (Jadelle) was approved by the FDA for 5 years of use, although it has not been marketed in the United States. Similarly, the Sino-Implant II contraceptive implant is similar to Jadelle, but is designed to remain in place for 4 years.''Preliminary studies of the product showed that it was generally well tolerated and effective in preventing pregnancy. However, these studies showed that irregular bleeding is a possible side effect of the product.''As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, Implanon will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Vaginal ring: NuvaRing,"'A ring-shaped device that contains the hormones estradiol and etonogestrel (a progestin) can be placed in the vagina. It remains in place for three weeks continuously, then it is removed for one week to allow for a menstrual period. It continuously releases low levels of the hormone into the bloodstream for the entire three weeks.'' There is currently one brand available in the U.S., ''NuvaRing'' (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol-vaginal ring). It is about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy, having the same high effectiveness as the other hormonal methods of contraception. The incidence of hormone-related side effects is similar to those seen with other hormonal contraceptive methods such as the pill and the patch. ''Vaginal discharge'' can sometimes occur as a side effect of the ring preparation.''NuvaRing does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
How effective are hormonal birth control methods?,"'Hormonal methods of birth control are some of the most effective forms of birth control available. When used properly, their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy can approach 99%-100%. With typical use of ''birth control pills'', effectiveness is estimated to be about 95%. With any form of hormonal contraception, precisely following instructions for proper use will increase its effectiveness.' "
What are birth defects?,"'Birth defects are structural or functional abnormalities present at birth that cause physical or mental disability. Some may be fatal. ''Researchers have identified thousands of different birth defects. Currently, birth defects are the leading cause of death for infants during the first year of life. ' "
What causes birth defects?,"'Birth defects have a variety of causes, such as: '""Genetic problems caused when one or more genes doesn't work properly or part of a gene is missing ""'Problems with chromosomes, such as having an extra chromosome or missing part of a chromosome ''Environmental factors that a woman is exposed to during ''pregnancy'', such as ''rubella'' or ''German measles'' while ''pregnant'', or using ''drugs'' or ''alcohol'' during pregnancy.' "
What are the different types of birth defects?,"'There are two main types of birth defects: structural and functional/developmental. ''Structural birth defects are related to a problem with body parts. Some physical problems include cleft lip or cleft palate, heart defects, such as missing or misshaped valves, and abnormal limbs, such as a club foot. They also include neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, problems that are related to the growth and development of the brain and spinal cord. ''Functional birth defects are related to a problem with how a body part or body system works. These problems often lead to developmental disabilities and can include things such as: ''Nervous system or brain problems'' - such as ''learning disabilities'', mental retardation, behavioral disorders, speech or language difficulties, convulsions, and movement trouble. Some examples of birth defects that affect the nervous system include ''Autism'', ''Down syndrome'', ''Prader-Willi syndrome'', and ''Fragile X syndrome''. ''Sensory problems'' - such as ''blindness'', ''cataracts'' and other visual problems, and varying degrees of ''hearing loss'' including deafness ''Metabolic disorders'"" - involve a body process or chemical pathway or reaction, such as conditions that limit the body's ability to get rid of waste materials or harmful chemicals. Two common metabolic disorders are ""'phenylketonuria'' (PKU) and ''hypothyroidism''. ''Degenerative disorders'""--are conditions that might not be obvious at birth, but cause one or more aspects of health to steadily get worse. For example, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), which was the focus of the movie Lorenzo's Oil, Rett syndrome, muscular dystrophy, and lysosomal disorders are examples of degenerative disorders. ""'In some cases, birth defects are caused by a combination of factors. Some recognized patterns of birth defects affect many parts or processes in the body, leading to both structural and functional problems. '  "
What are the treatments for birth defects?,'Treatments for birth defects vary by disorder. Talk to your health care provider for more information about treatments for birth defects.' 
Introduction to parenting and birthing classes,"""First-time mothers-to-be often have lots of questions and even some worries: How will I know I'm in ""'labor''? Will it hurt? Will my baby know how to breastfeed? How do I care for a ''newborn''? Classes to prepare you for ''childbirth'', ''breastfeeding'', infant care, and ''parenting'' are great ways to lessen ''anxiety'' and build confidence. In some cities, classes might be offered in different languages. ' "
Birthing Classes,"'Birthing classes often are offered through local hospitals and birthing centers. Some classes follow a specific method, such as ''Lamaze'' or the Bradley method. Others review ''labor'' techniques from a variety of methods. You might want to read about the different methods beforehand to see if one appeals more to you than others. That way, you will know what to sign up for if more than one type of birthing class if offered. Try to sign up for a class several months before your due date. Classes sometimes fill up quickly. Also, make sure the instructor is qualified.''You should discuss with your healthcare professional in advance of delivery about yor preferred birth method and plan.''Most women attend the class with the person who will provide support during ''labor'', such as a spouse, family member, or good friend. This person is sometimes called the ''labor'' coach. During class, the instructor will go over the signs of labor and review the stages of labor. She will talk about positioning for labor and birth, and ways to control ''pain''. She also will give you strategies to work through labor pains and to help you stay relaxed and in control. You will practice many of these strategies in class, so you are ready when the big day arrives. Many classes also provide a tour of the birthing facility.' "
Breastfeeding classes,"'Like any new skill, breastfeeding takes knowledge and practice to be successful. ''Pregnant'"" women who learn about how to breastfeed are more likely to be successful than those who do not. Breastfeeding classes offer pregnant women and their partners the chance to prepare and ask questions before the baby's arrival. Classes may be offered through hospitals, breastfeeding support programs, La Leche League, or local lactation consultants. Ask your doctor for help finding a breastfeeding class in your area."" "
Parenting Classes,"'Many first-time parents have never cared for a newborn. Hospitals, community education centers, and places of worship sometimes offer baby care classes. These classes cover the basics, such as diapering, feeding, and bathing your newborn. The American Red Cross offers such courses as ""Family ''First Aid''"" and ""CPR Online - Pediatric.""''You also will learn these basic skills in the hospital before you are discharged.'""In some communities parenting classes are available. Children don't come with how-to manuals. So some parents appreciate learning about the different stages of child development, as well as practical skills for dealing with common issues, such as discipline or parent-child power struggles. Counselors and social workers often teach this type of class. If you are interested in parenting programs, ask your child's doctor for help finding a class in your area.""'Did you know?'' Some hospitals and birthing centers offer sibling classes for soon-to-be brothers and sisters. These classes often help small children get ready for a new baby using fun games and activities. ' "
What is a birthmark?,"""Any mark, spot, or bump that is present in or around the time of birth on the skin of an infant is a birthmark. Mothers are fond of giving these rather romantic names such as angel's kisses, stork bites, or ""'beauty'' marks. Most of these lesions are not particularly esthetically desirable.' "
What are the different types of birthmarks?,"'Birthmarks can be categorized according to their composition. Marks as a result of excessive accumulations of ''melanin'' are called pigmented birthmarks, since the great majority of them are brown to black. Other birthmarks appear lighter than the rest of the skin due to a relative lack of melanin.''Some birthmarks are composed of blood vessels and are called vascular birthmarks. They are generally red, blue, or purple. Other birthmarks are composed of lymphatic tissue (cystic hygroma), breast tissue, and epidermal tissue, which are often yellow to flesh-colored.'  "
What is a Mongolian birthmark?,"'Pigmented birthmarks can be flat or elevated. They may simply be due to excessive deposition of melanin pigment in the deeper layers of the skin called dermal melanosis. This is particularly common in more heavily pigmented infants and is commonly called a Mongolian birthmark or spot. More frequently, there are accumulations of melanin produced by and contained in pigment cells called melanocytes. The medical term for such a concentration of melanin-producing cells is a ''nevus''. These ''nevi'"" are generally small, no larger than ¼ inch diameter, however, they can be quite large, covering a significant portion the infant's skin."" "
What are the characteristics of vascular birthmarks?,"'The color of vascular birthmarks ranges from light pink to dark purple, and they can be either flat or elevated. Their size is quite variable, as well. Certain types of vascular birthmarks can evolve and change after birth.' "
What is a strawberry birthmark?,"'A ''hemangioma'' is a type of vascular birthmark that is also called a strawberry mark,\xa0nevus vascularis, capillary hemangioma, or hemangioma simplex. A strawberry birthmark can appear on any part of the body. The most common areas of the body where you will find a hemangioma include the\xa0face, ''scalp'', back, or chest.''The red color of the strawberry birthmark comes from the closely packed blood vessels where it is found. It is painless and the actual cause is not known.\xa0'""A strawberry mark will typically appear at birth and may grow quickly. Oftentimes it will disappear from the child's skin by age 9."" "
What causes birthmarks?,"'Most birthmarks are probably due to defective migration of cells during fetal development. Once these cells start to multiply, they produce tissue with the characteristics of their cell type though they are not where those cells typically are located.' "
Are any symptoms and signs associated with birthmarks?,"'Pigmented birthmarks, aside from their coloration, cause no symptoms. Vascular birthmarks of certain types can produce significant symptoms. The identification of the type of vascular birthmarks may be difficult and require certain advanced imaging techniques as well pathological examination of samples of the birthmark. Certain vascular birthmarks called hemangiomas can begin as flat lesions at birth but enlarge rapidly during the first few months of life. They may ulcerate and disappear slowly, leaving only a ''scar''. If this type of lesion is situated adjacent to an important anatomical structure like an eye or mouth, it may need to be treated to hasten the natural resolution.' "
What disorders are associated with birthmarks?,"'There are a number of rare serious disorders that are associated with both pigmented (café au lait mark, for example) and vascular birthmarks. It would be appropriate that any infant with a birthmark is examined by a pediatrician to detect any of these uncommon conditions. Some of these disorders can be ''inherited'', so affected families need to be educated as to their significance.' "
Can skin damage during delivery produce a birthmark?,'It is possible for birth ''trauma'' to produce sufficient damage to leave a scar. This scarring could be interpreted as a birthmark.' 
How do I remove birthmarks?,"'It is now possible to treat many kinds of both pigmented and vascular birthmarks. The approach depends on the type of tissue involved and the risks versus the benefits of treatment. The pediatrician is an excellent source of information as to potential treatment options.''Birthmark removal\xa0depends on the nature of the tissue involved. Medical treatment can hasten the resolution of certain kinds of vascular birthmarks. Generally, measures that destroy the involved cells of the birthmark are required for both pigmented or vascular birthmarks. Either scalpel surgery, lasers, and rarely\xa0''radiation''\xa0can be helpful.' "
Does insurance cover the cost of birthmark removal?,"'As with all such questions about insurance coverage, each company may be different. Most birthmarks that are small and not visually unpleasant are unlikely to require treatment and are rarely covered. Any birthmark that is likely to impair either the physical or ''mental health'' of the child is much more likely to be covered.' "
What is the prognosis of birthmarks?,"'A few small pigmented birthmarks are quite common and do not need to be treated. This is also true for vascular birthmarks. Smaller hemangiomas will disappear spontaneously, leaving a small insignificant scar depending on the sites involved. Dermal melanosis eventually fades.' "
What do chiggers look like (pictures)? Can you see them?,"'Chiggers are barely visible to the naked eye (their length is less than 1/150th of an inch). A magnifying glass may be needed to see them. They are red in color and may be best appreciated when clustered in groups on the skin. The juvenile forms have six legs, although the (harmless) adult mites have eight legs.' "
How do chiggers burrow under the skin?,"'Chigger mites infest human skin via areas of contact with vegetation, such as pant cuffs or shirtsleeves and collars. They migrate on the skin in search of an optimal feeding area. A common myth about chiggers is that they burrow into and remain inside the skin. This is not true. Chiggers insert their feeding structures into the skin and inject enzymes that cause destruction of host tissue. Hardening of the surrounding skin results in the formation of a feeding tube called a stylostome. Chigger larvae then feed upon the destroyed tissue. If they are not disturbed (which is rarely the case because they cause substantial itching) they may feed through the stylostome for a few days.'""The chigger's mouth and feeding structures are delicate and are best able to penetrate the skin at areas of ""'wrinkles'', folds, or other areas of skin that are thin. Most bites occur around the ankles, the crotch and groin areas, behind the knees, and in the armpits. Barriers to migration on the skin such as belts may be one reason that chigger bites also commonly occur at the waist or at other areas where their migration is prevented by compression from clothing. The location of chigger bites contrasts with that of mosquito bites, which are usually in exposed areas of skin where mosquitoes can land.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of chigger bites?,"'A chigger bite itself is not noticeable. After the chigger has begun to inject digestive enzymes into the skin (usually after about 1-3 hours), symptoms and signs typically begin.'   Pronounced itching is the most common symptom. The area of the bite may be reddened, flat, or raised; sometimes it resembles a pustule or blister. The itch is due to the presence of the stylostome and usually is most intense within 1-2 days after the bite. The itching persists for several days, and complete resolution of the skin lesions can take up to two weeks. If multiple bites are present, the condition may be mistaken for eczema or allergic contact dermatitis. A history of outdoor activity can suggest that chigger bites are the cause of itching and characteristic skin changes."
What home remedies and OTC medications ease itching and pain from chigger bites?,"'Many home remedies for chigger bites are based upon the incorrect belief that chiggers burrow into and remain in the skin. Nail polish, ''alcohol'', and bleach have been applied to the bites to attempt to get rid of the chiggers by ""suffocating"" or killing the chiggers. However, because the chiggers are not present in the skin, these methods are not effective. Home remedies to help relieve the itching associated with chigger bites may help some people. These can include''Treatment for chigger bites is directed toward relieving the itching and inflammation. ''Calamine lotion'' and ''corticosteroid'' creams may be used to control itching. Oral ''antihistamines'', such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), may also be used for symptom relief.''Chigger bites themselves do not produce any long-term complications. However, because of the intense itching, prolonged scratching may lead to skin wounds that may become infected by bacteria. Chiggers in North America are not known to carry any diseases, unlike some other arthropods.'   Taking a cool shower or applying cool compresses Sitting in a cool bath Using bath products that contain colloidal oatmeal Using certain over-the-counter (OTC) medications"
How can you prevent from getting chigger bites?,"   Washing with soap and water after outdoor activity may remove any chiggers that may be migrating on the skin and prevent their bites. Likewise, washing clothing that was worn outdoors in hot water will kill any chiggers remaining on the clothing. Attention to the outdoor temperature can help with prevention of chigger bites. Chiggers do not bite at colder temperatures (below 60 F or 15.5 C). Chiggers also are not found in areas hotter than 99 F or 37.2 C, so hot rocky areas on sunny days can provide chigger-free seats. As with mosquito bites, proper outdoor clothing can help prevent chigger bites. Long pants and long-sleeved shirts as well as thick socks and high shoes or boots can help prevent infestation. Pants legs should be tucked into shoes or boots if possible. All mosquito repellents (such as DEET), applied to skin and clothing, are effective at repelling chiggers."
How many people get bitten by dogs?," Almost 70 million dogs live in the United States, and since many victims of dog bites don't seek medical care or report the attack, it may be that the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s estimate of 4.5 million dog bites each year in the U.S. may be too low. Over one million of dog bite victims go to emergency medical care at hospitals in the U.S. every year. Dogs have rounded teeth, and it is the pressure exerted by their jaws that can cause significant damage to the tissues under the skin, including bones, muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves. The risk of being bitten by a dog increases if there is a dog in the home; the more dogs there are, the greater the risk. Men are more frequent bitten by dogs than women, who are bitten by cats more often. Children between the ages of 5 and 9 are more likely to be bitten by a dog than other age groups. Children are also more likely to need medical attention."
What should you do if a dog bites you?,"   If a dog bites you or someone that you are with, you need go to a safe place away from the dog that has bitten you to prevent further attack and injury. Infants and children should be evaluated after any dog bite. If there are no signs of skin damage or if there is a small amount of abrasion from a dog bite, it may be reasonable to watch for signs and symptoms of infection (pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and drainage of pus or fluid) before seeking medical care. Wounds should be kept elevated and if it is possible, you may attempt to clean the dog bite with tap water. Gather information from the dog's owner about the dog's rabies immunization status, but if this is not possible, hospital, animal control centers, or law enforcement personnel will help gather any required information. Since dog bites can cause significant damage beneath the skin, a type of injury that cannot always easily be seen. Moreover, if there is pain at or near the dog bite, underlying tissues and other structures may have been damaged or if the bite disrupts the skin causing a puncture, laceration, or tear, call your doctor or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department."
What is the treatment and management for infections and other problems from a dog bite?,"'Three important treatment issues that need to be addressed with a dog bite:'""It is easy to look at a dog bite and see that the skin has been damaged, but it is also important to assess the underlying structures that may have also been injured in the attack. The patient often concentrates on the cosmetic appearance of the wound; while that is important, the health care practitioner may be more concerned about the injuries that will impair the body's function. For example, a laceration to a hand may look bad, but more important than the potential scarring would be a lacerated tendon that would prevent a finger from moving.""'The potential for infection from a dog bite is extremely high. Dog bites inoculate bacteria deep into tissue, and while not as aggressive as cat bites, the majority of dog bites get infected. Common bacteria involved in such infections include ''Streptococcus'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Pasteurella''.''Find out if the dog that bit you has current rabies immunizations. If the dog has not been immunized for rabies, the question becomes whether to immunize the patient against the rabies virus. A variety of approaches may be considered depending upon the situation surrounding the bite.'""Once the doctor or other healthcare professional has taken a history of the events and examined the patient, most dog bites can be cared for in the emergency department, urgent care centers, or a doctor's office. The physical exam will help decide whether any deep structures like muscle, tendon, nerve, or bone have been damaged.""'Commonly, the wound is anesthetized so that it can be explored. This will help confirm the condition of the deep structures and their function. The wound will then be washed with normal saline (a salt-water solution) to irrigate out as much dirt and bacteria as possible.''Once the wound has been cleaned, a decision needs to be made whether to close the skin. Stitching the skin (to make the scar look better) increases the risk of infection. Balancing the risk of infection against the benefit of a better-looking scar depends upon the location of the injury and the discussion between the doctor and patient. Dog bites to the face tend to be sutured, while those located on less noticeable parts of the body may be left to heal on their own.''Sometimes, dog bite wounds need surgery to repair the wound if there is considerable skin damage or skin loss, or if there are associated injuries that need treatment.''Some dog bites In infants and children may need surgery to repair lacerations, especially if facial wounds are involved, because of the need for prolonged anesthetic to keep the patient still.''There is some controversy regarding antibiotic therapy for dog bites. Some doctors routinely prescribe antibiotics while others choose to wait until the wound shows signs and symptoms of potential infection.'   Skin damage Injury to underlying tissues such as muscle, nerve, and bone Infection Is the dog available to be observed? Was the bite provoked or defensive rather than an unprovoked attack? Where is the bite located? What is the past medical history of the victim?"
Will I get rabies?,"""If the dog bite victim does not to seek medical care, the rabies immunization status of the dog must be determined immediately. Rabies therapy, if necessary, must begin as soon as possible. The victim's ""'tetanus'' status also needs to be current.''Exposure to a rabid animal does not always result in rabies. If treatment is initiated promptly following a rabies exposure, rabies can be prevented. If a rabies exposure is not treated and a person develops clinical signs of rabies, the diseased usually results in death.' "
8 tips to prevent dog bites,"'Dog bites often occur when there is miscommunication between the dog and the victim. It is not common to have an unprovoked attack by a stray dog. Often, it is the dog owner or a family member who is bitten. To prevent being bitten by a dog:'  Choose a dog breed that is compatible with the family. Aggressive dogs may not be appropriate in a home with infants and small children. Dogs are social animals; therefore, socializing and appropriate training will help minimize the risk of dog bites. Do not approach a stray or unfamiliar dog, especially if the owner is not present. Do not approach a dog with quick motions or from above their head. Allow time for the dog to acknowledge your presence before attempting to pet it. Prior to contact with the dog, ask the owner if is OK to pet the dog. If a confrontation occurs, do not make eye contact and do not run or scream. Do not approach an unfamiliar dog while it is eating, sleeping, or caring for puppies. Do not leave young children or infants unsupervised with a dog."
What is a venomous (poisonous) snakebite?,"'A venomous (poisonous) snake bite is a bite or a puncture ''wound'' made by a snake that is capable of injecting, secreting, or spitting venom into the penetrated skin wound, ''mucus'' membranes or the eyes where the toxin can be absorbed. Worldwide, there are about 20,000 to 100,000 snakebite deaths per year. In North America, there are about 25 species of snakes able to secrete venom. However, non-native poisonous species are present in zoos and held in private homes or other areas by snake collectors. Consequently, almost any type of venomous snake bite can be encountered in the US. About 7,000 snake bites are reported in the US per year, but because snake bites are not required to be reported, it is estimated that up to 45,000 bites per year may occur with about 8,000 by poisonous snakes. About five deaths per year are reported due to snakebites. The most common venomous snakes in the US are:''The first three are pit vipers (have a pit used to detect temperature changes and two movable fangs), and the coral snake is an elapid with short fixed fangs and no pit. Brown snakes are also elapid and are very poisonous.'   Rattlesnakes Copperheads Cottonmouths/water moccasins Coral snakes"
What is a nonvenomous (nonpoisonous) snakebite?, A nonvenomous (nonpoisonous) snake bite is a bite or puncture wound made by a snake that is incapable of secreting venom. This should be distinguished from a dry bite. A dry bite is a bite by a venomous snake that does not inject any venom. Even bites that are from a nonvenomous snake or are dry need to be evaluated as they can lead to significant tissue damage or infections.
What are the 	symptoms of a venomous snakebite?,"'The symptoms of a venomous snakebite depend on the type of toxin(s) secreted into the bite or puncture wound, and in part, on how much toxin is present in the tissue. The types of symptoms produced can be grouped into four groups:''Some toxins may cause more than one of these effects. Because of the various symptoms that can occur with venomous snakebites, the potential signs and symptoms to look for, as listed by the CDC include the following:''Symptoms from these toxins are somewhat variable and may occur quickly within minutes or they may be delayed for hours, depending on the toxin type and the amount absorbed. In general, small children are more vulnerable to snake bites because the relative larger amount of toxin absorbed in relation to their smaller body size can make the toxin effect more potent. Individuals with medical conditions like ''heart disease'' or other chronic diseases are also at higher risk of complications due to snakebite. The quick action of many toxins usually does not allow the immune system a chance to counter the toxin’s effects.''Identification of the snake helps emergency health care professionals to both anticipate the potential symptoms, and it allows for more rapid and appropriate treatment of the venomous snake bite. A detailed description and a picture of the snake will help identify the type of snake and the type of toxin. Do not waste time, however, in transporting the patient to an appropriate medical facility and do not put others in jeopardy of getting bitten.''The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed snakebite to its list of neglected tropical diseases. Sub-Saharan Africa has a lack of antivenom supplies; minute-to-minute delays in treatment can affect outcomes; for example in April 2019, a woman died on her wedding day a few hours after a snakebite in Nigeria.'   Cardiotoxins act on heart tissue. Neurotoxins act on nervous system tissue. Cytotoxins act on tissue at the site of the bite or on tissue that directly absorbs the venom. Hemotoxins act on the blood coagulation system and may cause internal bleeding. A pair of puncture marks at the wound Redness and swelling around the bite Severe pain at the site of the bite Nausea and vomiting Labored breathing (in extreme cases, breathing may stop altogether) Disturbed vision Increased salivation and sweating Numbness or tingling around the face and/or limbs"
How is a venomous snakebite diagnosed?,"'Any snakebite needs ''emergency medicine'' and evaluation. Identification of fang or bite marks is done, even if the snake is nonvenomous, to determine local ''trauma'' or tissue damage at the site of the bite. Identification of the snake type by description or picture, along with the circumstances of the bite and the surrounding environment usually provides the health care professional a working diagnosis. For example, a snakebite occurring in dry west Texas is likely a ''rattlesnake bite'', while a snakebite in a swampy area of the U.S. is likely a water moccasin, and Tiger snakes (body has bands of colors) are found mainly in Australia and its costal islands. A zookeeper or private snake owner/collector who is bitten will likely know the exact type of snake that caused the bite or toxic spray (spitting cobras).' "
What is the 	treatment for a venomous snakebite?,"'After a snake bites, there are two phases of treatment.''Many past home remedies, snakebite kits and other ''first aid'' treatment methods have been shown to make the effects of the snakebite worse. Consequently, the CDC has issued guidelines to use after the threat of additional bites to the patient or others is eliminated, about what to ''DO'' and what ''NOT TO DO'' if a snakebite occurs. The following are CDC recommendations:''Do ''NOT'' do any of the following:''Not included in the CDC recommendation is the bite of the Australian elapid snake, also termed a sea snake, which ''is'' emergently treated with a pressure bandage at the bite site with splinting and extremity immobilization. Others suggest no use of electric shocks for any snakebite.''The second phase of treatment consists of stabilization and supportive care, and when medically indicated, administration of antitoxin (antivenin) specific for the snake species and a ''tetanus'' booster ''vaccine''. A good practice is to call your local ''poison control'' center or the national Poison Help Line (1-800-222-1222), and also to consult a toxicologist and a surgeon to help care for the patient. Certain patients may require surgical treatment and admission to the hospital, as some snakebites can be life-threatening.''The treatment of non-venomous snake bites includes local ''wound care'' at the site of the bite, removing snake ''teeth'' if left in the bite site, attending to any trauma at the bite site, and a ''tetanus'' booster if needed. Some wounds may become infected and require additional treatment with antibiotics.'  The emergency treatment is provided on-site and during transport to an appropriate health care facility. The health care facility stabilizes the patient, administers antivenin if deemed necessary, and provides supportive treatment. Seek medical attention as soon as possible (dial 911 or call local Emergency Medical Services) Try to remember the color and shape of the snake, which can help with identification and treatment of snake venom in the snakebite. Keep still and calm. This can slow down the spread of venom. Inform your supervisor (if the bite occurs at work). Apply first aid if you cannot get to the hospital right away.Lay or sit down with the bite below the level of the heart.Wash the bite with soap and water.Cover the bite with a clean, dry dressing. Lay or sit down with the bite below the level of the heart. Wash the bite with soap and water. Cover the bite with a clean, dry dressing. Do not pick up the snake or try to trap it. Do not wait for symptoms to appear if bitten, rather seek immediate medical attention. Do not apply a tourniquet. Do not slash the wound with a knife. Do not suck out the venom. Do not apply ice or immerse the wound in water. Do not drink alcohol as a painkiller. Do not drink caffeinated beverages."
What are the complications of a venomous snakebite?,"'The complications of venomous snake bites can range from mild to severe and may mimic other human diseases like hemorrhagic ''fever'', ''ALS'' (''Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis'') and autoimmune disease, for example. Complications include ''pain'' and swelling at the bite site, ''allergic reaction'', vision damage (from toxin sprays especially), ''compartment syndrome'' (localized severe swelling that can damage or destroy nerves and blood vessels, leading to muscle necrosis), infection (including methicillin-resistant bacteria), limb loss, ''gangrene'', ''sepsis'', internal bleeding, cardiac damage, respiratory compromise, possible long-term psychological effects or mental disorders, and even death.'  "
Can a snakebite be prevented?,"'Many snake bites can be prevented as most snakes are not aggressive toward humans unless they sense danger. Consequently, avoidance of snakes usually prevents a bite, so people should not try to handle, capture or threaten (for example, tease with a stick) any snake. Statistical studies suggest that about 40% of all snake bites in the US occur in people that consumed alcoholic ''drinks'"". If a person's workplace involves areas known to be a habitat of snakes, wearing protective boots, thick pants, and gloves may reduce the chances of a snake bite; or at least it may reduce the bite trauma and the amount of venom distributed."" "
What is the prognosis for a venomous snakebite?,"'Most snakebites, when quickly and appropriately treated, have a good prognosis. If left untreated for various increasing lengths of time after the snake bites, the prognosis usually diminishes while the complications increase. Deaths are unlikely, as fewer than 10 deaths per year are due to snakebites in the U.S.' "
What are fleas? What do they look like?,"'Fleas are a parasitic insect that feeds on the blood of mammals and birds. There are an estimated 2,500 species of fleas in the world. The most common flea species in the U.S. is the cat flea, ''Ctenocephalides felis'', which also infests ''dogs'' and can bite humans.''Humans can be bitten by so-called ""sand fleas,"" which usually are found at the beach and in coastal areas. They actually are not insects, but tiny crustaceans, though their bite is similar to that of the cat flea. They do not infest homes.''Adult fleas are about 1/12 to 1/8 inch long, wingless, oval, flat from side to side, and dark reddish-brown. They have six long legs and can jump very high and far, about 200 times their body length. Flea larvae are pale white and measure about 3 mm in length, resembling tiny worms.' "
What does a flea bite look like on a person (pictures)?,"'Flea bites look like small red dots. These spots often occur in two to three groups or clusters with redness around them and sometimes a light halo. They tend to bite humans around the ''feet'', ankles, and lower legs.''For people who are ''allergic'' to flea bites, there can be larger areas of redness and small ''pimple''-like ''bumps''.'""The redness can last from a few hours to several days, depending on an individual's reaction, and how much (or little) the bites are scratched."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of a flea bites in humans?,"'Symptoms of flea bites on humans that will occur immediately after being bitten include:''Some people are more sensitive to flea bites, and can have allergic reactions. Symptoms of allergic reactions to flea bites include:'""Allergic reactions to flea bites can be a medical emergency, so call 911 or get to a hospital's emergency department immediately.""   Red spots with a halo Itching Hives Rash (characterized by small clusters of bumps) Swelling around the bite Difficulty breathing (shortness of breath or wheezing) Swelling of the lips or tongue Dizziness Nausea Chest pain"
"Flea bites in humans vs. bed bug bites, do they look the same?","'Flea bites and ''bed bug bites'' appear similar, but they are not the same.' Bed bug bites often look like mosquito bites. They can be red, firm, and there may be some slight swelling around the bite. Flea bites look like small clusters of red spots. Bed bug bites often appear in linear rows and can appear anywhere on the body, whereas flea bites tend to be located in clusters often on the feet and ankles. Bed bugs are nocturnal, and like to make their home in your mattress, so bites from these insects usually occur at night when you are sleeping. Fleas are also nocturnal but tend to cling to pets, and are found on furniture, drapery, and carpeting. Bed bug bites may take several days to appear and will start to itch gradually, whereas flea bites start to itch immediately and become swollen and red within an hour after the bite. Both flea bites and bed bug bites itch and can cause allergic reactions."
Do flea bites itch? Is it bad to scratch them?,'Regardless of how much they itch try not to scratch flea bites. Flea bites can itch intensely and can cause a secondary infection. Symptoms of infection from flea bites include:' Redness Pain Fever Red streaking on extremities Swollen lymph nodes
How can you to stop flea bites from itching?,"'The main symptom of flea bites is ''itching'', which can be treated with ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) anti-itch creams, lotions, or ointments.''If the itching is bothersome, an oral ''antihistamine'' such as diphenhydramine (''Benadryl'') may help. If you have an ''allergic reaction'', see a doctor. You may be prescribed a stronger ''antihistamine'' such as ''hydroxyzine'' (''Vistaril'', Atarax).'   Wash the area first to lessen the chances for infection. Apply an anti-itch topical medication such as calamine lotion (Caladryl), hydrocortisone (Cortaid, Cortizone), or diphenhydramine (Benadryl Itch Stopping Gel)."
What are natural home remedies and other treatments are used for flea bites in humans?,"'Natural and home remedies to soothe or relieve itching from flea bites include:''Avoid scratching the flea bites because you can create an ''open wound'' that will let in bacteria, and can lead to infection.'   Wrap ice packs (or frozen vegetables) in a towel and apply to the skin to relieve swelling, and to numb the area. Aloe Vera may ease redness and swelling. Witch hazel can help with itching. Rubbing alcohol can be used to dry the bites. White vinegar (dilute 1 part vinegar with 1 part water) can provide temporary relief. Tea tree oil to can relieve itching. Cool used teabags in the freezer and apply to the bite to relieve inflammation."
Can I become infected from flea bites?,"'Infection and disease can result from flea bites. Infection usually occurs because of scratching the bites. Bacterial and other debris can be present under the fingernails, and if a person vigorously scratches a ''fleabite'', they may cause the ''rash'' to become an open ''wound'' for bacteria to enter.''Fleas also can be a public health threat because they can transmit a number of diseases to both humans and animals. Diseases transmitted to humans by fleas include:' Plague (Yersinia pestis) Bartonellosis Typhus (Rickettsia typhi) Tungiasis Flea tapeworm"
How can you prevent flea bites on humans?,"'Since most flea bites are due to fleas brought into the home by pets, the best way to prevent being bitten is to prevent the fleas from getting on your pets.''If you catch fleas on pets or in your home early it is much easier to get rid of them before they spread throughout your home.''To prevent bites from sand fleas if you are on the beach:' Keep your pets away from animals you know have had fleas recently. Keep your pets out of difficult to treat places such as under decks or sheds. Mow your lawn frequently and keep the grass short. Use a flea comb to check your pet's fur for fleas. Keep pet bedding clean and wash in hot water. Vacuum carpets, rugs, and upholstered furniture frequently, especially in areas where pets sleep, and under beds, sofas and behind furniture. Dust furniture and dry clean curtains and upholstery. Use flea preventive medicine on your pet once a month (for example, Advantage, Advantix, Frontline, Revolution, Sentinel, and others). Talk to your veterinarian about the right product for your dog or cat. Avoid the beach in the early morning and late afternoon, when sand fleas feed. Use lounges or chairs rather than a towel or blanket on the sand. Wear closed shoes and socks when walking on the beach. Use insect repellant with DEET. Stay away from seaweed, a favorite food of sand fleas."
How can I tell if I have fleas in my home?,"'One of the first ways people notice they have a flea infestation is when their ''dogs'"" or cats start scratching, biting, or licking themselves excessively. You can use a flea comb to check your pet's fur for fleas and flea feces. Flea feces on your pet may look like dot-like insects or flecks of dirt or pepper.""'Once fleas have gotten onto pets it does not take long to spread through the household. Once they have infested the home, you may notice fleas hopping on your carpet, furniture, or drapery.'""If you suspect that your pet or home may have a flea infestation you can test the dark specks to see if it is flea feces. Moisten the suspected flea feces, and if it turns red or maroon in color, it is flea feces. (Flea feces is comprised of dried blood.) Another quick way to help you check for a flea infestation is to wear long white socks. Fleas like to jump on human's feet, ankles, and lower legs. The insects are dark reddish-brown, and if they jump on you while you wear white socks they will be easier to see."" "
10 natural remedies and solutions get rid of fleas on pets and in homes?,"'Getting rid of fleas is a multi-pronged approach.There are some natural solutions that may help repel fleas, however, if you have an infestation it is probably best to consult a pest-removal specialist to thoroughly rid your home of fleas, and consult your veterinarian to make sure your pets are flea-free.''Once you have gotten rid of fleas, you can use some natural remedies to prevent them from returning.''Flea bombs (foggers) do not soak into carpets well, where flea larvae live. Because of this, most pest control specialists do not recommend flea bombs because they do not consider them to be effective.''Some natural remedies that may help repel fleas in pets include:''Talk to your vet about ways to keep your dogs and cats free from fleas. Before using any home or natural flea preventive/repellant remedy on your pets, consult with your vet. Some remedies work well for some pets and not others, and some pets may have unwanted reactions to these items. The amount of any herb or oil or other product used for a pet may vary depending on their size, weight, age, breed, and overall health. It is always best to consult with your veterinarian to make sure the products and amounts you use are safe for your cats and dogs.' Treat areas of the home with antimicrobial solutions such as tea tree oil, garlic spray, or diatomaceous earth powder. A few drops of tea tree oil may be added to bath products, or it may be used as a spray on bedding, upholstery, carpets, and other fabrics. Essential oils can be used to make a homemade flea repellant spray. Common oils used include eucalyptus, peppermint, tea tree, rosewood, cedar, citrus, or lemongrass. Mix with water and put in a spray bottle. Use homemade flea traps to help get rid of fleas. In a bowl, add equal amounts of hot water and liquid hand soap, and place the bowl at the foot of your bed with a small lamp on nearby. The fleas are attracted to the warmth of the light and will fall into the trap and drown. Before you vacuum, sprinkle diatomaceous earth powder and Borax powder on carpets, rugs, and flooring. Borax can be irritating to the skin and eyes, so keep away from children. Eucalyptus trees are known to be flea-repellent, and can be planted in the yard. Add small amounts of Brewer's yeast and apple cider vinegar to your pet's drinking water to help repel fleas. Diluted apple cider vinegar may also be used a final rinse for pets after bathing. Herbal shampoos to bathe your pet(s) include eucalyptus, lavender, germanium, lemon, or tea tree. Garlic added to your pet's food may help repel fleas."
Do I have to have a pet to get flea bites?,"'While most home flea infestations occur in homes with pets, fleas can infest home without pets as well. This may happen in several scenarios.' If you recently moved into a home where previous owners had pets with fleas, and they were not properly eradicated, you may find yourself with a flea infestation. Used furniture may come infested with fleas. Neighborhood dogs or cats that have fleas may hang out near your home Pests such as rats or mice, or wild animals such as opossums, raccoons, squirrels, and skunks also can carry fleas and bring them into your home. A common public place where fleas may be found is in dog parks. They also may be found in large natural parks that are home to wild animals such as opossums, raccoons, squirrels, and skunks that can carry fleas."
Biventricular Pacemaker Introduction,"'A biventricular ''pacemaker'' is a special pacemaker used for cardiac resynchronization therapy in ''heart failure'' patients.''In the normal ''heart'"", the heart's lower chambers (ventricles) pump at the same time and in sync with the heart's upper chambers (atria). When a person has heart failure, often the right and left ventricles do not pump together. When the heart's contractions become out of sync, the ""'left ventricle'' is not able to pump enough blood to the body. This eventually leads to an increase in heart failure symptoms, such as ''shortness of breath'', dry ''cough'', swelling in the ankles or legs, ''weight gain'', increased urination, ''fatigue'', or rapid or irregular heartbeat.''Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), also called biventricular pacing, uses a special kind of pacemaker, called a biventricular pacemaker, designed to treat the delay in ''heart ventricle'"" contractions. It keeps the right and left ventricles pumping together by sending small electrical impulses through the leads. This therapy has been shown to improve the symptoms of heart failure and the person's overall quality of life."" "
What Is a Biventricular Pacemaker?,"'Leads are implanted through a vein into the ''right ventricle'' and into the coronary sinus vein to pace or regulate the left ventricle. Usually (but not always), a lead is also implanted into the ''right atrium''. This helps the heart beat in a more balanced way.''Traditional pacemakers are used to treat slow heart rhythms. Pacemakers regulate the right ''atrium'' and right ventricle to maintain a good heart rate and keep the ''atrium'' and ventricle working together. This is called AV synchrony. Biventricular pacemakers add a third lead to help the left ventricle contract at the same time as the right ventricle.' "
Who Is a Candidate for a Biventricular Pacemaker?,"'Biventricular pacemakers improve the symptoms of heart failure in about 50% of people that have been treated with medications but still have severe or moderately severe heart failure symptoms. Therefore, to be eligible for the biventricular pacemaker, heart failure patients must:''In addition, the heart failure patient may or may not need this type of pacemaker to treat slow heart rhythms and may or may not need an internal ''defibrillator'' (implantable ''cardioverter'' defibrillator, or ICD), which is designed to treat people at risk for ''sudden cardiac death'' or cardiac arrests.'   Have severe or moderately severe heart failure symptoms. Be taking medications to treat heart failure. Have delayed electrical activation of the heart (Your doctor can usually determine this using ECG.)."
My Doctor Recommends Combination ICD and Pacemaker Therapy. Why?,"'People with heart failure who have poor ejection fractions (measurement that shows how well the heart pumps with each beat) are at risk for fast irregular heart rhythms -- some of which can be life-threatening. Currently, doctors use an ICD to prevent these arrhythmias.''The device works by detecting such a rhythm and shocking the heart back to normal. These devices can combine biventricular pacing with anti-tachycardia (fast heart rate) pacing and internal defibrillators to deliver treatment as needed. Current studies are showing that resynchronization may even lessen the amount of ''arrhythmia'"" that occurs, decreasing the frequency of ICD firing. These devices are improving heart failure patients' quality of life as well as improving their safety."" "
How Do I Prepare for the Biventricular Pacemaker Implant?,"'Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take before getting your biventricular pacemaker. Your doctor may ask you to stop certain medications several days before your procedure. If you have ''diabetes'', ask your doctor how you should adjust your diabetic medications.''Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before the procedure. If you must take medications, drink only small sips of water to help you swallow your pills.''When you come to the hospital, wear comfortable clothes. You will change into a hospital gown for the procedure. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home.' "
What Happens During the Pacemaker Implantation?,"'Pacemakers can be implanted two ways:''Your doctor will decide which approach is best for you.' Inside the Heart (Endocardial, Transvenous approach): This is the most common technique used. A lead is placed into a vein (usually in your groin), and then guided to your heart. The tip of the lead attaches to your heart muscle. The other end of the lead is attached to the pulse generator, which is placed under the skin in your upper chest. This technique is done under local anesthesia (you will not be asleep). Outside the Heart (Epicardial approach): The lead tip is attached to the outside of the heart. The other end of the lead is attached to the pulse generator, which is placed under the skin in your abdomen. This technique is done under general anesthesia (you will be asleep) by a surgeon."
A Closer Look at What Happens During the Endocardial Approach," Your procedure will take place in the electrophysiology (EP) lab. You will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an IV (intravenous) line to deliver medications and fluids during the procedure. An antibiotic will be given through your IV at the beginning of the procedure to help prevent infection. You will receive a medication through your IV to make you drowsy. The medication will not put you to sleep. If you are uncomfortable or need anything during the procedure, please let the nurse know. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. The monitors allow the doctor and nurse to monitor your condition at all times during the procedure. It is very important to keep the area of insertion sterile to prevent infection. 
Therefore, your chest will be shaved (if necessary) and cleansed with a special soap. Sterile drapes will be used to cover you from your neck to your feet. A soft strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in contact with the sterile field. The doctor will numb your skin by injecting a local numbing medication. You will feel a pinching or burning feeling at first. Then, the area will become numb. Once this occurs, an incision will be made to insert the pacemaker and leads. You may feel a pulling as the doctor makes a pocket in the tissue under your skin for the pacemaker. You should not feel pain. If you do, tell your nurse. After the pocket is made, the doctor will insert the leads into a vein and guide them into position using a fluoroscopy machine. After the leads are in place, the doctor tests the leads to make sure lead placement is correct, the leads are sensing and pacing appropriately and the right and left ventricle are synchronized. This is called ""pacing"" and involves delivering small amounts of energy through the leads into the heart muscle. This causes the heart to contract. When your heart rate increases, you may feel your heart is racing or beating faster. It is very important to tell your doctor or nurse any symptoms you feel. Any pain should be reported immediately. After the leads are tested, the doctor will connect them to your pacemaker. Your doctor will determine the rate of your pacemaker and other settings. The final pacemaker settings are done after the implant using a special device called a ""programmer."" The pacemaker implant procedure lasts about 2 to 5 hours."
What Happens After The Pacemaker Is Implanted?,"'Hospital stay:'' After the pacemaker implant, you will likely be admitted to the hospital overnight. The nurses will monitor your heart rate and rhythm. You will also have a a telemetry monitor attached with small electrode patches. It will record your heart rhythm for about 12 hours. This is another way to check proper pacemaker function. The morning after your implant, you will have a ''chest x-ray'' to check your ''lungs'' and the position of your pacemaker and leads.''Final pacemaker check:'' For your final pacemaker check, you will sit in a reclining chair and the pacemaker will be attached to a computer monitor. A small machine known as a programmer is used to check your pacemaker. It has a wand that is placed directly over the device. This machine allows the nurse or doctor to read your pacemaker settings and make changes during testing. With these changes, the function of the pacemaker and leads can be evaluated. You may feel your heart beating faster or slower. This is normal; however, report all symptoms to the nurse. Results of the pacemaker check are discussed with your doctor who will then determine your pacemaker settings.''After your pacemaker check, an ''echocardiogram'' may be done. The pacemaker nurse will be there during your echo and will change your pacemaker at least 3 times. The echo will be repeated with each change to evaluate ''heart function''. The pacemaker will keep the settings that demonstrated your best heart function.' "
When Will I Be Able to Go Home After Getting the Pacemaker?,"'Usually, you will be able to go home the day after your pacemaker is implanted. Your doctor will discuss the results of the procedure and answer any questions you may have. A doctor or nurse will go over specific instructions for your care at home. Please ask a responsible adult to drive you home, as the medications you received may cause drowsiness, making it unsafe for you to drive or operate heavy machinery.' "
How Do I Care for My Wound?,"'Keep the area where the pacemaker was inserted clean and dry. After about five days, you may take a shower. Look at your ''wound'' daily to make sure it is healing. Call your doctor if you notice:' Increased drainage or bleeding from the insertion site. Increased opening of the incision. Redness around the incision site. Warmth along the incision. Increased body temperature (fever or chills)."
When Will I Be Able to Perform My Normal Activities After Getting the Pacemaker?,"'You may move your arm normally and do not have to restrict its motion during normal daily activities if you have a pacemaker. Avoid extreme pulling or lifting motions (such as placing your arm over your head without bending at the elbow). Activities such as golf, tennis, and ''swimming'' should be avoided for 6 weeks from when the pacemaker was implanted. Microwave ovens, electric blankets, and heating pads may be used. Cellular phones should be used on the side opposite your pacemaker. Ask your doctor or nurse for more specific information regarding what types of equipment may interfere with your pacemaker.''Pacemaker Identification:'' You will receive a temporary ID card that tells you what type of pacemaker and leads you have, the date of implant, and the doctor who implanted it. In about 3 months following implantation, you will receive a permanent card from the company. It is important that you CARRY THIS CARD AT ALL TIMES in case you need medical attention at another hospital.' "
How Often Do I Need to Get my Pacemaker Checked?,"'A complete pacemaker check should be done 6 weeks after your pacemaker is implanted. This check is very important because adjustments will be made that can prolong the life of your pacemaker.''Further follow-up pacemaker checks are scheduled every 3 to 6 months.''Here is an outline of the pacemaker follow-up schedule:' Check before you are discharged from the hospital, the day after implantation Telephone call 2 weeks after implantation to make sure the wound is healing and to ensure the transmitter is working 6 week check Pacemaker analysis every 3 to 6 months"
How Long Will My Pacemaker Last?,'Regular pacemakers usually last 4 to 8 years. Biventricular pacemakers that are combined with an ICD and do not tend to last as long (about 4 to 6 years).' 
How Will I Know If My Pacemaker Needs to Be Changed?,"""After getting a pacemaker, you will need to follow up with the doctor and nurses in a pacemaker clinic. This will allow them to monitor your pacemaker's function and anticipate when it will need to be changed. Some pacemakers give a beep that you can hear when the pacemaker is getting clost to needing to be replaced.""'Resynchronization therapy is only one part of a comprehensive heart failure management program. Device and/or surgical therapy, when combined with taking medications, following a low-sodium ''diet'', making lifestyle changes, and following up with a heart failure specialist, will help you decrease symptoms and live a more active life. Your doctor will help determine what treatment options are best for you.' "
Black eye introduction,"'A black eye often results from injury to the face or the head, and is caused when blood and other fluids collect in the space around the eye. Swelling and dark discoloration result in a ""black eye"" -- sometimes called a ""shiner.""''Most black eyes are relatively minor injuries. Many heal on their own in a few days, but they may signify a more serious injury.''Despite the name, ""black eye,"" the eye itself is not usually injured. The tissues around the eye may be significantly discolored and swollen without any injury to the eye itself, like a bruise (ecchymosis) around the eye.''The skin around the eye is very loose, with mostly fat underneath it, and fluid accumulates easily in this area. The skin around the eye is one of the first places to swell when the facial area is injured. Depending on the location and type of injury, one or both eyes may be affected. Injuries to the eyebrow, nose, and forehead area often result in black eyes because gravity pulls the blood and inflammatory fluid into the soft tissues under and around the eyes.''As a black eye heals, the swelling around the eye decreases, and the bruise gradually fades away. The ''bruising'' will usually start out a very dark purple, and as it fades, it may change to light purple, then greenish, then yellow before disappearing.'  "
What causes a black eye?,"'The most common cause of a black eye is a blow to the eye, nose, or forehead. Depending on where the blow lands, one or both eyes may be affected.''A blow to the nose often causes both eyes to swell because the swelling from the nasal injury causes fluid to collect in the loose tissues of the eyelids.''Other causes of black eye include:''Other causes of swelling around the eye include (these conditions do not necessarily make the skin turn black and blue around the eye):'   surgical procedures to the face, such as a facelift, jaw surgery, or nose surgery; a certain type of head injury, called a basilar skull fracture, causes both eyes to swell and blacken; this condition is typically described as ""raccoon eyes."" allergic reactions, bites, cellulitis (skin infection around the eye), angioedema (swelling, usually around both eyes), and dental infections."
What are the signs and symptoms of a black eye?,"'Edema'' (swelling) and ''pain'' are the most common signs and symptoms of a black eye, and may be accompanied by discoloration caused by ''bruising''.''Initially, the swelling and discoloration may be mild. The area around the eye often starts off slightly reddened and then progresses to a darker shade, and swelling increases. Some blurry vision or difficulty opening the eye may occur, but more serious visual problems are less common. Over the course of a few days, the area becomes lighter and the swelling decreases.''Signs of a more serious injury are ''double vision'', loss of sight, or inability to move the eye. ''Loss of consciousness'', blood or clear fluid coming out of the nose or the ears, blood on the surface of the eye itself, or persistent ''headache'' can also indicate a severe injury.'  "
When should I call the doctor for a black eye?,"'Most black eyes are minor injuries that heal on their own in a few days with ice and OTC pain medications. Depending on the mechanism of injury and accompanying symptoms, an ophthalmologist might have to examine the injured eye to make sure that no significant injury to the eye has occurred.''Call a doctor if the person:''Consult a health care professional any time you are unsure about treatment or concerned about symptoms.''Some conditions require immediate medical care. Call 9-1-1 or get to an emergency department immediately in the following situations:' experiences changes in vision; has severe pain or swelling that does not go away; has swelling around the eyes that is not related to an injury; has signs of infection (for example, fever, warmth, redness, pus-like drainage), has behavioral changes, has forgetfulness or lethargy, or nausea, vomiting and/or dizziness. the person experiences changes in or loss of vision (especially double vision); an inability to move the eye itself (i.e., unable to look in different directions); any injury in which an object may have pierced the eye or may be inside the eyeball; if there is obvious blood in the eye itself; if there is deformity to the eye; fluid leaking from the eyeball; there are any lacerations (cuts) to the eye area, face, or head; the person has signs of a serious head or facial injury; if the black eye is accompanied by broken bones or teeth; loss of consciousness; changes in behavior; nausea, vomiting and/or dizziness; inability to walk; blood or clear fluids coming out of the nose or the ears; people who take blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin), or those with a history of bleeding problems such as hemophilia; swelling after a bee sting near the eye; or from a suspected infection of the eye."
How is a black eye diagnosed?,"'For most black eyes, a doctor will perform a physical exam and will ask about the injury and look for any associated injuries or symptoms.'""The doctor will shine a light into the patient's eyes to look at the pupils and inside the eye itself for any injury, and to check for foreign bodies or abrasions on the eye. The doctor will test the motion of the patient's eye (following the doctor's finger with the eyes) and examine the facial bones around the eye.""'Depending on what the doctor finds, he or she may perform additional testing like an X-ray or a ''CT scan'' if the doctor suspects a fracture to the bones of the face or around the eye (the orbit) or that something is inside the eye.''If there are any special concerns, the doctor may refer the patient to a specialist, such as an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specializes in ''eye care'' and surgery), for follow-up care.' "
What is the treatment for a black eye?,"'Home remedies''Home remedies for black eye include rest and ice applied early after the injury to decrease swelling and pain.''Ice helps decrease swelling by constricting blood vessels, by decreasing fluid accumulation, and by cooling and numbing the area.''For simple, uncomplicated black eyes, the treatment prescribed by health care professionals is similar to home treatment:''Avoid possibly injurious activities until after the eye has healed.'""For more complicated injuries, the patient may be referred to an appropriate specialist; such as an ophthalmologist, who can treat the patient's injuries to the eye itself, or an otorhinolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat [ENT]), or an oral/maxillofacial surgeon for ""'fractures'' to the face.'   Apply ice for 20 minutes every hour for the first 24 hours (a package of frozen vegetables such as peas or corn can be used as it will conform to the shape of the face better than ice cubes). To avoid potential cold injury to the site, wrap the ice or frozen object in a cloth or use a commercial ice pack. Do not use raw meat on a black eye, as putting potentially bacteria-laden meat on a mucous membrane or an open skin injury can be dangerous. ice; pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) (avoid taking aspirin [unless prescribed by your doctor or cardiologist for your heart] because this may increase bleeding); rest; and protection of the injured area."
What are the complications of black eye?,"'Black eye in itself usually is a minor condition that resolves on its own. Severe injuries, especially forceful blunt ''trauma'' to the eye area may result in complications.''Traumatic ''uveitis'' and ''iritis'' ''(iritis is a type of ''uveitis'') result from blunt ''trauma'' to the eye. A black eye may be the first sign of this condition. Iritis generally affects only one eye. Signs and symptoms of ''uveitis'' (and iritis) may include:''Any of these symptoms should be brought to the attention of a physician.''Hyphema'' is an accumulation of blood in the front (anterior) chamber of the eye following injury and can cause damage to the interior tissues of the eye. The amount of blood may be too small to see with the naked eye, or the entire front of the eye may fill with blood.''Glaucoma'' may also result from blunt trauma to the eye, and can occur immediately or years later. The force of the trauma can cause bleeding inside the eye which leads to an increase in eye pressure, and damages the ''optic nerve''. Delayed onset ''glaucoma'' (angle recession ''glaucoma'') can occur as ''scar tissue'' from the injury builds in the eye.''Orbital floor fracture'' (blowout fracture) may also occur as a result of the forceful blunt trauma to the eye. The force of the blow pushes the eyeball further into the eye socket, fracturing the very thin walls of bone that make up the eye socket. This can lead to pinching (entrapment) of the ''optic nerve'' and the muscles that move the eye. Loss of vision or ''double vision'' can result and must be treated emergently.''Retinal detachment'' can result in permanent ''vision loss''. Trauma to the eye can lift or pull the retina from its normal position, lining the back of the eyeball. Symptoms include partial or total loss of vision or flashing lights or spots in the field of vision and must be treated immediately.'   reddened eye (especially around the iris, the colored part of the eyeball); pain that increases with exposure to bright light; a small or irregularly shaped pupil; floating spots before the eyes; or blurred vision."
How can I prevent a black eye?,"'Black eye injury can be avoided with basic injury ''prevention''.' Check the home for items that might cause a fall, such as throw rugs or objects on the floor (such as toys). Wear the appropriate protective gear for any athletic or work-related activity. Wear goggles or other eye protection when working, doing yard work, or other hobbies and sports that may be injurious to the eyes. Wear seat belts while driving and wear helmets when riding a motorcycle."
Facts you should know about blackheads,"  Blackheads are composed of dried sebum (oil) and dead skin cells. Blackheads can be present in a number of skin diseases. Blackheads are a prime component of teenage acne. Blackhead removal, unless performed by a professional, can produce significant skin trauma."
What are blackheads?,"'When the opening of a pore (''hair follicle'' orifice) becomes occluded with sebum (oil) and dead skin cells, which then solidifies, the surface color often darkens. This is what is commonly called a ''blackhead''. There are a number of ''skin conditions'' in which blackheads are an important component. The medical name of this structure is a ''comedo'' (plural: ''comedones'').' "
Blackheads vs. whiteheads (pimples),"'The black color of the surface of the ''comedo'' is thought to be due to the oxidation of the fat molecules in the sebum. If the surface of the comedo is covered by skin, this oxidation does not occur and the structure might be called by some ""a ''whitehead''"" or ''pimple''. This terminology could be confused with a ''pustule'', which may often occur at or near a follicular orifice.' "
What are causes and risk factors for blackheads?,"'Blackheads are most often recognized early in the course of ''acne vulgaris'', the inflammatory skin disease that affects the face, back, and chest of almost all ''teens'' as they go through ''puberty''. They are thought to be the first sign of teenage ''acne'' and contain inflammatory substances the start the ''acne'' process. Elastotic degeneration of the skin affects sun-exposed areas, mostly on the face. The yellowish bumpy deposits of degenerated collagen are often accompanied by numerous blackheads. Chloracne is a condition caused by the absorption of dioxins, which are well known toxins often encountered as a byproduct in the manufacture of herbicides and defoliants. ''Comedones'' are seen on the exposed skin in certain workers exposed to insoluble cutting oils in the metal machining industry. Certain topical hair products are known to induce blackheads on the adjacent skin, resulting in a condition called ""pomade ''acne''."" ''Makeup'' ''cosmetics'' occasionally may contain comedogenic substances. Certain anti-''seizure'' and antipsychotic medications are thought to induce comedones. Certain rare ''birthmarks'' called epithelial ''nevi'' may contain many blackheads. Sometimes a follicular orifice may become so dilated that after it becomes filled with dried sebum and skin it is termed a ""giant pore of Winer.""' "
What are signs and symptoms of blackheads?,"'Blackhead rarely produce symptoms in themselves. Blackheads often are a sign of some of the previously listed ''skin conditions''. Most of the time, these little black dots are of no significance aside from their cosmetic appearance, which is dramatically enhanced when using a magnifying mirror.' "
What types of specialists diagnose and treat blackheads?,"'You do not have to be a specialist to recognize a blackhead. Occasionally, a magnifying glass can be helpful. If they become a bothersome problem, a dermatologist may see you for treatment strategies. A dermatologist specializes in the treatment of ''acne'' and other skin diseases and conditions.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose blackheads?,"'A health care professional, most often a dermatologist, will likely be able to explain which skin condition is responsible for producing the blackheads.' "
What are the types of treatment options for blackhead removal?,"'If blackheads are a significant problem, it may be necessary to apply a prescription topical retinoid like ''tretinoin''\xa0(Refissa, ''Atralin'', Tretin-X) or ''tazarotene''\xa0(''Tazorac'', ''Avage'') to successfully get rid of the blackhead. Occasionally physicians may remove a blackhead. Most often this procedure is performed by a trained esthetician, a ''skin care'' specialist, who ought to be able to get rid of the blackhead without damaging the adjacent skin.' "
Are there home remedies that get rid of blackheads?,"'Salicylic acid pads and/or 12% ''ammonium lactate'' lotion can be found in most pharmacies. They contain a chemical that exfoliates or loosens the blackhead so that it is possible to remove the blackhead when a person cleans his/her face. Comedo extractors can be purchased in most pharmacies and from Internet retailers. These small metallic devices have a small opening in a spatula-like tip, which when pressed over the blackhead produces enough side pressure on the skin to get rid of the oil plug from the blocked pore. This might not be the best option because it is possible that the untrained operator (the patient) will be too aggressive and produce more damage than benefit. Other options for comedo removal include vacuum suction and pore strips. There is little compelling evidence that blackhead removal produces any lasting benefit.' "
Is it possible to prevent blackheads?,'A person can prevent blackheads by treating the skin condition responsible for their presence. This is most effectively done by a dermatologist.' 
What is the prognosis for blackheads?,"'Since most blackheads are due to ''acne'', which is limited to ''puberty'' in most people, it is likely that they ultimately will resolve spontaneously.' "
What is the bladder?,"'The urinary bladder, or the bladder, is a hollow organ in the pelvis. Most of it lies behind the pubic bone of the pelvis, but when full of urine, it can extend up into the lower part of the abdomen. Its primary function is to store urine that drains into it from the kidney through tube-like structures called the ureters. The ureters from both the kidneys open into the urinary bladder. The bladder forms a low-pressure reservoir that gradually stretches out as urine fills into it. In males, the ''prostate gland'' is located adjacent to the base of the bladder where urethra joins the bladder. From time to time, the muscular wall of the bladder contracts to expel urine through the urinary passage (urethra) into the outside world. The normal volume of the full bladder is about 400 ml-600 ml, or about 2 cups.'  "
What are the layers of the bladder?,"'The bladder consists of three layers of tissue. The innermost layer of the bladder, which comes in contact with the urine stored inside the bladder, is called the ""mucosa"" and consists of several layers of specialized cells called ""transitional cells,"" which are almost exclusively found in the urinary system of the body. These same cells also form the inner lining of the ureters, kidneys, and a part of the urethra. These cells form a waterproof lining within these organs to prevent the urine from going into the deeper tissue layers. These cells are also termed ''urothelial cells'', and the mucosa is termed the ''urothelium''.''The middle layer is a thin lining known as the ""lamina propria"" and forms the boundary between the inner ""mucosa"" and the outer muscular layer. This layer has a network of blood vessels and nerves and is an important landmark in terms of the staging of bladder cancer (described in detail below in the bladder cancer staging section).''The outer layer of the bladder (the ""muscularis"") comprises of the ""detrusor"" muscle. This is the thickest layer of the bladder wall. Its main function is to relax slowly as the bladder fills up to provide low-pressure urine storage and then to contract to compress the bladder and expel the urine out during the act of passing urine. Outside these three layers is a variable amount of fat that lines and protects the bladder like a soft cushion and separates it from the surrounding organs such as the rectum and the muscles and bones of the pelvis.' "
What is bladder cancer?,"'Bladder cancer is an uncontrolled abnormal growth and multiplication of cells in the urinary bladder, which have broken free from the normal mechanisms that keep uncontrolled cell growth in check. Invasive bladder cancer (like ''cancers'' of other organs) has the ability to spread (''metastasize'') to other body parts, including the ''lungs'', bones, and ''liver''.''Bladder cancer invariably starts from the innermost layer of the bladder (for example, the mucosa) and may invade into the deeper layers as it grows. Alternately, it may remain confined to the mucosa for a prolonged period. Visually, it may appear in various forms. Most common is a shrub-like appearance (papillary), but it may also appear as a nodule, an irregular solid growth or a flat, barely perceptible thickening of the inner bladder wall (see details in subsequent sections).' "
What is the burden of bladder cancer in the U.S.?,"'Bladder cancer has the dubious distinction of inclusion on the top 10 list of cancers, with an estimated 81,190 new cases occurring in 2017 within the U.S. Bladder cancer is three to four times more likely to be diagnosed in men than in women and about two times higher in white men than in African-American men. Bladder cancer killed approximately 17,240 people in the U.S. in 2017. In the U.S., the bladder cancer risk for men is about one in 26 and for women about one in 90.' "
What are the types of bladder cancer?,"'Bladder cancer is classified based on the appearance of its cells under the microscope (histological type). The type of bladder cancer has implications in selecting the appropriate treatment for the disease. For example, certain types may not respond to ''radiation'' and chemotherapy as well as others. The histological type of the cancer may also impact the extent of surgery required for maximizing the chances of cure. In addition, physicians often describe bladder cancer based on its position in the wall of the bladder. Noninvasive bladder cancers occur in the inner layer of cells (transitional cell epithelium) but do not penetrate into deeper layers. Invasive cancers penetrate into the deeper layers such as the muscle layer. Invasive cancers are more difficult to treat.''The more common types of bladder cancer are as follows:' Urothelial carcinoma (previously known as ""transitional cell carcinoma"") is the most common type and comprises 90%-95% of all bladder cancers. This type of cancer has two subtypes: papillary carcinoma (growing finger-like projections into the bladder lumen) and flat carcinomas that do not produce fingerlike projections. Urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) is strongly associated with cigarette smoking. Adenocarcinoma of the bladder comprises about 1%-2% of all bladder cancers and is associated with prolonged inflammation and irritation. Most adenocarcinomas of the bladder are invasive. Squamous cell carcinoma comprises 1%-2% of bladder cancers and is also associated with prolonged infection, inflammation, and irritation such as that associated with longstanding stones in the bladder. In certain parts of the Middle East and Africa (for example, Egypt), this is the predominant form of bladder cancer and is associated with chronic infection caused by Schistosoma worm (a blood fluke, that causes schistosomiasis, also termed bilharzia or snail fever). Other rare forms of cancer found in the bladder include small cell cancer (arising in neuroendocrine cells), pheochromocytoma (rare), and sarcoma (in muscle tissue)."
What are bladder cancer causes and risk factors?,"'Cigarette smoking'' causes about 50% of all bladder cancers. The longer and heavier the exposure, greater are the chances of developing bladder cancer. The toxic chemicals in ''cigarette'' smoke, many of which are known cancer-causing substances (carcinogens), travel in the bloodstream after being absorbed from the lungs; the kidneys filter the chemicals into the urine. Then they contact the cells in the inner lining of the urinary system, including the bladder, and cause changes within these cells that make them more prone to developing into cancer cells. Quitting ''smoking'' decreases the risk of developing bladder cancer but takes many years to reach the level of people who have never smoked. However, as time passes after the quit date, the risk progressively decreases. In view of the above, it is extremely important for patients with bladder cancer to stop ''smoking'' completely since the chances of the cancer coming back after treatment are higher in those people who continue to smoke.''People who smoke also have a higher risk of many other types of cancer, including ''acute leukemia'' and cancers of the lung, lip, mouth, larynx, ''esophagus'', stomach, and pancreas. Smokers also have a higher risk of diseases like ''heart attacks'', ''peripheral vascular disease'', ''diabetes'', ''stroke'', bone loss (''osteoporosis''), ''emphysema'', and ''bronchitis''.''Age and family history are other risk factors as is male sex. About 90% of people with bladder cancer are over age 55, though in exceptional cases the disease may surface in the third or fourth decade of life. Men are more prone to developing bladder cancer probably due to a higher incidence of smoking and exposure to toxic chemicals. A close relative with a history of bladder cancer may increase the predisposition for the development of this disease.''Exposure to toxic chemicals such as arsenic, phenols, aniline dyes, and arylamines increase the risk of bladder cancer. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk.''Radiation therapy'' (such as that for prostate or ''cervical cancer'') and chemotherapy with ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan'') increases the risk for development of bladder cancer. Moreover, it may also delay the diagnosis of bladder cancer in patients who have blood in their urine, since the patient and/or physician may incorrectly blame bladder irritation caused by the chemotherapy or radiation (radiation ''cystitis'') as the cause of the bleeding.''Long-term chronic infections of the bladder, irritation due to stones or foreign bodies, and infections with the blood fluke prevalent in certain regions of the world (as mentioned earlier) are some other factors that predispose to bladder cancer.' "
What are bladder cancer symptoms and signs?,"'The most common symptom of bladder cancer is bleeding in the urine (hematuria). Most often the bleeding is ""gross"" (visible to the naked eye), episodic (occurs in episodes), and is not associated with ''pain'' (painless hematuria). However, sometimes the bleeding may only be visible under a microscope (microscopic hematuria) or may be associated with ''pain'' due to the blockage of urine by formation of ''blood clots''. There may be no symptoms or bleeding for prolonged periods between episodes, lulling the patient into a false sense of security (""I don\'t know what the problem was, but it is fine now!""). Some types of bladder cancer may cause irritative symptoms of the bladder with little or no bleeding. The patients may have the desire to urinate small amounts in short intervals (increased urinary frequency), an inability to hold the urine for any length of time after the initial desire to void (urgency), or a burning sensation while passing urine (''dysuria''). These symptoms occur more commonly in patients with high-grade, flat urothelial cancers called ""''carcinoma in situ''"" or ""CIS"" (described subsequently in the section on staging of bladder cancer). Other problems may cause blood to appear in the urine; for example, infections, ''kidney stones'', and ''kidney disease'', so it is important to have a physician check for the exact cause of ''blood in the urine''.''Rarely, patients may have signs and symptoms of more advanced disease such as' 

Read Doctor's View
   a distended bladder (due to obstruction by a tumor at the bladder neck), an inability to pass any urine, pain in the flanks (due to obstruction of urine flow from kidney to the bladder by the growing tumor mass in the bladder), bone pains, foot and/or ankle swelling, or cough/blood in the phlegm (due to spread to cancer cells to bones or lungs)."
How do health care professionals diagnose bladder cancer?,"'Bladder cancer is most frequently diagnosed by investigating the cause of bleeding in the urine that a patient has noticed. The following are investigations or tests that come in handy in such circumstances:'   Urinalysis: A simple urine test that can confirm that there is bleeding in the urine and can provide an idea about whether an infection is present or not. It is usually one of the first tests that a physician requests. It does not confirm that a person has bladder cancer but can help the physician in short-listing the potential causes of bleeding. Urine cytology: A health care professional performs the test on a urine sample that is centrifuged. Then a pathologist examines the sediment under a microscope. The idea is to detect malformed cancerous cells that may pass into the urine from a cancer. A positive test is quite specific for cancer (for example, it provides a high degree of certainty that cancer is present in the urinary system). However, many early bladder cancers may be missed by this test so a negative or inconclusive test does not effectively rule out the presence of bladder cancer. Ultrasound: An ultrasound examination of the bladder can detect bladder tumors. It can also detect the presence of swelling in the kidneys in case the bladder tumor is located at a spot where it can potentially block the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder. It can also detect other causes of bleeding, such as stones in the urinary system or prostate enlargement, which may be the cause of the symptoms or may coexist with a bladder tumor. An X-ray examination may rule out other causes of symptoms. CT scan/MRI: A CT scan or MRI provides greater visual detail than an ultrasound exam and may detect smaller tumors in the kidneys or bladder than can be detected by an ultrasound. It can also detect other causes of bleeding more effectively than ultrasound, especially when intravenous contrast is used. Cystoscopy and biopsy: This is probably the single most important investigation for bladder cancer. Since there is always a chance to miss bladder tumors on imaging investigations (ultrasound/CT/MRI) and urine cytology, it is recommended that all patients with bleeding in the urine, without an obvious cause, should have a cystoscopy performed by a urologist as a part of the initial evaluation. This entails the use of a thin tube-like optical instrument connected to a camera and a light source (cystoscope). A health care provider passes it through the urethra into the bladder and the inner surface of the bladder is visualized on a video monitor. Small or flat tumors that may not be visible on other investigations are visible by this method, and a piece of this tissue can be taken as a biopsy for examination under the microscope. This method effectively diagnoses the presence and type of bladder cancer. In addition, health care professionals may perform fluorescence cystoscopy at the same time; fluorescent dyes are placed in the bladder and are taken up by cancer cells. These cancer cells are visible (fluoresce) when a blue light is shined on them through the cystoscope and thus become visible, thereby making identification of cancer cells easier with this technique. Newer biomarkers like NMP 22 and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) are currently in use to detect bladder cancer cells by a simple urine test. UroVysion, BTA, and the ImmunoCyt test are newer diagnostic tests. However, they have not yet achieved the level of accuracy to replace cystoscopy and cytology in the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder cancer."
How do health care professionals determine bladder cancer staging?,"""Bladder cancer is staged using the tumor node metastases (TNM) system developed by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) in 1997 and updated and used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). In addition, the American Urologic Association (AUA) has a similar staging system that varies slightly from that used by the AJCC. The combination of both staging systems appears below. This staging gives your physician a complete picture of the extent of the person's bladder cancer.""'The T stage refers to the depth of penetration of the tumor from the innermost lining to the deeper layers of the bladder. The T stages are as follows:''The presence and extent of involvement of the lymph nodes in the pelvic region of the body near the urinary bladder determines the N stage. The N stages are as follows:''The metastases or the M stage signifies the presence or absence of the spread of bladder cancer to other organs of the body.''A health care professional then assigns a stage:''The proper staging of bladder cancer is an essential step that has significant bearings on the management of this condition. The implications of bladder stage are as follows:' Tx - Primary tumor cannot be evaluated T0 - No primary tumor Ta - Noninvasive papillary carcinoma (tumor limited to the innermost lining or the epithelium) Tis - Carcinoma in situ (flat tumor) T1 - Tumor invades connective tissue under the epithelium (surface layer) T2 - Tumor invades muscle of the bladderT2a - Superficial muscle affected (inner half)T2b - Deep muscle affected (outer half) T2a - Superficial muscle affected (inner half) T2b - Deep muscle affected (outer half) T3 - Tumor invades perivesical (around the bladder) fatty tissueT3a - Microscopically (visible only on examination under the microscope)T3b - Macroscopically (for example, visible tumor mass on the outer bladder tissue) T3a - Microscopically (visible only on examination under the microscope) T3b - Macroscopically (for example, visible tumor mass on the outer bladder tissue) T4 - Tumor spreads beyond fatty tissue and invades any of the following: prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, or abdominal wall Nx - Regional lymph nodes cannot be evaluated N0 - No regional lymph node metastasis N1 - Metastasis in a single lymph node < 2 cm in size N2 - Metastasis in a single lymph node > 2 cm, but < 5 cm in size, or two or more lymph nodes < 5 cm in size N3 - Metastasis in a lymph node > 5 cm in size and/or to lymph nodes along the common iliac artery Mx - Distant metastasis cannot be evaluated (This stage is not used by some clinicians.) M0 - No distant metastasis M1 - Distant metastasis Stage 0a Ta N0 M0 Stage 0is Tis N0 M0 Stage 1 T1 N0 M0 Stage 2 T2 N0 M0 Stage 3 T3 N0M0 Stage 4 T4 N0 M0, or any T, N1 or above M0 , or any T, any N, M1 It helps select proper treatment for the patient. Less aggressive treatment manages superficial disease (Ta/T1/Tis) as compared to invasive disease (T2/T3/T4). Invasive tumors have a higher likelihood of spread to lymph nodes and distant organs as compared to superficial tumors. The chances of cure and long-term survival progressively decrease as the bladder cancer stage increases. Staging allows proper classification of patients into groups for research studies and study of newer treatments."
What is bladder cancer grading?,"'A pathologist examines the tumor specimen under a microscope to determine the grading of the bladder cancer. It is a measure of the extent by which the tumor cells differ in their appearance from normal bladder cells. The greater the distortion of appearance, the higher the grade assigned. High-grade cancers are more aggressive than low-grade ones and have a greater propensity to invade into the bladder wall and spread to other parts of the body. An example of grading is as follows:''Depending upon which cancer organization your clinician follows, the grades above may differ slightly. In general, they all follow the same pattern. Bladder cancers with a higher number (zero through four) are more aggressive and more difficult to treat.''In 2010, the World Health Organization and the International Society of Urologic Pathology agreed to assign the cancers grades based upon the above descriptions, shortened to G1, G2, G3, and G4.''GX is used in cases where grading cannot be assessed for technical or clinical reasons.'""However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended changing bladder grading to only two categories; the first category being well differentiated or low grade and the second category being poorly differentiated or high grade. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is adopting these categories. The older categories listed above may still be used by some clinicians and may be listed in individual patient's medical records, so they were included here.""'Stage and grade of bladder cancer play a very important role not just in deciding the treatment that an individual patient should receive but also in quantifying the chances of success with that treatment. Of note, carcinoma in situ (CIS or Tis, as mentioned in the section on staging) is always high grade.' Grade 1 cancers (or low grade or well differentiated cancers) have cells that look very much like normal cells. They tend to grow slowly and are not likely to spread. Grade 2 cancers have cells that look more abnormal. They are called medium grade or moderately differentiated and may grow or spread more quickly than low grade. Grade 3 cancers have cells that look very abnormal. They are called high grade or poorly differentiated and are more quickly growing and more likely to spread. Grade 4 cancers are so abnormal that they have no distinguishing features to say that they even started as bladder cells. They are undifferentiated."
What is transurethral surgery (TURBT) for bladder cancer?,"'The initial surgical procedure that a patient undergoes after the diagnosis of bladder cancer is established is usually a transurethral resection of bladder tumor or ""TURBT."" Health care professionals perform TURBT with the help of special instruments attached to a cystoscope (mentioned earlier in the section on investigations) and involves cutting out the tumor and removing it from the bladder with the help of an electrical cautery device. Doctors perform this surgery through the normal urinary passage and does not involve an external cut on the body. It is the initial treatment of bladder cancer as well as a staging procedure since the specimen retrieved from the surgery is sent to a pathologist who gives his/her diagnosis as to the depth of invasion of the tumor in the bladder wall (T stage) as well as the grade (high/low). Further treatment depends on the findings of this initial surgery as well as the other staging investigations and is covered in the sections to follow. TURBT is the most common treatment for bladder cancer.'  "
What is the treatment for superficial bladder cancer?,"'Superficial bladder cancer is a cancer that has not invaded the muscle wall of the bladder and is confined to the inner lining of the bladder. This cancer is also termed ''non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer''. The T stage is Ta, T1, or Tis (also known as carcinoma in situ or ""CIS""). After the initial TURBT or biopsy in case of CIS, the subsequent treatment in these cases may involve observation with regular follow-up with cystoscopy examinations of the bladder, instillation of medications in the bladder, or in certain cases, surgical removal of the bladder (radical cystectomy).''Small low-grade, superficial bladder cancers may not require aggressive management after the initial TURBT and may be simply followed up by doing repeated cystoscopy examinations at regular intervals (usually every three months for the initial two years and then at increasing intervals). Some physicians will use fulguration (laser or electricity) to treat biopsy areas or other small areas that may contain bladder cancer cells.''It is very important to note that 30%-40% of these tumors tend to recur and these recurrences may not be associated with any symptoms. Hence, it is imperative to stick to a regular follow-up protocol to ensure that the disease does not go out of control. A single dose of a chemotherapy medication (for example, mitomycin C [''Mutamycin'']) put inside the bladder immediately after a TURBT can decrease the chances of recurrence within the first two years after surgery.''High-grade, larger, multiple, or recurrent superficial bladder cancers may require additional treatment after the initial TURBT. One of the most effective and widely used medications is the Bacille Calmette Guerin, commonly referred to as BCG. It is a modified form of ''Mycobacterium bovis'', the bacterium that causes ''tuberculosis'' in cattle. Health care professionals instill BCG into the bladder in the form of a solution using a catheter placed in the urinary passage. It acts by stimulating the immune system of the body to act against the cancerous bladder cells and prevent their growth and development. It decreases the chances of recurrence of bladder cancer as well as its invasion into the muscle layer of the bladder. However, it is only partially effective in achieving these objectives, and its use does not obviate the need for a regular follow-up. It is usually administered in six initial doses at weekly intervals followed by a ""maintenance"" schedule of three weekly doses repeated every three months that is usually recommended for at least one year but may be needed for as long as three years.''Patients who do not respond to BCG treatment, have recurrent bladder cancer in spite of treatment, or those who have medical issues which preclude the use of BCG may require other forms of treatment. These include bladder instillation of immunotherapy agents such as ''interferon'' or chemotherapy medicines like valrubicin (''Valstar''), mitomycin C, epirubicin (''Ellence''), or doxorubicin (''Adriamycin''). In general, these medications are not as effective as BCG and help only a small minority of patients who have not responded to BCG.''Patients who have an aggressive form of high-grade superficial bladder cancer and those who have not responded or who have recurrent bladder cancer in spite of treatments mentioned above receive a more aggressive form of treatment. This is usually in the form of a major surgical procedure called radical cystectomy. Cystectomy entails removal of the bladder and the prostate and diverting the urinary stream using parts of the intestine.'  "
What is surveillance for bladder cancer?,"'Patients diagnosed and treated for superficial bladder cancer need regular follow-up to detect recurrences and treat them effectively. The following is a typical follow-up protocol:''Cystoscopy and cytology detect recurrence in the bladder itself while CT/IVU detects a tumor in the kidneys and ureters. Patients with bladder cancer are more likely to get upper urinary tract (kidney and ureter) tumors that arise from the inner lining of these organs and share a common origin with bladder tumors. The risk of upper urinary tract recurrence depends on the stage and grade of the initial disease and the response of the tumor to BCG. Individuals with recurrent high-grade bladder tumors can have a risk of developing a tumor in the upper tracts.''Commercially available tumor markers that test urine samples for evidence of bladder tumor recurrence are also being used in follow-up protocols. However, their exact role is undefined as of now, and they are not an adequate substitute for cystoscopy and cytology. Some of these tests and markers are NMP 22, BTA Stat, BTA Trak, and UroVysion.' Cystoscopy and urine cytology every three months for two years, every six months for the next two to three years, and annually thereafter Imaging study (CT scan/intravenous urogram) of the kidneys and ureters once every year (especially for high-grade tumors/those associated with CIS)"
What is the treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer?,"'Muscle invasive bladder cancer generally requires a more aggressive treatment plan than superficial bladder cancer. The standard and most effective treatment is the surgical removal of the bladder and diversion of the urinary stream using intestinal segments. This procedure, known as radical cystectomy, is a major operation; the doctor and patient should have a thorough discussion about the risks, complications, and benefits prior to this surgical procedure.''In short, the procedure entails removal of the bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and the fatty tissue around the bladder through an incision made in the abdomen. The surgery also includes removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis on both sides of the bladder to detect their involvement with the cancer. This helps in deciding further management after surgery, including the need for chemotherapy. Patients who undergo a thorough lymph node dissection have a better chance of cure as compared to patients who either do not receive one or undergo a less extensive dissection.''Radical cystectomy can be performed via open surgery, ''laparoscopy'"", or with robotic assistance. The outcomes in terms of cancer control and cure rates do not differ between these different approaches. However, the use of laparoscopic and robotic approaches significantly decreases blood loss during the surgery, decreases the need for blood transfusions, and may help in early recovery by decreasing postoperative pain at the surgical site. An additional advantage of the robot is that it permits an enhanced magnification of the surgical field with three-dimensional vision, which helps to enhance surgical precision. It is very important to note that all these approaches can achieve comparable results in terms of cancer control in the hands of surgeons skilled and experienced in a particular modality. So, the comfort factor and experience of an individual surgeon in a particular approach should play a major role in the patient's decision regarding selection of the approach for surgery.""'The physician must divert the urine once the bladder has been removed. There are three popular ways of doing that. All of them require the use of segments of the intestine that are still connected to their blood supply but have been disconnected from the gastrointestinal tract.''Radical cystectomy (open, laparoscopic, or robot assisted) combined with one of the three urinary diversion methods is the gold standard for the treatment of muscle invasive and selected cases of high-grade superficial bladder cancer. Certain patients, however, may be unfit or unwilling to undergo this surgery. Segmental, or partial cystectomy is rarely done. Bladder cancer is so often multifocal in the bladder that such an approach is rarely effective. These patients can often undergo a combination of extensive TURBT, chemotherapy, and radiation in an attempt to cure or control the disease without the need to remove the urinary bladder surgically. Most experts believe that this regime may not be as effective as a radical cystectomy, but it is an option in unfit/unwilling patients. Radiation to the bladder can, however, lead to its own set of problems and complications, including radiation damage to the bladder and rectum that give rise to bleeding and irritative symptoms (""radiation cystitis"" and ""radiation proctitis"").' Ileal conduit is the most extensively used form of urinary diversion. It is also the simplest and the least time-consuming form of diversion and has the least chances of complications in the short and long term. This entails the use of an intestinal segment, one end of which is connected inside the body to the ureters that drain urine into it from the kidneys, while the other end is brought out to the level of the skin and is covered by an external appliance (a ""urostomy bag""). The urine from the kidneys continuously drains into the bag through the ureters and the ""ileal conduit."" A patient can empty the bag at regular intervals or when it is nearly full by opening a tap-like attachment at the lower end of the bag. The major advantage of this procedure is that is relatively straightforward to perform with the least chances of complications. The disadvantages include the need to wear a bag all the time and the resultant negative impact that may occur on body image. This procedure is also termed incontinent diversion. Orthotopic neobladder entails the creation of a new bladder (""neobladder"") with the help of an intestinal segment and connecting it to the natural urinary passage so that a person may be able to pass urine ""more normally."" The major advantage of this procedure is that it avoids the need to wear a bag, and the patient can pass urine in a more natural fashion. However, this is a more difficult procedure with a longer recovery period and may lead to some short-term and long-term complications, including persistent urinary leakage and inability to pass urine requiring the use of self-intermittent catheterization (passage of a tube into the urinary passage to empty the bladder). The ileal conduit rather than the neobladder may best serve some senior patients and those with certain medical conditions that affect the function of the kidneys or impair their ability to self-catheterize. Continent catheterizable pouch (for example, ""Indiana pouch"") is a form of neobladder that is not connected to the normal urinary passage but instead has an opening or a ""stoma"" at the level of the skin on the abdomen through which a catheter can be passed to empty it periodically. This has a valve-like mechanism that prevents the leakage of urine through this opening thereby precluding the need to wear a bag. It is used it patients desirous of and fit for a continent urinary system while being unsuitable for an orthotopic neobladder due to certain circumstances such as cancer at the point where the bladder joins the urethra. This procedure is also termed continent diversion."
What is chemotherapy for bladder cancer?,"'Patients who are diagnosed with metastatic bladder cancer (M stage - M1; cancer which has spread to other parts of the body) are usually treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may also be used in cases of ""locally advanced"" bladder cancer (T stage - T3 and above and/or N stage - N1 and above) in an attempt to decrease the chances of the cancer coming back after radical cystectomy. This is ""''adjuvant chemotherapy''."" Another strategy entails administering ""neoadjuvant chemotherapy"" by giving these medications before radical cystectomy in an attempt to improve the results of surgery and decrease the size of the tumor before the operation.''Chemotherapy has the potential to control metastatic bladder cancer and increase the chances of cure when used in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting along with surgery. However, chemotherapy has its own set of side effects that some individuals find intolerable.''The time-honored chemotherapy regimen for bladder cancer is the MVAC. It is a combination of four medications given in cyclical form.''Oncologists currently prescribe MVAC in a ""dose dense"" fashion. This means the patient takes the ''drugs'' more frequently than was previously done in the accepted treatment schedule, as well as taking growth factors to help the blood counts to recover faster from the effects of the chemotherapy drugs. The older schedule for MVAC therapy is no longer recommended according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.''Some patients with ''heart disease'' may not be in a condition to receive Adriamycin and may receive ''CMV'' instead (''CMV'' = MVAC without Adriamycin)''An alternative regimen is a combination of gemcitabine (''Gemzar'') and cisplatin. Physicians use this more often nowadays since some studies have shown that it is equally effective as the MVAC regime with fewer side effects. However, about 40%-50% of patients have medical issues that preclude the use of this therapy.''Cisplatin, which is the main medication in all these regimens, is not given to patients who have an abnormal kidney function. In this case, doctors may substitute it with carboplatin (''Paraplatin''), which, however, is not as effective as cisplatin-based chemotherapy.''Chemotherapy is an ever-changing method to reduce or eliminate cancer cells; it is best for patients to discuss this therapy with their doctors. Variations in chemotherapy treatments occur among clinicians and one patient’s therapy may be quite different from that of another patient. In addition, health care professionals may introduce newer compounds at any time that may be advantageous to use instead of conventional chemotherapy agents. The following is a list of compounds that some clinicians use to treat various stages of bladder cancer, usually in combination with other anti-cancer cell compounds:''A few cancer treatment centers use, in addition to chemotherapy and endoscopic resection, external radiation beam therapy to treat patients. However, the protocol is complex with toxicity and high pretreatment mortality (death) rates mainly due to ''sepsis'' from the chemotherapy. External beam radiation therapy is mainly used in other countries; it is infrequently used in the United States as a primary treatment. Its use to reduce pain from metastases of bladder cancer, especially to the bones, is still of value.''Immunotherapy drugs, such as atzolizumab (Tecentriq) and durvalumab (Imfinzi), also treat bladder cancer. These drugs block a molecule known as PD-L1 that leads to increased immune system (T-cell) activation and decreased tumor size; you should discuss with your doctors what individual treatments are best for your current condition.'   M: Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) V: Vinblastine A: Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) C: Cisplatin (Platinol-AQ) Paclitaxel Fluorouracil (5-FU) Gemcitabine Pemetrexed Vinblastine Valrubicin Carboplatin Ifosamide Thioepa Docetaxel"
What is the prognosis for bladder cancer?,"""The most important factors that affect the prognosis (or the chances of control and cure) of bladder cancer are the stage and grade of the tumor. The lower the stage and grade, the better the outlook. Other factors such as number, size, pattern of recurrence (if any), response to initial treatment like BCG, coexistent carcinoma in situ, and certain genetic mutations also play a role. The table below is based on the National Cancer Institute's database:""'For low-risk superficial bladder cancer (Ta, low grade), the chances of recurrence are about 50% in five years after the initial diagnosis. This necessitates regular follow-up, even in these low-risk tumors. However, unlike the more aggressive variants of bladder cancer, the chances of progression (for example, chances of the tumor invading into the deeper layers of the bladder) are minimal. Typically, these tumors, even when they recur, do so in the same stage and grade as the original tumor and do not compromise the life expectancy of the patient.''High-risk superficial tumors are those that are high-grade, T1 tumors and are associated with extensive areas of carcinoma in situ. Multiple tumors, large tumors, and those that recur despite BCG treatment are also at an increased risk for recurrence and progression. These tumors have a recurrence rate in the range of 50%-70% at one and five years, respectively. They are also much likely to invade into the deeper layers. Doctors need to manage these tumors more aggressively since they have a potential to invade and spread to other parts of the body thereby shortening the life expectancy of the patient.''After radical cystectomy, survival depends mostly on the stage of the disease. The five-year disease specific survival rate for various stages after a radical cystectomy is as follows:' T2, N0: 70%-80% T3, N0: 40%-50% T4, N0: 25%-30% N+ (patients with lymph node involvement): 15%-20%"
Is it possible to prevent bladder cancer?,"'The best way to prevent bladder cancer is to avoid exposure to agents that cause the disease. People who '""don't smoke""' are three to four times less likely to get bladder cancer as compared to smokers. Continuing to smoke after the diagnosis of bladder cancer portends a poorer outcome and increases the chance of the disease coming back after treatment. Avoidance of occupational exposure to cancer-causing chemicals such as aniline dyes may also be important. Despite research in this area no medication or dietary supplement has been conclusively demonstrated to decrease the risk of bladder cancer in normal individuals. However, recent studies of patients taking ''atorvastatin'' (''Lipitor'') to lower ''cholesterol'' have suggested the drug may lower the risk of prostatic cancer and by inference, bladder cancer, but this needs further study.' "
Where can people find more information on bladder cancer?,'A number of online resources are available for bladder cancer patients to gain more insight into this disease and its management. Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (http://www.bcan.org) is one such resource that provides a downloadable patient information handbook and links to patient support groups.''The National Cancer Institute (http://www.cancer.gov) also provides bladder cancer information.''The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (http://www.eortc.be/tools/''bladdercalculator) features a calculator that predicts the chances of recurrence and progression of superficial bladder cancer after initial treatment based on certain tumor characteristics.' 
What are topics of bladder cancer research?,"'Bladder cancer is a topic of intense scientific research currently. Basic science research is focused on finding and studying the genetic alterations (or changes in the human DNA) that predispose to bladder cancer in the hopes to discover new medications and treatments for curing the disease. Other areas of research include the following:''This field is likely to see significant advances in the years to come and hopefully would provide effective treatment strategies and hope for the millions of bladder cancer patients worldwide.' Newer molecular diagnostic tests to detect bladder cancer thereby avoiding the need for invasive tests like frequent cystoscopy examination Targeted therapy acts on genetic pathways responsible for bladder cancer; it is the next generation of chemotherapy for the disease. Newer surgical techniques, such as robotics, improve precision and accelerate patient recovery after bladder cancer surgery. Stem cell research for creation of urinary diversion during radical cystectomy without the need for intestinal segments"
What is the bladder?,"'The urinary bladder, or the bladder, is a hollow organ in the pelvis. Most of it lies behind the pubic bone of the pelvis, but when full of urine, it can extend up into the lower part of the abdomen. Its primary function is to store urine that drains into it from the kidney through tube-like structures called the ureters. The ureters from both the kidneys open into the urinary bladder. The bladder forms a low-pressure reservoir that gradually stretches out as urine fills into it. In males, the ''prostate gland'' is located adjacent to the base of the bladder where urethra joins the bladder. From time to time, the muscular wall of the bladder contracts to expel urine through the urinary passage (urethra) into the outside world. The normal volume of the full bladder is about 400 ml-600 ml, or about 2 cups.'  "
What are the layers of the bladder?,"'The bladder consists of three layers of tissue. The innermost layer of the bladder, which comes in contact with the urine stored inside the bladder, is called the ""mucosa"" and consists of several layers of specialized cells called ""transitional cells,"" which are almost exclusively found in the urinary system of the body. These same cells also form the inner lining of the ureters, kidneys, and a part of the urethra. These cells form a waterproof lining within these organs to prevent the urine from going into the deeper tissue layers. These cells are also termed ''urothelial cells'', and the mucosa is termed the ''urothelium''.''The middle layer is a thin lining known as the ""lamina propria"" and forms the boundary between the inner ""mucosa"" and the outer muscular layer. This layer has a network of blood vessels and nerves and is an important landmark in terms of the staging of bladder cancer (described in detail below in the bladder cancer staging section).''The outer layer of the bladder (the ""muscularis"") comprises of the ""detrusor"" muscle. This is the thickest layer of the bladder wall. Its main function is to relax slowly as the bladder fills up to provide low-pressure urine storage and then to contract to compress the bladder and expel the urine out during the act of passing urine. Outside these three layers is a variable amount of fat that lines and protects the bladder like a soft cushion and separates it from the surrounding organs such as the rectum and the muscles and bones of the pelvis.' "
What is bladder cancer?,"'Bladder cancer is an uncontrolled abnormal growth and multiplication of cells in the urinary bladder, which have broken free from the normal mechanisms that keep uncontrolled cell growth in check. Invasive bladder cancer (like ''cancers'' of other organs) has the ability to spread (''metastasize'') to other body parts, including the ''lungs'', bones, and ''liver''.''Bladder cancer invariably starts from the innermost layer of the bladder (for example, the mucosa) and may invade into the deeper layers as it grows. Alternately, it may remain confined to the mucosa for a prolonged period. Visually, it may appear in various forms. Most common is a shrub-like appearance (papillary), but it may also appear as a nodule, an irregular solid growth or a flat, barely perceptible thickening of the inner bladder wall (see details in subsequent sections).' "
What is the burden of bladder cancer in the U.S.?,"'Bladder cancer has the dubious distinction of inclusion on the top 10 list of cancers, with an estimated 81,190 new cases occurring in 2017 within the U.S. Bladder cancer is three to four times more likely to be diagnosed in men than in women and about two times higher in white men than in African-American men. Bladder cancer killed approximately 17,240 people in the U.S. in 2017. In the U.S., the bladder cancer risk for men is about one in 26 and for women about one in 90.' "
What are the types of bladder cancer?,"'Bladder cancer is classified based on the appearance of its cells under the microscope (histological type). The type of bladder cancer has implications in selecting the appropriate treatment for the disease. For example, certain types may not respond to ''radiation'' and chemotherapy as well as others. The histological type of the cancer may also impact the extent of surgery required for maximizing the chances of cure. In addition, physicians often describe bladder cancer based on its position in the wall of the bladder. Noninvasive bladder cancers occur in the inner layer of cells (transitional cell epithelium) but do not penetrate into deeper layers. Invasive cancers penetrate into the deeper layers such as the muscle layer. Invasive cancers are more difficult to treat.''The more common types of bladder cancer are as follows:' Urothelial carcinoma (previously known as ""transitional cell carcinoma"") is the most common type and comprises 90%-95% of all bladder cancers. This type of cancer has two subtypes: papillary carcinoma (growing finger-like projections into the bladder lumen) and flat carcinomas that do not produce fingerlike projections. Urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) is strongly associated with cigarette smoking. Adenocarcinoma of the bladder comprises about 1%-2% of all bladder cancers and is associated with prolonged inflammation and irritation. Most adenocarcinomas of the bladder are invasive. Squamous cell carcinoma comprises 1%-2% of bladder cancers and is also associated with prolonged infection, inflammation, and irritation such as that associated with longstanding stones in the bladder. In certain parts of the Middle East and Africa (for example, Egypt), this is the predominant form of bladder cancer and is associated with chronic infection caused by Schistosoma worm (a blood fluke, that causes schistosomiasis, also termed bilharzia or snail fever). Other rare forms of cancer found in the bladder include small cell cancer (arising in neuroendocrine cells), pheochromocytoma (rare), and sarcoma (in muscle tissue)."
What are bladder cancer causes and risk factors?,"'Cigarette smoking'' causes about 50% of all bladder cancers. The longer and heavier the exposure, greater are the chances of developing bladder cancer. The toxic chemicals in ''cigarette'' smoke, many of which are known cancer-causing substances (carcinogens), travel in the bloodstream after being absorbed from the lungs; the kidneys filter the chemicals into the urine. Then they contact the cells in the inner lining of the urinary system, including the bladder, and cause changes within these cells that make them more prone to developing into cancer cells. Quitting ''smoking'' decreases the risk of developing bladder cancer but takes many years to reach the level of people who have never smoked. However, as time passes after the quit date, the risk progressively decreases. In view of the above, it is extremely important for patients with bladder cancer to stop ''smoking'' completely since the chances of the cancer coming back after treatment are higher in those people who continue to smoke.''People who smoke also have a higher risk of many other types of cancer, including ''acute leukemia'' and cancers of the lung, lip, mouth, larynx, ''esophagus'', stomach, and pancreas. Smokers also have a higher risk of diseases like ''heart attacks'', ''peripheral vascular disease'', ''diabetes'', ''stroke'', bone loss (''osteoporosis''), ''emphysema'', and ''bronchitis''.''Age and family history are other risk factors as is male sex. About 90% of people with bladder cancer are over age 55, though in exceptional cases the disease may surface in the third or fourth decade of life. Men are more prone to developing bladder cancer probably due to a higher incidence of smoking and exposure to toxic chemicals. A close relative with a history of bladder cancer may increase the predisposition for the development of this disease.''Exposure to toxic chemicals such as arsenic, phenols, aniline dyes, and arylamines increase the risk of bladder cancer. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk.''Radiation therapy'' (such as that for prostate or ''cervical cancer'') and chemotherapy with ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan'') increases the risk for development of bladder cancer. Moreover, it may also delay the diagnosis of bladder cancer in patients who have blood in their urine, since the patient and/or physician may incorrectly blame bladder irritation caused by the chemotherapy or radiation (radiation ''cystitis'') as the cause of the bleeding.''Long-term chronic infections of the bladder, irritation due to stones or foreign bodies, and infections with the blood fluke prevalent in certain regions of the world (as mentioned earlier) are some other factors that predispose to bladder cancer.' "
What are bladder cancer symptoms and signs?,"'The most common symptom of bladder cancer is bleeding in the urine (hematuria). Most often the bleeding is ""gross"" (visible to the naked eye), episodic (occurs in episodes), and is not associated with ''pain'' (painless hematuria). However, sometimes the bleeding may only be visible under a microscope (microscopic hematuria) or may be associated with ''pain'' due to the blockage of urine by formation of ''blood clots''. There may be no symptoms or bleeding for prolonged periods between episodes, lulling the patient into a false sense of security (""I don\'t know what the problem was, but it is fine now!""). Some types of bladder cancer may cause irritative symptoms of the bladder with little or no bleeding. The patients may have the desire to urinate small amounts in short intervals (increased urinary frequency), an inability to hold the urine for any length of time after the initial desire to void (urgency), or a burning sensation while passing urine (''dysuria''). These symptoms occur more commonly in patients with high-grade, flat urothelial cancers called ""''carcinoma in situ''"" or ""CIS"" (described subsequently in the section on staging of bladder cancer). Other problems may cause blood to appear in the urine; for example, infections, ''kidney stones'', and ''kidney disease'', so it is important to have a physician check for the exact cause of ''blood in the urine''.''Rarely, patients may have signs and symptoms of more advanced disease such as' 

Read Doctor's View
   a distended bladder (due to obstruction by a tumor at the bladder neck), an inability to pass any urine, pain in the flanks (due to obstruction of urine flow from kidney to the bladder by the growing tumor mass in the bladder), bone pains, foot and/or ankle swelling, or cough/blood in the phlegm (due to spread to cancer cells to bones or lungs)."
How do health care professionals diagnose bladder cancer?,"'Bladder cancer is most frequently diagnosed by investigating the cause of bleeding in the urine that a patient has noticed. The following are investigations or tests that come in handy in such circumstances:'   Urinalysis: A simple urine test that can confirm that there is bleeding in the urine and can provide an idea about whether an infection is present or not. It is usually one of the first tests that a physician requests. It does not confirm that a person has bladder cancer but can help the physician in short-listing the potential causes of bleeding. Urine cytology: A health care professional performs the test on a urine sample that is centrifuged. Then a pathologist examines the sediment under a microscope. The idea is to detect malformed cancerous cells that may pass into the urine from a cancer. A positive test is quite specific for cancer (for example, it provides a high degree of certainty that cancer is present in the urinary system). However, many early bladder cancers may be missed by this test so a negative or inconclusive test does not effectively rule out the presence of bladder cancer. Ultrasound: An ultrasound examination of the bladder can detect bladder tumors. It can also detect the presence of swelling in the kidneys in case the bladder tumor is located at a spot where it can potentially block the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder. It can also detect other causes of bleeding, such as stones in the urinary system or prostate enlargement, which may be the cause of the symptoms or may coexist with a bladder tumor. An X-ray examination may rule out other causes of symptoms. CT scan/MRI: A CT scan or MRI provides greater visual detail than an ultrasound exam and may detect smaller tumors in the kidneys or bladder than can be detected by an ultrasound. It can also detect other causes of bleeding more effectively than ultrasound, especially when intravenous contrast is used. Cystoscopy and biopsy: This is probably the single most important investigation for bladder cancer. Since there is always a chance to miss bladder tumors on imaging investigations (ultrasound/CT/MRI) and urine cytology, it is recommended that all patients with bleeding in the urine, without an obvious cause, should have a cystoscopy performed by a urologist as a part of the initial evaluation. This entails the use of a thin tube-like optical instrument connected to a camera and a light source (cystoscope). A health care provider passes it through the urethra into the bladder and the inner surface of the bladder is visualized on a video monitor. Small or flat tumors that may not be visible on other investigations are visible by this method, and a piece of this tissue can be taken as a biopsy for examination under the microscope. This method effectively diagnoses the presence and type of bladder cancer. In addition, health care professionals may perform fluorescence cystoscopy at the same time; fluorescent dyes are placed in the bladder and are taken up by cancer cells. These cancer cells are visible (fluoresce) when a blue light is shined on them through the cystoscope and thus become visible, thereby making identification of cancer cells easier with this technique. Newer biomarkers like NMP 22 and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) are currently in use to detect bladder cancer cells by a simple urine test. UroVysion, BTA, and the ImmunoCyt test are newer diagnostic tests. However, they have not yet achieved the level of accuracy to replace cystoscopy and cytology in the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder cancer."
How do health care professionals determine bladder cancer staging?,"""Bladder cancer is staged using the tumor node metastases (TNM) system developed by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) in 1997 and updated and used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). In addition, the American Urologic Association (AUA) has a similar staging system that varies slightly from that used by the AJCC. The combination of both staging systems appears below. This staging gives your physician a complete picture of the extent of the person's bladder cancer.""'The T stage refers to the depth of penetration of the tumor from the innermost lining to the deeper layers of the bladder. The T stages are as follows:''The presence and extent of involvement of the lymph nodes in the pelvic region of the body near the urinary bladder determines the N stage. The N stages are as follows:''The metastases or the M stage signifies the presence or absence of the spread of bladder cancer to other organs of the body.''A health care professional then assigns a stage:''The proper staging of bladder cancer is an essential step that has significant bearings on the management of this condition. The implications of bladder stage are as follows:' Tx - Primary tumor cannot be evaluated T0 - No primary tumor Ta - Noninvasive papillary carcinoma (tumor limited to the innermost lining or the epithelium) Tis - Carcinoma in situ (flat tumor) T1 - Tumor invades connective tissue under the epithelium (surface layer) T2 - Tumor invades muscle of the bladderT2a - Superficial muscle affected (inner half)T2b - Deep muscle affected (outer half) T2a - Superficial muscle affected (inner half) T2b - Deep muscle affected (outer half) T3 - Tumor invades perivesical (around the bladder) fatty tissueT3a - Microscopically (visible only on examination under the microscope)T3b - Macroscopically (for example, visible tumor mass on the outer bladder tissue) T3a - Microscopically (visible only on examination under the microscope) T3b - Macroscopically (for example, visible tumor mass on the outer bladder tissue) T4 - Tumor spreads beyond fatty tissue and invades any of the following: prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, or abdominal wall Nx - Regional lymph nodes cannot be evaluated N0 - No regional lymph node metastasis N1 - Metastasis in a single lymph node < 2 cm in size N2 - Metastasis in a single lymph node > 2 cm, but < 5 cm in size, or two or more lymph nodes < 5 cm in size N3 - Metastasis in a lymph node > 5 cm in size and/or to lymph nodes along the common iliac artery Mx - Distant metastasis cannot be evaluated (This stage is not used by some clinicians.) M0 - No distant metastasis M1 - Distant metastasis Stage 0a Ta N0 M0 Stage 0is Tis N0 M0 Stage 1 T1 N0 M0 Stage 2 T2 N0 M0 Stage 3 T3 N0M0 Stage 4 T4 N0 M0, or any T, N1 or above M0 , or any T, any N, M1 It helps select proper treatment for the patient. Less aggressive treatment manages superficial disease (Ta/T1/Tis) as compared to invasive disease (T2/T3/T4). Invasive tumors have a higher likelihood of spread to lymph nodes and distant organs as compared to superficial tumors. The chances of cure and long-term survival progressively decrease as the bladder cancer stage increases. Staging allows proper classification of patients into groups for research studies and study of newer treatments."
What is bladder cancer grading?,"'A pathologist examines the tumor specimen under a microscope to determine the grading of the bladder cancer. It is a measure of the extent by which the tumor cells differ in their appearance from normal bladder cells. The greater the distortion of appearance, the higher the grade assigned. High-grade cancers are more aggressive than low-grade ones and have a greater propensity to invade into the bladder wall and spread to other parts of the body. An example of grading is as follows:''Depending upon which cancer organization your clinician follows, the grades above may differ slightly. In general, they all follow the same pattern. Bladder cancers with a higher number (zero through four) are more aggressive and more difficult to treat.''In 2010, the World Health Organization and the International Society of Urologic Pathology agreed to assign the cancers grades based upon the above descriptions, shortened to G1, G2, G3, and G4.''GX is used in cases where grading cannot be assessed for technical or clinical reasons.'""However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended changing bladder grading to only two categories; the first category being well differentiated or low grade and the second category being poorly differentiated or high grade. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is adopting these categories. The older categories listed above may still be used by some clinicians and may be listed in individual patient's medical records, so they were included here.""'Stage and grade of bladder cancer play a very important role not just in deciding the treatment that an individual patient should receive but also in quantifying the chances of success with that treatment. Of note, carcinoma in situ (CIS or Tis, as mentioned in the section on staging) is always high grade.' Grade 1 cancers (or low grade or well differentiated cancers) have cells that look very much like normal cells. They tend to grow slowly and are not likely to spread. Grade 2 cancers have cells that look more abnormal. They are called medium grade or moderately differentiated and may grow or spread more quickly than low grade. Grade 3 cancers have cells that look very abnormal. They are called high grade or poorly differentiated and are more quickly growing and more likely to spread. Grade 4 cancers are so abnormal that they have no distinguishing features to say that they even started as bladder cells. They are undifferentiated."
What is transurethral surgery (TURBT) for bladder cancer?,"'The initial surgical procedure that a patient undergoes after the diagnosis of bladder cancer is established is usually a transurethral resection of bladder tumor or ""TURBT."" Health care professionals perform TURBT with the help of special instruments attached to a cystoscope (mentioned earlier in the section on investigations) and involves cutting out the tumor and removing it from the bladder with the help of an electrical cautery device. Doctors perform this surgery through the normal urinary passage and does not involve an external cut on the body. It is the initial treatment of bladder cancer as well as a staging procedure since the specimen retrieved from the surgery is sent to a pathologist who gives his/her diagnosis as to the depth of invasion of the tumor in the bladder wall (T stage) as well as the grade (high/low). Further treatment depends on the findings of this initial surgery as well as the other staging investigations and is covered in the sections to follow. TURBT is the most common treatment for bladder cancer.'  "
What is the treatment for superficial bladder cancer?,"'Superficial bladder cancer is a cancer that has not invaded the muscle wall of the bladder and is confined to the inner lining of the bladder. This cancer is also termed ''non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer''. The T stage is Ta, T1, or Tis (also known as carcinoma in situ or ""CIS""). After the initial TURBT or biopsy in case of CIS, the subsequent treatment in these cases may involve observation with regular follow-up with cystoscopy examinations of the bladder, instillation of medications in the bladder, or in certain cases, surgical removal of the bladder (radical cystectomy).''Small low-grade, superficial bladder cancers may not require aggressive management after the initial TURBT and may be simply followed up by doing repeated cystoscopy examinations at regular intervals (usually every three months for the initial two years and then at increasing intervals). Some physicians will use fulguration (laser or electricity) to treat biopsy areas or other small areas that may contain bladder cancer cells.''It is very important to note that 30%-40% of these tumors tend to recur and these recurrences may not be associated with any symptoms. Hence, it is imperative to stick to a regular follow-up protocol to ensure that the disease does not go out of control. A single dose of a chemotherapy medication (for example, mitomycin C [''Mutamycin'']) put inside the bladder immediately after a TURBT can decrease the chances of recurrence within the first two years after surgery.''High-grade, larger, multiple, or recurrent superficial bladder cancers may require additional treatment after the initial TURBT. One of the most effective and widely used medications is the Bacille Calmette Guerin, commonly referred to as BCG. It is a modified form of ''Mycobacterium bovis'', the bacterium that causes ''tuberculosis'' in cattle. Health care professionals instill BCG into the bladder in the form of a solution using a catheter placed in the urinary passage. It acts by stimulating the immune system of the body to act against the cancerous bladder cells and prevent their growth and development. It decreases the chances of recurrence of bladder cancer as well as its invasion into the muscle layer of the bladder. However, it is only partially effective in achieving these objectives, and its use does not obviate the need for a regular follow-up. It is usually administered in six initial doses at weekly intervals followed by a ""maintenance"" schedule of three weekly doses repeated every three months that is usually recommended for at least one year but may be needed for as long as three years.''Patients who do not respond to BCG treatment, have recurrent bladder cancer in spite of treatment, or those who have medical issues which preclude the use of BCG may require other forms of treatment. These include bladder instillation of immunotherapy agents such as ''interferon'' or chemotherapy medicines like valrubicin (''Valstar''), mitomycin C, epirubicin (''Ellence''), or doxorubicin (''Adriamycin''). In general, these medications are not as effective as BCG and help only a small minority of patients who have not responded to BCG.''Patients who have an aggressive form of high-grade superficial bladder cancer and those who have not responded or who have recurrent bladder cancer in spite of treatments mentioned above receive a more aggressive form of treatment. This is usually in the form of a major surgical procedure called radical cystectomy. Cystectomy entails removal of the bladder and the prostate and diverting the urinary stream using parts of the intestine.'  "
What is surveillance for bladder cancer?,"'Patients diagnosed and treated for superficial bladder cancer need regular follow-up to detect recurrences and treat them effectively. The following is a typical follow-up protocol:''Cystoscopy and cytology detect recurrence in the bladder itself while CT/IVU detects a tumor in the kidneys and ureters. Patients with bladder cancer are more likely to get upper urinary tract (kidney and ureter) tumors that arise from the inner lining of these organs and share a common origin with bladder tumors. The risk of upper urinary tract recurrence depends on the stage and grade of the initial disease and the response of the tumor to BCG. Individuals with recurrent high-grade bladder tumors can have a risk of developing a tumor in the upper tracts.''Commercially available tumor markers that test urine samples for evidence of bladder tumor recurrence are also being used in follow-up protocols. However, their exact role is undefined as of now, and they are not an adequate substitute for cystoscopy and cytology. Some of these tests and markers are NMP 22, BTA Stat, BTA Trak, and UroVysion.' Cystoscopy and urine cytology every three months for two years, every six months for the next two to three years, and annually thereafter Imaging study (CT scan/intravenous urogram) of the kidneys and ureters once every year (especially for high-grade tumors/those associated with CIS)"
What is the treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer?,"'Muscle invasive bladder cancer generally requires a more aggressive treatment plan than superficial bladder cancer. The standard and most effective treatment is the surgical removal of the bladder and diversion of the urinary stream using intestinal segments. This procedure, known as radical cystectomy, is a major operation; the doctor and patient should have a thorough discussion about the risks, complications, and benefits prior to this surgical procedure.''In short, the procedure entails removal of the bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and the fatty tissue around the bladder through an incision made in the abdomen. The surgery also includes removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis on both sides of the bladder to detect their involvement with the cancer. This helps in deciding further management after surgery, including the need for chemotherapy. Patients who undergo a thorough lymph node dissection have a better chance of cure as compared to patients who either do not receive one or undergo a less extensive dissection.''Radical cystectomy can be performed via open surgery, ''laparoscopy'"", or with robotic assistance. The outcomes in terms of cancer control and cure rates do not differ between these different approaches. However, the use of laparoscopic and robotic approaches significantly decreases blood loss during the surgery, decreases the need for blood transfusions, and may help in early recovery by decreasing postoperative pain at the surgical site. An additional advantage of the robot is that it permits an enhanced magnification of the surgical field with three-dimensional vision, which helps to enhance surgical precision. It is very important to note that all these approaches can achieve comparable results in terms of cancer control in the hands of surgeons skilled and experienced in a particular modality. So, the comfort factor and experience of an individual surgeon in a particular approach should play a major role in the patient's decision regarding selection of the approach for surgery.""'The physician must divert the urine once the bladder has been removed. There are three popular ways of doing that. All of them require the use of segments of the intestine that are still connected to their blood supply but have been disconnected from the gastrointestinal tract.''Radical cystectomy (open, laparoscopic, or robot assisted) combined with one of the three urinary diversion methods is the gold standard for the treatment of muscle invasive and selected cases of high-grade superficial bladder cancer. Certain patients, however, may be unfit or unwilling to undergo this surgery. Segmental, or partial cystectomy is rarely done. Bladder cancer is so often multifocal in the bladder that such an approach is rarely effective. These patients can often undergo a combination of extensive TURBT, chemotherapy, and radiation in an attempt to cure or control the disease without the need to remove the urinary bladder surgically. Most experts believe that this regime may not be as effective as a radical cystectomy, but it is an option in unfit/unwilling patients. Radiation to the bladder can, however, lead to its own set of problems and complications, including radiation damage to the bladder and rectum that give rise to bleeding and irritative symptoms (""radiation cystitis"" and ""radiation proctitis"").' Ileal conduit is the most extensively used form of urinary diversion. It is also the simplest and the least time-consuming form of diversion and has the least chances of complications in the short and long term. This entails the use of an intestinal segment, one end of which is connected inside the body to the ureters that drain urine into it from the kidneys, while the other end is brought out to the level of the skin and is covered by an external appliance (a ""urostomy bag""). The urine from the kidneys continuously drains into the bag through the ureters and the ""ileal conduit."" A patient can empty the bag at regular intervals or when it is nearly full by opening a tap-like attachment at the lower end of the bag. The major advantage of this procedure is that is relatively straightforward to perform with the least chances of complications. The disadvantages include the need to wear a bag all the time and the resultant negative impact that may occur on body image. This procedure is also termed incontinent diversion. Orthotopic neobladder entails the creation of a new bladder (""neobladder"") with the help of an intestinal segment and connecting it to the natural urinary passage so that a person may be able to pass urine ""more normally."" The major advantage of this procedure is that it avoids the need to wear a bag, and the patient can pass urine in a more natural fashion. However, this is a more difficult procedure with a longer recovery period and may lead to some short-term and long-term complications, including persistent urinary leakage and inability to pass urine requiring the use of self-intermittent catheterization (passage of a tube into the urinary passage to empty the bladder). The ileal conduit rather than the neobladder may best serve some senior patients and those with certain medical conditions that affect the function of the kidneys or impair their ability to self-catheterize. Continent catheterizable pouch (for example, ""Indiana pouch"") is a form of neobladder that is not connected to the normal urinary passage but instead has an opening or a ""stoma"" at the level of the skin on the abdomen through which a catheter can be passed to empty it periodically. This has a valve-like mechanism that prevents the leakage of urine through this opening thereby precluding the need to wear a bag. It is used it patients desirous of and fit for a continent urinary system while being unsuitable for an orthotopic neobladder due to certain circumstances such as cancer at the point where the bladder joins the urethra. This procedure is also termed continent diversion."
What is chemotherapy for bladder cancer?,"'Patients who are diagnosed with metastatic bladder cancer (M stage - M1; cancer which has spread to other parts of the body) are usually treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may also be used in cases of ""locally advanced"" bladder cancer (T stage - T3 and above and/or N stage - N1 and above) in an attempt to decrease the chances of the cancer coming back after radical cystectomy. This is ""''adjuvant chemotherapy''."" Another strategy entails administering ""neoadjuvant chemotherapy"" by giving these medications before radical cystectomy in an attempt to improve the results of surgery and decrease the size of the tumor before the operation.''Chemotherapy has the potential to control metastatic bladder cancer and increase the chances of cure when used in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting along with surgery. However, chemotherapy has its own set of side effects that some individuals find intolerable.''The time-honored chemotherapy regimen for bladder cancer is the MVAC. It is a combination of four medications given in cyclical form.''Oncologists currently prescribe MVAC in a ""dose dense"" fashion. This means the patient takes the ''drugs'' more frequently than was previously done in the accepted treatment schedule, as well as taking growth factors to help the blood counts to recover faster from the effects of the chemotherapy drugs. The older schedule for MVAC therapy is no longer recommended according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.''Some patients with ''heart disease'' may not be in a condition to receive Adriamycin and may receive ''CMV'' instead (''CMV'' = MVAC without Adriamycin)''An alternative regimen is a combination of gemcitabine (''Gemzar'') and cisplatin. Physicians use this more often nowadays since some studies have shown that it is equally effective as the MVAC regime with fewer side effects. However, about 40%-50% of patients have medical issues that preclude the use of this therapy.''Cisplatin, which is the main medication in all these regimens, is not given to patients who have an abnormal kidney function. In this case, doctors may substitute it with carboplatin (''Paraplatin''), which, however, is not as effective as cisplatin-based chemotherapy.''Chemotherapy is an ever-changing method to reduce or eliminate cancer cells; it is best for patients to discuss this therapy with their doctors. Variations in chemotherapy treatments occur among clinicians and one patient’s therapy may be quite different from that of another patient. In addition, health care professionals may introduce newer compounds at any time that may be advantageous to use instead of conventional chemotherapy agents. The following is a list of compounds that some clinicians use to treat various stages of bladder cancer, usually in combination with other anti-cancer cell compounds:''A few cancer treatment centers use, in addition to chemotherapy and endoscopic resection, external radiation beam therapy to treat patients. However, the protocol is complex with toxicity and high pretreatment mortality (death) rates mainly due to ''sepsis'' from the chemotherapy. External beam radiation therapy is mainly used in other countries; it is infrequently used in the United States as a primary treatment. Its use to reduce pain from metastases of bladder cancer, especially to the bones, is still of value.''Immunotherapy drugs, such as atzolizumab (Tecentriq) and durvalumab (Imfinzi), also treat bladder cancer. These drugs block a molecule known as PD-L1 that leads to increased immune system (T-cell) activation and decreased tumor size; you should discuss with your doctors what individual treatments are best for your current condition.'   M: Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) V: Vinblastine A: Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) C: Cisplatin (Platinol-AQ) Paclitaxel Fluorouracil (5-FU) Gemcitabine Pemetrexed Vinblastine Valrubicin Carboplatin Ifosamide Thioepa Docetaxel"
What is the prognosis for bladder cancer?,"""The most important factors that affect the prognosis (or the chances of control and cure) of bladder cancer are the stage and grade of the tumor. The lower the stage and grade, the better the outlook. Other factors such as number, size, pattern of recurrence (if any), response to initial treatment like BCG, coexistent carcinoma in situ, and certain genetic mutations also play a role. The table below is based on the National Cancer Institute's database:""'For low-risk superficial bladder cancer (Ta, low grade), the chances of recurrence are about 50% in five years after the initial diagnosis. This necessitates regular follow-up, even in these low-risk tumors. However, unlike the more aggressive variants of bladder cancer, the chances of progression (for example, chances of the tumor invading into the deeper layers of the bladder) are minimal. Typically, these tumors, even when they recur, do so in the same stage and grade as the original tumor and do not compromise the life expectancy of the patient.''High-risk superficial tumors are those that are high-grade, T1 tumors and are associated with extensive areas of carcinoma in situ. Multiple tumors, large tumors, and those that recur despite BCG treatment are also at an increased risk for recurrence and progression. These tumors have a recurrence rate in the range of 50%-70% at one and five years, respectively. They are also much likely to invade into the deeper layers. Doctors need to manage these tumors more aggressively since they have a potential to invade and spread to other parts of the body thereby shortening the life expectancy of the patient.''After radical cystectomy, survival depends mostly on the stage of the disease. The five-year disease specific survival rate for various stages after a radical cystectomy is as follows:' T2, N0: 70%-80% T3, N0: 40%-50% T4, N0: 25%-30% N+ (patients with lymph node involvement): 15%-20%"
Is it possible to prevent bladder cancer?,"'The best way to prevent bladder cancer is to avoid exposure to agents that cause the disease. People who '""don't smoke""' are three to four times less likely to get bladder cancer as compared to smokers. Continuing to smoke after the diagnosis of bladder cancer portends a poorer outcome and increases the chance of the disease coming back after treatment. Avoidance of occupational exposure to cancer-causing chemicals such as aniline dyes may also be important. Despite research in this area no medication or dietary supplement has been conclusively demonstrated to decrease the risk of bladder cancer in normal individuals. However, recent studies of patients taking ''atorvastatin'' (''Lipitor'') to lower ''cholesterol'' have suggested the drug may lower the risk of prostatic cancer and by inference, bladder cancer, but this needs further study.' "
Where can people find more information on bladder cancer?,'A number of online resources are available for bladder cancer patients to gain more insight into this disease and its management. Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (http://www.bcan.org) is one such resource that provides a downloadable patient information handbook and links to patient support groups.''The National Cancer Institute (http://www.cancer.gov) also provides bladder cancer information.''The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (http://www.eortc.be/tools/''bladdercalculator) features a calculator that predicts the chances of recurrence and progression of superficial bladder cancer after initial treatment based on certain tumor characteristics.' 
What are topics of bladder cancer research?,"'Bladder cancer is a topic of intense scientific research currently. Basic science research is focused on finding and studying the genetic alterations (or changes in the human DNA) that predispose to bladder cancer in the hopes to discover new medications and treatments for curing the disease. Other areas of research include the following:''This field is likely to see significant advances in the years to come and hopefully would provide effective treatment strategies and hope for the millions of bladder cancer patients worldwide.' Newer molecular diagnostic tests to detect bladder cancer thereby avoiding the need for invasive tests like frequent cystoscopy examination Targeted therapy acts on genetic pathways responsible for bladder cancer; it is the next generation of chemotherapy for the disease. Newer surgical techniques, such as robotics, improve precision and accelerate patient recovery after bladder cancer surgery. Stem cell research for creation of urinary diversion during radical cystectomy without the need for intestinal segments"
What is the bladder?,"'The bladder is a hollow muscular organ that is located in the pelvis. The bladder has two functions: one is to store urine and the other is to release/expel urine. Urine drains from the kidneys (one on each side of the body), down the ureters (one on each side of the body), and into the bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder where it remains until urination. When it is time to urinate, the bladder muscle contracts and the outlet of the bladder and sphincter muscles relax to allow urine to pass through the urethra to leave the body. The bladder and urethra are part of the lower urinary tract, whereas the kidneys and ureters are part of the upper urinary tract.' "
What is a bladder infection?,"'Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder. Most cystitis is from ''bacterial infections'' involving the bladder and less commonly may be due to other infectious diseases, including yeast infections, viral infections, or the result of other causes such as chemical irritants of the bladder, or for unknown reasons (''interstitial cystitis''). Bladder infection (infectious cystitis) is a type of ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''). Other forms of ''urinary tract infection'' include ''pyelonephritis'' (''kidney infection''/inflammation), ''urethritis'' (infection/inflammation of the urethra), and ''prostatitis'' (inflammation/infection of the ''prostate gland''). This review will specifically address infectious cystitis.''The urine in the bladder is normally free of bacteria (sterile). However, bacteria may be present in the bladder but not cause inflammation or symptoms of an infection. This is asymptomatic bacteriuria, not cystitis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is bacteria in the urine that does not cause symptoms. It is important to differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from cystitis, to prevent overuse of antibiotics. Most people with asymptomatic bacteriuria do not require antibiotics. In fact, the guidelines for the Infectious Disease Society of America recommend only treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in ''pregnant'' women or immediately before urologic procedures.''Cystitis can be complicated or uncomplicated. Uncomplicated cystitis is a bladder infection in a healthy person with a structurally and functionally normal urinary tract. A complicated bladder infection is one that occurs in association with factors that increase the chance of developing a bacterial infection and decrease the chance of antibiotic therapy being effective. Such abnormalities include obstruction from stones, congenital blockages, urethral strictures, and ''prostate enlargement''.' "
What causes bladder infections?,"'All ''urinary tract infections'' are the result of interactions between the infecting organism (bacteria, yeast, virus), the number of the organisms that are present in the bladder, and the body’s ability to fight off the organism (host defense mechanisms).''The most common way bacteria gain access to the urinary system from outside is through the urethra (the tube that allows urine to pass from the bladder to outside of the body).''In terms of specific bacteria, ''E. coli'' (''Escherichia coli'') is by far the most common organism responsible for bladder infection or cystitis. Staphylococcal (''staph'') organisms (from skin) and other gut bacteria (''Proteus'', ''Klebsiella'', ''Enterococcus'') are other bacteria that can cause cystitis and other forms of urinary infections. The type of organism causing the infection can vary with the individual’s age. For example, ''Staphylococcus'' saprophyticus'', a skin bacteria, causes approximately 10% of symptomatic bladder infections in young sexually active women, whereas it rarely causes bladder infections in males and elderly individuals.''Rarely, fungi can cause bladder infections. ''Candida'' is the most common fungus to cause bladder infection. ''Candida'' infections of the bladder and urinary tract are much less common than ''bacterial infections''. Bladder infections from ''Candida'' can occur in patients whose immune system is weakened, individuals who have been treated with powerful antibiotics for other infections, and individuals who have had indwelling urinary catheters.''Viruses'' can rarely cause bladder infections. Viral cystitis can occur in individuals after bone marrow transplantation and in other individuals with a weakened immune system (immunocompromised individuals). ''Adenovirus'' can cause bladder infections and BK virus is another virus that can cause bladder infections in individuals who have undergone bone marrow transplantation.' The most common source of bacteria that cause UTIs is from the stool. In women, the bacteria from the stool travel first to the vagina and then enter the urethra. Sometimes bacteria may enter the bladder via the urethra from nearby skin. In general, women are more susceptible to bladder infections due to their shorter length of urethra. In the first year of life, boys have a higher risk of UTIs, but thereafter girls have a higher risk that persists in adulthood. Increasing age is a risk factor for UTIs."
What are some risk factors for bladder infection?,"'It is important to modify risk factors, when possible, to decrease the risk of recurrent ''urinary tract infections''.''Female gender is one of the main risk factors for bladder infection. Women are at increased risk for bladder infections for a number of reasons including the following:''Bacteria in the bladder is one of the most common infectious issues that occurs in ''pregnancy''. The risk of having bacteria in the urine increases with lower socioeconomic status, history of multiple children, and sickle cell trait. ''Pregnant'' women are less likely to clear the bacteria in the bladder compared to nonpregnant women and are more likely to develop symptoms. In addition, pregnant women have a higher risk of a bladder infection progressing to a ''kidney infection'' (''pyelonephritis'').''Other risk factors include the following:' Women have a shorter urethra than men which allows bacteria to gain access to the bladder much easier than in men. Sexual activity can increase the risk of urinary tract infections. Sexually active women tend to have more urinary tract infections than women who are not sexually active. The type of birth control a woman uses can affect the risk of developing urinary tract infections. Women who use diaphragms for birth control may have a higher risk of urinary tract infections, as well as women who use spermicidal agents. Menopausal women are at greater risk of developing urinary tract infections. Decreased estrogen levels cause changes in the urinary tract, making it more susceptible to bacteria. Urinary tract abnormalities such as obstruction to the flow of urine at any level, vesicoureteral reflux (a structural abnormality that allows urine to go backwards from the bladder to the kidneys), and neurologic conditions that affect bladder function In men with prostate enlargement, bladder infection is also more common than in the general male population. Prostate enlargement can lead to obstruction of the normal flow of urine out of the bladder and into the urethra. Residual urine can then become infected. The higher bladder pressure needed to push urine past the enlarged prostate causes decreased blood flow to the bladder, making it more susceptible to bacteria. Urinary catheters (Foley catheters) are another potential risk for bladder infection. People typically use these urinary catheters in settings where an individual may not be able to urinate naturally. Urinary catheters simply provide a physical vehicle to transport bacteria from outside directly into the bladder and the urinary system. Foley catheters are commonly used in patients with severe illness, limited mobility, urinary incontinence (inability to hold their urine), bladder obstruction and urinary retention (prostate enlargement, urethral scarring, prostate cancer), bladder trauma, bladder cancer, bladder dysfunction due to neurologic conditions, or who are unable to get out of bed. Bladder infection is more commonly seen in patients with neurologic conditions that may affect bladder function, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, and other diseases of the nervous system, than in the public. In these and other similar neurologic diseases, bladder function may be impaired due to abnormal nervous system control of the bladder (neurogenic bladder). As a result, a person may retain urine in the bladder after voiding. Urinary retention can be a cause of bladder infection. Furthermore, if urinary retention becomes more serious, causing pain and kidney dysfunction, Foley catheters may become necessary to empty the bladder and relieve the bladder pressure caused by excessive retention of urine. A catheter, in turn, can substantially increase the risk of bladder infection. In addition to the Foley catheter, any instrumentation of the urinary tract or nearby structures can potentially lead to cystitis. Medical procedures (cystoscopy, bladder biopsy, prostate procedures), vaginal pessary, and IUD (intrauterine device) placement for birth control can pose an increased risk of developing a bladder infection. In children and toddlers, the risk for bladder infection may be higher in females, uncircumcised males, those with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and Caucasians (four times higher than in African Americans). Elderly people are also at higher risk of suffering bladder infections as are individuals who take medications that weaken the immune defense system. Constipation"
What are the signs and symptoms of a bladder infection in women?,"'Because cystitis is more common in women, most signs and symptoms listed below pertain to cystitis in women unless otherwise indicated.''General ''symptoms of bladder infection'' may include the following:''Fevers'', ''chills'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and poor oral intake rarely occur with a bladder infection, although they are more common upper urinary tract infections, such as pyelonephritis (kidney infection).''Some common signs of bladder infection are'   Dysuria (painful urination) Urinary frequency Urinary urgency (sudden, compelling urge to urinate) Hesitancy to void urine Bladder pain (pain in the lower abdomen around the pubic bone and pelvic area) Incomplete voiding of urine (leaving urine in the bladder after urinating) Urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine), which may be associated with urgency lower abdominal tenderness; blood in urine (hematuria); less commonly, tenderness on the sides of the back (flanks); foul-smelling urine; and in elderly patients, lethargy or confusion may be the only signs."
What are the signs and symptoms of a bladder infection in men?,"'In men, signs and symptoms of probable bladder infection (cystitis) are as follows:' Dysuria (painful urination) Urinary frequency Urinary urgency Suprapubic pain (pain above the pelvic bone in lower abdomen) Hematuria (blood in urine): Blood in the urine may occur with a bladder infection. However, if an individual has grossly bloody urine, consultation with a urologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of conditions affecting the urinary tract) is essential as other conditions, such as bladder cancer, can also cause the urine to be bloody. Incomplete voiding of urine (leaving urine in the bladder after urinating) Urinary incontinence, which may be associated with urgency"
What are the signs and symptoms of a bladder infection in children?,"'Signs and symptoms of bladder and urinary infection in young children and infants may be more vague and can include the following:''Toilet trained children may develop'   Irritability Fussiness Poor eating Vomiting Failure to thrive Generalized malaise Strong-smelling urine Abdominal pain urinary frequency, urinary urgency, change in continence status, dysuria (pain) with urination, hematuria (blood in the urine), and complaints of abdominal pain."
How do health care professionals diagnose a bladder infection?,"'A ''urinalysis'' (UA) is the initial evaluation for a bladder infection. In most cases, health care professionals use a voided urine specimen, however, there is a risk of contamination by skin bacteria. A ""clean catch"" voided urine specimen involves voiding and collecting a urine sample ""mid-stream"" as opposed to at the very start or end of voiding. A catheterized urine sample is more accurate, but has the risk of introducing bacteria into the bladder and may be uncomfortable in children. In infants, medical professionals can perform a suprapubic aspiration.''The method of collecting a voided urine sample differs between men and women, as well as between circumcised men and uncircumcised men. In circumcised men, there is no special preparation. However, uncircumcised men should retract the foreskin. If the source of the infection is unclear, three separate urine samples may be collected: the first void (the first 10 ml of urination) reflects whether or not bacteria are in the urethra; and the second sample is a midstream void (that which occurs after the first 10 ml) and reflects whether bacteria are in the bladder. If there is a concern for bacteria in the prostate, a medical professional performs a rectal examination and massages the prostate to express fluid from the prostate into the urethra, and the third urine sample is obtained after the prostate ''massage''. In both males and females, the voided urine should be collected midstream. It is unclear if washing the penis or perineum with gauze or an antibiotic wipe is more effective in preventing contamination from the skin. In children who are not toilet-trained, a catheterized specimen is more accurate than placing a collection bag over the urethra. In infants, a health care professional can perform a suprapubic aspiration (placing a small needle through the lower abdomen into the bladder and withdrawing a urine sample). In toilet-trained children, a health care professional may obtain a voided urine sample.''A quick office-based ''urinalysis'', called a urine dipstick, is unable to detect if bacteria are present. However, health care professionals use it to detect the presence of nitrite in the urine and leukocyte esterase. Nitrite is a chemical that forms when bacteria in the urine break down a chemical called nitrate, which is normally present in the urine. The nitrite test is not positive for all bacterial infections of the bladder, as not all bacteria can break down nitrate to nitrite. In addition, the urine dipstick is unable to determine the number of white blood cells (infection cells) present in the urine but assesses whether or not white blood cells are present by measuring leukocyte esterase activity. Leukocyte esterase is a chemical produced by white blood cells. The presence of both nitrites and an elevated leukocyte esterase are very suggestive of a ''urinary tract infection''. A formal urinalysis with examination of the urine under the microscope is able to identify whether or not bacteria are present in the urine as well as determine the number of white blood cells present in the urine. Examination of the urine under the microscope can also determine if yeast are present in the urine. ''Viruses'' cannot be seen under the routine microscope and require special tests to identify.''The definitive test to determine if there is a bladder infection is the urine culture. The urine culture identifies the number of and type of bacteria in the urine as well as determine the sensitivity of the bacteria to a number of different antibiotics. The usual cutoff for a ''urinary tract infection'' is the presence of greater than 100,000 bacteria, however, in the presence of symptoms, a positive leukocyte esterase or > 10 white blood cells on urinalysis, even fewer bacteria in the urine is supportive of a ''urinary tract infection''.''A recent publication in the Infectious Disease Clinics of North America highlights the importance of differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria, possible, probable, and definite ''urinary tract infection''. Localizing symptoms and signs (pain with urination, urinary frequency, suprapubic/''bladder pain'', ''bloody urine'', pain in the flank, new or worsening urgency or urinary ''incontinence''), pyuria (white blood cells in the urine), or positive leukocyte esterase on urinalysis are the most important predictors of a urinary tract infection. They note that the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection requires three components: (1) clinical symptoms of infection localizing to the urinary tract or nonspecific symptoms of infection (''fever'', ''chills'', change in mental status) in the absence of symptoms suggesting an infection in another part of the body, (2) the presence of white blood cells in the urine and bacteria in the urine, and (3) absence of another infection or noninfectious process accounting for the symptoms and signs.''If symptoms of an upper urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis), ''fever'', flank pain, ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'' are present, health care professionals will obtain a blood test (a complete blood cell count [''CBC'']). If there is a concern for a severe infection, a medical professionals will culture a sample of blood to see if there are bacteria in the bloodstream. Radiologic studies are not routinely obtained in the case of cystitis, however, if there are signs of a kidney infection (pyelonephritis) such as flank pain, ''fevers''/chills, or there is a failure to respond to antibiotics (with persistent or worsening symptoms), then radiologic testing (renal ''ultrasound'', ''CT scan'', or ''MRI'') can be performed to rule out an ''abscess'' or other abnormalities. If a physician suspects ''constipation'', a plain X-ray of the abdomen may be obtained to assess the severity of the ''constipation''.' "
What are treatment options and medications for a bladder infection?,"'The appropriate use of antibiotics can treat and cure a bladder infection. The selection and duration of antibiotic treatment depends on severity of the infection, previous history of similar infection, and patient factors (age, gender, ''allergies'', other medications, other medical problems). The antibiotic initially chosen will be dependent on these factors as well as urine culture results from prior infections. Sometimes a doctor will change the prescribed antibiotic if the urine culture results show that the bacteria is resistant to the antibiotic used initially. In most bladder infections, oral (by mouth) antibiotics are used. The length of treatment will vary with whether or not the infection is complicated or not, as well as other risk factors. Sometimes intravenous antibiotics may be needed until a suitable oral antibiotic has been identified. A number of different types of antibiotics treat bladder infections, including ''trimethoprim''-''sulfamethoxazole'' (''Bactrim''), ''nitrofurantoin'' (''Macrobid'', ''Furadantin'', and ''Macrodantin''), fosfomycin (''Monurol''), cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Doctors commonly prescribe the antibiotics nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated cystitis. However, with the increasing emergence of resistant organisms, physicians prescribe fosfomycin more frequently for uncomplicated cystitis. Resistance to various antibiotics varies in different areas of the country, and this may also affect the antibiotic that your physician chooses initially until the culture results are available. It is important that you tell your physician all the medications, including any ''over-the-counter'' medications so that the physician can ensure that the selected antibiotic will not interfere with your current medications. Your physician and/or pharmacist can also review more commonly encountered side effects of the prescribed antibiotic. It often takes up to 72 hours, sometimes longer, to have the final culture result and antibiotic sensitivities available.''Self-medication for bladder infection is occasionally an option in patients with mild, recurrent infections. In reliable and compliant individuals who are familiar with the symptoms of frequent bladder infections, their treating physicians can prescribe appropriate bladder infection antibiotics to them in advance. The patient may then start bladder infection medication on their own at the onset of their symptoms. If the symptoms do not improve after several days of treatment, a health care professional will obtain a urine culture from the patient to ensure the use of the proper antibiotic.''Bladder ''muscle spasm'' and bladder inflammation are responsible for some of the symptoms associated with bladder infection, such as bladder pain, urinary frequency, urgency, and dysuria. ''Phenazopyridine'' (Pyridium) is a medication often used to treat symptoms of painful urination due to bladder infection. Other similar medications are available over the counter. It is important to read the prescribing information on these medications (for example, physicians only recommend the use of pyridium for two days use when used with an antibiotic for a ''UTI'').''Physicians sometimes recommend prophylactic antibiotics (a low dose of antibiotic on a daily basis) for individuals who develop frequent symptomatic UTIs. Similarly, women who develop UTIs related to sexual activity may take a single dose of antibiotic around the time of intercourse.''Your provider may ask you to have a follow-up urine culture to ensure adequate treatment of your ''UTI''. In addition, if your urine culture shows bacteria associated with the development of stones, a health care professional may obtain an ''ultrasound'' of the kidneys or plain abdominal X-ray to see if you have a ''kidney stone''.'  "
Are home remedies effective for a bladder infection?,"'People have used ''cranberry'' products to prevent bladder infections. Cranberries contain a substance that can prevent bacteria from sticking on the walls of the bladder. A Cochrane Database systematic review of cranberries for preventing UTIs in 2012 concluded that the evidence for ''cranberry'' products, particularly cranberry juice, over the long term is small and that cranberry juice could not be recommended at that time for the ''prevention'' of UTIs. Further studies need to evaluate other cranberry preparations.''Probiotics'' are preparations that contain live bacteria, for example ''lactobacillus'', that can prevent other bacteria from growing and moving up from the bladder to the kidney. The ''probiotic'"" decreases the ability of the infecting bacteria from sticking to the bladder and growing and may also affect the ability of the individual's own body to fight off bacteria. A Cochrane Database review in 2015 demonstrated no significant difference in the risks of recurrent UTIs for ""'probiotics'' compared with placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic effect, used as a control in testing a new medication) or antibiotic prophylaxis in either women or children, however, there were a limited number of good quality studies.''Adhering to the prescribed antibiotic regimen and staying well hydrated are essential components of home remedy for bladder infection.' "
What is the treatment for a bladder infection during pregnancy?,"'In pregnant women, bladder infection can be complicated. Sometimes the presence of bacteria without obvious signs of infection in pregnant patients could be harmful and may lead to severe infections that compromise the ''pregnancy''. As previously stated, the presence of asymptomatic bacteria in a pregnant woman warrants treatment. The choice of antibiotics during pregnancy may be different for bladder infection during pregnancy due to potential harm to the fetus and thus, careful evaluation by a physician is very important to start the correct therapy promptly.' "
What are potential complications of a bladder infection?,"'Complications of a bladder infection can occur without appropriate diagnosis or treatment. Untreated or poorly treated bladder infection can ascend the urinary system and lead to kidney infection (pyelonephritis) and enter the bloodstream, leading to ''sepsis'' (infection spread into the blood), which can be life threatening. In children, particularly, kidney infections can cause permanent damage to the kidney. In pregnant women, complications of bladder infections include an increased risk of delivering low birth weight or premature infants. Urethral narrowing (stricture) in men from recurrent urethral infections can occur, more commonly with ''sexually transmitted diseases'' such as ''gonorrhea''.' "
Is it possible to prevent bladder infections?,"'Although the use of cranberry products (whole cranberries, cranberry juice, cranberry pills) is thought to help prevent infections, more recent evidence fails to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness in preventing UTIs. The role of ''probiotics'' in the prevention of urinary tract infections is unclear.''Regular voiding and bowel habits may help decrease the risk of bladder infections. Timely and effective bladder emptying as well as avoiding ''constipation'' may decrease the number of bacteria present near the urethra and decrease the likelihood of bacteria growing in the bladder.''Strict adherence to guidelines to prevent catheter associated urinary tract infections is helpful in reducing bladder infections. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has developed guidelines with respect to appropriate urinary catheter use, proper techniques for insertion, and maintenance of urinary catheters (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/ca_uti/uti.html). Individuals who perform clean intermittent catheterization (insertion of a catheter to drain the bladder and removal several times a day) and who develop frequent infections may change to single use systems.''Sexual intercourse is another potential risk factor for bladder infection. Thus, it may be advisable to empty the bladder (urinate) after sexual activity, draining bacteria that could have entered the bladder. Available clinical data does not completely supported this, and some experts do not recommended this. The use of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of intercourse may also be helpful in individuals with recurrent UTIs related to sexual activity.''Preventive use of antibiotics may also have a role in preventing bladder infections. In some female patients with frequent bladder infections (more than three to four times per year) or with ''symptoms of bladder infection'' present after sexual intercourse, a short course of antibiotics can be taken as a preventive measure. The treating doctor needs to recommend this method, and the strategy needs to be outlined for patients who are deemed reliable.''Physicians also sometimes recommend preventive antibiotics in patients undergoing invasive urologic procedures (''cystoscopy'', prostate biopsy, bladder biopsy). Occasionally, medical professionals may order a urinalysis and/or urine culture before the procedure and if an infection is suggested, then antibiotics are prescribed to prevent an infection after the procedure.'  "
What is the prognosis for a bladder infection?,'The overall prognosis for a bladder infection is very good. An uncomplicated bladder infection typically does not cause any damage to the bladder. Identification of risk factors may help decrease the risk of recurrent infections.' 
What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?,"'A ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'') is an infection involving the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. These are the structures that urine passes through before being eliminated from the body.''Any part of this system can become infected. As a rule, the farther up in the urinary tract the infection is located, the more serious it is.''In the United States, ''urinary tract infections'' account for more than 10 million visits to medical offices and hospitals each year.'   The kidneys are a pair of small organs that lie on either side of the spine at about waist level. They have several important functions in the body, including removing waste and excess water from the blood and eliminating them as urine. These functions make them important in the regulation of blood pressure. Kidneys are also very sensitive to changes in blood sugar levels and blood pressure and electrolyte balance. Both diabetes and hypertension can cause damage to these organs. Two ureters, narrow tubes about 10 inches long, drain urine from each kidney into the bladder. The bladder is a small saclike organ that collects and stores urine. When the urine reaches a certain level in the bladder, we experience the sensation that we have to void, then the muscle lining the bladder can be voluntarily contracted to expel the urine. The urethra is a small tube connecting the bladder with the outside of the body. A muscle called the urinary sphincter, located at the junction of the bladder and the urethra, must relax at the same time the bladder contracts to expel urine. The upper urinary tract is composed of the kidneys and ureters. Infection in the upper urinary tract generally affects the kidneys (pyelonephritis), which can cause fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and other severe symptoms. The lower urinary tract consists of the bladder and the urethra. Infection in the lower urinary tract can affect the urethra (urethritis) or the bladder (cystitis). Urinary tract infections are much more common in adults than in children, but about 1%-2% of children do get urinary tract infections. Urinary tract infections in children are more likely to be serious than those in adults (especially in younger children). Urinary tract infection is the most common urinary tract problem in children besides bedwetting. Urinary tract infection is second only to respiratory infection as the most common type of infection. These infections are much more common in girls and women than in boys and men younger than 50 years of age. The reason for this is not well understood, but anatomic differences between the genders (a shorter urethra in women) might be partially responsible. About 40% of women and 12% of men have a urinary tract infection at some time in their life."
What are causes and risk factors for a urinary tract infection?,"'The urine is normally sterile. An infection occurs when bacteria get into the urine and begin to grow. The bacterial infection usually starts at the opening of the urethra where the urine leaves the body and moves upward into the urinary tract.''The following people are at increased risk of urinary tract infection:''The following special groups may be at increased risk of urinary tract infection:' The culprit in at least 90% of uncomplicated infections is a type of bacteria called Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli. These bacteria normally live in the bowel (colon) and around the anus. These bacteria can move from the area around the anus to the opening of the urethra. The two most common causes of this are improper wiping and sexual intercourse. Usually, the act of emptying the bladder (urinating) flushes the bacteria out of the urethra. If there are too many bacteria, urinating may not stop their spread. The bacteria can travel up the urethra to the bladder, where they can grow and cause an infection. The infection can spread further as the bacteria move up from the bladder via the ureters. If they reach the kidney, they can cause a kidney infection (pyelonephritis), which can become a very serious condition if not treated promptly. People with conditions that block (obstruct) the urinary tract, such as kidney stones People with medical conditions that cause incomplete bladder emptying (for example, spinal cord injury) Postmenopausal women: Decreased circulating estrogen makes the urinary tract more vulnerable to a UTI. People with suppressed immune systems: Examples of situations in which the immune system is suppressed are HIV/AIDS and diabetes. People who take immunosuppressant medications such as chemotherapy for cancer also are at increased risk. Women who are sexually active: Sexual intercourse can introduce larger numbers of bacteria into the bladder. Urinating after intercourse seems to decrease the likelihood of developing a urinary tract infection. Women who use a diaphragm for birth control Men with an enlarged prostate: Prostatitis or obstruction of the urethra by an enlarged prostate can lead to incomplete bladder emptying, thus increasing the risk of infection. This is most common in older men. Breastfeeding has been found to decrease the risk for urinary tract infections in children. Very young infants: Bacteria gain entry to the urinary tract via the bloodstream from other sites in the body. Young children: Young children have trouble wiping themselves and washing their hands well after a bowel movement. Poor hygiene has been linked to an increased frequency of urinary tract infections. Children of all ages: Urinary tract infection in children can be (but is not always) a sign of an abnormality in the urinary tract, usually a partial blockage. An example is a condition in which urine moves backward from the bladder up the ureters (vesicoureteral reflux). Hospitalized patients or nursing-home residents: Many of these individuals are catheterized for long periods and are thus vulnerable to infection of the urinary tract. Catheterization means that a thin tube (catheter) is placed in the urethra to drain urine from the bladder. This is done for people who have problems urinating or cannot reach a toilet to urinate on their own. Patients using catheters: If a patient is required to empty their bladder using a catheter, they are at increased risk for infection."
Are urinary tract infections contagious?,'No. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not ''contagious''.' 
What are urinary tract infection symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms develop rapidly and may or may not include the symptoms for a lower urinary tract infection.''In newborns, infants, children, and elderly people, the classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection may not be present. Other symptoms may indicate a urinary tract infection.''Pregnant'' women are at increased risk for an UTI. Typically, pregnant women do not have unusual or unique symptoms. If a woman is pregnant, her urine should be checked during ''prenatal'' visits because an unrecognized infection can cause ''pregnancy'' health complications.''Although most people have symptoms with a urinary tract infection, some do not.''The ''symptoms of urinary tract infection'' can resemble those of ''sexually transmitted diseases''.'

   Bladder (cystitis, or bladder infection): The lining of the urethra and bladder becomes inflamed and irritated. Dysuria: pain or burning during urination Frequency: more frequent urination (or waking up at night to urinate, sometimes referred to as nocturia); often with only a small amount of urine Urinary urgency: the sensation of having to urinate urgently Cloudy, bad-smelling, or bloody urine Lower abdominal pain or pelvic pressure or pain Mild fever (less than 101 F), chills, and ""just not feeling well"" (malaise) Urethra (urethritis): Burning with urination Fairly high fever (higher than 101 F) Shaking chills Nausea Vomiting Flank pain: pain in the back or side, usually on only one side at about waist level Newborns: fever or hypothermia (low temperature), poor feeding, jaundice Infants: vomiting, diarrhea, fever, poor feeding, not thriving Children: irritability, eating poorly, unexplained fever that doesn't go away, loss of bowel control, loose bowels, change in urination pattern Elderly people: fever or hypothermia, poor appetite, lethargy, change in mental status"
When should people seek medical care for a UTI?,"'Any adult or child who develops any of the symptoms of a urinary tract infection needs to be evaluated by a medical professional, preferably within 24 hours. Most medical offices can test urine for infection by using a quick urine ""dipstick"" test.''If someone has symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection and any of the following applies, he or she may be at risk for complications of the urinary tract infection.''Infants, children, and elderly people with any of the signs and ''symptoms of UTI'' should see their health care professional as soon as possible or go to an emergency department for evaluation.' Someone who has symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection should call a health care professional for an appointment, preferably on the same day that symptoms are recognized. Someone who has symptoms of an upper urinary tract infection involving the kidneys should call a health care professional immediately. Depending on the situation, he or she will recommend either a visit to the office or to a hospital emergency department. Vomiting and inability to keep down clear fluids or medication Not better after taking antibiotics for two days Pregnant Having diabetes or another disease that affects the immune system Taking medication that suppresses the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy Fever, lethargy, and poor appetite may indicate a urinary tract infection in these groups, but they may also be signs of something more serious. Urinary tract infections have the potential to make these vulnerable people very ill when the bacteria spread into the bloodstream."
How do health care professionals diagnose a urinary tract infection?,"'Diagnosis of a urinary tract infection is based on information someone gives about his or her symptoms, medical and surgical history, medications, habits, and lifestyle. A physical examination and lab tests complete the evaluation.''A health care professional may simply perform a urine dipstick test in the office. Only a few minutes are needed to obtain results. Your health care provider may also send a urine sample to the lab for culture testing (see below). These results take a few days to come back. This tells the doctor the exact bacteria causing the infection and to which antibiotics these bacteria have resistance or sensitivity. The culture is usually sent for special populations, including men, because they are less likely to get UTIs. It is not necessary to send a culture for everyone because the majority of UTIs are caused by the same bacteria.''For a culture specimen, the patient will be asked to give a clean-catch, midstream urine specimen. This avoids contamination of the urine with bacteria from the skin. Patients will be instructed in how to do this.''If someone cannot produce a urine specimen or is unable to follow instructions for a clean-catch specimen, a health care professional may obtain a urine specimen by catheterization.''Depending on their symptoms, sexually active women could require a pelvic examination because pelvic infections can have similar symptoms as a urinary tract infection. Males will require a genital examination, and depending on the symptoms, most likely a prostate examination. A prostate infection (prostatitis) requires a longer course of antibiotics than a urinary tract infection.''Men will most likely require a rectal examination so that the prostate can be checked. A prostate infection (prostatitis) requires a longer course of antibiotics than a urinary tract infection.''Rarely, an imaging test may be indicated to detect any underlying problem in the urinary tract that could cause an infection. This is usually only necessary in repeat infections or special circumstances (unusual bacteria, suspected anatomic abnormalities).''Imaging tests are most often needed for the following groups:' The single most important lab test is urinalysis. A urine culture will be tested for signs of infection, such as the presence of white blood cells and bacteria. In certain circumstances, urine also may be ""cultured."" This means that a small amount of the urine is brushed on a sterile nutrient substance in a plastic plate. The plate is allowed to sit for a few days and then examined to see what kind of bacteria are growing on it. These bacteria are treated with different antibiotics to see which works best against them. This helps determine the best treatment for the specific infection. Blood tests usually are not required unless a complicated condition, such as pyelonephritis or kidney failure, is suspected. Midstream means urinating a little into the toilet before collecting a specimen. The idea is to avoid collecting the urine that comes out first, as this urine is often contaminated. Clean-catch refers to a midstream sample that was collected after cleaning the area of the urethral opening. Adult women and older girls: Cleanse the area around the urethral opening gently (but completely) using a sterile wipe or soap and water. Catch the urine midstream. For some women, catheterization (inserting a tube into the bladder) may be the only way to obtain a sterile, uncontaminated specimen. Men and boys: A sterile specimen can usually be obtained with a midstream catch. Uncircumcised males should retract the foreskin and cleanse the area before urinating. Newborns: Urine may be obtained with a catheter or a procedure in which a needle is introduced through the lower abdominal wall to draw (aspirate) urine from the bladder. Infants and children: Either catheterization or the needle aspiration method is used. This means placing a thin tube (catheter) in the urethra to drain urine from the bladder. The catheter usually is removed after the bladder is emptied. The catheter may remain in place if someone is very ill or if it is necessary to collect all urine or measure urine output. An ultrasound examination can evaluate kidney and bladder problems. A fluoroscopic study can show any physical problems that predispose children to urinary tract infections. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is a special series of X-rays that uses a contrast dye to highlight abnormalities in the urinary tract. Cystoscopy involves insertion of a thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera on the end through the urethra into the bladder. This allows detection of abnormalities inside the bladder that might contribute to infections. A CT scan gives a very detailed three-dimensional picture of the urinary tract. Children with repeat urinary tract infections, especially boys Up to 50% of infants and 30% of older children with a urinary tract infection have an anatomic abnormality. The child's pediatrician should investigate this possibility. Adults with frequent or recurrent urinary tract infections People who have blood in the urine"
What is the treatment for a urinary tract infection?,"'The usual treatment for both simple and complicated urinary tract infections is antibiotics. The type of antibiotic and duration of treatment depend on the circumstances. Examples of common antibiotics used in treatment include, but are not limited to, ''amoxicillin'', ''sulfamethoxazole''/''trimethoprim'' (''Bactrim''), ''ciprofloxacin'', ''nitrofurantoin'' (''Macrobid''), and many others. Your health care provider will chose the appropriate medication for your condition and the specific causative organisms.''A person may be hospitalized if he or she has symptoms of pyelonephritis and any of the following:''Urethritis in men and women can be caused by the same bacteria as sexually transmitted diseases (''STDs''). Therefore, people with symptoms of ''STDs'' (vaginal or ''penile discharge'', for example) should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Your doctor will have to evaluate you for urinalysis as well as UTIs if you experience any pain in the genital area.'

   In an otherwise healthy person, a three-day course of antibiotics is usually enough. Some providers prefer a seven-day course of antibiotics. Occasionally, a single dose of an antibiotic is used. A health care professional will determine which of these options is best. In adult males, if the prostate is also infected (prostatitis), four weeks or more of antibiotic treatment may be required. Adult females with potential for or early involvement of the kidneys, urinary tract abnormalities, or diabetes are usually given a five- to seven-day course of antibiotics. Children with uncomplicated cystitis are usually given a 10-day course of antibiotics. To alleviate burning pain during urination, phenazopyridine (Pyridium) or a similar drug, can be used in addition to antibiotics for one to two days. Young, otherwise healthy patients with symptoms of pyelonephritis can be treated as outpatients. They may receive IV fluids and antibiotics or an injection of antibiotics in the emergency department, followed by 10-14 days of oral antibiotics. They should follow up with their health care professional in one to two days to monitor improvement. If someone is very ill, dehydrated, or unable to keep anything in his or her stomach because of vomiting, an IV will be inserted into the arm. He or she will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids and antibiotics through the IV until he/she is well enough to switch to an oral antibiotic. A complicated, acute infection may require treatment for several weeks. Appear very ill Are pregnant Have not gotten better with outpatient antibiotic treatment Have underlying diseases that compromise the immune system (diabetes is one example) or are taking immunosuppressive medication Are unable to keep anything in the stomach because of nausea or vomiting Had previous kidney disease, especially pyelonephritis, within the last 30 days Have a device such as a urinary catheter in place Have kidney stones"
Are there home remedies for a urinary tract infection?,"'There are a variety of self-care measures (home remedies) and other treatments available for urinary tract infections.''Because the symptoms of a urinary tract infection mimic those of other conditions, someone should see a health care professional if a urinary tract infection is suspected. A urine test is needed to confirm an infection. Self-care is not recommended.'   Use a hot-water bottle to ease pain. Drink plenty of water. Avoid coffee, alcohol, and spicy foods, all of which irritate the bladder. There are some indications that cranberry juice can help fight a urinary tract infection."
What kinds of doctors treat urinary tract infections?,"""Most urinary tract infections can be treated by your primary care doctor (including family medicine and internal-medicine specialists, as well as gynecologists) or your child's pediatrician. They are usually the best provider to treat you as they are most familiar with your medical history, medications you are taking, and other factors that might affect your treatment. If you seek treatment in an urgent care facility, a specialist in ""'emergency medicine'' may be involved in your care.''If there are frequent reoccurrences of UTIs or if complicating circumstances are present, your primary care doctor might refer you to a ''urologist'', a physician who specializes in diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to the urinary system.' "
How long does a UTI last after treatment with antibiotics?,"   Symptoms of lower urinary tract infections usually resolve within 24 hours of starting the medication. The full amount of prescribed antibiotics should be taken even if the symptoms are fully gone. Upper urinary tract symptoms (pyelonephritis) will usually take longer to respond to treatment. The patient will usually improve within 24 hours, but it will often take longer until all symptoms resolve."
What follow-up is needed for a urinary tract infection?,"""Follow a health care professional's treatment recommendations. Finish all medications even if feeling better before the medication is gone. A health care professional will want the patient to have a follow-up appointment to repeat the urinalysis and make sure he or she is getting better.""'Occasionally, the infection does not go away with the first treatment. If someone is being treated for an infection and has any of the following, call a health care professional promptly:' Children and adults with kidney involvement should be seen again in one to two days. People recovering from uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections might be told that they only have to return if symptoms don't go away or if they return. Fever or pain with urination is not gone after two days of antibiotic treatment. Someone cannot keep the medication down or it has severe side effects. Someone is unable to keep foods, fluids, or medication down because of nausea or vomiting. Someone develops signs of kidney involvement (such as flank pain, shaking chills, high fever). Someone's symptoms are worse rather than better after two days of antibiotics."
Is it possible to prevent a urinary tract infection?," Women and girls should wipe from front to back (not back to front) after bowel movements. This helps prevent bacteria from the anus entering the urethra. Empty the bladder regularly and completely, especially after sexual intercourse. Drink plenty of fluids, especially water. Cranberry juice, especially, has been shown to help prevent urinary tract infections. Women should empty the bladder soon after sexual intercourse."
What is the prognosis of a urinary tract infection?," For people with uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis, antibiotic treatment usually brings complete resolution of the infection. If not treated promptly, urinary tract infections can cause permanent scarring of the urinary tract. Recurrent urinary tract infections can become a problem and will require close monitoring by your health care provider. Pyelonephritis, if not treated promptly, can spread to the bloodstream and cause a very severe infection.Short-term and long-term kidney damage can be a result of pyelonephritis.Death from pyelonephritis is rare in otherwise healthy people.Factors associated with poor outcome are old age or general debility, kidney stones, recent hospitalization, diabetes, sickle cell disease, cancer, or chronic kidney disease. Short-term and long-term kidney damage can be a result of pyelonephritis. Death from pyelonephritis is rare in otherwise healthy people. Factors associated with poor outcome are old age or general debility, kidney stones, recent hospitalization, diabetes, sickle cell disease, cancer, or chronic kidney disease."
What Do Bladder Spasms Feel Like?,"'Normally, the bladder gently fills with urine and you slowly become aware ofthe need to urinate. This feeling is your cue to start looking for abathroom.''But in people who have bladder spasms, the sensation occurs suddenly andoften severely. A spasm itself is the sudden, involuntary squeezing of amuscle. A bladder spasm, or ""detrusor contraction,"" occurs  when thebladder muscle squeezes suddenly without warning, causing an urgent need torelease urine. The spasm can force urine from the bladder, causing leakage.When this happens, the condition is called  ''urge incontinence'' or  ''overactive bladder''.''People who have had such spasms describe them as a cramping ''pain'' andsometimes as a burning sensation. Some women with severe bladder spasmscompared the muscle contractions to severe ''menstrual cramps'' and even laborpains experienced during  childbirth.'  "
Who Is Most Likely to Develop Bladder Spasms?,"'Anyone at any age can have bladder spasms. In children, bladder spasms (alsocalled pediatric unstable bladder or uninhibited bladder) are the leading causeof daytime ''incontinence''.''However, you are more likely to have bladder spasms with urine leakage ifyou:' Are elderly Are going through menopause Recently had a  baby or are pregnant Have a urinary tract infection Have recently had lower abdominal or pelvic surgery Have nerve or bladder muscle damage caused by disease or injury"
What Causes Bladder Spasms?,"'There are a number of different causes of bladder spasms. The cramping paincould be due to something as simple as your  ''diet'' or a  medication that you are taking, or it could beassociated with changes in blood supply and function of the nerves controllingthe bladder.'""However, bladder spasms may be the result of an infection or a recentsurgery, or they may occur if you have nerve or muscle damage. So it'simportant to see a doctor to determine the cause.""'In some cases, your doctor may not be able to identify the cause. When thishappens, the condition is called idiopathic bladder spasms.''Some common causes of bladder spasms are:'   Urinary tract infection (UTI):  Bladder pain and burning are a common symptom of a
UTI. Interstitial cystitis (IC), also called painful bladder
syndrome: This condition refers to bladder and urinary pain that is not due to
other causes, such as a urinary tract infection. Pain is recurring and often
severe. Catheter use: A catheter is a thin tube used to drain urine from the body,
often after surgery. It is placed into the urethra and up into your bladder.
Bladder spasms are a common and sometimes distressing complication of catheter
usage."
Nervous System Disorders That Lead to Bladder Spasms,"'The feeling you get when you need to empty your bladder is normally aninvoluntary response. The brain signals the bladder muscle when it is time totighten (contract) and release urine. However, certain nervous system disorderscause damage to the nerves that send signals between the brain and the bladder.When this happens, the bladder does not work properly. ""Neurogenic bladder"" isthe general term for bladder problems due to nerve damage.''Nervous system disorders and injury that can cause bladder spasmsinclude:' Brain tumor Cerebral palsy Herpes zoster infection that affects the nerves in the sacrum Multiple sclerosis Parkinson's disease Multiple system atrophy (Shy-Drager syndrome) Spinal cord injury Stroke that has caused brain damage Diabetic neuropathy (when the nerves are damaged by longstanding  diabetes)"
Surgery That Leads to Bladder Spasms,"'Surgery to the lower abdominal area may weaken the bladder or pelvic floormuscles, or cause damage to the nerves that control the bladder. Bladder spasmsmay occur following certain surgeries, including:' Bladder surgery (a common cause of bladder spasms in both children and
adults) Cesarean section Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus, or womb, and sometimes the surrounding
female organs, including the ovaries and fallopian tubes.) Prostatectomy (prostate removal) Other lower abdominal surgery"
Other Causes of Bladder Spasms,"'Some medications may cause bladder spasms as a side effect. Medications thatcommonly cause bladder spasms include:''What you eat or drink can sometimes bother a fragile bladder and cause it togo into a spasm. This is especially true in patients who have a conditioncalled interstitial ''cystitis''.''Spicy, acidic, or citrusy foods and the chemicals in certain preservativesand food additives can irritate the lining of the bladder. Such productsinclude:' Bethanechol (urecholine) A chemotherapy drug called Valrubicin Medicines called diuretics, which help the body remove excess water, such
as furosemide (Lasix) Alcohol Artificial sweeteners Caffeinated beverages such as soda, coffee, and tea Chocolate Citrus fruits and drinks, such as oranges and orange juice Pickled foods Tomatoes"
Treatment of Bladder Spasms,"'How your doctor treats your bladder spasms depends on what exactly iscausing your painful symptoms. But in general, therapy may involve one or moreof the following treatments. A combination of treatments often works best.''''Change in diet.'' This may help prevent bladder pain if certain foodsand beverages are the culprit behind your spasms. Avoid spicy, acidic, orcitrusy foods, as well as alcohol and  ''caffeine''. Keeping a food diary,which tracks your meals and your symptoms, can be helpful.''''Timed voiding.'' This involves timed trips to the bathroom to urinate,usually every 1.5 to 2 hours. Timed voiding is especially helpful for children.As the bladder spasms get better and fewer wetting accidents occur, you canextend the time between trips to the bathroom.''''Pelvic floor exercises (""Kegels"").'' Kegels and other forms of physicaltherapy help strengthen and relax the bladder and other muscles that help thebody hold in urine. Kegels, combined with biofeedback, are a good way to helpreduce bladder spasms in children. To tighten your pelvic muscles, squeeze yourmuscles in the same way as if you were trying to stop the flow of urine orprevent yourself from passing ''gas''. Kegel exercises take practice, and tightening the wrongmuscles can put more pressure on your bladder. Ask your doctor for specificinstructions.''''Medicines to relax the bladder.'' The most commonly prescribed ''drugs'' torelax the bladder and prevent spasms are called anticholinergics. They include ''oxybutynin'' chloride, ''tolterodine'' and others. A commonside effect is ''dry mouth''.''An  ''antidepressant'' called ''imipramine'' hydrochloride (''Tofranil'') also helps relax the bladder and reducesbladder spasms.''Medicines called alpha-blockers (such as ''terazosin'' or doxazosin) may begiven to children to help the bladder relax and allow the bladder to emptycompletely.''''TENS.'"" Electrical stimulation through the skin (transcutaneouselectrical nerve stimulation, or TENS) sends mild electrical pulses to thebladder through patches applied to the skin. It's believed the electric signalshelp you feel better by increasing blood flow and releasing hormones that blockpain. TENS is often used to relieve muscle or  backpain. In the case of bladder spasms, doctors think the increased blood flowmakes the bladder muscle stronger, which reduces spasms and leakage.""'''Electrical stimulation implant (Inter-Stim).'' This is placed under theskin to deliver gentle electrical pulses to the bladder at regularly timedintervals. Your doctor may recommend this therapy if you have severe bladderspasms and urge incontinence that does not get better with othertreatments.''''Pain medicines and sedatives.'"" These may be given to patients who havecatheter-related bladder spasms after surgery. But they don't always take awayall the discomfort. Some research suggests that a prescriptionanti-inflammatory medicine called ""'ketorolac'' may help relieve or prevent catheter- orsurgery-related bladder spasms in children.'  "
Complementary and Alternative Therapies,"'Acupuncture''. Someresearch has suggested that bladder-specific ''acupuncture'' may significantlyreduce bladder muscle contractions and the urge to use the bathroom.''''Biofeedback''. Biofeedback is a method that teaches the mind how tocontrol normally automated body functions. Bladder training is a type ofbiofeedback. Some doctors believe biofeedback and behavioral changes workbetter than medicines for treating urge incontinence. A combination ofbiofeedback and medications may work best.''Botox''. In studies, botulinum-A toxin hasbeen shown to reduce nerve-related bladder spasms in children and adults. ''Botox''prevents nerves from releasing chemicals that tell muscles to contract. TheBotox is injected directly into the bladder muscle wall.' "
When to See a Doctor,"'Call your doctor for an appointment if you have:''If you have or think you are having bladder spasms, it is important that yousee a doctor for a proper diagnosis.

Introduction to Bleeding Varices,"'Varices are dilated blood vessels usually in the ''esophagus'' or stomach. They cause no symptoms unless they rupture and bleed.''Bleeding from varices is a life-threatening complication of ''portal hypertension''. Portal ''hypertension'' is an increase in the pressure within the portal vein (the vein that carries blood from the digestive organs to the ''liver'') due to blockage of blood flow throughout the liver.''This increased pressure in the portal vein causes the development of large, swollen veins (varices) within the esophagus and stomach. The varices are fragile and can rupture easily, resulting in a large amount of blood loss.''The most common cause of portal ''hypertension'' is ''cirrhosis'' of the liver. ''Cirrhosis'' is scarring which accompanies the healing of liver injury caused by ''hepatitis'', ''alcohol'', or other less common causes of liver damage. In cirrhosis, the ''scar tissue'' blocks the flow of blood through the liver and slows its processing functions.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Bleeding Varices?,"'Symptoms of ''bleeding varices'' include:' Vomiting of blood Black, tarry, or bloody stool Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Shock (in severe cases)
"
How Are Bleeding Varices Treated?,"'Bleeding from varices is a medical emergency and treatment should be immediate. If the bleeding is not controlled quickly, a person may go into shock or die. In severe cases, a person may need to be placed temporarily on a ventilator to prevent the ''lungs'' from filling with blood. Aside from the urgent need to stop the bleeding, treatment is also aimed at preventing future bleeding. Procedures that help treat bleeding varices include:' Banding: A procedure performed by a gastroenterologist in which small rubber bands are placed directly over the varices. This will stop the bleeding and eradicate the varices. Sclerotherapy: A procedure in which a gastroenterologist directly injects the varices with a blood-clotting solution instead of banding them. Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS): A radiological procedure in which a stent (a tubular device) is placed in the middle of the liver. The stent connects the hepatic vein with the portal vein. This procedure is done by placing a catheter through a vein in the neck. It is performed to relieve the high blood pressure that has built up in the liver.
     Distal Splenorenal Shunt (DSRS): A surgical procedure that connects the splenic vein to the left kidney vein in order to reduce pressure in the varices and control bleeding. Liver transplant: A liver transplant may be done in cases of end-stage liver disease. Devascularization: A surgical procedure that removes the bleeding varices. This procedure is done when a TIPS or a surgical shunt is not possible or unsuccessful in controlling the bleeding.
	"
Can Bleeding Varices Be Prevented?,"'Treating the underlying cause of bleeding varices can help prevent their recurrence and treating ''liver disease'' earlier on may prevent their development. Certain medications including the class of heart ''drugs'' called ""''beta-blockers''"" may reduce elevated portal pressure and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Long acting nitroglycerines are also used for this purpose.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is blepharitis?,"'Blepharitis'' is the medical term for inflammation of the eyelids. The word ""blepharitis"" is derived from the Greek word ''blepharos'', which means ""eyelid,"" and the Greek suffix ''itis'"", which is typically used in English to denote an inflammation. Inflammation is the process by which white blood cells and the body's chemicals react to and protect us from foreign substances, injury, or infection. Signs of inflammation are eye swelling, redness, ""'pain'', warmth, and often change in function.''Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelids, causing red, irritated, ''itchy'' eyelids and the formation of ''dandruff''-like scales on the eyelashes. It is a common eye disorder with a wide variety of causes. It affects people of all ages. Although it may be uncomfortable, annoying, or unattractive, blepharitis is not ''contagious'' and does not cause permanent damage to eyesight. The skin condition can be difficult to manage and it tends to recur. Another term for blepharitis is granulated eyelids. Angular blepharitis describes inflammation that primarily affects the outer corners of the eyelids. Most patients with blepharitis have it in both eyes. MGD, or meibomian gland disease, is often used as a synonym for blepharitis.' "
What are the different types of blepharitis?,"'The cause of most cases of blepharitis is a malfunction of the oil glands of the lids, although ''allergies'', eye infections, and certain systemic diseases can also cause blepharitis. Common types include ''allergic'' blepharitis, seborrheic blepharitis, infectious blepharitis, and blepharitis associated with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD).' "
What causes blepharitis?,"'Blepharitis involves the eyelid margins, where the eyelashes grow and the openings of the tiny oil glands are located. There may be involvement of the skin adjacent to the outer edges of the eyelid margins and/or the inner edge of the eyelid that comes into contact with the eyeball secondary to the underlying disorder of the lid margins.''Most cases of blepharitis are posterior blepharitis, due to inflammation of the meibomian glands of the lids. There are about 40 of these glands in each of the upper and lower lids. The openings of each gland lie behind the eyelashes. The eyelid margins can become inflamed, irritated, and itchy when these glands produce abnormal secretions. Blepharitis is often seen in patients with ''acne rosacea'', a common disorder of the oil glands of the skin of the face.''Anterior blepharitis is due to inflammation of the lid margin around the lashes. Seborrheic blepharitis is similar to ''dandruff'' of the ''scalp'' and is a type of ''seborrheic dermatitis'', a common skin condition that causes scaly patches, red skin, and stubborn dandruff. Seborrheic ''dermatitis'' can also affect oily areas of the body, such as the face, sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears, eyelids, and chest.''Allergies'' due to reactions from mascara, contact ''lens'' solutions, sprays, exposure to animals, environmental chemicals, or airborne allergens can also cause blepharitis.''Less commonly, inflammation of the lids can be caused by a primary infection of the eye lids by bacteria such as ''Staphylococci'' or infestation of the lashes by tiny mites (Demodex) or ''head lice''.'  "
Is blepharitis contagious?,"'Since blepharitis is usually noninfectious, the vast majority of blepharitis cases are not contagious.' "
What are blepharitis symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of blepharitis are usually present in both eyes, affecting the upper and lower lids. They can appear at any age. Symptoms (what one feels in the eyes or eyelids) include''Signs (observations that one makes) of blepharitis include''The symptoms and signs of blepharitis are often erroneously ascribed by the patient as being due to ""recurrent ''conjunctivitis''."" They are also often mistakenly attributed to ""''dry eye''"" by patients due to the gritty sensation that may occur. Lubricating drops, however, do little to improve the condition.'   itchy or irritated eyelids, mild tearing, dryness of the eyes, burning sensation, gritty or sandy sensation, foreign-body sensation (the feeling that something may be in the eye), crusting of the eyelids, decreased comfort while wearing contact lenses, and sensitivity to light. red eyelid margins, swollen eyelids, thickened eyelids, increased shedding of skin cells near the eyelids, causing flaking of the skin around the eyes, matting of the lashes or eyes appearing ""glued together"" in the morning, eyelids that appear greasy and crusted with scales that cling to the lashes, crusted eyelashes upon awakening, tears that are frothy or bubbly in nature, eyelashes that grow abnormally, loss of eyelashes, mild scarring of the eyelid margins, mild ulceration of the lid margins, dry and flaky patches of skin on the lid, and dandruff (seborrhea) of the lashes and eyebrows."
How do health care professionals diagnose blepharitis?,"'Blepharitis can be usually diagnosed by a physician based on the history as given by the patient and the physical examination. Taking a history includes a thorough discussion of symptoms that the patient is experiencing and a review of any general health problems that may be contributing to the eye problem.''The physical examination concentrates on an evaluation of the eyelids, lid margins, base of the lashes, oil gland openings, tear quantity and quality, and the front surface of the eyeball using a slit lamp, which allows a magnified view with sufficient illumination. The type of blepharitis is determined based on this examination and appropriate treatment recommended. Occasionally, cultures are taken by swabbing the discharge and sending this to the laboratory. In some cases, an ''allergy'' evaluation may be required.' "
What are complications of blepharitis?,"'It is unusual for blepharitis to cause serious medical problems. However, blepharitis can lead to the following changes in eye health.''Blepharitis does not affect vision generally, although disturbances of the tear film may intermittently blur vision, causing varying amounts of fluctuating vision during the day.''Call the ophthalmologist if these symptoms develop, which are not due to blepharitis:'  Sty: A sty (sometimes spelled stye) or hordeolum is a bacterial infection in one of the oil glands whose opening is clogged. The result is a painful lump on the edge or inside of the eyelid. Chalazion: A chalazion or conjunctival granuloma occurs when blockage in one or more of the oil glands causes it/them to become enlarged and scarred. Multiple chalazia can also develop, either on the same eyelid or on different lids. Chronic pinkeye: Blepharitis can lead to recurrent bouts of pinkeye (conjunctivitis). Ulceration of the cornea: Constant irritation from inflamed eyelids or misdirected eyelashes may cause a sore (ulcer) to develop on the cornea. Significant changes in vision A sore on the eyelid that persists or increases in size, especially if it is red, bleeding, and not healing Significant pain in either or both eyes Symptoms that become worse or last for longer than two weeks"
What types of health care professionals treat blepharitis?,"'If you develop blepharitis, you should be examined promptly by a health care professional trained in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. Such eye doctors include ophthalmologists and optometrists.' "
What are medical treatment options for blepharitis? Are there home remedies for blepharitis?,"'The single most important treatment principle is a daily routine of lid margin hygiene. The following is a typical lid margin hygiene routine:''Limit or stop using eye ''makeup'', as its use will make lid hygiene more difficult. If one wears contact lenses, temporarily discontinuing wearing them during treatment may be advised. Other treatment depends on the specific type of blepharitis. The key to treating most types of blepharitis is keeping the lids clean and free of crusts. Dandruff shampoo is a standard recommendation.''Antibiotics such as ''doxycycline'', ''tetracycline'', ''azithromycin'', or ''erythromycin'' may be prescribed topically or orally. If the blepharitis is due to ''allergy'', efforts should be made to identify and reduce exposure to the offending agent. Prescription, over-the-counter drops, or oral ''antihistamines'' may be used. If it is caused by an ''allergy'' at home or at work, simply avoiding the ''allergen'' (for example, a dog or cat) may avoid future problems. Oral ''omega-3 fatty acids'', pulsating thermal lid ''massage'', and intense pulsed light treatment to the meibomian glands have also been effective in chronic or severe cases.' Soften lid margin debris and oils: Apply a warm, wet compress to the lids, such as a washcloth with hot water, for five to 10 minutes two to four times a day. To keep the compresses warm for a longer period of time, place a small hot water bottle over the compress. Using a clean washcloth for each cleansing is important. Mechanically remove lid margin debris: After using the compresses, clean the eyelids with a cotton applicator stick soaked in a 4 to 1 mixture of water and baby shampoo or an over-the-counter lid-cleansing product. Gently and repeatedly rub along the lid margins while the eyes are closed. Be careful to avoid rubbing or scratching the eyes."
What is the prognosis for blepharitis?,"'Good hygiene (regular cleaning of the area) can control signs and symptoms of blepharitis and prevent complications. Good eyelid care is usually sufficient for treatment. Such a routine needs to be convenient enough to be continued lifelong to avoid relapses, as blepharitis is often a chronic condition. One episode, however, does not signify that one has a lifelong condition. Blepharitis is not a vision-threatening condition.''If blepharitis is linked to an underlying cause such as ''acne'' ''rosacea'', treating those conditions may alleviate the blepharitis. In patients who have multiple episodes of blepharitis, the condition rarely disappears completely. Even with successful treatment, relapses are common. Taking the time to devote extra attention to good hygiene at those times may help to control the condition.'  "
How long does blepharitis last?,"'Blepharitis due to allergies to mascara or other products like contact lens solutions, sprays, exposure to animals, environmental chemicals, or airborne allergens can be cured within a short period of time by removal of the inciting agent(s).''More commonly, blepharitis is due to inflammation of the meibomian glands of the lids or the lid margin around the lashes. This type tends to be chronic, and if untreated, may persist for years, although the symptoms may be mild and variable. Appropriate daily treatment can lessen the signs and symptoms and can lead to remissions.' "
Is it possible to prevent blepharitis?,"'It is not usually possible to prevent blepharitis. In many cases, good eyelid hygiene and a regular cleaning routine can control blepharitis. This includes frequent scalp and face washing, using a warm compress to soak the eyelids and doing eyelid scrubs using cotton swabs or other soft materials. Blepharitis is usually not contagious. Untreated blepharitis can last for many years, and chronic blepharitis can fluctuate in severity over time.'  "
What is eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty)?,"'An ''eyelid'' lift, or blepharoplasty, is a procedure to remove skin and to add or remove fat from the eyelids. The term ""eyelid lift"" is a misnomer because the eyelid is not truly lifted during surgery.''Upper blepharoplasty surgery uses incisions to allow for removal of skin and fat. A thin stitch is then used to bring the skin together to allow for a creation of an eyelid crease.''Lower eyelid surgery can involve skin incisions directly below the lash line or an incision on the inside of the eyelid, called a transconjunctival approach. The transconjunctival approach allows for access to the eyelid without visible incisions, making this technique perfect for patients who need fat removed or added. This approach can be combined with ''laser resurfacing'' of the eyelid skin to reduce lines and ''wrinkles''.' "
Why is eyelid surgery performed?,"'Upper eyelid excess skin and fat can create a heavy looking eyelid, aged appearance, puffiness, and sometimes block the upper field of vision. Upper blepharoplasty is performed to remove excess skin and fat and can improve the field of vision.''Double eyelid surgery, also called Asian eyelid surgery, is performed to create or enhance an upper eyelid crease. This type of surgery is performed on Asian people to ""westernize"" the appearance of the eyelid.''Lower blepharoplasty can be performed to remove excess skin and improve the contour of the eyelid by adding or removing fat. Sometimes tightening the eyelid is needed to correct sagging, while laser skin resurfacing can be used to improve ''wrinkles'' and skin texture.' "
Who is a good candidate for eyelid surgery?,'Those individuals with realistic expectations who are in good health are suitable for eyelid surgery.' 
How do you prepare for eyelid surgery?,"""Prior to eyelid surgery, the patient should have a detailed examination and discussion about blepharoplasty and potential risks and benefits associated with the procedure. The patient should follow the doctor's preoperative instructions carefully and thoroughly review the postoperative instructions before the day of surgery. This will allow the patient to have any medications for ""'pain'' relief or necessary items such a gel packs, artificial tears, and gauze at home prior to their return from surgery.''A physical may be required to have your medical doctor ""clear"" you for surgery if intravenous sedation or general anesthesia is used.' "
How long is the recovery time for eyelid surgery?,"'Patients usually have a short recovery time after blepharoplasty. Although ''bruising'' and swelling is usually worse on the day after surgery, they quickly begin to disappear. During the first 48 hours, the use of cool compresses can greatly reduce ''bruising'' and swelling around the eyes and face. Light activity such as ''walking'' will also help speed healing. Thin bandages are usually placed over the incision sites and removed in several days, while the ''stitches'' can remain in the skin for about a week. Sometimes self-absorbing stitches are used that do not require removal.''Most people return to normal activities after seven to 10 days following blepharoplasty. By two weeks after eyelid surgery, the majority of the bruising and swelling will resolve.'  "
What are the risks and complications of eyelid surgery?,"'As with any surgery, there are potential risks and complications of blepharoplasty. The major risks include;'   infection, bleeding, scarring, the inability to close the eyes, dry eye, abnormal eyelid position, double vision, and loss of vision."
How much does eyelid surgery cost? Does insurance cover the cost of blepharoplasty?,'The cost of eyelid surgery depends on the type and complexity of the procedure performed.''Insurance carriers will only cover the cost of upper eyelid surgery if the patient has obstruction of their visual field. This must be documented during an examination with formal visual field testing and photographs. Some insurance carriers require submission of the visual fields and photographs before approving the blepharoplasty as a medically indicated procedure.'  
Introduction,"'Botox'' is a brand name of a toxin produced by the bacterium ''Clostridium botulinum''. There are other brand names for ''botulinum'', such as Xeomin. In large amounts, this toxin can cause ''botulism'', which you probably associate with ''food poisoning''. Despite the fact that one of the most serious complications of ''botulism'' is ''paralysis'', scientists have discovered a way to use it to human advantage. Small, diluted amounts can be directly injected into specific muscles causing controlled weakening of the muscles. ''The FDA approved such usage in the late 1980s upon the discovery that Botox could stop ailments like ''blepharospasm'' (uncontrolled blinking) and ''strabismus'' (''lazy eye''). Doctors have been using Botox for years to successfully treat ''wrinkles''  and facial creases. In April 2002, Botox gained FDA approval for treatment of moderate-to-severe frown lines between the eyebrows - called glabellar lines. However, Botox is often used for other areas of the face as well.' "
How Does Botox Work?,"'Botox blocks signals from the nerves to the muscles. The injected muscle can no longer contract, which causes the ''wrinkles'' to relax and soften.'""It is most often used on forehead lines, crow's ""'feet'' (lines around the eye) and frown lines. ''Wrinkles'' caused by sun damage and gravity will not respond to Botox.' "
How Is a Botox Procedure Performed?,'Getting Botox takes only a few minutes and no anesthesia is required. Botox is injected with a fine needle into specific muscles with only minor discomfort. It generally takes three to seven days to take full effect and it is best to avoid ''alcohol'' at least one week prior to treatment. ''Aspirin'' and anti-inflammatory medications should be stopped two weeks before treatment as well in order to reduce ''bruising''.' 
How Long Does a Botox Injection Last?,"'The effects from Botox will last four to six months. As muscle action gradually returns, the lines and wrinkles begin to re-appear and wrinkles need to be re-treated. The lines and wrinkles often appear less severe with time because the muscles are being trained to relax.' "
What Are the Side Effects of Botox?,"'Temporary ''bruising'' is the most common side effect of Botox. ''Headaches'', which resolve in 24-48 hours, can occur, but this is rare. A small percentage of patients may develop ''eyelid'"" drooping. This usually resolves in three weeks. This usually happens when the Botox moves around so you shouldn't rub the treated area for 12 hours after injection or lay down for three to four hours."" "
Who Should Not Receive Botox?,"'Patients who are ''pregnant'', ''breastfeeding'"" or have a neurological disease should not use Botox. Since Botox doesn't work for all wrinkles, a consultation with a doctor is recommended."" "
Will Insurance Pay For Botox?,"'Insurance coverage varies for Botox injections, depending largely on the medical necessity of your condition. Botox is not generally covered by insurance when used for cosmetic purposes. Check with your insurance carrier for coverage details.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is blindness?,"'Blindness is defined as the state of being sightless. A blind individual is unable to see. In a strict sense, the word ""blindness"" denotes the inability of a person to distinguish darkness from bright light in either eye. The terms blind and blindness have been modified in our society to include a wide range of visual impairment. Blindness is frequently used today to describe a severe visual decline in one or both eyes with the maintenance of some residual vision.''Vision impairment, or ''low vision'', means that even with ''eyeglasses'', ''contact lenses'"", medicine, or surgery, someone doesn't see well. Vision impairment can range from mild to severe. Worldwide, between 300 million-400 million people are visually impaired due to various causes. Of this group, approximately 50 million people are totally blind. Approximately 80% of blindness occurs in people over 50 years of age."" "
When is one considered legally blind?,"'Legal blindness is not a medical term. It is defined by lawmakers in nations or states in order to either limit allowable activities, such as driving, by individuals who are ""legally blind"" or to provide preferential governmental benefits to those people in the form of educational services or monetary assistance. Under the Aid to the Blind program in the Social Security Act passed in 1935, the United States Congress defined legal blindness as either central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with corrective glasses or central visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a visual field defect in which the peripheral field is contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better eye. Blindness in one eye is never defined as legal blindness if the other eye is normal or near-normal.''It is estimated that more than 1 million people in the United States meet the legal definition of blindness.'  "
What are the different types of blindness?,"'There are three main types of blindness.''People often say, ""I am \'blind as a bat\' without my glasses."" All bat species have eyes, and most have excellent vision at night but not in daylight. More importantly, the term blindness means the inability to see despite wearing glasses. Anyone who has access to glasses and sees well with the glasses cannot be termed blind.' Color blindness is the inability to perceive differences in various shades of colors, particularly green and red, that others can distinguish. It is most often inherited (genetic) and affects about 8% of males and under 1% of women. People who are color blind usually have normal vision otherwise and can function well visually. This is actually not true blindness. Night blindness is a difficulty in seeing under situations of decreased illumination. It can be genetic or acquired. The majority of people who have night vision difficulties function well under normal lighting conditions; this is not a state of sightlessness. Snow blindness is a loss of vision after exposure of the eyes to large amounts of ultraviolet light. Snow blindness is usually temporary and is due to swelling of cells of the corneal surface. Even in the most severe cases of snow blindness, the individual is still able to see shapes and movement."
What causes blindness?,"'The many causes of blindness differ according to the socio-economic condition of the nation being studied. In developed nations, the leading causes of blindness include'""In third-world nations where 90% of the world's visually impaired population lives, the principal causes are infections, ""'cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', injury, and inability to obtain any glasses. In developed nations, the term ''blindness'' is not used to describe those people whose vision is correctable with glasses.''Infectious causes in underdeveloped areas of the world include''The most common infectious cause of blindness in developed nations is ''herpes'' simplex. Other causes of blindness include'   ocular complications of diabetes, macular degeneration, glaucoma, and traumatic injuries. trachoma, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and leprosy. vitamin A deficiency, retinopathy of prematurity, blood vessel diseases involving the retina or optic nerve includingstroke, infectious diseases of the cornea or retina,ocular inflammatory disease,retinitis pigmentosa,primary or secondary malignancies of the eye, congenital abnormalities, hereditary diseases of the eye, andchemical poisoning from toxic agents such as methanol. stroke, infectious diseases of the cornea or retina, ocular inflammatory disease, retinitis pigmentosa, primary or secondary malignancies of the eye, congenital abnormalities, hereditary diseases of the eye, and chemical poisoning from toxic agents such as methanol."
What are risk factors for blindness?,"'A principal risk factor for blindness is living in a third-world nation without ready access to modern medical care. Other risk factors include' poor prenatal care, premature birth, advancing age, poor nutrition, failing to wear safety glasses when indicated, poor hygiene, smoking, a family history of blindness, the presence of various ocular diseases, and the existence of medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease."
What are signs and symptoms of blindness?,"'All people who are blind or have visual impairment have the common symptom of difficulty seeing. People with similar levels of visual loss may have very different responses to that symptom. If one is born blind, there is much less adjustment to a non-seeing world than there is for people who lose their vision late in life, where there may be limited ability to cope with that visual loss. Support systems available to individuals and their psychological ''makeup'' will also modify the symptom of lack of sight. People who lose their vision suddenly, rather than over a period of years, also can have more difficulty adjusting to their visual loss.''Associated symptoms, such a discomfort in the eyes, awareness of the eyes, foreign body sensation, and ''pain'' in the eyes or discharge from the eyes may be present or absent, depending on the underlying cause of the blindness.''A blind person may have no visible signs of any abnormalities when sitting in a chair and resting. However, when blindness is a result of infection of the cornea (the dome in front of the eye), the normally transparent cornea may become white or gray, making it difficult to view the colored part of the eye. In blindness from ''cataract'', the normally black pupil may appear white. Depending on the degree of blindness, the affected individual will exhibit signs of visual loss when attempting to ambulate. Some blind people have learned to look directly at the person they are speaking with, so it is not obvious they are blind.' "
What specialists treat blindness?,"'Ophthalmology is the specialty of medicine that deals with diagnosis and medical and surgical treatment of eye disease. Therefore, ophthalmologists are the specialists who have the knowledge and tools to diagnose the cause of blindness and to provide treatment, if possible.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose blindness?,"'Blindness is diagnosed by testing each eye individually and by measuring the visual acuity and the visual field, or peripheral vision. People may have blindness in one (unilateral blindness) or both eyes (bilateral blindness). Historical information regarding the blindness can be helpful in diagnosing the cause of blindness. Poor vision that is sudden in onset differs in potential causes than blindness that is progressive or chronic. Temporary blindness differs in cause from permanent blindness. The cause of blindness is made by a thorough examination by an ophthalmologist.'  "
What are treatments for blindness?,"'The treatment of visual impairment or blindness depends on the cause.'  In third-world nations where many people have poor vision as a result of a refractive error, merely prescribing and giving glasses will alleviate the problem. Nutritional causes of blindness can be addressed by dietary changes. There are millions of people in the world who are blind from cataracts. In these patients, cataract surgery would, in most cases, restore their sight. Inflammatory and infectious causes of blindness can be treated with medication in the form of drops or pills. Corneal transplantation may help people whose vision is absent as a result of corneal scarring."
What is the prognosis for blindness?,"'The prognosis for blindness is dependent on its cause. In patients with blindness due to optic-nerve damage or a completed ''stroke'', visual acuity can usually not be restored. Patients with long-standing ''retinal detachment'' in general cannot be improved with surgical repair of their detachment. Patients who have corneal scarring or ''cataract'' usually have a good prognosis if they are able to access surgical care of their condition.' "
Is blindness preventable?,"'Blindness is preventable through a combination of education and access to good medical care. Most traumatic causes of blindness can be prevented through eye protection. Nutritional causes of blindness are preventable through proper ''diet''. Most cases of blindness from ''glaucoma'' are preventable through early detection and appropriate treatment. Visual impairment and blindness caused by infectious diseases have been greatly reduced through international public-health measures.''The majority of blindness from ''diabetic retinopathy'' is preventable through careful control of blood-''sugar'' levels, ''exercise'', avoidance of ''obesity'' and ''smoking'', and emphasis on eating foods that do not increase the ''sugar'"" load (complex, rather than simple carbohydrates). There has been an increase in the number of people who are blind or visually impaired from conditions that are a result of living longer. As the world's population achieves greater longevity, there will also be more blindness from diseases such as macular degeneration. However, these diseases are so common that research and treatment are constantly evolving. Regular eye examinations may often uncover a potentially blinding illness that can then be treated before there is any visual loss.""""There is ongoing research regarding gene therapy for certain patients with inheritable diseases such as Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) and retinitis pigmentosa. Improvements in diagnosis and ""'prevention'' of retinopathy of prematurity, a potentially blinding illness seen in premature ''babies'', have made it an avoidable cause of blindness today.''Patients who have untreatable blindness need tools and help to reorganize their habits and the way in which they perform their everyday tasks. Organizations, such as the Braille Institute, offer helpful resources and support for people with blindness and for their families. Visual aids, text-reading software, and Braille books are available, together with many simple and complex technologies to assist people with severely compromised vision in functioning more effectively. In the United States and most other developed nations, financial assistance through various agencies can pay for the training and support necessary to allow a blind person to function.''John Milton and Helen Keller are well known for their accomplishments in life despite being blind. There are countless other unnamed individuals with blindness, however, who, despite significant visual handicaps, have had full lives and enriched the lives of those who have interacted with them.' "
What is prosopagnosia?,"'Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to recognize faces. Prosopagnosia is also known as face blindness or facial agnosia. The term prosopagnosia comes from the Greek words for “face” and “lack of knowledge.” Depending upon the degree of impairment, some people with prosopagnosia may only have difficulty recognizing a familiar face; others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, while still others may not even be able to distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some people with the disorder are unable to recognize their own face. Prosopagnosia is not related to memory dysfunction, ''memory loss'', impaired vision, or ''learning disabilities''. Prosopagnosia is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus, a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate the neural systems that control facial perception and memory. Prosopagnosia can result from ''stroke'', traumatic ''brain injury'', or certain neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases it is a congenital disorder, present at birth in the absence of any ''brain damage''. Congenital prosopagnosia appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. Some degree of prosopagnosia is often present in children with ''autism'' and ''Asperger’s syndrome'', and may be the cause of their impaired social development.\xa0'  "
Is there any treatment?,'The focus of any treatment should be to help the individual with prosopagnosia develop compensatory strategies. Adults who have the condition as a result of ''stroke'' or brain trauma can be retrained to use other clues to identify individuals.'  
What is the prognosis?,"'Prosopagnosia can be socially crippling. Individuals with the disorder often have difficulty recognizing family members and close friends. They often use other ways to identify people, such as relying on voice, clothing, or unique physical attributes, but these are not as effective as recognizing a face. Children with congenital prosopagnosia are born with the disability and have never had a time when they could recognize faces. Greater awareness of ''autism'', and the ''autism'' spectrum disorders, which involve communication impairments such as prosopagnosia, is likely to make the disorder less overlooked in the future.' "
What research is being done?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to prosopagnosia in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders, such as prosopagnosia.' "
"What is bloating? What does ""feeling bloated"" mean?","'Why am I so bloated? Abdominal bloating or ""feeling bloated"" is a very frequent and familiar symptom most people have experienced at some time in their lives. There are many reasons you may feel bloated. Most causes are simple, harmless, and easily treatable with ''over-the-counter'' or home remedies. Very rarely, abdominal bloating is caused by something more serious, leading to a rapid worsening of uncomfortable symptoms.''The definition of ""bloated"" is swelling or distension, and it usually refers to abdominal bloating, which is a distended belly. Bloating may be accompanied by burping (''belching''), ''gas'' (''flatulence'', ''farting''), abdominal discomfort, and a feeling of fullness. People sometimes refer abdominal bloating as a ""''bloated stomach''"" or ""bloated belly.""' "
What are 21 common causes of abdominal bloating?,"'Increased ''intestinal gas'' is one of the most common reasons you might be bloated. The foods you eat and how you eat them are the main culprits for increased ''gassiness''.''Causes of ''gas'' include:''Other common causes of bloating include:'   Swallowing air from drinking through a straw, or chewing gum. Eating too fast Eating too much Eating fatty foods Eating foods that create gas in the intestinal tract (such beans, vegetables, and other high fiber foods) Lactose intolerance Intestinal disorders, for example, IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), IBD (inflammatory bowel disease, which includes including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), and SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). Celiac disease (gluten intolerance) Abdominal adhesions due to prior surgery(s) in the abdominal or pelvic region, for example, hysterectomy. Indigestion Pregnancy Menstrual period and/or PMS (premenstrual syndrome) Drinking a lot of soda or other carbonated beverages Food allergies Constipation Smoking Liver disease Hiatal hernia Gallstones H. pylori infection (which can lead to stomach ulcers) Gastroparesis"
9 foods that cause bloating,"'Foods high in ''fiber'' can often cause bloating and ''gassiness'', especially in people who are not used to eating them regularly. The good news is that eating these foods frequently can result in better tolerance and less bloating and gas (and better health).''Other foods that may cause bloating and gassiness include:'   Raw, cruciferous vegetables (such as broccoli, cauliflower, kale, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, lettuce, onions) Certain fruits like apricots, apples, peaches, pears, and prunes Beans and lentils Whole grains Greasy, fatty foods Artificial sweeteners (sorbitol) Carbonated beverages Dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream) Salty foods (foods high in sodium, such as processed foods, canned soups, and frozen entrees)"
15 natural and home remedies for bloating and gas relief,"'The best way to relieve and even prevent symptoms of stomach bloating and gas, is a healthy ''diet'' and regular ''exercise'', however, there are many things you can do to prevent and relieve bloating and gas.''You can try natural remedies to relieve bloating and gas.''Talk with your doctor or other health care professional before using any natural or home remedies because they may have unwanted side effects or interactions with medications you currently take.'  Identify foods that cause you to have bloating or gas, and eliminate them from your diet. Other than vegetables and fruits, many of these foods are not necessary for a healthy and balanced diet. Stay active and exercise to help your digestive system function at its best. Don’t smoke cigarettes because it can cause or aggravate bloating and gas. Eat smaller portions if you feel bloated after overeating. Reduce your intake of fatty foods, which can contribute to feeling overly full. Eat more slowly. It can take up to 20 minutes to feel full after you’ve started eating. To reduce excess swallowed air that can cause gas and bloating, avoid carbonated beverages such as sodas, drinking with straws, and chewing gum. When adding high fiber foods to the diet, do so gradually to allow the body time to adjust. Reduce salt intake Don’t smoke as this can cause or aggravate bloating and gas. Take a walk after eating to stimulate digestion. Peppermint tea Ginger Chamomile tea Pumpkin"
5 OTC products for relief of common causes of stomach bloating and gas,"'For relief of more common, less-serious causes of abdominal or belly bloating, there are a number of OTC (''over-the-counter'') products.' Simethicone (Gas-X, Phazyme, Mylicon) can help reduce bloating and gas caused by swallowed air. Beano is an over-the-counter product that contains an enzyme called alpha-D galactosidase that can help reduce gas and bloating caused by eating high fiber foods like vegetables and beans. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto Bismol) can help control the odor in gas, and decrease stomach and intestinal symptoms of discomfort.

What is leukemia? What are the different types of leukemia?,"'Leukemia is a ''malignancy'' (cancer) of blood cells. In leukemia, abnormal blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. Usually, leukemia involves the production of abnormal white blood cells -- the cells responsible for fighting infection. However, the abnormal cells in leukemia do not function in the same way as normal white blood cells. The leukemia cells continue to grow and divide, eventually crowding out the normal blood cells. The end result is that it becomes difficult for the body to fight infections, control bleeding, and transport oxygen.''There are different types of leukemia, based upon how quickly the disease develops and the type of abnormal cells produced. Leukemia is called an acute leukemia if it develops rapidly. Large numbers of leukemia cells accumulate very quickly in the blood and bone marrow, leading to symptoms such as ''tiredness'', ''easy bruising'', and susceptibility to infections. Acute leukemia requires fast and aggressive treatment.''There are around 60,000 new cases of leukemia each year in the U.S. and over 24,000 deaths due to leukemia. Leukemia makes up about 3.7% of all new cancer cases.''Chronic leukemias develop slowly over time. These leukemias may not cause specific symptoms at the beginning of their course. If left untreated, the cells may eventually grow to high numbers, as in acute leukemias causing similar symptoms.''Leukemias are further classified as myeloid or lymphoid, depending upon the type of white blood cell that makes up the leukemia cells. A basic understanding of the normal development of blood cells is needed to understand the different types of leukemia. Normal blood cells develop from ''stem cells'' that have the potential to become many cell types. Myeloid stem cells mature in the bone marrow and become immature white cells called myeloid blasts. These myeloid blasts further mature to become either ''red blood cells'', platelets, or certain kinds of white blood cells. Lymphoid stem cells mature in the bone marrow to become lymphoid blasts. The lymphoid blasts develop further into T or B lymphocytes (T-cells or B-cells), special types of white blood cells. Myeloid or myelogenous leukemias are made up of cells that arise from myeloid cells, while lymphoid leukemias arise from lymphoid cells. Knowing the type of cell involved in leukemia is important in choosing the appropriate treatment.''The four most common types of leukemia are acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ''acute myeloid leukemia'', and ''chronic myeloid leukemia''.''Less common types of leukemia account for about 6,000 cases of leukemia each year in the U.S.'   Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia) is the most common type of leukemia in children, but it can also affect adults. In this type of leukemia, immature lymphoid cells grow rapidly in the blood. It affects almost 6,000 people per year in the U.S. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML, also called acute myelogenous leukemia) involves the rapid growth of myeloid cells. It occurs in both adults and children and affects about 19,500 people each year in the U.S. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a slow-growing cancer of lymphoid cells that usually affects people over 55 years of age. It is estimated to affect about 21,000 people in the U.S. every year. It almost never occurs in children or adolescents. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, also known as chronic myelogenous leukemia) is a type of chronic myeloproliferative disorder that primarily affects adults and occurs in about 8,400 people every year in the U.S. Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is another type of chronic leukemia that develops from myeloid cells. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a type of myeloid leukemia that usually occurs in children under 6 years of age. Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGL leukemia) is a type of chronic leukemia that develops from lymphoid cells. It can be slow- or fast-growing. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML."
What causes leukemia? Is leukemia hereditary?,"""The exact cause of leukemia is not known, but it is thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Leukemia cells have acquired mutations in their DNA that cause them to grow abnormally and lose functions of typical white blood cells. It is not clear what causes these mutations to occur. One type of change in the cells' DNA that is common in leukemias is known as a chromosome translocation. In this process, a portion of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to a different chromosome. One translocation seen in almost all cases of CML and in sometimes in other types of leukemia is an exchange of DNA between chromosomes 9 and 22, which leads to what is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This creates an oncogene (cancer-promoting gene) known as BCR-ABL. This change in DNA is not ""'inherited'' but occurs sometime in the life of the affected individual.''Most cases of leukemia are not believed to be hereditary, but certain genetic mutations and conditions can be passed along to offspring that increase the chances of developing leukemia. A condition known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by an inherited mutation in a ''tumor'' suppressor gene known as TP53, and individuals with this condition have an increased risk of leukemia and other ''cancers''. Other hereditary conditions that can increase the risk of developing leukemia include ''Down syndrome'', ''neurofibromatosis type 1'', ''ataxia telangiectasia'', and ''Noonan syndrome''.' "
What are leukemia risk factors?,"'Exposure to radiation is known to increase the risk of developing AML, CML, or ALL. Increases in leukemia were observed in people surviving atomic bombs. Radiation therapy for cancer can also increase the risk of leukemia. Exposure to certain chemicals, including benzene (used commonly in the chemical industry), increases the risk of leukemia. ''Cigarette smoking'' is known to increase the risk of developing AML.''Certain genetic disorders can increase the risk; ''Down syndrome'', Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and other medical conditions can increase the risk of developing leukemia. ''Blood disorders'' known as myelodysplastic syndromes confer an increased risk of developing AML. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a virus that causes a rare type of leukemia. Certain chemotherapy ''drugs'' for cancer can increase the risk for AML or ALL.''Having risk factors does not mean that a person will definitely get leukemia, and most people with risk factors will not develop the disease. Likewise, not everyone who develops leukemia has an identifiable risk factor.' "
What are leukemia symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms and signs of leukemia depend upon the type of leukemia. As stated earlier, slow-growing or chronic leukemia may not cause any symptoms at the outset, while aggressive or rapidly growing leukemia may lead to severe symptoms. The ''symptoms of leukemia'' arise from a loss of function of the normal blood cells or from accumulation of the abnormal cells in the body.''Signs and symptoms of leukemia typically include the following:''If leukemia cells have infiltrated the brain, symptoms such as ''headaches'', ''seizures'', ''confusion'', loss of muscle control, and ''vomiting'' can occur.'   Fevers Night sweats Swollen lymph nodes that are usually painless Feelings of fatigue, tiredness Easy bleeding or bruising, causing bluish or purplish patches on the skin or tiny red spots on the skin, or recurring nosebleeds Frequent infections Bone or joint pain Weight loss that is unintentional and otherwise unexplained, or loss of appetite Enlargement of the spleen or liver, which can lead to abdominal pain or swelling Red spots on the skin (petechiae)"
How do physicians diagnose leukemia?,"'Hematologists are specialist physicians who diagnose and treat blood diseases, including leukemia; hematologist-oncologists treat blood diseases like leukemia, as well as other types of cancers.''In addition to a medical history (asking about symptoms and risk factors) and a physical exam to look for signs of leukemia (''lymph node'' enlargement, enlargement of spleen), the diagnosis of leukemia typically involves laboratory studies of a blood sample. Abnormal numbers of blood cells may suggest a diagnosis of leukemia, and the blood sample may also be examined under the microscope to see if the cells appear abnormal. A sample of the bone marrow may also be obtained to establish the diagnosis. For a bone marrow aspirate, a long, thin needle is used to withdraw a sample of bone marrow from the hip bone, under local anesthesia. A ''bone marrow biopsy'' involves insertion of a thick, hollow needle into the hip bone to remove a sample of the bone marrow, using local anesthesia.''Cells from the blood and bone marrow are further tested if leukemia cells are present. These additional tests look for genetic alterations and expression of certain cell surface markers by the cancer cells (immunophenotyping). The results of these tests are used to help determine the precise classification of the leukemia and to decide on optimal treatment.''Other tests that may be useful include a ''chest X-ray'' to determine if there are ''enlarged lymph nodes'' or other signs of disease and a ''lumbar puncture'' to remove a sample of cerebrospinal fluid to determine if the leukemia cells have infiltrated the membranes and space surrounding the brain and spinal cord.''Imaging tests such as ''MRI'' and CT scanning can also be useful for some patients to determine the extent of disease.' "
What are leukemia treatment options?,"""There are a number of different medical approaches to the treatment of leukemia. Treatment will typically depend upon the type of leukemia, the patient's age and health status, as well as whether or not the leukemia cells have spread to the cerebrospinal fluid. The genetic changes or specific characteristics of the leukemia cells as determined in the laboratory can also determine the type of treatment that may be most appropriate.""'Watchful waiting may be an option for some people with a chronic leukemia who do not have symptoms. This involves close monitoring of the disease so that treatment can begin when symptoms develop. Watchful waiting allows the patient to avoid or postpone the side effects of treatment. The risk of waiting is that it may eliminate the possibility of controlling the leukemia before it worsens.''Treatments for leukemia include chemotherapy (major treatment modality for leukemia), radiation therapy, ''biological therapy'', targeted therapy, and stem cell transplant. Combinations of these treatments may be used. Surgical removal of the spleen can be a part of treatment if the spleen is enlarged.''Acute leukemia needs to be treated when it is diagnosed, with the goal of inducing a remission (absence of leukemia cells in the body). After remission is achieved, therapy may be given to prevent a relapse of the leukemia. This is called consolidation or maintenance therapy. Acute leukemias can often be cured with treatment.''Chronic leukemias are unlikely to be cured with treatment, but treatments are often able to control the cancer and manage symptoms. Some people with chronic leukemia may be candidates for stem cell transplantation, which does offer a chance for cure.'""Many patients opt to receive a second opinion before beginning treatment for leukemia. In most cases, there is time to receive a second opinion and consider treatment options without making the treatment less effective. However, in rare cases of very aggressive leukemias, treatment must begin immediately. One should discuss with a doctor the possibility of obtaining a second opinion and any potential delays in treatment. Most doctors welcome the possibility of a second opinion and should not be offended by a patient's wish to obtain one.""'Chemotherapy is the administration of drugs that kill rapidly dividing cells such as leukemia or other cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be taken orally in pill or tablet form, or it may be delivered via a catheter or intravenous line directly into the bloodstream. Combination chemotherapy is usually given, which involves a combination of more than one drug. The drugs are given in cycles with rest periods in between.''Sometimes, chemotherapy drugs for leukemia are delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (known as ''intrathecal chemotherapy''). Intrathecal chemotherapy is given in addition to other types of chemotherapy and can be used to treat leukemia in the brain or spinal cord or, in some cases, to prevent spread of leukemia to the brain and spinal cord. An Ommaya reservoir is a special catheter placed under the ''scalp'' for the delivery of chemotherapy medications. This is used for children and some adult patients as a way to avoid injections into the cerebrospinal fluid.''Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the particular drugs taken and the dosage or regimen. Some side effects from chemotherapy drugs include ''hair loss'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''mouth sores'', loss of appetite, tiredness, easy bruising or bleeding, and an increased chance of infection due to the destruction of white blood cells. There are medications available to help manage the side effects of chemotherapy.''Some adult men and women who receive chemotherapy sustain damage to the ovaries or testes, resulting in ''infertility''. Most children who receive chemotherapy for leukemia will have normal ''fertility'' as adults, but depending on the drugs and dosages used, some may have ''infertility'' as adults.''Biological therapy is any treatment that uses living organisms, substances that come from living organisms, or synthetic versions of these substances to treat cancer. These treatments help the immune system recognize abnormal cells and then attack them. Biological therapies for various types of cancer can include antibodies, tumor ''vaccines'', or cytokines (substances that are produced within the body to control the immune system). Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that react against a specific target that are used in the treatment of many kinds of cancer. An example of a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of leukemia is alemtuzumab, which targets the CD52 antigen, a protein found on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Interferons are cell signaling chemicals that have been used in the treatment of leukemia.''Side effects of biological therapies tend to be less severe than those of chemotherapy and can include ''rash'' or swelling at the injection site for IV infusions of the therapeutic agents. Other side effects can include ''headache'', muscle aches, ''fever'', or tiredness.''Targeted therapies are drugs that interfere with one specific property or function of a cancer cell, rather than acting to kill all rapidly growing cells indiscriminately. This means there is less damage to normal cells with targeted therapy than with chemotherapy. Targeted therapies may cause the target cell to cease growing rather than to die, and they interfere with specific molecules that promote growth or spread of cancers. Targeted cancer therapies are also referred to as molecularly targeted drugs, molecularly targeted therapies, or precision medicines.''Monoclonal antibodies (described above in the section on biologic therapy) are also considered to be targeted therapies since they specifically interfere and interact with a specific target protein on the surface of cancer cells. ''Imatinib'' (''Gleevec'') and ''dasatinib'' (''Sprycel'') are examples of targeted therapies that are used to treat CML, some cases of ALL, and some other cancers. These drugs target the cancer-promoting protein that is formed by the BCR-ABL gene translocation.''Targeted therapies are given in pill form or by injection. Side effects can include swelling, ''bloating'', and sudden ''weight gain''. Other side effects can include ''nausea'', vomiting, ''diarrhea'', ''muscle cramps'', or ''rash''.''Radiation therapy uses high energy radiation to target cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be used in the treatment of leukemia that has spread to the brain, or it may be used to target the spleen or other areas where leukemia cells have accumulated.''Radiation therapy also causes side effects, but they are not likely to be permanent. Side effects depend on the location of the body that is irradiated. For example, radiation to the abdomen can cause nausea, vomiting, and ''diarrhea''. With any radiation therapy, the skin in the area being treated may become red, dry, and tender. Generalized tiredness is also common while undergoing radiation therapy.''In stem cell transplantation, high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation are given to destroy leukemia cells along with normal bone marrow. Then, transplant stem cells are delivered by an intravenous infusion. The stem cells travel to the bone marrow and begin producing new blood cells. Stem cells may come from the patient or from a donor.'""Autologous stem cell transplantation refers to the situation in which the patient's own stem cells are removed and treated to destroy leukemia cells. They are then returned to the body after the bone marrow and leukemia cells have been destroyed.""'An allogeneic stem cells transplant refers to stem cells transplanted from a donor. These may be from a relative or an unrelated donor. A syngeneic stem cell transplant uses stem cells taken from a healthy identical twin of the patient.''Stem cells may be removed (harvested) in different ways. Typically, they are taken from the blood. They can also be harvested from the bone marrow or from umbilical cord blood.''Stem cell transplantation is done in a hospital, and it is necessary to remain in the hospital for several weeks. Risks of the procedure include infections and bleeding due to the depletion of normal blood cells. A risk of stem cell transplant with donor cells is known as ''graft-versus-host disease'' (''GVHD'""). In GVHD, the donor white blood cells react against the patient's normal tissues. GVHD can be mild or very severe, and often affects the liver, skin, or digestive tract. GVHD can occur at any time after the transplant, even years later. Steroids or medications that suppress the immune response may be used to treat this complication.""""Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell treatment is a new form of treatment in which a patient's own normal T lymphocytes are re-engineered in a laboratory to attack the leukemia cells and are then reintroduced into the patient's bloodstream. This treatment has been used for people with B-cell ""'lymphomas'' that have relapsed or are refractory to treatment. It is also an approved treatment option for certain cases of leukemia. The U.S. FDA approved tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) in 2018 for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse.''CAR-T therapy is also available in ''clinical trials''. Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially serious side effect frequently associated with CAR T-cell therapy. Cytokines are chemical messengers produced when the CAR T-cells multiply in the body and kill cancer cells. CRS may cause a range of symptoms from mild ''flu-like symptoms'' to more serious symptoms including fast ''heart'' rate, ''low blood pressure'', and heart problems. Other side effects can include nerve damage, suppressed immune function, and a condition known as tumor lysis syndrome that results when cancer cells are rapidly destroyed.''Because CAR T-cell therapy is so new, the patients who have had this treatment have not been followed over the long term. Studies are under way to determine whether CAR-T treatment may be useful in other types of leukemia.''Because many of the treatments for leukemia deplete normal blood cells, increasing the risk for bleeding and infection, supportive treatments may be needed to help prevent these complications of treatment. Supportive treatments may also be needed to help minimize and manage unpleasant side effects of medical or radiation therapy.''Types of supportive and preventive treatments that can be used for patients undergoing treatment for leukemia include the following:'   Vaccines against the flu or pneumonia Blood or platelet transfusions Anti-nausea medications Antibiotics or antiviral medications to treat or prevent infections White blood cell growth factors to stimulate white blood cell production (such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF], made up of filgrastim [Neupogen] and pegfilgrastim [Neulasta] and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating growth factor [GM-CSF], made up of sargramostim [Leukine]) Red cell growth factors to stimulate red blood cell production (darbepoetin alfa [Aranesp] or epoetin alfa [Procrit]) Intravenous injections of immunoglobulins to help fight infection"
What are complications of leukemia?,"'Many of the challenges of leukemia relate to the depletion of normal blood cells as well as the side effects of treatments as described in the previous section, such as frequent infections, bleeding, and GVHD in recipients of stem cell transplants. Weight loss and ''anemia'' are further complications of leukemia and its treatment. Complications of any leukemia also include a relapse or a progression of the disease after a remission has been achieved with treatment.''Other complications of leukemia relate to the specific type of leukemia. For example, in 3% to 5% of cases of CLL, the cells change characteristics and transform into an ''aggressive lymphoma''. This is known as a Richter transformation. Autoimmune hemolytic ''anemic'', in the body attacks and destroys red blood cells, is another potential complication of CLL. People with CLL are also more likely to develop second cancers and other blood disorders and blood cancers.''Tumor lysis syndrome is a condition caused by the rapid death of cancer cells during acute treatment. It can occur in almost any type of cancer, and it is seen with some cases of leukemia, particularly when large numbers of leukemia cells are present such as with AML or ALL. The rapid destruction of the leukemia cells leads to the release of large amounts of phosphate, which further causes metabolic abnormalities and can lead to ''kidney failure''.''Children who receive therapy for ALL may experience late adverse effects including central nervous system (CNS) impairment, slowing of growth, infertility, ''cataracts'', and an increased risk for other cancers. The incidence of these late effects varies depending upon the age at treatment and the type and strength of therapies.' "
What is the prognosis of leukemia?,"'The prognosis of leukemia depends upon the type of leukemia that is present and the age and health status of the patient. Mortality (death) rates for leukemia are higher in the elderly than in younger adults and children. In many cases, leukemia can be managed or cured with treatments available today. In particular, childhood ALL has a very high 5-year survival rate.''Modern treatments have led to a greater than fourfold increase since 1960 in five-year survival rates for leukemia. Five-year survival rates for different types of leukemia from 2007-2013 are approximately:''CML: 68%''CLL: 86%''AML: 27% overall, 66% for children and ''teens'' younger than 15''ALL: 71% overall, over 90% for children' "
How often does leukemia recur?,"""The likelihood that leukemia will recur (come back after successful treatment) depends upon the type of leukemia including the specific molecular characteristics of the cancer cells and the patient's response to initial treatment. Some acute leukemias are successfully treated, and the patient never experiences a recurrence. In chronic leukemias, such as CML, ongoing symptoms and recurrences are common, and treatments may be directed at keeping the leukemia under control."" "
Is it possible to prevent leukemia?,"'Most people who develop leukemia do not have a known risk factor, and it is generally not possible to prevent leukemia. Certain risk factors, such as exposure to radiation or benzene, may be minimized, but this does not guarantee ''prevention'' of leukemia.' "
What support groups are available for people with leukemia?,"'Support groups for people with leukemia and their families offer a variety of resources.''The Leukemia and ''Lymphoma'' Society (''http://www.lls.org/#/diseaseinformation/''getinformationsupport/'') offers information for patients and families, discussion boards, online chats, support groups, and 1:1 support from information specialists. They also offer family support groups.''Information specialists at 1-800-4-CANCER and at LiveHelp (''http://www.cancer.gov/help'') can help someone locate programs, services, and publications.'""Throughout the U.S., hospitals and health systems offer support groups and resources for people living with leukemia. A doctor or other members of a patient's treatment team can provide information about support groups in the area. The National Cancer Institute has publications for patients on coping with leukemia and other cancers (""'http://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education#coping-and-support'').' "
What research is being done on leukemia?,"'Leukemia is an active area of biomedical research. Ongoing studies are examining the risk factors and causes of leukemia, as well as examining new and improved treatment options.'""Clinical trials are studies that examine new drugs or new combinations of drugs and existing treatments. Trials are under way to test new targeted therapy, biological therapy, and chemotherapy regimens. Patients should discuss their situation and care with their doctor if they are interested in being part of a clinical trial. The NCI's web site includes a section on clinical trials at ""'https://clinicaltrials.gov''.' "
Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) overview,"   Pulmonary embolism (PE) describes a blockage of one of the pulmonary arteries by a blood clot that forms elsewhere in the body and travels to the lung. The blood clot (thrombus) usually forms in a vein deep in an arm or leg (DVT=deep vein thrombosis), and breaks off, traveling into and through the heart into the lung where it gets trapped, blocking blood supply to portions of the lung. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) describes the medical condition that includes both PE and DVT. Classic symptoms of pulmonary embolism may include:pleuritic chest pain,shortness of breath,rapid heart rate, andanxiety. pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and anxiety. The condition can also cause less obvious symptoms including anxiety, cough, bloody sputum, abdominal pain, or syncope (passing out). Some risk factors for VTE include:prolonged immobilization,surgery or trauma,cancer,pregnancy,oral contraceptives or estrogen therapy,smoking, andhypercoagulable states (inborn errors of coagulation). prolonged immobilization, surgery or trauma, cancer, pregnancy, oral contraceptives or estrogen therapy, smoking, and hypercoagulable states (inborn errors of coagulation). Pulmonary embolism may cause sudden death. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is sometimes difficult to make and may be missed. It is a diagnosis that needs to be considered in everyone complaining of chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis is most often confirmed by lung CT scan or pulmonary angiography. Anticoagulation (blood thinning) is the treatment for pulmonary embolism. Depending upon the situation, anticoagulation may continue for 3 to 6 months or it may last a lifetime. The major complication of anticoagulation is bleeding."
What is a pulmonary embolism? What does it look like (picture)?,"'The ''lungs'' are responsible for taking oxygen from the air and delivering it to the body. They also take carbon dioxide (a waste product of metabolism) from the blood stream and exhale it, removing it from the body.''The exchange of the air between the lungs and blood are through the arterial and venous system. Both arteries and veins carry and move blood throughout the body, but the process for each is very different.''Arteries carry blood away from the heart, and veins return blood. Every time the heart pumps, it sends blood both to the lungs and the rest of the body.''The circulation pathway is as follows:'""If a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the body's deep veins (""'deep vein thrombosis'' or ''DVT''), it has the potential to break off and travel (embolize) back to the heart and into one of the pulmonary arteries where it can become stuck.''A pulmonary embolus blocks blood flow and prevents functioning of that part of the lung. Not only does it prevent the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, but it also decreases blood supply to the lung tissue itself, potentially causing part of the lung tissue to die (infarct=tissue death).''A pulmonary embolus is one of the life-threatening causes of chest ''pain'' that should always be considered when patients complain of chest ''pain'' and shortness of breath to their health care professionals.''There are special types of pulmonary embolus that are not due to ''blood clots'', but instead are due to other body materials. These are rare occurrences and include:''The signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolus are caused by decreased lung function and the inability of the lung to provide adequate oxygen to the rest of the body.' The pulmonary arteries and their branches send blood from the heart to the lungs. Oxygen from the air is loaded onto hemoglobin in the red blood cells and then travels back to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The heart then pumps that oxygen-rich blood through the aorta and its branches to all the organs and tissues in the rest of the body, including the brain, the abdomen, and the arms and legs. After the hemoglobin delivers the oxygen into the tissues, it collects carbon dioxide, the waste product of metabolism. The carbon dioxide-laden blood then returns through veins back to the heart. The heart pumps this blood through the pulmonary arteries back to the lung. There, the carbon dioxide is returned to exhaled air and a new cargo of oxygen is uploaded to begin the circulation cycle again. fat emboli from the interior of a large bone like a femur (thigh bone), which can occur because of a fracture or as a complication of surgery, an amniotic fluid embolus in pregnancy, tumor tissue from cancer, air embolus, usually a complication of a medical procedure such as neurosurgery, dye injection, or central intravenous line placement."
What are the signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism?,"'The most common symptoms of a pulmonary embolus are the acute onset of:''Vital signs (''blood pressure'', heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) may be normal or abnormal, depending upon the size of the embolus and how much lung tissue is affected. The larger the clot burden or load, the less stable the vital signs.''Abnormal vital signs may include:''The condition progresses as follows:''Sudden death is the initial sign of the condition in up to 25% of cases. The person collapses, stops breathing, and his or her heart stops beating (''cardiac arrest'') without prior symptoms. Pulmonary embolus is the second leading cause of sudden death, behind ''coronary artery disease''.'   Chest pain: The pain is often described as pleuritic, a sharp pain that worsens when taking a deep breath. Shortness of breath: The person may have difficulty catching his or her breath at rest, and the shortness of breath often worsens with activity. Hypoxia or hypoxemia: decreased oxygen concentration in the blood. (hypo=less + ox=oxygen + ia or emia= blood). Tachycardia: elevated heart rate (tachy=fast + cardia=heart); Tachypnea: elevated respiratory (breathing) rate.(tachy=fast + pnea= breathing); Hypotension: decreased blood pressure (hypo=low + tension=blood pressure); Hypoxia: decreased SaO2. Oxygen saturation described how many hemoglobin molecules are carrying oxygen. Normal oxygen level is usually greater than 92%-93%. The heart rate and respiratory rate may elevate as the body tries to compensate for the decreased oxygen transfer capabilities in the lung. This allows the oxygen that is available to be circulated more quickly, supplying the body's organ and tissue needs as best as possible. This may lead to anxiety, weakness and lightheadedness as the body's organs are deprived of the necessary oxygen to function. If the clot burden is large enough, it may make it harder for the heart to pump blood through the blocked pulmonary arteries. This increases the work that the heart has to do, raising pressures inside the heart and straining the heart muscle itself."
What are the causes and risk factors for pulmonary embolism?,"'Pulmonary embolus is the end result of a ''deep vein thrombosis'' or blood clot elsewhere in the body. Most commonly, the DVT begins in the leg and lower abdomen (pelvis) or arm.'""The risk factors for a pulmonary embolism are the same risks for developing deep vein thrombosis. These are referred to as Virchow's triad and include:""'Examples of these include:''Prolonged immobilization''Increased blood clotting potential''Damage to vessel wall'   prolonged immobilization or alterations in normal blood flow (stasis), increased clotting potential of the blood (hypercoagulability), damage to the walls of the veins. Extended travel (sitting in a car, airplane, train) Hospitalization or prolonged bed rest Surgery Medicationsbirth control pillsestrogen supplementationphenothiazines birth control pills estrogen supplementation phenothiazines Smoking Genetic predisposition. Examples include:Factor V Leiden deficiencyMHFTHR mutationProtein C or Protein S deficienciesantithrombin III deficiencyHomocystinemiaHomocystinuriaHyperlipidemia Factor V Leiden deficiency MHFTHR mutation Protein C or Protein S deficiencies antithrombin III deficiency Homocystinemia Homocystinuria Hyperlipidemia Blood disordersPolycythemiaincreased number of red blood cells(the opposite of anemia)ThrombocytosisElevated platelet count Polycythemiaincreased number of red blood cells(the opposite of anemia) increased number of red blood cells (the opposite of anemia) ThrombocytosisElevated platelet count Elevated platelet count Cancer Pregnancy, including the postpartum period up to 6 to 8 weeks after delivery Prior deep venous thrombosis Trauma to the lower leg with or without surgery or casting Venography Pacemaker insertion IV drug abuse"
What tests diagnose pulmonary embolism?,"'The health care professional should keep a high level of suspicion that a pulmonary embolus may be the cause of chest pain or shortness of breath. The first step in the diagnosis is taking a history of the chest pain, including its characteristics, its onset, and any associated symptoms that may direct the diagnosis to pulmonary embolism. The provider may also ask questions about risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.''Physical examination will concentrate initially on the heart and lungs, since chest pain and shortness of breath may also be the major complaints for ''heart attack'', ''pneumonia'', ''pneumothorax'' (collapsed lung), dissection of an ''aortic aneurysm'', among other conditions.''In pulmonary embolism, the chest examination is often normal, but if there is some associated inflammation on the surface of the lung (the pleura), a rub may be heard (pleura inflammation may cause friction, which can be heard with a stethoscope).''The physical examination may also include examining the arms and legs, looking for signs of a DVT, including warmth, redness, tenderness, and swelling.''People with a pulmonary embolus may have no physical findings and have a normal physical exam.'  "
PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolus,"'It is important to be able to determine the risk for pulmonary embolus to decide whether testing is needed to look for a PE.''One risk stratification tool is the PERC rule. If the patient has no risk factors for PE and normal vital signs, the potential for pulmonary embolism is low (less than 2%). No further testing may be necessary, depending upon the situation.''A negative PERC test requires that NO is the answer to the following statements:''If the answer is YES to any of these questions, then the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus still needs to be considered.' Age older than 50 Heart rate faster than 100 SaO2 on room air less than 95% Prior DVT or PE Trauma or surgery within the last 4 weeks Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) Hormone use Unilateral leg swelling (only one leg involved)"
"Basic testing (CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine blood test, chest X-ray, EKG)","'Basic testing in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism may include:''Chest X-ray is often normal in pulmonary embolism.''EKG may be normal, but may also show indirect signs of PE. These include tachycardia (heart rate >100), and changes associated with ''right ventricle'' strain.' CBC (complete blood count), Electrolytes, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), Creatinine blood test (to assess kidney function; see below), INR, PTT (to measure blood clotting capabilities), Chest X-ray, and Electrocardiogram (Electrocardiography; EKG, ECG)."
D-dimer blood test,"'If the suspicion for pulmonary embolism is low, a D-dimer blood test can be used for reassurance that a blood clot may not be present. The D-dimer blood test measures one of the breakdown products of a blood clot. If this test is normal, then the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism is very low. Unfortunately, this test is not specific for blood clots in the lung. It can be positive for a variety of reasons including pregnancy, injury, recent surgery, cancer, or infection.''D-dimer is not helpful if the potential risk for a blood clot is high.''The purpose for the PERC rule and D-dimer test is to minimize the need for imaging studies and decrease ''radiation'' exposure risk.' "
CT scan,"'CT scan (''computerized tomography'') of the chest is usually the imaging test of first choice to look for pulmonary embolus. Dye is injected into a vein in the upper arm. This allows the pulmonary arteries to be outlined looking for blood clots. Care needs to be taken with people who have dye ''allergies'', have kidney issues or who are in their ''first trimester'' of pregnancy.' "
Pulmonary angiogram,"'Historically, the gold standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus was a pulmonary ''angiogram'', in which a catheter was threaded into the pulmonary arteries, usually from veins in the groin or wrist. Dye was injected into the pulmonary arteries and could identify whether blood clots were present. This is an invasive test and requires a skilled radiologist to insert the catheter.''CT scan is more commonly used today, and pulmonary angiography is most often performed in unusual circumstances.' "
Ventilation-perfusion scans,"'Ventilation-perfusion scans (V/Q scans) are another less commonly used test in people who cannot undergo a chest CT scan to make the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.''The scan uses inhaled ''gas'' (V) and injected dye (Q) to compare areas of lung where air can enter with those areas of lung that are getting blood supply. If there is a mismatch, then there is a possibility that a blood clot exists.''V/Q scans take hours to perform and are read by a radiologist as low, medium, and high probability that a blood clot is present. A low probability result means that there is still a 5%-15% change that a PE exists. For that reason, V/Q scans are not often performed.' "
Venous Doppler ultrasound,"'Instead of imaging the lung, ''ultrasound'' of the legs (or arms, if clinically appropriate) may be used to look for blood clots in a patient suspected of having a pulmonary embolus. If a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) exists, it can be inferred that someone complaining of chest pain and/or shortness of breath may be suffering from a pulmonary embolism. The initial treatment for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus may be similar, depending upon the clinical situation.'  "
Echocardiography,'Echocardiography'' or ''ultrasound of the heart'' may be helpful looking for right heart strain as a complication of a pulmonary embolus.' 
What is the treatment for pulmonary embolism?,"'When patients with a PE are admitted to the hospital, it is because they are unstable with abnormal vital signs, or there is concern that they will become unstable. The initial treatment of choice is ''unfractionated ''heparin'', an injectable blood thinner that is continuously given intravenously.''If vital signs are not stable, other alternative treatments may be considered based on the clinical situation. Complications can include ''shock'' with ''hypotension'' (''low blood pressure''), ''confusion'', ''coma'', or ''heart failure''.''Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or ''alteplase'' is an injectable clot-busting drug.''Thrombolytic therapy''Thrombectomy, embolectomy''Once vital signs are stable, anticoagulation with oral medication will follow the intravenous heparin or tPA, and these will be maintained after discharge to home.'   The best treatment for a pulmonary embolus is prevention. Minimizing the risk of deep vein thrombosis is key in preventing a potentially fatal illness. The treatment for PE is anticoagulation. Once the diagnosis of PE is made, it is important to know the severity of the illness and whether the patient needs to be hospitalized or whether treatment can occur at home. The Pulmonary Embolus Severity Index (PESI) can help risk stratify who is stable and who may potentially be unstable. It takes the following factors into account:AgeSexHistory of cancer, heart disease, lung diseaseVital signsMental status Age Sex History of cancer, heart disease, lung disease Vital signs Mental status All patients with abnormal vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) need to be admitted to the hospital. Those who have unstable social situations, have difficulty obtaining medication or have difficulty understanding their medication may require observation prior to being discharged to home. Peripheral thrombolysis (thrombo= clot + lysis= dissolve) is the use of a clot-busting drug injected into a vein, with the expectation that it will “dissolve” the blood clot in the pulmonary artery. Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy is the use of a catheter threaded into the pulmonary artery where the clot is lodged and the clot-busting drug is injected directly into it. A catheter is inserted into the pulmonary artery and the clot is sucked out."
Anticoagulation,"'Anticoagulation, or blood thinning, is the treatment of choice for both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.''Anticoagulation prevents further blood clot formation and prevents embolization of a clot to the lung from existing clots. Under normal conditions, the body will activate a system that will break down blood clots within 4 to 6 weeks.''The American College of Chest Physicians has published guidelines regarding the choice of medications to anticoagulate a patient with VTE. The recommendations were based on review of multiple ''clinical trials'' and meta-analyses (statistical evaluation) in the medical literature.''Apixaban and rivaroxiban are oral medications that have a relatively rapid onset of action and become effective within 3 to 4 days.''Edoxiban and dabigatran take long to become effective and, therefore, there is a two-step process in their use. Either intravenous heparin or subcutaneous enoxaparin need to be used until the oral medications become effective.''Coumadin'' (''warfarin'') has historically been the medication of choice for the treatment of VTE. It takes many days to reach its therapeutic range in the body and, therefore, it too requires the use of heparin or enoxaparin until the medicine is effective.''Certain clinical situations also affect the choice of anticoagulation. Pregnancy, those who are ''breastfeeding'', the presence of ''liver'' or ''kidney failure'', and the presence of anti-phospholipid syndrome may require specific anticoagulation medications. The health care professional needs to match the clinical situation with the appropriate medication.''The dosing of Coumadin is monitored by blood test. INR (international normalized ratio) is used to guide the amount of Coumadin that is taken each day to keep the blood appropriately thinned. Certain foods and medications can interact with Coumadin and affect the dosing.''DOACs do not need blood tests to monitor their effectiveness or dosing. There are ''drug interactions'' that need to be considered when they are prescribed.' In patients with VTE and no cancer, the drug of choice is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as:apixaban (Eliquis)rivaroxiban (Xarelto)edoxiban (Sayvessa)dabigatran (Pradaxa) apixaban (Eliquis) rivaroxiban (Xarelto) edoxiban (Sayvessa) dabigatran (Pradaxa) In patients with VTE and active cancer, the drug of choice is enoxaparin (Lovenox).The National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggests that DOACs may be an acceptable alternative to enoxaparin. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggests that DOACs may be an acceptable alternative to enoxaparin."
Duration of treatment,"'People usually take anticoagulation medications for a minimum of 3 to 6 months. At that time, the decision will be made based upon their risk of developing recurrent clots as to whether they should continue with long-term therapy.''Risk stratification may include whether the blood clot was provoked or unprovoked. An example of a provoked blood clot would be a patient who broke his or her leg, was placed in a cast, and was sedentary. Those who have VTE often undergo hypercoagulable evaluations looking for genetic or familial causes of blood clots.''If the health care professional, in consultation with the patient (shared decision-making), decides that lifelong therapy is required, that decision should be reviewed every year to determine if the risk of clotting still exists and whether the risk of clotting is greater than the risk of bleeding.'  "
Can pulmonary embolism cause death?,"'Patient survival depends upon:''There are more than 900,000 cases of DVT and PE in the United States, and 60,000-100,000 people die each year from the condition. In addition, 25% of cases of PE cause sudden death, and 10%-30% of patients with PE will die within the first month of diagnosis.' the underlying health of the patient, the clot burden of the pulmonary embolus, the effect it has on the heart and its ability to pump blood to the organs of the body, vital sign stability, the cause of the pulmonary embolus, and the ability for the diagnosis to be made and early initiation of treatment."
Can pulmonary embolism be prevented?,"'Minimizing the risk of deep vein thrombosis minimizes the risk of pulmonary embolism. The embolism cannot occur without the initial DVT.' In the hospital setting, the nursing staff works hard to minimize the potential for clot formation in immobilized patients.Compression stockings are routinely used.Surgery patients are out of bed walking (ambulatory) earlier.Low-dose heparin or enoxaparin is prescribed for deep vein thrombosis prevention. Compression stockings are routinely used. Surgery patients are out of bed walking (ambulatory) earlier. Low-dose heparin or enoxaparin is prescribed for deep vein thrombosis prevention. DVT in the legs may require the placement of vena cava filters to prevent clots in the legs from embolizing to the lung. The filter sits in the large vein that leads from the legs to the heart. Those who have had hip or knee replacements may be prescribed DOACs to prevent DVTs. For long travel, getting up and walking or stretching every couple hours may prevent clot formation. Compression stockings may be helpful in preventing recurrent DVT in people with a previous history of a clot. Those on hormone therapy, including birth control pills, should be counseled regarding the risk of DVT. Smoking cessation reduces risk of clot. In those who are overweight, weight loss may decrease the risk of clot formation."
What are blood clots?,"'Blood flows through blood vessels (arteries and veins), and is constantly in motion as the heart pumps blood through arteries to the different areas (organs, glands, cells etc.) of the body. Blood is then returned back to the heart by the veins. Blood returns to the heart by the motion of the body. Muscles squeeze blood through the veins back toward the heart. Without motion, blood has a tendency to stagnate by gravity, and stagnant blood has the tendency to clot.''Blood clotting is an important mechanism to help the body repair injured blood vessels. Blood consists of:''Complex mechanisms exist in the bloodstream to form clots where they are needed. If the lining of the blood vessels becomes damaged, platelets are recruited to the injured area to form an initial plug. These activated platelets release chemicals that start a clotting cascade, using a series of clotting factors produced by the body. Ultimately, fibrin is formed, a protein that crosslinks with itself to form a mesh that makes up the final blood clot.''The medical term for a blood clot is a thrombus (plural = thrombi). When a thrombus is formed as part of a normal repair process of the body, there is little consequence. When a thrombus (blood clot) forms when it is not needed, it can have significant consequences.'   Red blood cells containing hemoglobin that carry oxygen to cells and remove carbon dioxide (the waste product of metabolism), White blood cells that fight infection, Platelets that are part of the clotting process of the body, and Blood plasma, which contains fluid, chemicals, and proteins important for bodily functions."
What causes blood clots?,"'Blood clots form when there is damage to the lining of a blood vessel, either an artery or a vein. The damage may be obvious, such as a cut or laceration, or may not be visible to the naked eye. Blood also will begin to clot if it stops moving and becomes stagnant, or in diseases that cause the blood to clot abnormally.''Blood clots in a vein (venous thrombosis) occur when a person becomes immobilized and muscles are not contracting to push blood back to the heart. This stagnant blood begins to form small clots along the walls of the vein. This initial clot can gradually grow to partially or completely block (occlude) the vein and prevent blood from returning to the heart.''Blood clots in an artery (arterial thrombi) occur by a different mechanism. For those with ''atherosclerotic'' disease, plaque deposits form along the lining of the artery and grow, which causes the vessel to narrow. This disease process may cause:''If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form at the site of that rupture and can completely or partially block the blood flow at that point.'   Heart attack Stroke Peripheral artery disease (PAD)"
What are other causes blood clots?,"'Blood clots in the heart:'' In ''atrial fibrillation'', the upper chamber (''atrium'') of the heart does not beat in an organized manner. Instead, it jiggles, and blood tends to become stagnant along the walls of the ''atrium'"". Over time this may cause small blood clots to form. Clots also can form in the ventricle after a heart attack when part of the heart muscle is injured and unable to contract normally. Since the damaged area doesn't contract with the rest of the heart, blood can start to pool or stagnate, leading to clot formation.""'Blood leaking out of a blood vessel:'"" Blood clots can form when blood leaks out of a blood vessel, and this process can be very beneficial because the clot helps stop further bleeding at the site of injury. A few examples of how bleeding is controlled by the body's clotting mechanism are""'Blood clots causing other medical problems:'' Sometimes, normal blood clotting can cause medical problems because of its location. For example, ''blood in the urine'' may occur from any of a variety of reasons (such as infection, trauma, or ''tumor''/''cancer''), and clots may form over the urethra, the tube that empties the bladder, preventing the bladder from emptying, causing ''urinary retention''.''Clot formation in the uterus may cause pain when the clots are passed through the cervix and can lead to ''vaginal bleeding'', either as part of ''menstruation'' or as abnormal ''vaginal bleeding'' (menorrhagia, ''dysmenorrhea'').' Cuts or scrapes Broken bones Sprains and strains Nosebleed"
What are the symptoms and signs of blood clots?,"'Blood clots in the veins do not allow blood to return to the heart, and symptoms occur because of this ""damming effect."" These clots often occur in the legs or the arms, symptoms include:''Most often, only one leg or arm is affected and the swelling occurs over the course of many hours. Because the leg or arm becomes red, warm, and swollen, it is sometimes difficult to decide whether the cause is a ''DVT'' (''deep vein thrombosis'') or an infection.''On occasion, the whole leg may become very swollen, painful and turn bluish in color due to a blood clot located in the femoral vein in the upper leg or the iliac vein in the pelvis. This is called phlegmasia cerulia dolens. A similar situation may occur in the arm if the blood clot affects the subclavian vein located in the chest.''Blood clots in the arteries do not allow blood to pump to an affected area. Body tissue that is deprived of blood and oxygen begins to die and becomes ischemic. Symptoms of blood clots in the arteries depend upon the location of the clot. Arterial blood clots cause diseases and illnesses that are medical emergencies or call 911.''Heart attack: ''Blood clots in the coronary arteries of the heart cause a heart attack. Symptoms of a heart attack may include:''The pain also may radiate to the arm, jaw, or back.''Stroke'' or ''transient ischemic attack'' (''TIA'' or ""''mini-stroke''""):'' Blood clots to arteries in the brain may cause a stroke or ''transient ischemic attack'' (TIA). Symptoms may include:''FAST'' is the memory tool to remember regarding the symptoms for stroke:''Blood clots that involve the ''mesenteric arteries'' that supply the intestine can cause significant ''abdominal pain'', ''vomiting'', bloating and blood in the ''stool''. This is called mesenteric ischemia.'   Swelling Warmth Redness Pain Chest pain or pressure Shortness of breath Nausea Sweating Indigestion Loss of speech Loss of vision Profound dizziness Weakness and/or loss of sensation on one side of the body Facial drooping Arm weakness Speech difficulties Time (time is of the essence to try to reverse the stroke process. Call 911 and go to a hospital.)"
What are the risk factors for forming blood clots?,"'The risk factors for arterial clots are those that are common to all diseases that cause narrowing of blood vessels, ''cholesterol'' plaque formation, and plaque rupture, including:''Blood clots in the veins are formed due to one of two main reasons: 1) immobility, and 2) genetic errors in the clotting mechanism. There are other associated risk factors including smoking and the use of ''birth control pills''.' High blood pressure High cholesterol levels Diabetes Smoking Family history of early heart attack or stroke Cancer Immobility: Commonly, when the body stops moving, the risk of blood clots increases since muscle movement is required to pump blood toward the heart. Stagnant blood in a vein is prone to clot. Examples of how blood clots may occur from immobility include: Being hospitalized or bedridden after illness or surgery Taking long trips (such as in a car, train, or plane), when hours may pass without standing to move, walk, or stretch, and blood pools in the leg veins and may potentially clot Orthopedic injuries and/or has casts placed over broken bones or limbs Undergoing knee or hip replacement Pregnancy is a risk factor for forming blood clots in the legs and pelvis, due to insufficient blood flow back to the heart. Immobility due to paralysis from a stroke or spinal cord injury. Genetic errors in the clotting mechanism: There may be a genetic or inborn error in the clotting mechanism, making a person hypercoagulable (hyper=more + coagulation= clotting) and at greater risk for forming clots."
What happens when a blood clot forms in the leg and travels to the lung?,"'Blood clots may cause life-threatening medical conditions, and may be considered in the diagnosis.''Deep venous thrombosis (''DVT'') may lead to a ''pulmonary embolism''. If there is a blood clot or thrombus in a deep vein of the leg or arm, it has the potential to break off (embolize) and flow through the veins toward the heart, and into the lung where it can become lodged in a pulmonary artery, which prevents the lung from functioning. ''Pulmonary embolism'' is a medical emergency and can cause serious illness or death.''An embolus is the medical term for a blood clot that has moved within the bloodstream to a different location. With pulmonary embolus (pulmonary embolism), two issues occur.''Even if venous blood clots do not embolize, they may cause significant local problems with swelling and pain. Since blood cannot return to the heart if a clot blocks a vein, the limbs may chronically swell and have decreased function in a condition called chronic ''thrombophlebitis''.' The lungs' blood supply is comprised and the affected area of lung tissue may infarct, or die. Because of the blockage, the ability of the lung to provide oxygen to the body is decreased and hypoxia (decreased levels of oxygen in the blood and throughout the body) may occur."
What happens when blood clots form and travel to the heart?,"'An arterial thrombus stops the blood supply to the tissues beyond the blockage, depriving cells of oxygen and nutrients. This quickly leads to tissue death. Arterial thrombus is the mechanism that causes:''In ''atrial fibrillation'' (''AFib'', AF), small clots may form along the walls of the ''atrium'' or the upper chambers of the heart. If one of these clots break off, it may embolize, or travel in the bloodstream to the brain, blocking an artery and causing a stroke. Other arteries also may be involved when blood clots caused by the presence of AFib dislodge to stop blood flow (embolize), including those that supply blood to the bowel. This can cause bowel ischemia and tissue death (potential necrosis) of the intestine. Clots also can affect blood supply to the extremities (arms, fingers, and toes).''Blood should clot anytime it becomes stagnant. This also means clots will form when blood leaks out of blood vessels.''Examples include:' Heart attack (when it occurs in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart) Stroke (when it occurs in arteries within the brain), Peripheral vascular disease (occurring in the arteries of the legs), or Ischemic bowel or mesenteric ischemia (when it occurs in the arteries that supply blood to the intestine) With bleeding peptic ulcers, patients may vomit liquid blood mixed with clot. Patients with rectal bleeding may also have clot mixed with bloody stool if there has been time for the clot to form. Sometimes patients with urinary tract or bladder infections may develop associated bleeding in their urine, and small clots can form. On occasion, these clots may be so big that they cannot be passed and block the urethra (the tube that empties the bladder), preventing urination and causing urinary retention. Vaginal bleeding is a normal event for most women in the reproductive years and occasionally, blood can pool in the vagina and form clots before being expelled. If clots form in the uterus, they may cause significant pain and pressure as they pass through the cervix while being expelled."
How are blood clots found and diagnosed?,"'The first step in making the diagnosis of a blood clot is talking to the patient and family to understand the situation. The location of the blood clot and its effect on blood flow is what causes symptoms and signs. If a blood clot or thrombus is a consideration, the history may explore risk factors or situations that might put the patient at risk for forming a clot.''Venous blood clots often develop slowly with a gradual onset of swelling, pain, and discoloration. Symptoms of a venous thrombus will often progress over hours.''Arterial thrombi occur as an acute (sudden onset) event. Tissues need oxygen immediately, and the loss of blood supply creates a situation in which symptoms begin immediately.''Arterial thrombi occur as an acute event. Tissues need oxygen immediately, and the loss of blood supply creates a situation in which symptoms begin immediately.''There may be symptoms that precede the acute artery blockage that may be warning signs of the potential future complete occlusion of the blood vessel.''Physical examination can assist in providing additional information that may increase the suspicion for a blood clot.''Arterial thrombus is also the cause of heart attack and stroke (''cerebrovascular accident'') and their associated symptoms.' Patients with an acute heart attack may experience angina or chest discomfort (pressure, pain, indigestion, fatigue) in the days and weeks prior to the heart attack. It is important to remember that women may experience atypical and non-specific symptoms as part of their angina equivalent, including fatigue and malaise. Patients with peripheral artery disease may have pain with walking (claudication) A TIA (transient ischemia attack, mini-stroke) in which the symptoms resolve without treatment may precede a stroke. Vital signs may be helpful in deciding how stable the patient is. These include blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation (what percentage of red blood cells have oxygen attached). Heart monitoring and an EKG may be ordered to assess heart rate and rhythm. Venous thrombi may cause swelling of an extremity (arm, leg). The limb may appear to be red, warm, and tender; sometimes the appearance is difficult to distinguish from cellulitis or an infection of the extremity. If there is concern about a pulmonary embolus, the doctor may examine the lungs to listen for abnormal sounds caused by an area of inflamed lung tissue. Arterial thrombus symptoms are much more dramatic. If a leg or arm is involved, the tissue may be white because of the lack of blood supply. In addition, it may be cool to touch and there may be loss of sensation and movement (paralysis). The patient may be writhing in pain."
What procedures and test diagnose blood clots?,"'If a blood clot travels to the lung, this is a medical emergency. ''There are varieties of tests to look for pulmonary emboli. A plain ''chest X-ray'' will not show blood clots, but the X-ray may be done to look for other conditions that can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, which are the most common symptoms of a pulmonary embolus. An ''electrocardiogram'' (EKG) may show abnormalities suggestive of a pulmonary embolus and may reveal other causes of chest pain.''Arterial thrombosis is an emergency'', since tissue cannot survive long without blood supply delivering oxygen and nutrients and shortly causing irreversible damage. When this occurs in an arm or leg, often a surgeon is consulted on an emergency basis. Arteriography may be considered, a test in which contrast material is injected into the artery in question to look for blockage on imaging studies. Sometimes, if there is a large artery that is blocked (occluded) this test is done in the operating room with the presumption that a surgical procedure will be needed to open the vessel and restore blood flow. An interventional radiologist may be part of the treatment team to also try to remove the clot directly or dissolve the clot with medications.''Heart attack:'' The EKG may establish the diagnosis, although blood tests may be used to look for enzymes (troponin) that leak into the bloodstream from irritated heart muscle. In an acute heart attack, the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice is a heart catheterization. A catheter is threaded into the coronary artery to the level of the blockage, and the clot and plaque are squashed in the artery wall (''angioplasty''), and a ''stent'' is placed to keep the artery open. If the hospital does not have a cardiologist or heart catheterization facility available, clot busting ''drugs'' (TPA, TNK) may be used to try to restore blood supply to the affected part of the heart. A heart catheterization may be performed later.''Acute stroke: ''The test of choice is a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head to look for bleeding or tumor as the cause of ''stroke symptoms'' instead of a blood clot blocking an artery.''Other studies:'' Other CT studies of the head may be helpful in guiding treatment of a stroke and include CT perfusion to look at brain blood flow and CT ''angiography'' (CTA) to map the anatomy of the arteries and look for any acute clot that might need to be treated. An ''MRI'' may be considered but the test is not always readily available and also takes significantly more time to perform and interpret. If the symptoms of a stroke resolve quickly, the diagnosis becomes a transient ischemic attack (TIA, mini-stroke), and further tests may include carotid ultrasound to look for blockages in the major arteries of the neck and ''echocardiography'' to look for blood clots in the heart that may embolize to the brain and cause permanent stroke damage in the future.' Ultrasound: Venous blood clots may be detected in a variety of ways, though ultrasound is most commonly used. Occasionally, the patient's size and shape limit the ability of the person performing the ultrasound to adequately see the veins. Venography: Venography is an alternative test to look for a clot. In this test, a radiologist injects contrast dye into a small vein in the hand or foot and using fluoroscopy (video X-ray), watches the dye fill the veins in the extremity as it travels back to the heart. The area of clot or obstruction can thus be visualized. D-Dimer: Sometimes, a blood test is used to screen for blood clots. D-Dimer is a breakdown product of a blood clot, and its levels in the bloodstream may be measured. D-Dimer is not specific for a blood clot in a given area and cannot distinguish a ""good"" or needed blood clot (for example, a clot that forms after surgery or due to bruising from a fall) from one that is causing medical problems. It is used as a screening test in low risk patients with the expectation that a negative result will conclude that there is no need to look further for blood clots. The healthcare professional usually counsels the patient that a positive blood test will likely require additional tests being considered. D-Dimer also maybe elevated in women who are pregnant and patients with cancer. CT scan: Computerized tomography (CT scan) is often the test of choice when suspicion of pulmonary embolus is high. Contrast material is injected intravenously, and the radiologist can determine whether a clot is present in the pulmonary vessels. The contrast material injected into the body can be irritating to the kidney(s) and should not be used in patients who have impaired kidney function. In older patients, screening blood tests (serum creatinine) to check kidney function may be required before a dye study is considered. The radiologist may also be able to advise whether the heart is straining to pump because of the amount of clot that might be present in the lung. The more clot there is, the harder the heart has to work to pump. Ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan: On occasion, a ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan is performed to look for pulmonary emboli. This test uses labeled chemicals to identify inhaled air into the lungs and match it with blood flow in the arteries. If a mismatch occurs, meaning that there is lung tissue that has good air entry but no blood flow, it may be indicative of a pulmonary embolus. It is less accurate and more subjective than a CT scan, and requires the skill and experience of a radiologist to interpret. The VQ scan is often performed when a CT scan is contraindicated, for example, with a major dye allergy or in a patient with kidney compromise."
What is the treatment for blood clots? Can it go away without treatment?,"'Depending upon their location, blood clots may be aggressively treated or may need nothing more than symptomatic care.''Blood clots in superficial the veins (venous blood clots)''Blood thinners''Clots in the deep vein system of the arm or leg may need to have the blood ""thinned"" with anticoagulation medications.'""The American College of Chest Physicians' 2016 guidelines recommend that patients who have ""'deep vein thrombosis'' (DVT) or pulmonary embolus (PE) be treated with different anticoagulation medications depending upon their situation.''NOACs work by blocking factors in the clotting cascade. These include:''Direct thrombin inhibitor''Enoxaparin (Lovenox) is a low molecular weight heparin that may be injected under the skin to ""thin"" the blood and anticoagulate the patient. In addition to its indication to treat DVT and PE in cancer patients, it is often used as a ''bridge'' treatment should a patient be treated with edoxaban, dabigatran, or ''warfarin'', since these medications take time to reach a therapeutic level in the body. Enoxaparin is often the medication of choice in pregnant patient who develop blood clots like a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.''Unfractionated heparin is used intravenously to anticoagulate a patient in the hospital, especially if the patient is unstable due to an underlying condition.''Warfarin (''Coumadin'', ''Jantoven'')''Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) is one type of anticoagulation medication that has been used for many years to treat blood clots. It blocks clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, those that depend upon ''Vitamin K'', and historically was prescribed as soon as DVT (deep venous thrombosis) or blood clot is diagnosed. Because it takes a few days to effectively thin the blood, low molecular weight Heparin (enoxaparin) or regular heparin is used to immediately cause anticoagulation.''Pulmonary emboli are treated similarly to deep venous thrombosis, but depending on the severity of the symptoms, the amount of clot formation, and the underlying health of the patient, admission to the hospital for treatment and observation may be needed. Usually, unstable or potentially unstable patients are treated with intravenous unfractionated heparin.''Patients who are critically ill and display symptoms of heart strain or ''shock'' may be candidates for thrombolytic therapy using drugs known as tissue plasminogen activators (tPA). tPA may be injected into a peripheral vein in the arm to immediately thin the blood and act as a clot-busting drug or it can be dripped directly into the clot through a catheter that is placed by an interventional radiologist.''Arterial blood clot treatment''Arterial blood clots are often managed more aggressively. Surgery may be attempted to remove the clot, or medication may be administered directly into the clot to try to dissolve it. ''Alteplase'' (''Activase'', r-tPA) or tenecteplase (TNKase) are examples of tissue plasminogen activator (see above) medications that may be used in peripheral arteries to try to restore blood supply.''This same approach is used for heart attack. If possible, ''cardiac catheterization'"" is performed to locate the blocked blood vessel and a balloon is used to open the occluded area, restore blood flow, and place a stent to keep it open. This is a time-sensitive procedure and if a hospital is not available to do the procedure emergently (within 60-90 minutes of the patient's symptoms) TPA or TNK may be used intravenously to try to dissolve the thrombus and minimize heart damage. Eventually, when stable, the patient will be transferred for potential heart catheterization to evaluate the heart anatomy and decide whether ""'stents'' may be needed to keep an artery open or whether bypass surgery might be needed to restore blood supply to the heart.''Stroke is also treated with tPA if the patient is an appropriate candidate for this therapy. As well, there are now opportunities in some hospitals to have an interventional radiologist or ''neurologist'' thread a catheter into the blocked artery in the brain, try to find the clot causing the stroke, and remove it. This same strategy is used for heart attack and some patients with peripheral artery clots in an arm or leg.' Clots may develop in the superficial or deep veins of the leg. Treatment for a superficial blood clot is directed at managing pain and decreasing inflammation with medication (for example, acetaminophen [Tylenol and others] or ibuprofen [Advil, Motrin, etc.]). The risk of these clots lodging and obstructing (embolizing) in the vein is low because of the anatomy of the leg. Specialized veins (perforator veins) connect the superficial veins to the deep veins, and have valves that act like strainers to prevent clots from traveling to the lung. Patients with DVT or PE who have no active cancer should be treated with NOACs (novel oral anticoagulant) medications. These are also known as DOACs (direct oral anticoagulant). Patients with DVT or PE who have active cancer should be treated with low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin [Lovenox]) Factor Xa inhibitors: apixaban (Eliquis) rivaroxaban (Xarelto) edoxaban (Savaysa) dabigatran (Pradaxa) Heparin"
What are the complications of blood clots?,"   Blood clots prevent proper circulation of blood. Deep vein thrombosis of the leg or arm may cause permanent damage to the veins themselves and cause persistent swelling of the extremity (post-phlebitis syndrome). The life-threatening issue that may arise from deep vein clots in the arm or leg is that they may break off and embolize to the lungs (pulmonary embolus), causing problems with lung function and oxygenation of the blood. Arterial thrombus often is a life- or limb threatening event, since organs and cells do not get enough oxygen when cut off from their oxygen supply."
How can you prevent blood clots?,"'Prevention is key in thrombosis or clot formation.''The main risk factor for deep vein thrombosis risks is immobilization. It is important to move around routinely so that blood can circulate in the venous system. On long trips, it is recommended to get out of the car every couple of hours, or in an airplane to routinely get up and stretch.''Physicians and nurses work hard at getting people moving after surgery or while in the hospital for medical conditions. The low molecular weight heparin known as enoxaparin (Lovenox) can also be used in low doses to prevent clot formation. Patients are often given tight stockings to promote blood return from the legs and prevent pooling of blood.''In patients who have had hip or ''knee replacement'', anticoagulation with a NOAC may be appropriate.''In patients with atrial ''fibrillation'"", anticoagulation may be appropriate depending upon the patient's underlying condition, the clinical situation, and the risk factors for stroke. Using the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system, the risk for stroke in atrial fibrillation may be calculated and discussed with the patient. This system considers various factors to determine the patient's risk:""'Anticoagulation with a NOAC or warfarin may be appropriate.' For arterial thrombosis, the most likely precipitating event is a plaque rupture with clot formation in the artery. Minimizing the risk of vascular disease requires life-long attention to the risk factors that lead to plaque buildup and ""hardening"" of the arteries. Blood pressure and cholesterol control, diabetes management, and refraining from smoking all minimize the risk of arterial disease. Although family history is an important risk factor, one needs to be even more vigilant about the other risk factors if there is a family history of early heart attack or stroke. Age in years Sex Congestive heart failure (CHF) history Hypertension (high blood pressure) history Stroke/TIA/ blood clot history Vascular disease history Diabetes"
Which type of doctor treat blood clots?,"'A variety of different specialists may be involved in the care of a patient with a blood clot, from diagnosis to treatment and prevention, depending upon the exact type and location of the clot. These may include internists, family medicine specialists, emergency physicians, interventional radiologists, surgeons, cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, neurologists, and critical care specialists.' "
What is a complete blood count (CBC) test?,"'The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. Special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute generally determine these calculations.''A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood.' "
How much does a CBC test cost?,"'The cost for a\xa0complete blood count test or CBC test varies greatly, and can run\xa0from $10.00 up to $2,700 depending on what type of insurance you have, and whether or not you have it.' "
What is the complete blood count test used for?,"'Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments.' It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia). To monitor a medical treatment: a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be the cause of prolonged bleeding or other medical conditions that affect the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Conversely, a high platelet count (thrombocytosis) may point toward a bone marrow problem or severe inflammation."
What does a complete blood count test measure?,"'The complete blood count, or CBC, lists a number of many important values. Typically, it includes the following:''Mean corpuscular volume (MCV):'' is the average volume of a red blood cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and red cell count. Normal range may fall between 80 to 100 femtoliters (a fraction of one millionth of a liter).''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): ''is the average amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell. This is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the red cell count. Normal range is 27 to 32 picograms.''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): ''is the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of red cells. This is a calculated volume derived from the hemoglobin measurement and the hematocrit. Normal range is 32% to 36%.''Mean Platelet Volume (MPV): ''is the average size of platelets in a volume of blood.' White blood cell count (WBC or leukocyte count) WBC differential count Red blood cell count (RBC or erythrocyte count) Hematocrit (Hct) Hemoglobin (Hbg) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) Red cell distribution width (RDW) Platelet count Mean Platelet Volume (MPV)"
What are the normal ranges for a complete blood count test?,"'The values generally included:''Red blood cells are the most common cell type in blood and people have millions of them in their blood circulation. They are smaller than white blood cells but larger than platelets.' White blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm). This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 to 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. White blood cell (WBC) differential count. The white blood count is comprised of several different types that are differentiated, or distinguished, based on their size and shape. The cells in a differential count are granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. Red cell count (RBC) signifies the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally from 4.2 to 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 to 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter. Platelet count measures the number of platelets in a volume of blood and usually ranges between 150,000 to 400,000 per cmm."
"What is the function of the red and white blood cells, and platelets?","'The cells in the CBC (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) have unique functions. Generally speaking, white blood cells are an essential part of the immune system and help the body fight infections. Each different component of the white blood cell (the WBC differential) plays a specific role in the immune system.''Red blood cells are essential in transporting oxygen to all the cells in the body to serve their functions. The hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell is the vehicle for the transportation of oxygen. Platelets are a part of the blood clotting system in the body and help in preventing bleeding.' "
What is blood in the semen?,"'The presence of blood in the semen (ejaculate) is also called hematospermia. Hematospermia is not always noticed; therefore, it is difficult to make estimates of its incidence.' "
What are the causes of blood in the semen?,"'Blood in semen'' can be caused by many conditions affecting the male genitourinary system. Areas affected may include the bladder, urethra, the testicles, the tubes that distribute semen from the testicles (known as the seminal vesicles), the epididymis (a segment of the spermatic ducts that serves to store, mature, and transport sperm), and the ''prostate gland''.''Blood in the semen is most commonly a result of a prostate gland biopsy. A majority of men who undergo a prostate biopsy may have some blood in their semen that persists for three to four weeks. Likewise, ''vasectomy'' can lead to bloody semen for about one week after the procedure.''In men with hematospermia who have not had a recent prostate biopsy or vasectomy, a number of benign and ''malignant'' conditions of the male genital system may be the cause. In many situations, no definitive cause is found.''The following conditions have been reported in association with hematospermia:'   Benign or malignant tumors of the prostate, bladder, testes, or seminal vesicles Infections including, but not limited to, chlamydia, herpes, cytomegalovirus, and trichomoniasis Inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), epididymis (epididymitis), or urethra (urethritis) Calculi (stones similar to kidney stones) in the seminal vesicles or prostate Polyps in the urethra Ejaculation duct obstructions Metastatic cancers (that have spread from other sites in the body) located in the genitourinary system Cysts, hemorrhage, or other abnormalities in the seminal vesicles"
What are the symptoms of blood in the semen?,"'The symptoms that can occasionally accompany blood in the semen may be any of the following, depending upon the cause (these are not all inclusive):'   Painful urination Pain with ejaculation Blood in urine Lower back pain Fever Tenderness in the testes and/or scrotum Swelling in the testes and/or scrotum Swelling or tenderness in the groin area"
How is blood in the semen evaluated?,"'A number of diagnostic tests may be performed after the clinical history is evaluated and a physical examination is performed. Some of the most commonly performed diagnostic tests are a ''urinalysis'' and cultures to identify any sexually transmitted or other infections. When indicated, imaging studies such as ''ultrasound'' or ''MRI'' may reveal tumors or other abnormalities. In some situations, a semen analysis, in which the semen is analyzed under a microscope, may be recommended.' "
What is the treatment for blood in the semen?,"'Treatment of blood in the semen is directed toward the underlying cause if a cause has been found. Sometimes, treatment with antibiotics for a presumptive diagnosis of prostatitis (''inflammation of the prostate gland'') is given, since some studies have shown that up to about one-fourth of men with hematospermia have prostatitis. However, the benefit of such treatment has not been definitively established.''In most cases, if blood in the semen is not associated with any known abnormality of other troubling symptoms, no treatment is given, and the condition usually resolves on its own with time in these situations. Persistent hematospermia (for a month or more) even in the absence of other symptoms warrants further or follow-up evaluation.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for patients with blood in the semen?,"'The prognosis relates to the underlying cause of blood in the semen if a cause can be identified. However, most cases of hematospermia are benign and resolve without treatment. While ''cancer'' is a rare cause of blood in the semen, the majority of cases are not related to ''cancer'', especially in younger men.' "
What does rectal bleeding (blood in stool) mean?,"'Rectal bleeding (known medically as ''hematochezia'') refers to the passage of red blood from the anus, often mixed with stool and/or ''blood clots'"". It is called rectal bleeding because the rectum lies immediately above the anus, but red blood in the stool may be coming from the rectum, as discussed later, but it also may be coming from other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.) The severity of rectal bleeding (i.e., the quantity of blood that is passed) varies widely. Most episodes of rectal bleeding are mild and stop on their own. Many patients report only observing a few drops of fresh blood that turns the toilet water pink or observing spots of blood on the tissue paper after they wipe. Others may report brief passage of a spoonful or two of blood. Generally, mild rectal bleeding can be evaluated and treated in the doctor's office without hospitalization or the need for urgent diagnosis and treatment.""""Bleeding also may be moderate or severe. Patients with moderate bleeding will repeatedly pass larger quantities of bright or dark red (maroon-colored) blood often mixed with stool and/or blood clots. Patients with severe bleeding may pass several bowel movements or a single bowel movement containing a large amount of blood. Moderate or severe rectal bleeding can quickly deplete a patient's body of blood, leading to symptoms of ""'weakness'', ''dizziness'', near-''fainting'' or ''fainting'', signs of ''low blood pressure'' or ''orthostatic hypotension'' (a drop in ''blood pressure'' when going from the sitting or lying position to the standing position). Rarely, the bleeding may be so severe as to cause ''shock'' from the loss of blood. Moderate or severe rectal bleeding usually is evaluated and treated in the hospital. Patients with signs and symptoms of a reduced volume of blood often require emergency hospitalization, and transfusion of blood.'  "
What are causes of blood in the stool (rectal bleeding)?,"'Blood in the stool primarily comes from the upper gastrointestinal tract (stomach and duodenum although occasionally the ''esophagus'') or the lower gastrointestinal tract (colon, rectum, and anus). Although the small intestine also may be the source of blood in the stool, compared to the upper and lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the small intestine is infrequently the source. Most people think of blood in the stool as meaning that the stool contains red blood, but this is not always true. As discussed previously, the bloody stool may be maroon colored or black.''The colon is the part of the gastrointestinal tract through which undigested food passes after the digestible part of the food has been digested and absorbed in the small intestine. The colon is primarily responsible for removing water from the undigested food, and storing the undigested food until it is eliminated from the body as stool. The rectum is the last 15 cm (6 inches) of the colon. The anal canal, approximately an inch in length, connects the rectum with the anus opening through which stool passes when it is eliminated from the body. Together, the colon, rectum, anal canal, and anus form a long (several ''feet'' in length), muscular tube that also is known as the ''large intestine'', large bowel, or the lower gastrointestinal tract.''The colon can be divided further into three regions; the right colon, the transverse colon, and the left colon. The right colon, also known as the ascending colon, is the part of the colon into which undigested food from the small intestine is first deposited. It is furthest from the rectum, anal canal, and anus. The transverse colon forms a ''bridge'' between the right and the left colon. The left colon is made up of the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The sigmoid colon connects the descending colon to the rectum.''The color of blood in the stool often depends primarily on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Generally, the closer the bleeding site is to the anus, the brighter red the blood will be. Thus, bleeding from the anus, rectum, and the sigmoid colon tends to be bright red, whereas bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon tends to be dark red or maroon-colored. With bleeding from the upper GI tract and depending on how long the blood remains in the stomach and small intestine, the color in the stool will change from bright red, to maroon, to black. ''Blood in the stool that is red or maroon is most commonly is referred to as rectal bleeding.''Bleeding that occurs from the stomach and duodenum frequently is black, ""tarry"" (sticky), and foul smelling.'' The black, smelly and tarry stool is called melena. ''Melena'' mostly occurs when the bleeding is in the stomach where the blood is exposed to acid or is in the small intestine for a prolonged amount of time; however, melena also may occur with bleeding from the colon if the transit of the blood through the colon is slow, and there is enough time for the intestinal bacteria to break the blood down into chemicals (hematin) that are black.''Blood from the sigmoid colon, rectum and anus usually does not stay in the colon long enough for the bacteria to turn it black. Rarely, massive bleeding from the right colon, from the small intestine, or from ulcers of the stomach or duodenum can cause rapid transit of the blood through the gastrointestinal tract and result in bright red rectal bleeding. In these situations, the blood is moving through the colon so rapidly that there is not enough time for the bacteria to turn the blood darker or black.''Another ""type"" of blood in the stool is occult blood. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding refers to a slow loss of blood into the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract that does not change the color of the stool or result in the presence of visible bright red blood. Blood in the stool is detected only by testing the stool for blood (fecal occult blood testing) in the laboratory. Occult blood in the stool has many of the same causes as rectal bleeding, and may be associated with the same symptoms as more active bleeding. For example, slow bleeding from ulcers, ''colon polyps'', or ''cancers'' can cause small amounts of blood to mix and be lost within the stool. Chronic occult bleeding often is associated with ''anemia'' due to the loss of iron along with the blood (''iron deficiency anemia'').'  "
What diseases and conditions can cause blood in the stool (rectal bleeding)?,"'Many diseases and conditions can cause rectal bleeding. Common causes include:''As discussed previously, it also is possible for ""rectal bleeding"" to be coming from the stomach and duodenum, primarily from ulcers, cancers, and angiodysplasias.'   Anal fissures Hemorrhoids Cancers and polyps of the rectum and colon Diverticulosis Abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the intestines (angiodysplasia) Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative proctitis Crohn's colitis Infectious colitis Ischemic colitis Meckel's diverticula"
Anal fissures,"'An anal fissure is a fairly common, painful condition in which the lining of the anal canal is torn. An anal fissure usually is caused by physical ''trauma'' due to ''constipation'' or a forceful bowel movement through a tight anal muscle or physical trauma also may be contributing factors. Once the skin is torn, each subsequent bowel movement can be painful, and the ''pain'' often is severe. The amount of bleeding that occurs with an anal fissure is small and usually is noticed in the toilet bowl or on the toilet paper as bright red in color. The symptoms of an anal fissure are commonly mistaken for ''hemorrhoids'', but ''hemorrhoids'' generally do not cause ''pain'' with bowel movements.'  "
Hemorrhoids,"'Hemorrhoids are masses or clumps (""cushions"") of tissue within the anal canal that contain blood vessels. Although most people think hemorrhoids are abnormal, they are present in everyone. It is only when the hemorrhoidal cushions enlarge that hemorrhoids become susceptible to trauma from passing stool and cause problems (such as bleeding or anal discomfort) and are considered abnormal or a disease. Like anal fissures, bleeding from hemorrhoids usually is mild and does not cause anemia or ''low blood pressure''. Rarely, a person may develop ''iron deficiency'' anemia as a result of repeated hemorrhoidal bleeding over several months to years, especially if the dietary intake of iron is low.'  "
Colon cancer and polyps,"'Tumors of the colon and rectum are growths (masses) arising from the wall of the large intestine. Benign tumors of the large intestine usually are called polyps because of their shape. ''Malignant'' tumors of the large intestine are cancers, and most are believed to have developed from polyps. Bleeding from colon polyps and cancers tends to be mild (the amount of blood loss is small), intermittent, and usually does not cause ''low blood pressure'' or shock.''Cancers and polyps of the colon and rectum can cause bright red rectal bleeding, maroon colored stools, and sometimes melena. The colon cancers and polyps located near the rectum and the sigmoid colon are more likely to cause mild intermittent bright red rectal bleeding, while colon cancers located in the right colon are more likely to cause occult bleeding that over time can lead to moderate or severe ''iron deficiency'' anemia.' "
Diverticulitis,"'Diverticulosis'' is a condition in which the colon contains outpouchings (little sacks). Diverticula are present in a majority of people who reach the age of 50-60 years. The cause of colonic diverticula is not entirely known, but may be contributed by years of high pressure within the colon or a weakness in the wall of the colon. Diverticula are permanent, and no ''diet'' will cause them to disappear. The only way to rid a person of diverticula is to surgically remove the part of the colon that contains the diverticula. A person with ''diverticulosis'' typically has many diverticula scattered throughout the colon, but diverticula are most common in the sigmoid and descending colon.''Most people with diverticulosis have few or no symptoms. Diverticulosis is not a problem unless a diverticulum ruptures and an infection (''abscess'') results, a condition called ''diverticulitis''. ''Diverticulitis'' causes ''abdominal pain'', ''fever'' and tenderness usually in the left lower abdomen. Rarely, bleeding can occur from a diverticulum when a blood vessel inside the diverticulum is weakened by the infection and ruptures.''Bleeding from diverticulosis (diverticular bleeding) without the presence of ''diverticulitis'' is painless. Bleeding from diverticulosis is generally more severe and brisker than bleeding from anal fissures, hemorrhoids, and colon tumors. Diverticular bleeding is the most common cause of moderate to severe rectal bleeding that requires hospitalization and blood transfusions among the elderly population in the Western world.''When bleeding occurs in a diverticulum located in the sigmoid colon, the bleeding tends to be bright red. When bleeding occurs in a diverticulum located in the right or ascending colon, the bleeding may also be bright red if the bleeding is brisk and the transit through the colon is rapid; however, the color is more likely to be dark red, maroon, or, sometimes, even black (melena).''Bleeding from diverticulosis is usually brief (it stops on its own). However, diverticular bleeding tends to recur. For example, a patient may experience several episodes of rectal bleeding from diverticula during the same hospitalization. Even after discharge from the hospital, some patients who do not have the diverticula-containing part of their colon surgically removed will experience another episode of diverticular bleeding within 4-5 years.' "
Meckel's diverticulum,"""A Meckel's diverticulum is an out-pouching (sack) that protrudes from the small intestine near the junction of the small intestine and the colon. It is present from birth and occurs in a small percentage of the population. Some Meckel's diverticula can secrete acid, like the stomach, and the acid can cause ulcerations in the inner lining of the diverticulum or the tissues of the small intestine adjacent to the diverticulum. These ulcers can bleed. Bleeding from a Meckel's diverticulum is the most common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in children and young adults. Bleeding from a Meckel's diverticulum is painless but can be brisk and can cause bright red, dark red, or maroon stools."" "
Angiodysplasias,"""Abnormal collections of enlarged blood vessels frequently occur just under the inner lining of the colon, small intestine or stomach. These abnormal vessels are called angiodysplasias. Angiodysplasias usually can be seen easily during endoscopy as bright red, spider-like lesions just beneath the colon's lining. Although angiodysplasias may occur anywhere in the colon, they are most common in the right or ascending colon. The cause of angiodysplasias is unknown, but they occur with increasing frequency as people grow older. Bleeding from angiodysplasias is painless and can result in bright red, dark red, maroon, or ""'black stools''. Angiodysplasias also can cause occult bleeding and iron deficiency anemia.' "
Colitis and proctitis,"'Colitis means inflammation of the colon. Proctitis means inflammation of the rectum. Several different diseases can cause colitis and proctitis. These include bacterial or viral infection, ''ulcerative colitis'"" or proctitis, Crohn's colitis, ischemic colitis, and ""'radiation'' colitis or proctitis.''Ulcerative colitis'"", ulcerative proctitis, and Crohn's colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon due to overactivity of the body's immune system. These diseases can cause ""'abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', and ''bloody diarrhea'' (''diarrhea'' mixed with blood). Occasionally, moderate or severe rectal bleeding may occur. The bleeding originates from ulcerations in the colon.''Like ulcerative colitis and '""Crohn's colitis""', infections - bacterial and, less commonly, viral -- can inflame the colon, leading to ''abdominal pain'', diarrhea, and even bloody diarrhea. Rarely, infections may cause moderate or severe rectal bleeding. Examples of infections causing rectal bleeding include '' ''Salmonella'', '' ''Shigella'', ''Campylobacter'', '' C. difficile'', '' ''E. Coli'' O157:H7'', and ''cytomegalovirus'' (the last in individuals with ''HIV'' infection).''Ischemic colitis'' is inflammation of the colon that is caused when the supply of blood to the colon is reduced suddenly. This is most often due to a ''blood clot'' that obstructs a small artery supplying blood to a portion of the colon. The sudden reduction in the flow of blood can lead to ulceration of the colon and cause sudden onset of severe lower abdominal, cramping pain followed by rectal bleeding. The most common part of the colon affected by ischemic colitis is the splenic flexure (the part of the colon where the transverse colon joins the left colon). The amount of blood lost during an episode of ischemic colitis usually is small. Rectal bleeding and the abdominal pain of ischemic colitis usually subside on their own after several days. The colonic ulcers usually heal after a few weeks.''Radiation'' treatment for cancers of the abdomen can cause radiation colitis acutely, but permanent changes to the inner lining of the colon and the colonic blood vessels may occur, which can result in bleeding many years after treatment. A common example is radiation proctitis that results from pelvic radiation for the treatment of ''prostate cancer''. Rectal bleeding from radiation proctitis usually is mild, but occasionally can be chronic enough to cause anemia.' "
Polypectomy,"'Colon polyps found during colonoscopy usually are removed, a process called polypectomy. Bleeding can occur at the site of the polypectomy days to weeks after the polyp is removed. Such bleeding is called delayed post-polypectomy bleeding. Smaller polyps (2-3 mm in size) can be removed with biopsy forceps. The amount of blood loss from the use of a forceps usually is minute, and there will be no delayed bleeding. However, larger polyps (larger than 5-10 mm) usually are removed with an electro-surgical snare. These snares are connected to a machine that generates an electrical current. The polyp is looped within a snare, and electrical current is passed through the snare. The electrical current ''cuts'' off the polyp and cauterizes (""heat seals"") the tissue at the base of the polyps. Cauterization prevents bleeding during polypectomy; however, the site of cauterization heals with the formation of an ulcer. Rarely, these ulcers can bleed several days to up to 2-3 weeks after polypectomy. Post-polypectomy bleeding can at times be brisk and severe, and can be bright red, dark red, maroon colored, or black.' "
Rare causes of rectal bleeding,"'Rarely, rapid and severe bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract (for example, ulcers of the stomach or duodenum) can cause bright red rectal bleeding. Other rare causes include leaking of larger amounts of blood into the gastrointestinal tract when a blood vessel ruptures. This may occur when an ulcer of the gastrointestinal tract erodes into a nearby artery or when an arterial graft, for example, an aortic graft used to repair an ''aortic aneurysm'', erodes into the gastrointestinal tract. Even more rare is bleeding from a rectal ulcer, or tumors of the small intestine.' "
What kind of doctor treats rectal bleeding?,"'Rectal bleeding usually is managed by a ''gastroenterologist'', a colon and rectal surgeon, or a proctologist.' "
When should I call a doctor for blood in the stool (rectal bleeding)?,"'Any blood in the stool is not normal and should be reported to a health-care professional. However, there are certain circumstances that might be considered an emergency and medical care should be accessed immediately. These situations include:' Black, tarry stools that may be due to bleeding from the esophagus, stomach or duodenum (upper gastrointestinal [GI] tract). This is especially a potentially serious concern in patients with liver disease and/or portal hypertension who have esophageal varices. This is a potential life-threatening situation. Maroon colored stool may be caused by an upper GI bleed or a bleeding source in the small intestine. Lightheadedness, weakness, fainting (syncope), chest pain or shortness of breath may be symptoms of significant blood loss. Bleeding that is associated with fever and abdominal pain."
How is the cause of blood in the stool (rectal bleeding) diagnosed?,"'An accurate diagnosis of the location and the cause of rectal bleeding is important for proper treatment, and ''prevention'' of further bleeding. Diagnosis relies on the history and physical examination, anoscopy, flexible ''sigmoidoscopy'', colonoscopy, radionuclide scans, angiograms, and blood tests.' "
History and physical examination,"""The age of the patient may offer an important clue to the cause of rectal bleeding. For example, moderate to severe rectal bleeding in teenagers and young adults is more likely to come from a Meckel's diverticulum. Moderate or severe rectal bleeding in older individuals is more likely to be due to diverticulosis or angiodysplasias. Mild rectal bleeding in an adult with prior abdominal radiation treatment may be due to radiation proctitis.""""The presence or absence of other symptoms also may provide important clues. Bleeding from diverticulosis, angiodysplasias, and Meckel's diverticula usually is not associated with abdominal or ""'rectal pain'"". Rectal bleeding from ischemic colitis is often preceded by the sudden onset of lower abdominal, crampy pain. Fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea often occur with colitis due to infection, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's colitis. Mild bleeding accompanied with pain in the anal area during defecation (passing of stool) suggests bleeding from an anal fissure. A recent change in bowel habit such as increasing ""'constipation'' or diarrhea suggests the possibility of ''cancer of the colon''.''Inspection of the anus may disclose bleeding from a ''hemorrhoid'"" or anal fissure. Unfortunately, most hemorrhoids and fissures are not actively bleeding at the time a patient arrives at the doctor's office. Thus, even if a doctor finds a ""'hemorrhoid'' or anal fissure, he/she cannot be certain that they are the cause of the bleeding. Therefore, flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will have to be done to exclude other potentially more serious causes of bleeding.' "
Anoscopy,"'An anoscope is a three-inch long, tapering, metal or clear ''plastic'', hollow tube approximately one inch in diameter at its wider end. The anoscope is lubricated, and the tapered end is inserted into the anus, through the anal canal, and into the rectum. As the anoscope is withdrawn, the area where internal hemorrhoids and anal fissures are found is well seen. Straining by the patient, as if they are having a bowel movement, may make hemorrhoids more prominent.''Whether or not hemorrhoids and anal fissures are found, if there has been rectal bleeding, the colon above the rectum needs to be examined to exclude other important causes of bleeding. Examination above the rectum can be accomplished by either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, procedures that allow the doctor to examine approximately one-third or the entire colon, respectively.' "
Flexible sigmoidoscopy,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy utilizes a flexible sigmoidoscope, a fiberoptic viewing tube with a light at its tip. It is a shorter version of a ''colonoscope'"". It is inserted through the anus and is used by the doctor to examine the rectum, sigmoid colon and part or all of the descending colon. It is useful for detecting diverticula, colon polyps, and cancers located in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy also can be used to diagnose ulcerative colitis, ulcerative proctitis, and sometimes Crohn's colitis and ischemic colitis.""'Despite its value, flexible sigmoidoscopy cannot detect cancers, polyps, or angiodysplasias in the transverse and right colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy also cannot diagnose colitis that is beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscope. Because of these limitations, colonoscopy may be necessary. The advantage of flexible sigmoidoscopy over colonoscopy is that it can be accomplished with no preparation of the colon or after only one or two enemas.' "
Colonoscopy,"'Colonoscopy is a procedure that enables an examiner (usually a gastroenterologist) to evaluate the inside of the entire colon. This is accomplished by inserting a flexible viewing tube (the colonoscope) into the anus and then advancing it slowly under direct vision through the rectum and the entire colon. The colonoscope frequently can reach the part of the small intestine that is adjacent to the right colon.'""Colonoscopy is the most widely used procedure for evaluating rectal bleeding as well as occult bleeding. It can be used to detect polyps, cancers, diverticulosis, ulcerative colitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's colitis, ischemic colitis, and angiodysplasias throughout the entire colon and rectum.""'If there is any possibility that the bleeding is coming from a location above the colon, and esophagogasatroduodenal endoscopic examination (''EGD'') also should be done to identify or exclude an upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding.' "
Video capsule and small intestine endoscopy,"""If neither an upper or lower gastrointestinal source of blood in the stool is found, the small intestine becomes suspect as the source of the bleeding. There are two ways of examining the small intestine. The first is the video capsule, a large pill containing a miniature camera, battery and transmitter that is swallowed and relays photos of the small intestine wirelessly to a recorder carried over the abdomen. The second way to examine the small intestine is with a specialized endoscope similar to the endoscopes used for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy. The advantage of these endoscopes over the video capsule is that bleeding lesions can be biopsied and treated, something that can't be done with the capsule. Unfortunately, small intestinal enteroscopy is time consuming and not generally available. Patients often must be sent to centers where small intestinal enteroscopy is available."" "
Radionuclide scans,"""There are two types of radionuclide scans that are used for determining the site of gastrointestinal bleeding; a Meckel's scan, and a tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan.""'The Meckel\'s scan is a scan for detecting a Meckel\'s diverticulum. A radioactive chemical is injected into the patient\'s vein, and a nuclear camera (like a Geiger counter) is used to scan the patient\'s abdomen. The radioactive chemical will be picked up and concentrated by the acid-secreting tissue in the Meckel\'s diverticulum and will appear as a ""hot"" area in the right lower abdomen on the scan.'""Tagged RBC scans are used to determine the location of the gastrointestinal bleeding. After drawing blood from the bleeding patient, a radioactive chemical is attached to the patient's ""'red blood cells'' and the ""tagged"" red blood cells are injected back into the patient\'s vein. If there is active gastrointestinal bleeding, the radioactive red blood cells leak into the intestine where the bleeding is occurring and will appear as a hot area with a nuclear camera. One drawback of the tagged RBC scan is that bleeding will not show as a hot area if there is no active bleeding at the time of the scan. Thus, it can fail to diagnose the site of bleeding if bleeding is intermittent and the scan is done between bleeding episodes. Another drawback of the scan is that it requires a reasonable amount of bleeding to form a hot area. Thus, it can fail to diagnose the site of the bleeding if bleeding is too slow. The tagged RBC scan is safe, and can be done quickly and without discomfort to the patient.''Unfortunately, the tagged RBC scans are not very accurate in defining the exact location of the bleeding; there is often a poor correlation between where the tagged RBC scan shows the bleeding to be and the actual site of bleeding found at the time of surgery. Therefore, tagged RBC scans cannot be relied upon to help surgeons decide what area of the gastrointestinal tract to remove in the event the bleeding is severe or persistent and requires surgery. However, if the scan shows a hot area, it usually means there is active bleeding, and the patient may be a candidate for a visceral ''angiogram'' to more accurately locate the site of bleeding.' "
Visceral angiogram,"'A visceral angiogram is an X-ray study of the blood vessels of the gastrointestinal tract. The doctor (usually a specially trained radiologist) will insert a thin, long catheter into a blood vessel in the groin and, under X-ray guidance, will advance the tip of the catheter into one of the mesenteric arteries (arteries that supply blood to the gastrointestinal tract). A radio-opaque dye is injected through the catheter and into the mesenteric artery. If there is active bleeding, the dye can be seen leaking into the gastrointestinal tract on the X-ray film. Visceral angiograms are accurate in locating rapid bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not useful if the bleeding is slow or has stopped at the time of the angiogram.''The visceral angiogram is not widely used because of its potential complications such as kidney damage from the dye, ''allergic'' reactions to the dye, and the formation of blood clots in the mesenteric arteries. It is reserved for patients who have severe and continuous bleeding and in whom colonoscopy cannot locate the site of the bleeding.' "
MRI and CT tomographic angiography,"'Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') and ''CT scan'' can both be used in a manner similar to ''X-rays'' in visceral ''angiography'', a diagnostic procedure that has been discussed previously. The use of MRI and CT angiography for diagnosis in gastrointestinal bleeding is a relatively recent development, and their value has not been clearly defined. They could be considered experimental.' "
Nasogastric tube aspiration,"'If there is concern about bleeding coming from the stomach or duodenum, nasogastric tube aspiration can be done. A thin, flexible rubber or plastic tube is passed through the nose and into the stomach. The liquid contents of the stomach then are aspirated and examined for visible blood. (The contents also can be tested for occult blood.) If the bleeding is coming from the stomach, there may be visible blood in the aspirate. There also may be visible blood if the bleeding is coming from the duodenum if some of the blood leaks retrograde back into the stomach. The main difficulty in interpreting results of aspiration is that there may be no blood if the bleeding has stopped even temporarily. Therefore, the absence of blood in the aspirate cannot completely exclude the stomach as the source of the bleeding. Only ''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'' can exclude causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.' "
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy,"'If there is major concern about bleeding coming from the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, an esophagogastricduodenoscopy (EGD) can be done using an endoscope similar to the endoscope used for colonoscopy.' "
Blood tests,"'Blood tests such as a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') and iron levels in the blood play no role in locating the site of gastrointestinal bleeding; however, the CBC and blood iron levels may help to determine whether bleeding is acute or chronic, since an anemia (''low red blood cell count'') associated with iron deficiency suggests chronic bleeding over many weeks or months. Colonic conditions commonly causing iron deficiency anemia include colon polyps, colon cancers, colon angiodysplasias, and chronic colitis.'""When a patient loses a large amount of blood suddenly, as with moderate or severe acute rectal bleeding, the lost blood is replaced by fluid from the body's tissues. This influx of fluid dilutes the blood and leads to anemia (a reduced concentration of red blood cells). It takes time, however, for the tissue fluid to replace the lost blood within the blood vessels. Therefore, soon after a sudden episode of major bleeding, there may be no anemia. It takes many hours and even a day or more for the anemia to develop while tissue fluid slowly dilutes the blood. For this reason, a red blood cell count early after bleeding is not reliable for estimating the severity of the bleeding."" "
What is the treatment for rectal bleeding (blood in the stool)?,"'Treatment and management of rectal bleeding include''Moderate to severe rectal bleeding can cause the loss of enough blood to result in weakness, low blood pressure, ''dizziness'', or fainting, and even shock. Patients with these symptoms usually are hospitalized. They need to be quickly treated with intravenous fluids and/or blood transfusions to replace the blood that has been lost so that diagnostic tests such as colonoscopies and angiograms can be performed safely to determine the cause and location of the bleeding.''Patients with severe iron deficiency anemia may need hospitalization for blood transfusions followed by prolonged treatment with oral ''iron supplements'' (tablets). Patients with iron deficiency anemia as a result of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss should undergo tests (such as colonoscopy) to determine the cause of the chronic blood loss.''Unless anemia is severe, patients with mild rectal bleeding from colon polyps, colon cancers, anal fissures, and hemorrhoids usually do not need hospitalization. Mild anemia can be treated with oral iron ''supplements'' while tests are performed to diagnose the cause of bleeding.''Colonoscopy is the most widely used procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of rectal bleeding. Most colonoscopies are performed after administration of oral laxatives to cleanse the bowel of stool, blood, and blood clots. However, in emergency situations such as when the bleeding is severe and continuous, a doctor may choose to perform an emergency colonoscopy without first cleansing the large bowel. In trained and experienced hands, the risk of either elective (delayed) or urgent colonoscopy is small. (Colon perforation, the most common complication, is rare). The benefits usually far outweigh the potential risks.''Colonoscopy is useful for both diagnosing the cause and determining the location of the bleeding. Locating the site of bleeding is especially important in diverticular bleeding. Even though most diverticular bleeding stops spontaneously without the need for surgery, patients with severe, recurrent, or continuous diverticular bleeding may need surgery to remove the bleeding diverticulum. Since a patient typically has numerous diverticula scattered throughout the colon, colonoscopy may be able to determine which diverticulum is bleeding prior to surgery. Without an accurate knowledge of the location of the bleeding diverticulum, the surgeon may have to perform an extensive ''colon resection'' (which is not as desirable as removing a small section of the colon) in order to make sure that the bleeding diverticulum is removed.''Nevertheless, colonoscopy has limitations. During colonoscopy doctors may not find active bleeding from a specific diverticulum. He/she may only find a colon filled with blood along with scattered diverticula. In such situations, the diagnosis of diverticular bleeding is assumed if no other cause for the bleeding such as colitis or ''colon cancer'' is found. In these situations, there is always some uncertainty about the location of the bleeding. Small, bleeding angiodysplasias also may be difficult to see and may be missed in a colon filled with blood. This is when radionuclide scans and visceral angiograms may be helpful. If the patient starts bleeding again, an urgent, tagged RBC scan followed by a visceral angiogram may demonstrate the location of the bleeding.'""Colonoscopy also cannot positively diagnose bleeding from a Meckel's diverticulum because the colonoscope usually cannot reach the part of the small intestine in which the Meckel's diverticulum is located. But colonoscopy still can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of a bleeding Meckel's diverticulum. Thus, in a young patient with rectal bleeding, a colonoscopy showing a blood filled colon without another source of bleeding, particularly if accompanied by an abnormal Meckel's scan, makes the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum bleeding highly likely. Surgical resection of the Meckel's diverticulum should result in permanent cure with no recurrence of bleeding.""'Colonoscopy is more than just a diagnostic tool; it can also be used to stop bleeding by removing (snaring) bleeding polyps, by cauterizing (sealing with electrical current) bleeding angiodysplasias or postpolypectomy ulcers and, occasionally, by cauterizing actively bleeding blood vessels inside diverticula. Cauterization during colonoscopy is usually accomplished by inserting a long cauterizing probe through the colonoscope. Colonoscopy with cauterization has been used to stop bleeding in many patients with bleeding from diverticula or angiodysplasias, thereby decreasing their need for blood transfusions, shortening their hospital stays, and avoiding surgery.''When colonoscopy cannot identify the site of bleeding or is unable to stop recurrent or continuous bleeding, visceral angiograms may be helpful. When a bleeding site is identified by an angiogram, medications can be infused through the angiographic catheter to constrict the bleeding blood vessel and stop the bleeding, Microscopic coils also can be infused through the catheter to plug (embolize) the bleeding blood vessel, thereby stopping the bleeding.''If colonoscopy and visceral angiogram cannot stop continuous bleeding or prevent rebleeding, then surgery becomes necessary. Ideally, the site of bleeding has been identified by colonoscopy, nuclear scans, or visceral angiogram, so that the surgeon can target the site of bleeding for exploration and excision. For example, a surgeon can usually resect a colon ''cancer'"", a bleeding polyp, or a Meckel's diverticulum with precision. Sometimes, the exact site of bleeding cannot be established, and the surgeon will have to perform an extensive colon resection under the presumption that a diverticulum or angiodysplasia is the cause of the bleeding.""'Mild rectal bleeding from anal fissures and hemorrhoids usually can be treated with local measures such as sitz baths, hemorrhoidal creams, and stool softeners. If these measures fail, several nonsurgical and surgical treatments are available.'   correcting the low blood volume and anemia; diagnosing the cause and the location of the bleeding; stopping active bleeding and preventing rebleeding; and Looking for other nonbleeding lesions that may bleed in the future."
Can rectal bleeding (blood in the stool) be prevented?,"'Most diseases that cause rectal bleeding are likely preventable, but it often is not possible.' Hemorrhoids can be avoided with proper diet and by prevention of constipation and straining to pass stool, but normal pregnancy increases the risk of hemorrhoid formation as does the acute diarrheal illness. Avoiding constipation is believed to decrease the risk of diverticulosis, outpouchings in the lining of the colon, and the risk of a diverticular bleed. Alcohol abuse increases the risk of rectal bleeding in a variety of ways, from directly irritating the lining of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, to decreasing clotting capabilities of blood."
What is the prognosis of  rectal bleeding (blood in the stool)?,"'The prognosis depends upon the underlying cause of the bleeding. Fortunately, the cause of rectal bleeding often is benign, and due to hemorrhoids or an anal fissure.''It is important to never ignore blood in the stool or rectal bleeding. It may be a clue to a serious illness and the earlier a diagnosis can be made, the better the chance for a cure.' "
What is rectal bleeding?,"'Any type of blood that is passed out from the anus or rectum during the passing of stools or fecal matter is called ''rectal bleeding''. The blood may be coming from the rectum or may also be coming from other parts of the gut or inside of the stomach. The color of blood may vary depending on the site of bleeding. It is usually bright or dark red (maroon-colored) in color. In most cases, bright red blood indicates bleeding in the lower intestine or rectum, whereas darker blood is a sign of bleeding in the small bowel or upper area of the gut. Very dark or black-red blood is often associated with bleeding in the stomach or other parts in the ''digestive system''.' "
What are the common causes of rectal bleeding?,"'Most common causes of ''rectal bleeding'' include:' Piles or hemorrhoids: Small hemorrhoids are usually painless. The most common symptom is bleeding after going to the toilet. Larger hemorrhoids may cause mucous discharge, pain, irritation, and itch. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the lower rectum.  Anal fissure: It is a small tear of the skin of the anus that may be less than a centimeter. It may be a very painful condition. Often, an anal fissure will bleed a little. The blood is usually bright red and stains the toilet tissue but soon stops.  Diverticula: A diverticulum is a small pouch in the wall of the gut (intestines) (more than one diverticulum is called diverticula). They can develop on any part of the gut. A diverticulum may occasionally bleed, and the patient may pass some blood through the anus. Bleeding is usually abrupt and painless. Bleeding is due to a burst blood vessel that can occur in the wall of a diverticulum, and the amount of blood loss may be heavy.  Crohn's disease: It is a condition that causes the gut to become inflamed. The disease flares up from time to time. Common symptoms include bloody diarrhea and stomach pain. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and other forms of colitis: UC is a disease where inflammation develops in the colon/intestine and rectum. A common symptom includes diarrhea mixed with blood.  Polyps: A polyp is a small growth that sometimes forms on the inside lining of the intestine or rectum. Polyps are usually benign (non-cancerous) and usually cause no problems. However, sometimes a polyp bleeds and sometimes a polyp can turn cancerous. Cancer: Cancer of the intestine and rectum are common cancers in older people. Rectal bleeding is one symptom that may occur. Cancers of other parts of the gut higher up from the colon sometimes may cause rectal bleeding, but these are uncommon.  Abnormalities of the gut: Various abnormalities of the gut or gut wall may cause rectal bleeding (for example, twisting of the gut). Ulcers: An ulcer in the stomach or duodenum may bleed. This can cause rectal bleeding. Stools may turn black- or plum-colored (melaena). Infections: Infections of the stomach and intestine are one of the causes that may cause rectal bleeding. Symptoms may include watery stools, pain in the abdomen, and fever."
What should a patient be educated regarding rectal bleeding?,"'Spotting'' blood during or after passing stools is common. Most of the causes of such rectal bleeding are not life-threatening. However, the only way to be certain of the cause is to be evaluated by a doctor. Usually, people with minor rectal bleeding may not have ''cancer'' or another serious condition. However, it is not possible to know the cause of rectal bleeding without an examination. ''Precancerous'' polyps near the end of the colon can mimic bleeding from hemorrhoids. These are generally present in the colon for years before they become cancerous, and they can be removed very safely from the colon, preventing progression to cancer. Polyps and ''colon cancer'' become more common with ''aging'', and thus, investigation of bleeding is most important in patients aged above 40-50 years.' "
What are the common screening tests to diagnose rectal bleeding?,"'Common screening tests include:' Rectal examination: A doctor may detect the cause of rectal bleeding with a rectal examination. Colonoscopy: It is a procedure in which a doctor examines the entire colon using a flexible camera attached to a tube, usually while the patient is sedated. Anoscopy: It allows the doctor to inspect the anus and lower rectum.  Sigmoidoscopy: During a sigmoidoscopy, the doctor may examine the rectum and most of the lower large intestine. It also can be done without sedation."
What is blood in the urine (hematuria)?,"'Hematuria, or blood in the urine, can be either gross (visible) or microscopic (blood cells only visible through a microscope). Gross hematuria can vary widely in appearance, from light pink to deep red with clots. Although the amount of blood in the urine may be different, the types of conditions that can cause the problem are the same, and require the same kind of workup or evaluation.''People with gross hematuria will visit their doctor with this as a primary complaint. People who have microscopic hematuria, on the other hand, will be unaware of a problem and their condition will most commonly be detected as part of a periodic checkup by a primary-care physician.'  "
What are the causes of blood in the urine?,"'The causes of gross and microscopic hematuria are similar and may result from bleeding anywhere along the urinary tract. One cannot readily distinguish between blood originating in the kidneys, ureters (the tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder), bladder, or urethra. Any degree of blood in the urine should be fully evaluated by a physician, even if it resolves spontaneously.''Infection of the urine, (often called a ''urinary tract infection'' or ''UTI'') stemming either from the kidneys or bladder, is a common cause of microscopic hematuria. Urine is naturally sterile and should not contain bacteria. Kidney and bladder stones can cause irritation and ''abrasion'' of the urinary tract, leading to microscopic or gross hematuria. ''Trauma'' affecting any of the components of the urinary tract or the prostate can lead to ''bloody urine'"". Hematuria can also be associated with renal (kidney) disease, as well as hematologic disorders involving the body's clotting system. Medications that increase the risk of bleeding, such as ""'aspirin'', ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), or clopidogrel (''Plavix''), may also lead to bloody urine. Lastly, ''cancer'' anywhere along the urinary tract can present with hematuria.'  "
What tests diagnose the causes of blood in the urine?,"'The evaluation for blood in urine consists of taking a history, performing a physical examination, evaluating the urine with a chemical test strip and under a microscope, and obtaining a culture of the urine to identify any bacteria present. Lower urinary tract symptoms, such as urgency (feeling a strong need to urinate) and frequency (needing to urinate frequently), as well as burning or ''pain'' when urinating, the presence of ''fever'' or ''chills'', are suggestive of infection. Recent trauma, even if believed by the patient to have been inconsequential, should be considered as a potential cause. Abdominal or flank ''pain'', especially if radiating to the inguinal or the genital area, may suggest ureteral or\xa0''kidney stones''. All recent medications, including ''vitamins'' or herbal ''supplements'', should be reviewed with the health-care professional. However, it is important to note that even if the patient has been taking a medication that is associated with bleeding, a full workup (as listed below) should still be undertaken.''The physical exam will focus on possible sources of hematuria. ''Bruising'' over the back or abdomen may indicate trauma. A digital rectal exam should be performed, especially in males, as findings consistent with ''prostatitis'' (for example, tenderness on palpation of the prostate) or an ''enlarged prostate'' suggestive of ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''), may be useful in making a diagnosis. The finding of a nodule or an area of induration (hardening) of the prostate may be indicative of ''cancer''. A repeat ''urinalysis'', as well as a urine culture, should be obtained. The presence of white blood cells on urinalysis is more consistent with a ''urinary tract infection''. Protein, glucose, or sediment in the urine may indicate the presence of a disease of the kidneys. Blood tests are also important, as they will aid in assessing renal function and identifying any clotting abnormalities.''In addition to the basic history and physical exam, there are three additional components for any workup of hematuria: imaging, urine cytology, and cystoscopy.''The CT scan is an imaging evaluation of the urinary tract. Prior to the procedure, the patient ''drinks'' an oral contrast agent and a dye is injected intravenously. The patient then goes through the CT scan machine and images are taken of the abdomen and pelvis. Another test that can be performed, the intravenous pyelogram (IVP), is also a type of X-ray evaluation of the urinary tract. In this procedure, a dye is injected into the veins, and this is filtered by the urinary tract. A series of ''X-rays'' are then taken over a 30-minute period to look for abnormalities. The CT scan is more commonly performed than the IVP to evaluate the urinary tract and should be considered the test of choice. Both of these studies are especially useful for evaluating the kidneys and ureters, but not the bladder, prostate, or urethra. Therefore, a second examination called a cystoscopy is necessary. This is a simple 10-minute procedure using a thin, flexible cystoscope (or fiberoptic camera), which is inserted via the urethra into the bladder to directly visualize any lesions or sources of bleeding. This is usually done with local anesthetic jelly injected into the urethra. Finally, urine cytology involves giving a urine sample to be analyzed by a pathologist for the presence of cancerous or abnormal-appearing cells.' "
What are the treatments for blood in the urine treated?,"'Treatments for hematuria vary widely and depend on the reason for the bleeding. It is important to note that quite often no cause is found for the hematuria. This should not be a source of major concern, however, since an appropriate workup effectively rules out the most serious causes of hematuria (for example, ''cancer''). In cases where a workup is negative and the cause of the hematuria remains unknown, observation with repeat urinalyses is a reasonable option. A blood test to check kidney function and a blood-pressure check should be done as well. Caucasian men over 50 should discuss with their doctor an annual prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test which is used to screen for ''prostate cancer''. Prostate screening in African Americans traditionally begins at age 45 and in all races, a history of ''prostate cancer'' in close family members may indicate an earlier start of screening.''Further discussion of the treatment for hematuria would depend upon the results of the workup and the exact cause for the hematuria. The ''urologist'' who performs this examination is responsible for recommending any further treatment or workup that would be necessary.''Previous contributing author: Mark H. Katz, MD'  "
What are the basic functions of the liver?,"'The ''liver'' is located in the right upper portion of the abdominal ''cavity'' just beneath the rib cage. The liver has many functions that are vital to life. Briefly, some of the important functions of the human liver are:' Detoxification of blood Production of important clotting factors, albumin, and many other important proteins Metabolizing (processing) medications and nutrients Processing of waste products of hemoglobin and other cells Storing of vitamins, fat, cholesterol, and bile Production of glucose (gluconeogenesis or glucose synthesis/release during starvation)"
What are common liver blood function tests?,"'Liver blood tests are some of the most commonly performed blood tests. These tests can be used to assess liver functions or liver injury. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the level of certain liver enzymes (proteins) in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes mostly reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured for any reason, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream. Enzymes are proteins that are present throughout the body, each with a unique function. Enzymes help to speed up (catalyze) routine and vital chemical reactions in the body.''Among the most sensitive and widely used liver enzymes are the aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes are normally predominantly contained within liver cells and to a lesser degree in the muscle cells. If the liver is injured or damaged, the liver cells spill these enzymes into the blood, raising the AST and ALT enzyme blood levels and signaling ''liver disease''.''Other blood tests pertaining to the liver are measurements of some of the other enzymes found the liver. In addition to AST and ALT, ''alkaline phosphatase'"", 5' nucleotidase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are a few of the other enzymes located in the liver. The focus of this article is mainly on the most common liver enzymes, AST and ALT.""  "
"What are the aminotransferases enzymes (ALT, AST)?","'The aminotransferases enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in which an amino group from one amino acid (amino acids are building blocks of proteins) is transferred from a donor molecule to a recipient molecule, hence, the names ""aminotransferases.""''Medical terms can sometimes be confusing, as is the case with these enzymes because they have interchangeable names that commonly appear in both medical and non-medical articles. For example:''To put matters briefly, AST = SGOT and ALT = SGPT; they are enzymes produced by the liver, and other types of cells).' Another name for aminotransferase is transaminase. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is also known as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
"Normally, where are AST and ALT (aminotransferase enzymes)?","'AST (SGOT) is normally found in a variety of tissues including liver, ''heart'', muscle, kidney, and the brain. It is released into the serum when any one of these tissues is damaged. For example, AST level in serum is elevated in ''heart attacks'' or with muscle injury. It is therefore, not a highly specific indicator of liver injury as its elevation can occur as a result of other injured tissues.''ALT (SGPT) is, by contrast, normally found largely in the liver. This is not to say that it is exclusively located in the liver, but that is where it is most concentrated. It is released into the bloodstream as the result of liver injury. Thus, it serves as a fairly specific indicator of liver status.' "
What are normal levels of AST and ALT?,"""However, the ranges of AST and ALT numbers may differ slightly depending on the technique and protocols used by different laboratories worldwide. However, normal reference ranges are routinely provided by each laboratory and printed with each patient's individual report.""   The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is about 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is about 7 to 56 units per liter of serum."
What do high (elevated) liver tests (AST and ALT) mean?,"'AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. However, it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with ''liver disease''. They may mean liver problems or they may not. For example, elevations of these enzymes can occur with muscle damage. The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT results depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual, and so it is best done by physicians experienced in evaluating liver disease and muscle disease.''Moreover, the precise levels of these liver enzyme tests do not correlate well with the extent of liver problems or the prognosis (outlook). Thus, the exact levels of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future prognosis for ''liver function''. For example, individuals with acute ''viral hepatitis'' A may develop very high AST and ALT levels (sometimes in the thousands of units/liter range), but most people with acute viral ''hepatitis A'' recover fully without residual liver disease. Conversely, people with chronic ''hepatitis C'' infection typically have only a little elevation in their AST and ALT levels while having substantial liver injury and even advanced scarring of the liver (''cirrhosis'') from ongoing minor inflammation of the liver.' "
Do AST and ALT test results indicate liver function?,"'It is important to clarify that ALT and AST levels do not reflect the function of the liver, even though in the medical community and in medical publications they commonly, and incorrectly, are referred to as liver function tests. Even in conditions when AST and ALT are very elevated, the liver still may function properly. Consequently, if you have ""elevated liver enzymes"" or a high or abnormal liver test, you need to ask your physician exactly what all of the tests indicate.' "
What blood tests are done to detect liver function?,"'The blood tests that truly reflect liver function are the following; normal values (ranges) listed are for adult men - women and children have similar but slightly different ranges of normal test values'   Coagulation panel (prothrombin time or PT, and international normalized ratio or INR): These tests measure blood's ability for normal clotting and prevention of bleeding and bruising. This is the function of certain proteins called clotting factors that normally are produced in the liver. Normal values are about 9.5 to 13.8 seconds. Albumin level (hypoalbuminemia): Albumin is a very common protein found in the blood with a variety of functions. It also is produced only in the liver, and if its levels are lower than normal it can be suggestive of chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. Of note, many conditions other than liver disease also may cause low albumin levels. Normal values are about 3.5 to 5 g/dL. Bilirubin: This molecule is a byproduct of the routine destruction of red blood cells occurring in the liver. It is normally released as bile in the feces. Elevation of the bilirubin can suggest liver dysfunction. However, other conditions with increased destruction of red blood cells also can cause elevated bilirubin levels despite normal liver function. Normal values are about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL."
What blood tests are done to detect liver function? (Continued),"'Note that many hospitals and doctor\'s offices list a liver function panel as part of a lab workup. These panels vary and may consist of AST, ALT and some or all of the tests listed above. In addition, the normal panel values may vary somewhat, especially between adult men, women and children so viewing the ""normal"" ranges of test values is always recommended, and a thorough discussion with the physician is necessary. In addition, some clinicians recommend other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. ''There are other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. There are home liver tests for blood enzyme levels and liver function however, individuals who use these tests should first discuss their use and results with their health care professional.' Platelet count: Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) has many causes, one of which can be advanced liver disease. Normal platelet counts are about 150,000 to 400,000 per (µL). Glucose: Glucose level is maintained in the body by a variety of mechanisms. The liver can release glucose in the blood for nourishment of other cells in case of starvation with insufficient oral intake of glucose. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is another major function of the liver. In advanced liver disease, this function of the liver can be compromised leading to unusually low glucose levels in the absence of adequate oral intake. Conversely, a large number of people with liver cirrhosis become glucose intolerant and develop diabetes. GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase): This enzyme is thought to indicate possible liver damage; the higher the abnormal level, the more likely there is liver damage. Normal levels of GGT are about 9 to 48 U/L. ALP (alkaline phosphatase): The liver synthesizes the highest amounts of this enzyme so high levels in the blood may suggest liver injury among other causes. Normal levels of ALP are about 45 to 115 U/L. LD or LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase): This enzyme may be elevated in many types of diseases, including liver disease. Normal levels are about 122 to 222U/L."
What are some common reasons for abnormal liver tests?,"'Abnormal liver tests may be detected in the blood in a variety of liver conditions.' Mild to moderate elevations of the liver enzymes are common. They are often unexpectedly encountered on routine blood screening tests in otherwise healthy individuals. The AST and ALT readings in such cases are usually between twice the upper limits of normal and several hundred units/liter. One of the most common causes of mild to moderate elevations of these liver tests is a condition referred to as fatty liver (steatohepatitis or hepatic steatosis). In the United States, the most frequent cause of fatty liver is alcohol abuse. Other causes of fatty liver include diabetes mellitus and obesity. Fatty liver tests are composed of several tests including blood tests, CT and/or MRI tests and in some individuals, a liver biopsy. Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are other causes of chronic mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation. In these conditions, ALT and AST may be only slightly high and the degree of abnormality in liver function tests can indicate the degree if injury. Chronic and acute alcohol use also can commonly cause abnormal liver blood tests. In alcoholic hepatitis, the range of liver tests can vary greatly. In chronic alcohol liver disease or alcoholic cirrhosis, slight elevation of ALT and AST may be observed, whereas in acute alcoholic hepatitis, high liver enzyme numbers are often seen. Many medications can be responsible for mild to moderate increase in the liver enzyme tests (see below)."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT) levels?,"'A variety of medications can cause abnormal liver enzymes levels in some individuals.''Examples of some of the common medications with potential liver toxicity include:''Pain'' relief medications ''such as:''Anti-''seizure'' medications'' such as:''Antibiotics ''such as:' aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Naprelan, Anaprox, Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR), and phenylbutazone (Butazolidine) phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equertro), and phenobarbital tetracyclines, (for example, tetracycline [Achromycin]) sulfonamides, isoniazid (INH) (Nydrazid, Laniazid) sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), trimethoprim (Trimpex; Proloprim, Primsol) nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin; Furadantin; Macrobid), fluconazole (Diflucan ) and some other anti-fungals, etc."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT)? (continued),"'Cholesterol lowering ''drugs'' ''such as ''statins'':''Cardiovascular drugs ''such as:''Other drugs'""With drug-induced liver enzyme abnormalities, the enzymes usually normalize weeks to months after stopping the medications. Typically, the physician will want to monitor the patient's liver enzymes over time to confirm that the values are normalizing."" lovastatin (Mevacor, Altocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and niacin amiodarone (Cordarone), hydralazine (Apresoline) quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), etc. Antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic type"
What conditions can cause very high AST or ALT levels?,"'AST and ALT serum levels in some liver conditions can range anywhere from ten times the upper limits of normal to thousands of units/liter. The highest levels of AST and ALT are found with disorders that cause rapid death of numerous liver cells (extensive hepatic necrosis). Although this degree of liver enzymes elevation is not common, it can occur in such conditions as:''Also, very high AST and ALT levels can be a result of severe muscle diseases.' Acute viral hepatitis A or B Profound liver damage inflicted by toxins as from an overdose of acetaminophen (brand-name Tylenol) or mushroom poisoning Prolonged collapse of the circulatory system (shock) when the liver is deprived of fresh blood providing oxygen and nutrients"
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood and function tests?,"'Less common causes of abnormal liver enzymes in the United States include ''hemochromatosis'' (''iron overload'""), Wilson's disease, alpha-1-""'antitrypsin'' deficiency, ''celiac disease'"", Crohn's disease, ""'ulcerative colitis'', and autoimmune hepatitis. Though not as common as ''hepatitis C'', ''hepatitis B'' can cause chronic liver disease with persistently abnormal liver enzymes.' Hemochromatosis is a genetic (inherited) disorder in which there is excessive absorption of dietary iron leading to accumulation of iron in the liver with resultant inflammation and scarring of the liver. If undiagnosed or untreated, hemochromatosis can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder with excessive accumulation of copper in diverse tissues including the liver and the brain. Excess copper in the liver can lead to chronic liver inflammation, while copper in the brain can cause psychiatric and motor disturbances. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the lack of a glycoprotein (carbohydrate-protein complex) called alpha-1-antitrypsin lead to chronic lung disease (emphysema) and chronic liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis results from liver injury brought about by the body's own antibodies and defense systems attacking the liver."
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood tests? (continued)," Celiac disease (celiac sprue) is a disease of the small intestine where a person has an allergy to gluten and develops gas, bloating, diarrhea, and in advanced cases malnutrition. Patients' with celiac disease can also develop mildly abnormal ALT and AST levels. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases with chronic inflammation of the intestines (collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases). In these individuals inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) also can occur, causing abnormal liver tests. Viral infections other than common hepatitis viruses (A, B, C) can sometimes cause elevation of liver enzymes as they can result in generalized body infection and liver inflammation. Non-viral infections of the liver are rare, but they can cause liver damage. Bacterial and amebic (parasitic) hepatic (liver) abscesses typically present as focal infection and inflammation of the liver as opposed to viral hepatitis where generalized liver inflammation occurs. Liver enzyme elevation is usually seen in the setting of these infections. Rarely, abnormal liver enzymes can be a sign of liver cancer. Cancer arising from liver cells is called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma. Cancers spreading to the liver from other organs (such as colon, pancreas, stomach, and others) are called metastatic malignancies (to the liver). Liver hemangiomas (masses of abnormal and atypical blood vessels within the liver) are the most common tumors in the liver. However, hepatic hemangiomas are benign and in general do not cause elevation of liver tests. Another rare condition that causes elevation of liver tests is called the Budd-Chiari Syndrome. In this condition, obstruction of blood flow in the liver by a blood clot can damage the liver by limiting blood flow leading to injury of liver cells. As a result of this insult, liver enzymes may rise indicating hepatic inflammation. Glycogen storage disorders are genetic conditions seen in pediatric population (detected at birth in severe types or later in childhood in less severe types). They impair the ability of the liver to store and metabolize glycogen, a complex sugar necessary for production of nutrients and energy in the body. Glycogen storage disorders cause varying degrees of liver enzyme abnormalities."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels?,"""Evaluation of healthy individuals with abnormal liver enzymes needs to be individualized. A doctor may ask for the patient's blood test data from old records for comparison. If no old records are available, the doctor may repeat blood tests in weeks to months to see whether these abnormalities persist.""'In the meantime, along with a physical examination, by performing thorough medical history the doctor will search for potential infectious and non-infectious causes and risk factors for liver disease such as:''A complete list of routine medications including ''over-the-counter'' medications will be reviewed.''Signs and symptoms of liver disease may or may not be present in individuals with mild increase in liver enzymes. Signs of liver damage can include ''jaundice'', ''easy bruising'', ''ascites'' (distention of abdomen as result of retained fluid), ''enlarged spleen'' (''splenomegaly''), and ''confusion''. Symptoms of liver disease are non-specific and numerous. Some of the more common liver disease symptoms may include ''fatigue'', ''itching'', yellow skin, poor appetite, and abdominal discomfort.''The pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities can sometimes provide useful clues as to the cause of the liver condition. For example, in a majority of people with alcoholic liver disease, liver enzyme levels are not as high as the levels reached in acute viral hepatitis. In alcoholic liver disease, frequently AST tends to be higher (usually under 300 units/liter) than ALT (usually under 100 units/ liter).' Medications Alcohol use Sexual exposures History of blood transfusions History of injectable drug use Occupational exposure to blood products Family history of liver disease (for the possibility of inherited diseases such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency)."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels? (continued),"""If alcohol or medication is responsible for the abnormal liver enzyme tests, stopping alcohol or the culprit medication (under a health care professional's supervision only) should bring the enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels in weeks to months. If obesity is suspected as the cause of ""'fatty liver disease'', weight reduction of about 5% to 10% should also bring the AST and ALT liver blood tests to normal or near normal levels in some individuals.''If abnormal liver enzymes persist despite abstinence from alcohol, weight reduction, and stopping certain suspected drugs, other tests can be performed to help diagnose other possible treatable liver diseases. The blood can be tested for the presence of ''hepatitis B'"" and C viruses and their related antibodies. Blood levels of iron, iron saturation, and ferritin (another measurement of the amount of iron stored in the body) are usually elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis. Blood levels of a substance called ceruloplasmin are usually decreased in people with Wilson's disease. Blood levels of certain antibodies (anti-nuclear antibody or ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-liver and kidney microsomal antibody) are elevated in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis.""'Liver ''ultrasound'' and ''CT scan'' of the abdomen are sometimes used to exclude tumors in the liver or other conditions such as ''gallstones'' or tumors obstructing the ducts that drain the liver. These tests also can provide important visual information about the liver such as size, contour, scarring, and anatomically important data. A CT liver scan is very useful to detect traumatic injuries to the liver.''Liver biopsy can occasionally assist in determining the cause of liver disease. In this procedure a needle is inserted through the skin over the right upper abdomen to obtain a thin strand of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. Liver biopsy is oftentimes performed after ultrasound study has located the liver. Not everybody with abnormal liver enzymes needs a liver biopsy. The doctor will usually recommend this procedure if:'""Liver biopsy is most useful in confirming a diagnosis of a potentially treatable condition including chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency."" The information obtained from the liver biopsy will likely be helpful in planning treatment The doctor needs to know the extent and severity of liver inflammation/damage Effectiveness of a certain treatment requires close monitoring at the tissue level No obvious cause of elevated liver tests has been found despite thorough investigation"
How do health care professionals monitor a person's liver blood values?,"'What is usually most helpful is serial testing of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) over time to determine whether the levels are increasing, remaining stable, or decreasing. For example, individuals undergoing treatment for chronic hepatitis C should be monitored with serial liver enzyme tests. Those responding to treatment will experience lowering of liver enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels. Those who develop relapse of hepatitis C after completion of treatment will usually develop abnormal liver enzyme levels again.' "
What other liver enzymes cause medical problems?,"'Aside from AST and ALT, there are other enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, 5\'-nucleotidase (""5 prime"" nucleotidase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that are often used to detect for liver disease.''LDH is not specific to the liver and can be elevated in many diseases with inflammation in other tissues.''Alkaline phosphatase is another liver enzyme that is frequently measured. This enzyme is usually found in the walls of the bile ducts (tube-like structures within the liver that connect liver cells together). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase may indicate an injury to the biliary cells. Common causes of biliary injury or biliary obstruction (''cholestasis'') are ''gallstones'"" and certain medications, although, some of the conditions listed previously can also raise the levels of this enzyme. Alkaline phosphate is also found in the bone and can be elevated in bone diseases. GGT and 5' nucleotidase levels can be elevated in biliary conditions (disease of the gallbladder and bile ducts) along with alkaline phosphatase."" "
What is anemia?,"'Anemia is a medical condition in which the red blood cell count or the hemoglobin is less than normal. The normal level of hemoglobin is generally different in males and females. For men, a normal hemoglobin level is typically defined as a level of more than 13.5 gram/100 ml, and in women as hemoglobin of more than 12.0 gram/100 ml. These definitions may vary slightly depending on the source and the laboratory reference used.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of anemia?,"'Some individuals with anemia have no symptoms. Others with anemia may:''Additional anemia symptoms may include:''If anemia is longstanding (chronic anemia), the body may adjust to low oxygen levels and the individual may not feel different unless the anemia becomes severe. On the other hand, if the anemia occurs rapidly (acute anemia), the patient may experience significant symptoms relatively quickly and with relatively mild fluctuations of hemoglobin levels.'   Feel tired Weakness Fatigue easily Appear pale Develop palpitations (feeling of heart racing) Notice shortness of breath Hair loss Malaise (general sense of feeling unwell) Worsening of heart problems"
What causes anemia?,"'Any process that can disrupt the normal life span of a red blood cell may cause anemia. Normal life span of a red blood cell is typically around 120 days. Red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.''Anemia is caused essentially through two basic pathways. Anemia is caused by either:''A more common classification of anemia (low hemoglobin) is based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) which signifies the average volume of individual red blood cells.''Looking at each of the components of a ''complete blood count'' (CBC), especially the MCV, a physician can gather clues as to what could be the most common reason for anemia in each patient.' a decrease in production of red blood cells or hemoglobin, or an increase in loss or destruction of red blood cells. If the MCV is low (less than 80), the anemia is categorized as microcytic anemia (low red blood cell volume). If the MCV is in the normal range (80-100), it is called a normocytic anemia (normal red blood cell volume). If the MCV is high, then it is called a macrocytic anemia (large red blood cell volume)."
What is iron deficiency anemia?,"'Iron deficiency'"" is a very common cause of anemia. This is because iron is a major component of hemoglobin and essential for its proper function. Chronic blood loss due to any reason is the main cause of low iron level in the body as it depletes the body's iron stores to compensate for the ongoing loss of iron. Anemia that is due to low iron levels is called ""'iron deficiency anemia''.''Young women are likely to have low-grade ''iron deficiency'' anemia because of the loss of blood each month through normal ''menstruation''. This is generally without any major symptoms as the blood loss is relatively small and temporary.''Another common reason for iron deficiency anemia can be recurring or small ongoing bleeding, for instance from ''colon cancer'' or from stomach ulcers. ''Stomach ulcer'' bleeding may be induced by medications, even very common ''over-the-counter'' ''drugs'' such as ''aspirin'' and ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''). Slow and chronic oozing from these ulcers can lead to loss of iron. Crohn’s disease can lead to iron deficiency anemia. In infants and young children, iron deficiency anemia is most often due to a ''diet'' lacking iron.''Interpretation of a complete blood count test (CBC) may lead to clues to suggest this type of anemia. For instance, iron deficiency anemia usually presents with low mean corpuscular volume (microcytic anemia) in addition to low hemoglobin.'  "
What is aplastic anemia?,"'Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening form of complete bone marrow failure. As a result, the blood contains inadequate numbers of red blood cells (anemia) as well as insufficient white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets (''thrombocytopenia''). Complete bone marrow failure causes all three cell lines produced in the bone marrow to be inadequate, a condition referred to as pancytopenia. Aplastic anemia can occur at nearly any age. Its onset can be sudden or gradual.''The symptoms of this anemia are similar to the symptoms of all anemias ( see above ) as well as recurrent infections and abnormal bleeding.''Causes of aplastic anemia include:' Chronic exposure to toxic chemicals Cancer treatments (radiation therapy; chemotherapy) Infections (certain viral infections) Medications (for examples, chloramhenicol, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) Myelodysplastic syndromes Genetic abnormalities"
What are other types and causes of anemia?,"'Some of the most common anemia causes include:' Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause pernicious anemia. This type of anemia could happen in people who are unable to absorb vitamin B12 from their intestines due to a number of reasons.Strict vegetarians are at risk if they do not balance their diets or take vitamin supplements.Long-term alcoholics.People who have abnormal structure or function of the stomach or intestines leading to impaired B12 absorption despite adequate intake.This typically causes macrocytic anemia (large red blood cell volume). Vitamin B12, along with folate, is involved in making the heme molecule that is an integral part of hemoglobin. Folate deficiency can be the culprit of anemia as well. This may also be caused by inadequate absorption, under-consumption of green, leafy vegetables, and long-term heavy alcohol use. Strict vegetarians are at risk if they do not balance their diets or take vitamin supplements. Long-term alcoholics.

This typically causes macrocytic anemia (large red blood cell volume). Vitamin B12, along with folate, is involved in making the heme molecule that is an integral part of hemoglobin. Folate deficiency can be the culprit of anemia as well. This may also be caused by inadequate absorption, under-consumption of green, leafy vegetables, and long-term heavy alcohol use. There can be rupture or destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia) due to antibodies clinging to the surface of the red blood cells. Examples of hemolytic anemia include hemolytic disease of the newborn, medication-induced hemolytic anemia, transfusion-related hemolysis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. A wide assortment of bone marrow diseases can cause anemia.For example, cancers that spread (metastasize) to the bone marrow, or cancers of the bone marrow (such as leukemia or multiple myeloma) can cause the bone marrow to produce red blood cells inadequately, resulting in anemia.Certain chemotherapy for cancers can also cause damage to the bone marrow and decrease red blood cell production, resulting in anemia.Certain infections may involve the bone marrow and result in bone marrow impairment and anemia.Finally, patients with kidney disease may lack a hormone necessary to stimulate normal red blood cell production by the bone marrow.Chronic alcohol consumption may lead to anemia via different pathways and thus, anemia is commonly seen in alcoholics. For example, cancers that spread (metastasize) to the bone marrow, or cancers of the bone marrow (such as leukemia or multiple myeloma) can cause the bone marrow to produce red blood cells inadequately, resulting in anemia. Certain chemotherapy for cancers can also cause damage to the bone marrow and decrease red blood cell production, resulting in anemia.

This could typically occur in individuals with longstanding chronic diseases. Some medications can cause anemia in a variety of ways. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) can cause anemia."
Can anemia be hereditary?,"'Yes, anemia may be genetic. Hereditary disorders create abnormal hemoglobin and can shorten the life span of the red blood cell and lead to anemia (for example, ''sickle cell disease''). Hereditary disorders can also cause anemia by impairing the production of normal hemoglobin (for example, ''alpha thalassemia'' and ''beta thalassemia'').''Depending on the degree of the genetic abnormality, hereditary anemias may cause mild, moderate, or severe anemia. In fact, some may be too severe to be compatible with life and may result in death of the fetus (unborn infant). On the other hand, some of these anemias are so mild that they are not noticeable and are incidentally revealed during routine blood work.' "
How does blood loss cause anemia?,'Acute blood loss from ''internal bleeding'' (as from a bleeding ulcer) or external bleeding (as from ''trauma'') can produce anemia in an amazingly short span of time. ''This type of anemia results in severe symptoms and consequences if not addressed promptly''. Severe sudden blood loss anemia may cause:' Dizziness Lightheadedness Fatigue Confusion Shortness of breath Loss of consciousness
How is anemia diagnosed?,"'Anemia is usually detected, or at least confirmed, by a complete blood cell (CBC) count. A CBC test may be ordered by a physician as a part of routine general checkup and screening or based on clinical signs and symptoms that may suggest anemia or other blood abnormalities.' "
What is a complete blood cell (CBC) count?,"'Traditionally, a doctor or a laboratory technician performed a CBC analysis by viewing a glass slide prepared from a blood sample under a microscope. Today, this work is automated. Six component measurements make up a CBC test:''Only the first three of these anemia tests -- the red blood cell (RBC) count, the hematocrit, and the hemoglobin -- are relevant to an anemia diagnosis.''Additionally, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is also often reported in a CBC, which basically measures the average volume of red blood cells in a blood sample. This is important in distinguishing the causes of anemia. Units of MCV are reported in femtoliters, a fraction of one millionth of a liter.''Other useful clues to causes of anemia that are reported in a CBC are the size, shape, and color of red blood cells.'

How is blood collected for a CBC?,"""Blood is collected by venipuncture (using a needle to draw blood from a vein) in a lab, hospital, or doctor's office. Typically, blood is collected in a special sterile tube from an arm vein. The tube has some preservatives to prevent clotting of the blood. Results may be available in an hour or longer depending on the setting.""'In some instances, a quick in-office test called hemoglobin rapid test may be performed using a few drops of blood from a finger prick. The advantage of this quick test is that results may be obtained in a few minutes and only a few drops of blood may be required.' "
What is the red blood cell (RBC) count?,"'The red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) are the most common type of cells in the blood. We each have millions and millions of these little disc-shaped cells. The RBC count is done to determine if the number of red blood cells is low (anemia) or high (''polycythemia'').''In an RBC count, the number and size of the RBCs are determined. This is usually reported as number of RBCs per a specified volume, typically in millions of RBCs in microliters (one one-thousandth of an ml) of whole blood. The shape of the RBCs is also evaluated under a microscope. All of this information -- the number, size and shape of the RBCs -- is useful in the diagnosis of anemia. Further, the specific type of anemia may be determined by this information.' "
What is hemoglobin?,"'Hemoglobin is a red pigment that imparts the familiar red color to red blood cells and to blood. Functionally, hemoglobin is the key chemical compound that combines with oxygen from the ''lungs'' and carries the oxygen from the lungs to cells throughout the body. Oxygen is essential for all cells in the body to produce energy.''The blood also transports carbon dioxide, which is the waste product of this energy production process, back to the lungs from which it is exhaled into the air. The transport of the carbon dioxide back to the lung is also achieved by hemoglobin. The carbon dioxide bound to hemoglobin is unloaded in the lungs in exchange for oxygen to be transported to the tissues of the body.' "
What does a low hemoglobin level mean?,"'Low hemoglobin is called anemia. When there is a low hemoglobin level, there is often a low red blood cell count and a low hematocrit, too. Reference ranges are slightly different from one source to another, but typically hemoglobin of less than 13.5 gram/100 ml in men and less than 12.0 gram/100 ml in women is abnormal.' "
What is the hematocrit?,"'The hematocrit is specifically a measure of how much of the blood is made of ''red cells''. The hematocrit is a very convenient way to determine whether the red blood cell count is too high, too low, or normal. The hematocrit is a measure of the proportion of blood that is composed of the red blood cells.' "
How is hematocrit determined?,"""The red blood cells in the sample of blood can quickly be determined by spinning a tube of blood in a centrifuge under prescribed conditions. The proportion of the tube that consists of red blood cells is then measured. Let's say that it is 45%. The hematocrit is 45%."" "
How can anemia be treated?,"'Anemia treatment varies greatly. First, the underlying cause of the anemia needs to be identified and corrected. For example, anemia as a result of blood loss from a stomach ulcer should begin with medications to heal the ulcer. Likewise, surgery is often necessary to remove a colon ''cancer'' that is causing chronic blood loss and anemia.''Sometimes ''iron supplements'' will also be needed to correct iron deficiency. In severe anemia, blood transfusions may be necessary. Vitamin B12 injections will be necessary for patients with ''pernicious anemia'' or other causes of B12 deficiency.''In certain patients with bone marrow disease (or bone marrow damage from chemotherapy) or patients with ''kidney failure'', ''epoetin alfa'' (''Procrit'', ''Epogen'') may be used to stimulate bone marrow red blood cell production.''If a medication is thought to be the culprit, then it should be discontinued under the direction of the prescribing doctor.'

What are the complications of anemia?,"'As mentioned earlier, hemoglobin has the important role of delivering oxygen to all parts of the body for consumption and carries back carbon dioxide back to the lung to exhale it out of the body. If the hemoglobin level is too low, this process may be impaired, resulting in low levels of oxygen in the body (''hypoxia'""). Depending on the severity of the anemia and the length of the patient's illness, the anemia could have no long-term complications or have significant complications."" "
What is the prognosis for a person with anemia?,"'Anemia generally has a very good prognosis and it may be curable in many instances. The overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause of anemia, its severity, and the overall health of the patient.' "
What is blood pressure?,"'Blood pressure'' is the force applied by the blood over the inner walls of the arteries. Although the average blood pressure for a person remains constant, it shows minor fluctuations throughout the day—declining while relaxing and momentarily increasing while being excited or under ''stress''. An increase in the resting blood pressure can ''scar'', stiffen, or harden the arteries.''Blood pressure is written as systolic and diastolic values. Hence, BP 120/80 mm Hg means 120 is the systolic number, and 80 is the diastolic number.''High blood pressure'' is more likely to cause:' heart attack stroke heart failure vision loss kidney failure dementia erectile dysfunction"
What is normal blood pressure according to age?,"'The blood pressure is the pressure of the blood within the arteries. It is produced primarily by the contraction of the ''heart'' muscle. Its measurement is recorded by two numbers. The first (systolic pressure) is measured after the heart contracts and is highest. The second (diastolic pressure) is measured before the heart contracts and lowest.\xa0A blood pressure cuff is used to measure the pressure. Elevation of blood pressure is called ""''hypertension''"".''The chart shows normal blood pressure according to age both male and female.\xa0 Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) are included in the chart.' "
What are the different blood pressure categories?,"'Blood pressure can be categorized into five different types, namely:''Normal:'' Blood pressure below 120/80 mm Hg is considered to be normal.''Elevated:'' When blood pressure readings consistently range from 120 to 129 systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic, it is known as elevated blood pressure. People with elevated blood pressure are at risk of ''high blood pressure'' unless steps are taken to control it.''Hypertension'' stage I:'' In this condition, blood pressure readings consistently range from 130 to 139 systolic or 80 to 89 mm Hg diastolic. Doctors may prescribe blood pressure medications and some lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of heart diseases and ''stroke''.''Hypertension'' stage II: ''In this condition, blood pressure readings consistently range from 140/90 mm Hg or higher. The doctors may prescribe a combination of both medications and lifestyle changes.''Hypertensive crisis:'' This is the most critical condition and requires emergency medical attention. In this condition, the blood pressure suddenly exceeds 180/120 mm Hg. Contact the physician immediately if the following symptoms are experienced:' Shortness of breath Chest pain Back pain Numbness/weakness Change in vision Difficulty speaking"
How to treat high blood pressure?,"'Lifestyle changes and regular exercises can help to treat ''high blood pressure''. Some of the suggested lifestyle changes by the physicians are as follows:''The physicians may prescribe the following medications:' Quit smoking Lose weight Avoid alcohol or at least limit the intake Eat a low-sodium and low-fat diet such as the DASH diet Avoid too much of stress Eat foods rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium such as bananas and milk Regular monitoring of blood pressure after reaching the age of 35 years Practice meditation and other stress-relieving exercises Cut back on caffeine Diuretics ACE inhibitors Alpha-blockers Beta-blockers Calcium channel blockers Vasodilators"
How to treat low blood pressure?,"'Low blood pressure'' can be prevented or treated using the following methods:''Medications such as ''fludrocortisone'' or ''midodrine'' may also help to treat ''low blood pressure''.' Consume lots of fluids Limit alcoholic drinks Stay hydrated, especially during the hot weathers or during viral flu Drink more of nonalcoholic drinks Exercise regularly to encourage blood flow Avoid sitting or standing quickly While rising, take care to sit upright for a few seconds and then getting off from the bed Stay away from heavy lifting Avoid standing still for a prolonged time Avoid straining while passing stools Avoid prolonged exposure to hot water such as sauna, hot water springs, and spas Compression stocking covering the thigh and calf restricts the blood flow to the lower part of the body Try eating smaller, more frequent meals to avoid post-meal dizziness Any consumption of over-the-counter medications should be reported to the physician."
What do blood pressure numbers mean (chart with ranges)?,"'Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. It constitutes one of the critically important signs of life or vital signs, which include ''heart'' rate, ''breathing'', and temperature. Blood pressure is generated by the heart pumping blood into the arteries modified by the response of the arteries to the flow of blood.'""An individual's blood pressure is expressed as ""'systolic/diastolic'' blood pressure, for example, 120/80.''Blood pressure always is higher when the heart is pumping (squeezing) than when it is relaxing.''The range of systolic blood pressure for most healthy adults falls between 90 and 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal diastolic blood pressure ranges between 60 and 80 mm Hg. Current guidelines define normal blood pressure range as lower than 120/80. Blood pressures over 130/80 are considered high. ''High blood pressure'' increases the risk of damaging the arteries, which leads to the development of:''Low blood pressure (''hypotension'') is pressure so low it causes symptoms or signs due to the low flow of blood through the arteries and veins. When the flow of blood is too low to deliver enough oxygen and nutrients to vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidney, the organs do not function normally and may be temporarily or permanently damaged.''Unlike ''high blood pressure'', low blood pressure is defined primarily by signs and symptoms of low blood flow and not by a specific blood pressure number. Some individuals routinely may have blood pressure numbers of 90/50 with no symptoms and therefore do not have low blood pressure. However, others who normally have higher blood pressures may develop symptoms of low blood pressure if their blood pressure drops to 100/60.''During ''pregnancy'', blood pressure tends to decrease. Normal blood pressure during pregnancy may be lower than 100/60. Your OB/GYN or ''Midwife'' should monitor your bood pressure if you are ''pregnant''.'   The systolic blood pressure (the top number) represents the pressure in the arteries as the muscle of the heart contracts and pumps blood into them. The diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) represents the pressure in the arteries as the muscle of the heart relaxes following its contraction. Heart disease Kidney disease Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis) Eye damage Stroke"
How does blood pressure work? ,"'During relaxation of the heart (diastole), the ''left ventricle'' of the heart fills with blood returning from the ''lungs''. The left ventricle then contracts and pumps blood into the arteries (systole). The blood pressure in the arteries during contraction of the ventricle (systolic pressure) is higher because blood is being actively ejected into the arteries. It is lower during relaxation of the ventricle (diastolic pressure) when no blood is being ejected into the arteries. The pulse we feel when we place our fingers over an artery is caused by the contraction of the left ventricle and the ejection of blood.''Blood pressure is determined by two factors: 1) The amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle of the heart into the arteries, and 2) the resistance to the flow of blood caused by the walls of the arterioles (smaller arteries).''Generally, blood pressure tends to be higher if more blood is pumped into the arteries or if the arterioles are narrow and/or stiff. Narrow and/or stiff arterioles, by resisting the flow of blood, increase blood pressure. Arterioles may become narrower when the muscles surrounding them contract. Arterioles may become stiff and narrow when older patients develop atherosclerosis.''Blood pressure tends to be lower if less blood is being pumped into the arteries or if the arterioles are larger and more flexible and, therefore, have less resistance to the flow of blood.''The body has mechanisms to alter or maintain blood pressure and blood flow. There are sensors that detect blood pressure in the walls of the arteries and send signals to the heart, the arterioles, the veins, and the kidneys that cause them to make changes that lower or increase blood pressure.''Several ways in which blood pressure can be adjusted ''by adjusting the amount of blood pumped by the heart into the arteries (cardiac output), the amount of blood contained in the veins, the arteriolar resistance, and the volume of blood.''For example, low blood volume due to bleeding (such as a bleeding ulcer in the stomach or from a severe laceration from an injury) can cause low blood pressure. The body quickly responds to the low blood volume and pressure by the following adjustments, which all increase blood pressure:'""The heart rate increases and the forcefulness of the heart's contractions increase, pumping more blood through the heart."" The heart can speed up and contract more frequently and it can eject more blood with each contraction (more forcefully). Both of these responses increase the flow of blood into the arteries and increase blood pressure. The veins can expand and narrow. When veins expand, more blood can be stored in the veins and less blood returns to the heart for pumping into the arteries. As a result, the heart pumps less blood, and blood pressure is lower. On the other hand, when veins narrow, less blood is stored in the veins, more blood returns to the heart for pumping into the arteries, and blood pressure is higher. The arterioles can expand and narrow. Expanded arterioles create less resistance to the flow of blood and decrease blood pressure, while narrowed arterioles create more resistance and raise blood pressure. The kidney can respond to changes in blood pressure by increasing or decreasing the amount of urine that is produced. Urine is primarily water that is removed from the blood. When the kidney makes more urine, the amount (volume) of blood that fills the arteries and veins decreases, and this lowers blood pressure. If the kidneys make less urine, the amount of blood that fills the arteries and veins increases and this increases blood pressure. Compared with the other mechanisms for adjusting blood pressure, changes in the production of urine affect blood pressure slowly over hours and days. (The other mechanisms are effective in seconds.) Veins narrow to return more blood to the heart for pumping. Blood flow to the kidneys decreases to reduce the formation of urine and thereby increases the volume of blood in the arteries and veins. Arterioles narrow to increase resistance to blood flow. These adaptive responses will keep the blood pressure in the normal range unless blood loss becomes so severe that the responses are overwhelmed."
What are the benefits of low blood pressure?,"'People who have lower blood pressures have a''Athletes, people who ''exercise'' regularly, people who maintain ideal body weight, and nonsmokers tend to have lower blood pressures.''Low blood pressure is desirable as long as it is not low enough to cause symptoms and damage to the organs in the body.' lower risk of stroke, kidney disease, and heart disease."
What are the signs and symptoms of low blood pressure?,"'When blood pressure is not sufficient to deliver enough blood to the organs of the body, the organs do not work properly and can be temporarily or permanently damaged. Symptoms of low blood pressure caused by conditions or diseases depend upon the specific cause of the low blood pressure. For example, if insufficient blood flows to the brain, brain cells do not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, and a person can feel lightheaded, dizzy, or even faint.''The most common symptoms of low blood pressure include:''Symptoms of low blood pressure due to conditions or diseases include:'   Lightheadedness Dizziness Fainting (syncope) Orthostatic hypotension symptoms: Going from a sitting or lying position to a standing position often brings out symptoms of low blood pressure. This occurs because standing causes blood to ""settle"" in the veins of the lower body, and this can lower the blood pressure. If the blood pressure is already low, standing can make the low pressure worse, to the point of causing symptoms. The development of lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting upon standing caused by low blood pressure is called orthostatic hypotension. Normal individuals are able to compensate rapidly for the low pressure created by standing with the responses discussed previously and do not develop orthostatic hypotension. Heart disease: Chest pain (a symptom of angina) or even a heart attack may occur when there is insufficient blood pressure to deliver blood to the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart's muscle). Kidney disease: When insufficient blood is delivered to the kidneys, the kidneys fail to eliminate wastes from the body, for example, urea (BUN and creatinine), and increases in their levels in the blood occur. Shock is a life-threatening condition where persistently low blood pressure causes organs such as kidney, liver, heart, lung, and brain to fail rapidly."
What causes low blood pressure?,'Conditions that reduce the volume of blood or that reduce cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped by the heart) and medications are frequent reasons for low blood pressure.' 
"Dehydration, bleeding, and inflammation","   Dehydration is common among patients with prolonged nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive exercise, which shunts blood away from the organs to the muscles. Large amounts of water are lost when vomiting and with diarrhea, especially if the person does not drink adequate amounts of fluid to replace the depleted water.Other causes of dehydration include exercise, sweating, fever, and heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Individuals with mild dehydration may experience only thirst and dry mouth. Moderate to severe dehydration may cause orthostatic hypotension (manifested by lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting upon standing). Prolonged and severe dehydration can lead to shock, kidney failure, confusion, acidosis (too much acid in the blood), coma, and even death. Moderate or severe bleeding can quickly deplete an individual's body of blood, leading to low blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension. Bleeding can result from trauma, surgical complications, or from gastrointestinal abnormalities such as ulcers, tumors, or diverticulosis. Occasionally, the bleeding may be so severe and rapid (for example, bleeding from a ruptured aortic aneurysm) that it causes shock and death rapidly. Severe inflammation of organs inside the body such as acute pancreatitis can cause low blood pressure. In acute pancreatitis, fluid leaves the blood vessels to enter the inflamed tissues around the pancreas as well as the abdominal cavity, concentrating blood and reducing its volume."
Heart disease,"'Several common reasons for bradycardia include: 1) sick sinus syndrome, 2) ''heart block'', and 3) drug toxicity. Many of these conditions occur in the elderly.''An abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia)'' also can cause low blood pressure. The most common example of tachycardia causing low blood pressure is ''atrial fibrillation'' (''Afib''). ''Atrial fibrillation'' is a disorder of the heart characterized by rapid and irregular electrical discharges from the muscle of the heart causing the ventricles to contract irregularly and (usually) rapidly. The rapidly contracting ventricles do not have enough time to fill maximally with blood before each contraction, and the amount of blood that is pumped decreases in spite of the faster heart rate. Other abnormally rapid heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia also can produce low blood pressure, and sometimes life-threatening shock.' Weakened heart muscle can cause the heart to fail and reduce the amount of blood it pumps. One common cause of weakened heart muscle is the death of a large portion of the heart's muscle due to a single, large heart attack or repeated smaller heart attacks. Other examples of conditions that can weaken the ability of the heart to pump blood include medications toxic to the heart, infections of the muscle of the heart by viruses (myocarditis), and diseases of the heart's valves such as aortic stenosis that reduce the flow of blood from the heart and into the arteries. Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart). Pericarditis can cause fluid to accumulate within the pericardium and compress the heart, restricting the ability of the heart to expand, fill, and pump blood. Pulmonary embolism is a condition in which a blood clot in a vein (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) breaks off and travels to the heart and eventually the lung. A large blood clot can block the flow of blood into the left ventricle from the lungs and severely diminish the blood returning to the heart for pumping. Pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening emergency. A slow heart rate (bradycardia) can decrease the amount of blood pumped by the heart. The resting heart rate for a healthy adult is between 60 and 100 beats/minute. Bradycardia (resting heart rates slower than 60 beats/minute) does not always cause low blood pressure. In fact, some highly trained athletes can have resting heart rates in the 40s and 50s (beats per minute) without any symptoms. The slow heart rates are offset by more forceful contractions of the heart that pump more blood than in non-athletes. However, in many patients bradycardia can lead to low blood pressure, lightheadedness, dizziness, and even fainting. Sick sinus syndrome: Sick sinus syndrome occurs when the diseased electrical system of the heart cannot generate electrical signals fast enough to maintain a normal heart rate. Heart block: Heart block occurs when the specialized tissues that transmit electrical current in the heart are damaged by heart attacks, degeneration from atherosclerosis, and medications. Heart block prevents some or all of the electrical signals from reaching parts of the heart, and this prevents the heart from contracting as well as it otherwise would. Drug toxicity: Drugs such as digoxin (Lanoxin) or beta blockers for high blood pressure can slow the transmission of electricity in the heart chemically and can cause bradycardia and hypotension (see section ""Medications that cause low blood pressure"")."
Medications,"'Medications that cause low blood pressure' Medications such as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and digoxin (Lanoxin) can slow the rate at which the heart contracts. Some elderly people are extremely sensitive to these medications since they are more likely to have diseased hearts and electrical conduction tissues. In some individuals, the heart rate can become dangerously slow even with small doses of these medications. Medications used in treating high blood pressure (such as angiotensin converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers) can excessively lower blood pressure and result in symptomatic low blood pressure especially among the elderly. Water pills (diuretics) such as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL) and furosemide (Lasix) can decrease blood volume by causing excessive urination. Medications used for treating depression, such as amitriptyline (Elavil); Parkinson's disease, such as levodopa-carbidopa (Sinemet); and erectile dysfunction (impotence), such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis) when used in combination with nitroglycerin, can cause low blood pressure. Alcohol and narcotics also can cause low blood pressure."
Other causes of low blood pressure," Vasovagal reaction is a common condition in which a healthy person temporarily develops low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and sometimes fainting. A vasovagal reaction typically is brought on by emotions of fear or pain such as having blood drawn, starting an intravenous infusion, or by gastrointestinal upset. Vasovagal reactions are caused by activity of the involuntary (autonomic) nervous system, especially the vagus nerve, which releases hormones that slow the heart and widen the blood vessels. The vagus nerve also controls digestive tract function and senses activity in the digestive system. Thus, some people can have a vasovagal reaction from straining at a bowel movement or vomiting. Postural (orthostatic) hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when an individual stands up from a sitting, squatting, or supine (lying) position. When a person stands up, gravity causes blood to settle in the veins in the legs so that less blood returns to the heart for pumping, and, as a result, the blood pressure drops. The body normally responds automatically to the drop in blood pressure by increasing the rate and narrowing the veins to return more blood to the heart. In patients with postural hypotension, this compensating reflex fails to occur, resulting low blood pressure and its symptoms. Postural hypotension can occur in persons of all ages but is much more common among the elderly, especially in those on medications for high blood pressure and/or diuretics. Other causes of postural hypotension include dehydration, adrenal insufficiency, prolonged bed rest, diabetes, and certain rare neurological syndromes (for example, Shy-Drager syndrome) that damage the autonomic nerves. Another form of postural hypotension occurs typically in young healthy individuals. After prolonged standing, the individual's heart rate and blood pressure drop, causing dizziness, nausea, and often fainting. In these individuals, the autonomic nervous system wrongly responds to prolonged standing by directing the heart to slow down and the veins to dilate thereby removing blood from circulating in the arteries. Micturition syncope is a temporary drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness brought about by urinating. This condition typically occurs in elderly patients and may be due to the release of hormones that lower blood pressure. Adrenal insufficiency, for example, due to Addison's disease, can cause low blood pressure. Addison's disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands (small glands next to the kidneys) are destroyed. The destroyed adrenal glands can no longer produce sufficient adrenal hormones (specifically cortisol) necessary to maintain normal bodily functions. Cortisol has many functions, one of which is to maintain blood pressure and the function of the heart. Addison's disease is characterized by weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and, sometimes, darkening of the skin. Septicemia is a severe infection in which bacteria (or other infectious organisms such as fungi) enter the blood. The infection typically originates in the lungs (as pneumonia), bladder, or in the abdomen due to diverticulitis or gallstones. The bacteria then enter the blood where they release toxins and cause life-threatening and profound low blood pressure (septic shock), often with damage to several organs. Anaphylaxis (anaphylactic shock) is a potentially fatal allergic reaction to medications such as penicillin, intravenous iodine used in some X-ray studies, foods such as peanuts, or bee stings (insect stings). In addition to a severe drop in blood pressure, individuals may also experience hives and wheezing due to constriction of the airways, and a swollen throat, which causes difficulty breathing. The shock is caused by enlargement of blood-containing blood vessels and escape of water from the blood into the tissues."
What procedures and tests diagnose low blood pressure?,"'In some people, particularly relatively healthy ones, symptoms of weakness, dizziness, and fainting raise the suspicion of low blood pressure. In others, an event often associated with low blood pressure, for example a heart attack, has occurred to cause the symptoms.''Measuring blood pressure in both the lying (supine) and standing positions usually is the first step in diagnosing low blood pressure. In patients with symptomatic low blood pressure, there often is a marked drop in blood pressure upon standing, and patients may even develop orthostatic symptoms. The heart rate often increases. The goal is to identify the cause of the low blood pressure. Sometimes the causes are readily apparent (such as loss of blood due to trauma, or sudden shock after receiving X-ray dyes containing iodine). At other times, the cause may be identified by testing:' CBC (complete blood count) may reveal anemia from blood loss or elevated white blood cells due to infection. Blood electrolyte measurements may show dehydration and mineral depletion, renal failure (kidney failure), or acidosis (excess acid in the blood). Cortisol levels can be measured to diagnose adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease. Blood and urine cultures can be performed to diagnose septicemia and bladder infections, respectively. Radiology studies, such as chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasounds, and computerized tomography (CT or CAT) scans may detect pneumonia, heart failure, gallstones, pancreatitis, and diverticulitis. Electrocardiograms (EKG) can detect abnormally slow or rapid heartbeats, pericarditis, and heart muscle damage from either previous heart attacks or a reduced supply of blood to the heart muscle that has not yet caused a heart attack. Holter monitor recordings are used to diagnose intermittent episodes of abnormal heart rhythms. If abnormal rhythms occur intermittently, a standard EKG performed at the time of a visit to the doctor's office may not show the abnormal rhythm. A Holter monitor is a continuous recording of the heart's rhythm for 24 hours that often is used diagnose intermittent episodes of bradycardia or tachycardia (aslow or fast heart rate). Patient-activated event recorder: If the episodes of bradycardia or tachycardia are infrequent, a 24-hour Holter recording may not capture these sporadic episodes. In this situation, a patient can wear a patient-activated event recorder for up to 4 weeks. The patient presses a button to start the recording when he or she senses the onset of an abnormal heart rhythm or symptoms possibly caused by low blood pressure. The doctor then analyzes the recordings later to identify the abnormal episodes. Echocardiograms are examinations of the structures and motion of the heart using ultrasound. Echocardiograms can detect pericardial fluid due to pericarditis, the extent of heart muscle damage from heart attacks, diseases of the heart valves, and rare tumors of the heart. Ultrasound examinations of the leg veins and CT scans of the chest can detect deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Tilt-table tests are used to evaluate patients suspected of having postural hypotension or syncope due to abnormal function of the autonomic nerves. During a tilt-table test, the patient lies on an examination table with an intravenous infusion administered while the heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. The table then is tilted upright for 15 minutes to 45 minutes. Heart rate and blood pressure are monitored every few minutes. The purpose of the test is to try to reproduce postural hypotension. Sometimes a doctor may administer epinephrine (Adrenalin, Isuprel) intravenously to induce postural hypotension."
What is the treatment for low blood pressure?,"'Low blood pressure readings in healthy people without symptoms or organ damage need no treatment. A doctor should evalute all patients with symptoms that are possibly due to low blood pressure. Patients who have had a major drop in blood pressure from their usual levels even without the development of symptoms also should be evaluated. The doctor needs to identify the cause of the low blood pressure; remedies will depend on the cause. For example, if a medication is causing the low blood pressure, the dose of medication may have to be reduced or the medication stopped. ''Do not adjust medication dose on your own, and do not stop taking any medication without first consulting your doctor.''Do not take any herbs without first consulting your doctor.''*Note: Increasing salt intake can lead to heart failure in patients with existing heart disease and should not be undertaken without consulting a doctor.'   Dehydration is treated with fluids and minerals (electrolytes). Mild dehydration without nausea and vomiting can be treated with oral fluids and electrolytes. Moderate to severe dehydration usually is treated in a hospital or emergency room with intravenous fluids and electrolytes. Blood loss can be treated by treating the cause of the bleeding, and with intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. Continuous and severe bleeding needs to be treated immediately. Septic shock is a medical emergency and is treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Blood pressure medications or diuretics are adjusted, changed, or stopped by the doctor if they are causing low blood pressure symptoms. Bradycardia may be due to a medication. The doctor may reduce, change, or stop the medication. Bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome or heart block is treated with an implantable pacemaker. Tachycardia is treated depending on the nature of the tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation can be treated with oral medications, electrical cardioversion, or a catheterization procedure called pulmonary vein isolation. Ventricular tachycardia can be controlled with medications or with an implantable defibrillator. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is treated with blood thinners, initially with types of heparin. Later, oral warfarin (Coumadin) or other oral medications are substituted for heparin. Pericardial fluid from pericarditis can be removed by a procedure called pericardiocentesis. Postural hypotension can be treated with changes in diet such asincreasing water and salt intake,* increasing intake of caffeinated beverages (because caffeine constricts blood vessels),using compression stockings to compress the leg veins and reduce the pooling of blood in the leg veins, andin some patients, the use of a medication called midodrine (ProAmatine). increasing water and salt intake, * increasing intake of caffeinated beverages (because caffeine constricts blood vessels), using compression stockings to compress the leg veins and reduce the pooling of blood in the leg veins, and in some patients, the use of a medication called midodrine (ProAmatine). The problem with midodrine is that while it increases blood pressure in the upright position, the supine blood pressure may become too high, thus increasing the risk of strokes. Mayo Clinic researchers found that a medication used to treat muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis called pyridostigmine (Mestinon) increases upright blood pressure but not supine blood pressure. Pyridostigmine, an anticholinesterase medication, works on the autonomic nervous system, especially when a person is standing up. Side effects include minor abdominal cramping or increased frequency of bowel movements. Postprandial hypotension refers to low blood pressure occurring after meals. Ibuprofen (Motrin) or indomethacin (Indocin) may be beneficial. Vasovagal syncope can be treated with several types of drugs such as beta blockers, for example:Propanolol (Inderal, Inderal LA)SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such asfluoxetine (Prozac),escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro),paroxetine (Paxil),sertraline (Zoloft),citalopram (Celexa), andfluvoxamine (Luvox). Propanolol (Inderal, Inderal LA) SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such asfluoxetine (Prozac),escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro),paroxetine (Paxil),sertraline (Zoloft),citalopram (Celexa), andfluvoxamine (Luvox). fluoxetine (Prozac), escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and fluvoxamine (Luvox). fludrocortisone (Florinef) (a drug that prevents dehydration by causing the kidney(s) to retain water) also may be used. A pacemaker can also be helpful when a patient fails drug therapy. Natural remedies have not been proven. Some herbs reported to raise blood pressure includeginger,rosemary,aniseed,cinnamon, andpepper. ginger, rosemary, aniseed, cinnamon, and pepper."
What is ferritin?,'Ferritin is the major iron storage protein of the body. Ferritin levels can be used to indirectly measure how much iron is in the body. Ferritin has the shape of a hollow sphere that permits the entry of a variable amount of iron for storage (as ferric hydroxide phosphate complexes).' 
What is the ferritin blood test?,"""The ferritin test uses venous blood to measure ferritin levels. The test is sometimes ordered together with other tests to help evaluate the body's iron stores, such as an iron level or a total iron binding capacity (TIBC) test."" "
How does one prepare for a ferritin blood test?,'The ferritin test uses venous blood that is withdrawn as for any routine blood test. No special preparation for the test is necessary. Fasting is not necessary.' 
How is the test performed?,"'A needle attached to a vacuum collection device is inserted into a vein, often a vein in the antecubital fossa (crease of the elbow), after the area has been cleaned. Venous blood can also be taken from other sites.' "
What are the potential side effects of a ferritin blood test?,'The ferritin blood test is a routine blood test and typically does not cause side effects. Mild ''bruising'' at the venipuncture site can occur infrequently.' 
What are normal results for a ferritin test?,"'The results may vary slightly among laboratories, but in general, normal ferritin levels range from 12 to 300 nanograms per milliliter of blood (ng/mL) for males and 12 to 150 ng/mL for females.' "
What does an elevated ferritin level mean?,"'Higher-than-normal levels of ferritin can be indicative of an iron storage disorder such as ''hemochromatosis''.''Hereditary ''hemochromatosis'' is an ''inherited'' (genetic) disorder in which there is excessive accumulation of iron in the body (''iron overload''). In individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, the daily absorption of iron from the ''intestines'' is greater than the amount needed to replace losses. Since the normal body cannot increase iron excretion, the absorbed iron accumulates in the body.''People with hereditary hemochromatosis may have no symptoms or signs (and have normal longevity), or they can have severe symptoms and signs of ''iron overload'' that include:''The symptoms arise because iron accumulates in the organs and leads to destruction and loss of normal function.''Other causes of a high ferritin level are chronic inflammatory medical conditions such as ''liver disease'' or ''rheumatoid arthritis'', or some types of ''cancer''.'   A man with hemochromatosis can accumulate 20 grams of total body iron by age 40 to 50 (the normal iron content for the body is 3 to 4 grams). The excess iron deposits in the joints, liver, testicles, and heart, which causes damage to these organs, and causes signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. Women with hemochromatosis accumulate iron at a slower rate than men because they lose more iron than men due to iron loss from menstruation. Therefore, they typically develop signs and symptoms of organ damage due to excess iron 10 years later than men. sexual dysfunction, heart failure, joint pains, liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, weight loss, fatigue, and darkening of skin."
What does a low ferritin level mean?,"'Lower-than-normal serum ferritin levels are seen in ''iron deficiency''. Without enough iron, the body cannot produce sufficient levels of ''hemoglobin'', a component of ''red blood cells'' that allows them to carry oxygen. ''Iron deficiency anemia'' is the result. Mild ''anemia'' may not produce symptoms at all. More serious cases of ''iron deficiency anemia'' can produce symptoms such as:' shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, pale skin, and fast heartbeat."
What are thyroid hormones?,"""The thyroid gland produces hormones that are essential for normal body metabolism. Blood testing is now commonly available to determine the adequacy of the levels of thyroid hormones. These blood tests can define whether the thyroid gland's hormone production is normal, overactive, or underactive.""""The thyroid gland is located in the lower part of the neck, below the Adam's apple.The gland wraps around the windpipe (trachea) and has a shape that is similar to a butterfly - formed by two wings (lobes) and attached by a middle part (isthmus). ""'The thyroid gland uses ''iodine'' (mostly available from the ''diet'' in foods such as seafood, bread, and salt) to produce thyroid hormones.' The two most important thyroid hormones are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which account for 99.9% and 0.1% of thyroid hormones present in the blood respectively. However, the hormone with the most biological activity is T3. Once released from the thyroid gland into the blood, a large amount of T4 is converted into T3 - the active hormone that affects the metabolism of cells."
What are normal thyroid hormone levels?,"'The thyroid itself is regulated by another gland that is located in the brain, called the pituitary. In turn, the pituitary is regulated in part by the thyroid (via a ""feedback"" effect of ''thyroid hormone'' on the ''pituitary gland'') and by another gland called the hypothalamus.''The hypothalamus releases a hormone called thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which sends a signal to the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In turn, TSH sends a signal to the thyroid to release thyroid hormones. If a disruption occurs at any of these levels, a defect in thyroid hormone production may result in a deficiency of thyroid hormone (''hypothyroidism'').''Hypothalamus - TRH''↓''Pituitary - TSH''↓''Thyroid - T4 and T3''The rate of thyroid hormone production is controlled by the pituitary gland. If there is an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone circulating in the body to allow for normal functioning, the release of TSH is increased by the pituitary gland in an attempt to stimulate more thyroid hormone production. In contrast, when there is an excessive amount of circulating thyroid hormone, TSH levels fall as the pituitary attempts to decrease the production of thyroid hormone.' In persons with hypothyroidism (thyroid hormone production is below normal), there is a continuously decreased level of circulating thyroid hormones. In persons with hyperthyroidism (thyroid hormone production is above normal), there is a continuously elevated level of circulating thyroid hormones."
What are the types of thyroid disorders?,'The most common ''thyroid disorders'' include:'   Thyroid nodules Hashimoto's thyroiditis Hyperparathyroidism Thyroid cancer Thyroiditis Hyperthyroidsm Hypothyroidism Graves' disease
What procedures and tests diagnose thyroid problems?,"'Blood tests are used to diagnose hypothyroidism or ''hyperthyroidism'"". They do not point to a specific cause. In order to determine a cause of the thyroid abnormality, the doctor will consider the patient's history, physical examination, and medical condition. Further testing might be used to isolate an underlying cause. These tests might include more blood testing for""'If ''thyroid cancer'' is suspected and surgery may be required, your physician may ask for a blood test known as thyroglobulin.'   thyroid antibodies, nuclear medicine thyroid scanning, ultrasound of the thyroid gland, or others. Thyroglobulin is a protein made only by thyroid cells. If the thyroglobulin level at baseline is detectable or elevated (this means the gland does in fact make the protein) it can be used as a tumor marker. After a total thyroidectomy for cancer (removal of the entire thyroid gland) the level should fall to an undetectable range since the cells that make thyroglobulin have been removed. If the level remains detectable after surgery, there is a possibility of thyroid tissue elsewhere in the body, and metastatic disease should be considered. If the level is undetectable for a period of time after surgery and then starts to climb, a recurrence of the cancer - either at the primary site or elsewhere in the body should be considered."
What is a blood transfusion?,"""A blood transfusion is the transfer of blood or blood products from one person (donor) into another person's bloodstream (recipient). This is usually done as a lifesaving maneuver to replace blood cells or blood products lost through severe bleeding, during surgery when blood loss occurs or to increase the blood count in an ""'anemic'' patient. The following material is provided to all patients and/or their family members regarding blood transfusions and the use of blood products. Although in most situations the likelihood of a blood transfusion associated with surgery is uncommon, at times patients may require blood products. You are encouraged to discuss your particular need for transfusion as well as the risks of transfusion with your doctor.''Your options may be limited by time and health factors, so it is important to begin carrying out your decision as soon as possible. For example, if friends or family members are donating blood for a patient (directed donors); their blood should be drawn several days prior to the anticipated need to allow adequate time for testing and labeling. The exact protocols are hospital and donor site specific.'""The safest blood product is your own, so if a transfusion is likely, this is your lowest risk choice. Unfortunately, this option is usually only practical when preparing for elective surgery. In most other instances, the person cannot donate their own blood due to the acute nature of the need for blood. Although you have the right to refuse a blood transfusion, this decision may have life-threatening consequences. If you are a parent deciding for your child, you as the parent or guardian must understand that in a life-threatening situation your doctors will act in your child's best interest to insure your child's health and wellbeing in accordance with standards of medical care regardless of religious beliefs. Please carefully review this material and decide with your doctor which option(s) you prefer, understanding that your doctor will always act in the best interest of his or her patient.""'To assure a safe transfusion make sure your healthcare provider who starts the transfusion verifies your name and matches it to the blood that is going to be transfused. Besides your name, a second personal identifier usually used is your birthday. This assures the blood is given to the correct patient.''If during the transfusion you have symptoms of ''shortness of breath'', ''itching'', ''fever'' or ''chills'' or just not feeling well, alert the person transfusing the blood immediately.''Blood can be provided from two sources: '' autologous blood'' (using your own blood) or '' donor blood'"" (using someone else's blood).""  "
Using your own blood (autologous blood)," Pre-operative donation: donating your own blood before surgery. The blood bank draws your blood and stores it until you need it during or after surgery. This option is only for non-emergency (elective) surgery. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during and after surgery. The disadvantage is that it requires advanced planning which may delay surgery. Some medical conditions may prevent the pre-operative donation of blood products. Intra-operative autologous transfusion: recycling your blood during surgery. Blood lost during surgery is filtered, and put back into your body during surgery. This can be done in emergency and elective surgeries. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during surgery. Large amounts of blood can be recycled. This process cannot be used if cancer or infection is present. Post-operative autologous transfusion: recycling your blood after surgery. Blood lost after surgery is collected, filtered and returned to your body. This can be done in emergency and elective surgeries. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during surgery. This process can't be used in patients where cancer or infection is present. Hemodilution: donating your own blood during surgery. Immediately before surgery, some of your blood is taken and replaced with IV fluids. After surgery, your blood is filtered and returned to you. This is done only for elective surgeries. This process dilutes your own blood so you lose less concentrated blood during surgery. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during surgery. The disadvantage of this process is that only a limited amount of blood can be removed, and certain medical conditions may prevent the use of this technique. Apheresis: donating your own platelets and plasma. Before surgery, your platelets and plasma, which help stop bleeding, are withdrawn, filtered, and returned to you when you need it later. This can be done only for elective surgeries. This process may eliminate the need for donor platelets and plasma, especially in high blood-loss procedures. The disadvantage of this process is that some medical conditions may prevent apheresis, however, it has limited applications."
Donor blood (blood from another person),"'All donor blood is tested for safety making its risks very small, but no screening program is perfect and risks, such as contraction of the ''hepatitis'' virus or other infectious diseases still exist.''Volunteer blood:'' blood collected from the community blood supply (blood banks). This has the advantage of being readily available and can be life-saving when your own blood is not available. The disadvantage is that there is a risk of disease transmission, such as ''hepatitis'', and ''allergic'' reactions.''Designated donor blood: ''blood is collected from the donors you select. You can select people with your own ''blood type'' who you feel are safe donors. Like volunteer blood, there is still a risk of disease transmission, such as hepatitis and ''AIDS'', and allergic reactions. This process usually requires several days for advanced donation. It may not necessarily be safer than volunteer donor blood.' "
What is a blood bank?,"'Blood banks collect, test, and store blood. They carefully screen all donated blood for possible infectious agents, such as ''viruses'', that could make you sick.'""Blood bank staff also screen each blood donation to find out whether it's ""'type A'"", B, AB, or O and whether it's Rh-positive or Rh-negative. Getting a blood type that doesn't work with your own blood type will make you very sick. That's why blood banks are very careful when they test the blood.""'To prepare blood for a transfusion, some blood banks remove white blood cells. This process is called white cell or leukocyte (LU-ko-site) reduction. Although rare, some people are allergic to white blood cells in donated blood. Removing these cells makes allergic reactions less likely.'""Not all transfusions use blood donated from a stranger. If you're going to have surgery, you may need a blood transfusion because of blood loss during the operation. If it's surgery that you're able to schedule months in advance, your doctor may ask whether you would like to use your own blood, rather than donated blood.""'If you choose to use your own blood, you will need to have blood drawn one or more times prior to the surgery. A blood bank will store your blood for your use.' "
What are the different types of blood?,"'Almost all cells, including red blood cells, have molecules on their surface that have important roles to play in interactions with cells of the immune system. There are multiple sites on each cell for the molecules, and at each site, one of several related molecules may reside. Each site has only a limited number of different molecules that can reside there; each site has its own, unique molecules. Each molecule that can reside at any one site is referred to (defined) as a blood type, and the entire group of related molecules that can occupy a single site is referred to as a blood group.''A blood group is an ''inherited'' feature. For example, two series of ''blood types'' constitute a blood group system known as the Rh or the ABO systems.'""Because blood types are responsible for the interactions between cells such as red blood cells and the immune system, it is important that the blood types of the donor and the recipient of red blood cells match. If the donor and recipient's blood types are not matched, the recipient's immune system will destroy the donor's cells.""'There are four blood types:'""Every person has one of the above four blood types. In addition, each person's blood is either:""""For example, if a person has type A blood, it's either type A positive or type A negative."" A, B, AB, or O. Rh-positive, or Rh-negative. Type O negative blood is safe for just about everyone. People with type O negative blood are referred to as universal donors; and type O negative blood is used for emergencies in which there is no time to test a person's blood type. Individuals who have type AB positive blood are referred to as universal recipients. This means that they can receive any type of blood. People who have Rh-positive blood can receive Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood. If a person has Rh-negative blood, they should only receive Rh-negative blood. Rh-negative blood is used for emergencies when there is not time to test a person's Rh type."
What are the types of blood transfusions?,"'Blood is transfused either as whole blood (with all its parts) or, more frequently as individual parts. The type of blood transfusion you need depends on your situation.''Red blood cells are the most commonly transfused components of the blood. These cells carry oxygen from the ''lungs'"" to your body's organs and tissues. They also help your body get rid of carbon dioxide and other waste products.""""You may need a transfusion of red blood cells if you've lost blood due to an injury or surgery. You also may need this type of transfusion if you have severe ""'anemia'' (uh-NEE-me-uh) due to disease or blood loss.''Anemia'"" is a condition in which your blood has a lower than a normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't have enough ""'hemoglobin'' (HEE-muh-glow-bin).''Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.''Platelets and clotting factors help stop bleeding, including ''internal bleeding'"" that you can't see. Some illnesses may cause your body to not make enough platelets or clotting factors. You may need regular transfusions of these blood products to stay healthy.""'For example, if you have ''hemophilia'"" (heem-o-FILL-ee-ah), you may need a special clotting factor to replace the clotting factor you're lacking. ""'Hemophilia'' is a rare, inherited ''bleeding disorder'"" in which your blood doesn't clot normally.""'If you have ''hemophilia'', you may bleed for a longer time than others may after an injury or accident. You also may bleed internally, especially in the joints (knees, ankles, and elbows).'""Plasma is the liquid part of your blood. It's mainly water, but also contains proteins, clotting factors, hormones, ""'vitamins'', ''cholesterol'', ''sugar'', sodium, potassium, calcium, and more.''If you have been badly burned or have ''liver'' failure or a severe infection, you may need a plasma transfusion.'  "
Who needs a blood transfusion?,"'Blood transfusions are very common. Each year, almost 5 million Americans need blood transfusions. This procedure is used for people of all ages.''Many people who have surgery need blood transfusions because they lose blood during their operations. For example, about one-third of all ''heart'' surgery patients have a transfusion.''Some people who have serious injuries - such as from car crashes, war, or natural disasters - need blood transfusions to replace blood lost during the injury.''Some people need blood or parts of blood because of illnesses. You may need a blood transfusion if you have:' A severe infection or liver disease that stops your body from properly making blood or some parts of blood. An illness that causes anemia, such as kidney disease or cancer. Medicines or radiation used to treat a medical condition also can cause anemia. There are many types of anemia, including aplastic, Fanconi, hemolytic, iron-deficiency, pernicious, and sickle cell anemias and thalassemia (thal-a-SE-me-a). A bleeding disorder, such as hemophilia or thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah)."
What to expect before a blood transfusion,"'Before a blood transfusion, a technician tests your blood to find out what blood type you have (that is, A, B, AB, or O and Rh-positive or Rh-negative). He or she pricks your finger with a needle to get a few drops of blood or draws blood from one of your veins.'""The blood type used in your transfusion must work with your blood type. If it doesn't, antibodies (proteins) in your blood attack the new blood and make you sick.""'Some people have allergic reactions even when the blood given does work with their own blood type. To prevent this, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to stop allergic reactions.''If you have ''allergies'' or have had an ''allergic reaction'"" during a past transfusion, your doctor will make every effort to make sure you're safe.""""Most people don't need to change their diets or activities before or after a blood transfusion. Your doctor will let you know whether you need to make any lifestyle changes prior to the procedure."" "
What to expect during a blood transfusion,"""Blood transfusions take place in either a doctor's office or a hospital. Sometimes they're done at a person's home, but this is less common. Blood transfusions also are done during surgery and in emergency rooms.""'A needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood. The procedure usually takes 1 to 4 hours. The time depends on how much blood you need and what part of the blood you receive.''During the blood transfusion, a nurse carefully watches you, especially for the first 15 minutes. This is when allergic reactions are most likely to occur. The nurse continues to watch you during the rest of the procedure as well.' "
What to expect after a blood transfusion,"'After a blood transfusion, your vital signs are checked (such as your temperature, ''blood pressure'', and heart rate). The intravenous (IV) line is taken out. You may have some ''bruising'' or soreness for a few days at the site where the IV was inserted.''You may need blood tests that show how your body is reacting to the transfusion. Your doctor will let you know about signs and symptoms to watch for and report.' "
"Allergic reactions, infections, fever, and iron overload risks and complications","'Most blood transfusions go very smoothly. However, mild problems and, very rarely, serious problems can occur.''Some people have allergic reactions to the blood given during transfusions. This can happen even when the blood given is the right blood type.''Allergic reactions can be mild or severe. Symptoms can include:''A nurse or doctor will stop the transfusion at the first signs of an allergic reaction. The health care team determines how mild or severe the reaction is, what treatments are needed, and whether the transfusion can safely be restarted.''Some infectious agents, such as ''HIV'', can survive in blood and infect the person receiving the blood transfusion. To keep blood safe, blood banks carefully screen donated blood.''The risk of catching a virus from a blood transfusion is very low.'""You may get a sudden fever during or within a day of your blood transfusion. This is usually your body's normal response to white blood cells in the donated blood. ""'Over-the-counter'' fever medicine usually will treat the fever.''Some blood banks remove white blood cells from whole blood or different parts of the blood. This makes it less likely that you will have a reaction after the transfusion.''Getting many blood transfusions can cause too much iron to build up in your blood (''iron overload''). People who have a blood disorder like thalassemia, which requires multiple transfusions, are at risk for ''iron overload''. Iron overload can damage your liver, heart, and other parts of your body.''If you have iron overload (''hemochromatosis''), you may need iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy.

If you receive blood during a transfusion that contains hepatitis, you'll likely develop the virus. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). This disease is the human version of Mad Cow Disease. It's a very rare, yet fatal brain disorder. There is a possible risk of getting vCJD from a blood transfusion, although the risk is very low. Because of this, people who may have been exposed to vCJD aren't eligible blood donors."
"Lung injuries, hemolytic reactions, and immune hemolytic reaction risks and complications","""Although it's unlikely, blood transfusions can damage your lungs, making it hard to breathe. This usually occurs within about 6 hours of the procedure. Most people recover, however, 5% to 25% of people who develop lung injuries die from the injuries.

Sometimes they can collect and reuse the blood for the patient.' "
What are the 11 causes of rectal bleeding?,"'There are many possible causes. Most common causes include:''Other causes of rectal bleeding may include:' Piles or hemorrhoids: Small hemorrhoids are usually painless. The most common symptom is bleeding while passing stools. The blood may stain the toilet bowl or may be seen on the toilet paper. Larger hemorrhoids may lead to a mucous discharge, pain, irritation, and itch. Hemorrhoids are swellings around the anus and lowermost part of the gut (lower rectum). Hemorrhoids are common during or after pregnancy, in persons suffering from long-standing constipation, during straining while passing stools. Anal fissure: It is a small tear of the skin at the anal border. It is a very painful condition. Often, an anal fissure will bleed a little. The blood is usually bright red and stains the toilet tissue but soon stops.  Stomach and duodenal ulcers: An ulcer in the stomach or duodenum may lead to bleeding. This can cause rectal bleeding. Stool may turn black- or plum-colored (melaena). Infections: Infections of the stomach and intestine are one of the causes that may cause rectal bleeding. Symptoms may include watery stools and swelling of the gut. Diverticula: A diverticulum is a small pouch in the intestines (wall of the gut). More than one diverticulum is called diverticula. They can develop on any part of the gut. A diverticulum may occasionally bleed, and patients may pass some blood through the anus. Bleeding is usually abrupt and painless. It is due to a burst blood vessel that can occur in the wall of a diverticulum and the amount of blood loss may sometimes be heavy. Crohn's disease: It is a condition that causes the inner lining of the gut to become red and swollen. The disease flares up from time to time. Symptoms vary, depending on the part of the gut affected and how bad the condition is. Common symptoms include bloody diarrhea and stomach pain. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and other forms of colitis: UC is a disease where inflammation (redness and swelling) develops in the terminal part of the gut. A common symptom when the disease flares up is diarrhea mixed with blood. The blood oozes from ulcers that develop on the lining of the inflamed gut.  Polyps: A bowel polyp is a small non-cancerous growth that sometimes forms on the inside lining of the intestine or rectum. They are common in older people. Sometimes, a polyp bleeds, and rarely, a polyp can turn cancerous.  Cancer: Cancer of the intestine and rectum may be seen in older or, rarely in, young people. Rectal bleeding is one symptom that may occur. Bleeding is often a late symptom, and other symptoms are present before visible bleeding occurs, for example, weight loss, tiredness due to blood loss, diarrhea, or constipation. Cancers of other parts of the gut higher up from the colon sometimes cause rectal bleeding, but these are uncommon.  Angiodysplasia: It is a condition where patients develop numerous enlarged blood vessels within the inner lining of the colon. Angiodysplasia most commonly develops in the right area of intestine. The cause is unknown, but they occur most commonly in older people. Bleeding is usually painless. The blood may be bright red brisk bleeding, dark blood mixed with stool, or black- or plum-colored stool (melaena).  Developmental abnormalities of the gut: In young children, various abnormalities of the gut or the gut wall may cause rectal bleeding. Volvulus: Twisting of the gut Intussusception: One part of the gut is sucked into another, creating a blockage Meckel's diverticulum: An extra bulge or pouch in the small intestine, which is congenital (present from birth). Hirschsprung's disease: A condition where a part of the lower bowel does not function as it should. The muscles of the bowel wall are unable to squeeze along the stool as they should do."
What is rectal bleeding?,'Oozing of blood from the anus or rectum during passing stools is called rectal bleeding. The blood may be from any part of the gut or even from the stomach. The color of blood may vary depending on the site. Fresh red color is a sign of bleeding in the rectum or anus. Darker blood is a sign of bleeding in the small bowel or upper area of the gut. Very dark or blackish blood is often associated with bleeding in the stomach or other organs in the ''digestive system''.' 
What is a complete blood count (CBC) test?,"'The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. Special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute generally determine these calculations.''A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood.' "
How much does a CBC test cost?,"'The cost for a\xa0complete blood count test or CBC test varies greatly, and can run\xa0from $10.00 up to $2,700 depending on what type of insurance you have, and whether or not you have it.' "
What is the complete blood count test used for?,"'Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments.' It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia). To monitor a medical treatment: a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be the cause of prolonged bleeding or other medical conditions that affect the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Conversely, a high platelet count (thrombocytosis) may point toward a bone marrow problem or severe inflammation."
What does a complete blood count test measure?,"'The complete blood count, or CBC, lists a number of many important values. Typically, it includes the following:''Mean corpuscular volume (MCV):'' is the average volume of a red blood cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and red cell count. Normal range may fall between 80 to 100 femtoliters (a fraction of one millionth of a liter).''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): ''is the average amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell. This is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the red cell count. Normal range is 27 to 32 picograms.''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): ''is the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of red cells. This is a calculated volume derived from the hemoglobin measurement and the hematocrit. Normal range is 32% to 36%.''Mean Platelet Volume (MPV): ''is the average size of platelets in a volume of blood.' White blood cell count (WBC or leukocyte count) WBC differential count Red blood cell count (RBC or erythrocyte count) Hematocrit (Hct) Hemoglobin (Hbg) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) Red cell distribution width (RDW) Platelet count Mean Platelet Volume (MPV)"
What are the normal ranges for a complete blood count test?,"'The values generally included:''Red blood cells are the most common cell type in blood and people have millions of them in their blood circulation. They are smaller than white blood cells but larger than platelets.' White blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm). This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 to 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. White blood cell (WBC) differential count. The white blood count is comprised of several different types that are differentiated, or distinguished, based on their size and shape. The cells in a differential count are granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. Red cell count (RBC) signifies the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally from 4.2 to 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 to 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter. Platelet count measures the number of platelets in a volume of blood and usually ranges between 150,000 to 400,000 per cmm."
"What is the function of the red and white blood cells, and platelets?","'The cells in the CBC (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) have unique functions. Generally speaking, white blood cells are an essential part of the immune system and help the body fight infections. Each different component of the white blood cell (the WBC differential) plays a specific role in the immune system.''Red blood cells are essential in transporting oxygen to all the cells in the body to serve their functions. The hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell is the vehicle for the transportation of oxygen. Platelets are a part of the blood clotting system in the body and help in preventing bleeding.' "
What are electrolytes?,"'Chemically, electrolytes are substances that become ions in solution and acquire the capacity to conduct electricity. Electrolytes are present in the ''human body'', and the balance of the electrolytes in our bodies is essential for normal function of our cells and our organs. ''Common electrolytes that are measured by doctors with blood testing include sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The functions and normal range values for these electrolytes are described below. ' "
Sodium,"'Sodium is the major positive ion (cation) in fluid outside of cells. The chemical notation for sodium is Na+. When combined with chloride, the resulting substance is table salt. Excess sodium (such as that obtained from dietary sources) is excreted in the urine. Sodium regulates the total amount of water in the body and the transmission of sodium into and out of individual cells also plays a role in critical body functions. Many processes in the body, especially in the brain, nervous system, and muscles, require electrical signals for communication. The movement of sodium is critical in the generation of these electrical signals. Therefore, too much or too little sodium can cause cells to malfunction, and extremes in the blood sodium levels (too much or too little) can be fatal.''A Normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased sodium (hypernatremia) in the blood occurs whenever there is excess sodium in relation to water. There are numerous causes of hypernatremia; these may include kidney disease, too little water intake, and loss of water due to diarrhea and/or vomiting. A decreased concentration of sodium (hyponatremia) occurs whenever there is a relative increase in the amount of body water relative to sodium. This happens with some diseases of the liver and kidney, in patients with congestive heart failure, in burn victims, and in numerous other conditions."
Potassium,"'Potassium is the major positive ion (cation) found inside of cells. The chemical notation for potassium is K+. The proper level of potassium is essential for normal cell function. Among the many functions of potassium in the body are regulation of the heartbeat and the function of the muscles. A seriously abnormal increase in potassium (''hyperkalemia'') or decrease in potassium (''hypokalemia'') can profoundly affect the nervous system and increases the chance of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), which, when extreme, can be fatal.''The normal blood potassium level is 3.5 - 5.0 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 3.5 - 5.0 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).'

The movement of sodium is critical in the generation of these electrical signals. Therefore, too much or too little sodium can cause cells to malfunction, and extremes in the blood sodium levels (too much or too little) can be fatal.''A Normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased sodium (hypernatremia) in the blood occurs whenever there is excess sodium in relation to water. There are numerous causes of hypernatremia; these may include kidney disease, too little water intake, and loss of water due to diarrhea and/or vomiting. A decreased concentration of sodium (hyponatremia) occurs whenever there is a relative increase in the amount of body water relative to sodium. This happens with some diseases of the liver and kidney, in patients with congestive heart failure, in burn victims, and in numerous other conditions."

It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia).

Many processes in the body, especially in the brain, nervous system, and muscles, require electrical signals for communication. The movement of sodium is critical in the generation of these electrical signals. Therefore, too much or too little sodium can cause cells to malfunction, and extremes in the blood sodium levels (too much or too little) can be fatal.''A Normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased sodium (hypernatremia) in the blood occurs whenever there is excess sodium in relation to water. There are numerous causes of hypernatremia; these may include kidney disease, too little water intake, and loss of water due to diarrhea and/or vomiting. A decreased concentration of sodium (hyponatremia) occurs whenever there is a relative increase in the amount of body water relative to sodium. This happens with some diseases of the liver and kidney, in patients with congestive heart failure, in burn victims, and in numerous other conditions."
Potassium,"'Potassium is the major positive ion (cation) found inside of cells. The chemical notation for potassium is K+. The proper level of potassium is essential for normal cell function. Among the many functions of potassium in the body are regulation of the heartbeat and the function of the muscles. A seriously abnormal increase in potassium (''hyperkalemia'') or decrease in potassium (''hypokalemia'') can profoundly affect the nervous system and increases the chance of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), which, when extreme, can be fatal.''The normal blood potassium level is 3.5 - 5.0 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 3.5 - 5.0 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased potassium is known as hyperkalemia. Potassium is normally excreted by the kidneys, so disorders that decrease the function of the kidneys can result in hyperkalemia. Certain medications may also predispose an individual to hyperkalemia. Hypokalemia, or decreased potassium, can arise due to kidney diseases; excessive losses due to heavy sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, eating disorders, certain medications, or other causes."
Chloride,"'Chloride is the major anion (negatively charged ion) found in the fluid outside of cells and in the blood. An anion is the negatively charged part of certain substances such as table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) when dissolved in liquid.\xa0Chloride plays a role in helping the body maintain a normal balance of fluids.''The balance of chloride ion (Cl-) is closely regulated by the body. Significant increases or decreases in chloride can have deleterious or even fatal consequences:''The normal serum range for chloride is 98 - 108 mmol/L.' Increased chloride (hyperchloremia): Elevations in chloride may be seen in diarrhea, certain kidney diseases, and sometimes in overactivity of the parathyroid glands. Decreased chloride (hypochloremia): Chloride is normally lost in the urine, sweat, and stomach secretions. Excessive loss can occur from heavy sweating, vomiting, and adrenal gland and kidney disease."
Bicarbonate,"'The bicarbonate ion acts as a buffer to maintain the normal levels of acidity (pH) in blood and other fluids in the body. Bicarbonate levels are measured to monitor the acidity of the blood and body fluids. The acidity is affected by foods or medications that we ingest and the function of the kidneys and ''lungs''. The chemical notation for bicarbonate on most lab reports is HCO3- or represented as the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). The normal serum range for bicarbonate is 22-30 mmol/L. ''The bicarbonate test is usually performed along with tests for other blood electrolytes. ''Disruptions in the normal bicarbonate level'' may be due to diseases that interfere with respiratory function, kidney diseases, metabolic conditions, or other causes.' "
What is a complete blood count (CBC) test?,"'The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. Special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute generally determine these calculations.''A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood.' "
How much does a CBC test cost?,"'The cost for a\xa0complete blood count test or CBC test varies greatly, and can run\xa0from $10.00 up to $2,700 depending on what type of insurance you have, and whether or not you have it.' "
What is the complete blood count test used for?,"'Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments.' It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia). To monitor a medical treatment: a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be the cause of prolonged bleeding or other medical conditions that affect the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Conversely, a high platelet count (thrombocytosis) may point toward a bone marrow problem or severe inflammation."
What does a complete blood count test measure?,"'The complete blood count, or CBC, lists a number of many important values. Typically, it includes the following:''Mean corpuscular volume (MCV):'' is the average volume of a red blood cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and red cell count. Normal range may fall between 80 to 100 femtoliters (a fraction of one millionth of a liter).''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): ''is the average amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell. This is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the red cell count. Normal range is 27 to 32 picograms.''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): ''is the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of red cells. This is a calculated volume derived from the hemoglobin measurement and the hematocrit. Normal range is 32% to 36%.''Mean Platelet Volume (MPV): ''is the average size of platelets in a volume of blood.' White blood cell count (WBC or leukocyte count) WBC differential count Red blood cell count (RBC or erythrocyte count) Hematocrit (Hct) Hemoglobin (Hbg) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) Red cell distribution width (RDW) Platelet count Mean Platelet Volume (MPV)"
What are the normal ranges for a complete blood count test?,"'The values generally included:''Red blood cells are the most common cell type in blood and people have millions of them in their blood circulation. They are smaller than white blood cells but larger than platelets.' White blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm). This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 to 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. White blood cell (WBC) differential count. The white blood count is comprised of several different types that are differentiated, or distinguished, based on their size and shape. The cells in a differential count are granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. Red cell count (RBC) signifies the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally from 4.2 to 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 to 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter. Platelet count measures the number of platelets in a volume of blood and usually ranges between 150,000 to 400,000 per cmm."
"What is the function of the red and white blood cells, and platelets?","'The cells in the CBC (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) have unique functions. Generally speaking, white blood cells are an essential part of the immune system and help the body fight infections. Each different component of the white blood cell (the WBC differential) plays a specific role in the immune system.''Red blood cells are essential in transporting oxygen to all the cells in the body to serve their functions. The hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell is the vehicle for the transportation of oxygen. Platelets are a part of the blood clotting system in the body and help in preventing bleeding.' "
What are electrolytes?,"'Chemically, electrolytes are substances that become ions in solution and acquire the capacity to conduct electricity. Electrolytes are present in the ''human body'', and the balance of the electrolytes in our bodies is essential for normal function of our cells and our organs. ''Common electrolytes that are measured by doctors with blood testing include sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The functions and normal range values for these electrolytes are described below. ' "
Sodium,"'Sodium is the major positive ion (cation) in fluid outside of cells. The chemical notation for sodium is Na+. When combined with chloride, the resulting substance is table salt. Excess sodium (such as that obtained from dietary sources) is excreted in the urine.

What is photodynamic therapy (PDT)?,"'Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a medical treatment that utilizes a photosensitizing molecule (frequently a drug that becomes activated by light exposure) and a light source to activate the administered drug. Very thin superficial ''skin cancers'' called ''actinic keratoses'' and certain other types of ''cancer'' cells can be eliminated this way. ''Acne'"" can also be treated as well. The procedure is easily performed in a physician's office or outpatient setting. PDT is also referred to as blue light therapy.""'PDT essentially has three steps. First, a light-sensitizing liquid, cream, or intravenous drug (photosensitizer) is applied or administered. Occasionally, a photosensitizing molecule that is already part of the body can be activated. Second, there is an incubation period of minutes to days. Finally, the target tissue is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light that then activates the photosensitizing medication. The mechanism by which tissue is destroyed seems to depend on the presence of activated oxygen molecules.''Steps:''Although first used in the early 1900s, PDT in the modern sense is a new, evolving science. Current PDT involves a variety of incubation times for different the light-sensitizing ''drugs'' and a variety of light sources depending on the target tissue. The basic premise of PDT is selective tissue destruction.''At present, the primary limitation of available PDT technology for skin is the depth of penetration of the light and ability to target cells within 1/3 of an inch (approximately 1 cm) of the light source. Therefore, tumors or atypical growths must be close to the surface of the skin for PDT to work.''PDT is currently used in a number of medical fields, including ''oncology'' (''cancer''), dermatology (skin), ''cosmetic surgery'', ophthalmology, and oral medicine.''In oncology, PDT is FDA approved for ''non-small cell lung cancer'', ''esophageal cancer'', and ''precancerous'"" changes of Barrett's ""'esophagus''. Its use is also being further investigated through ''clinical trials'' in general oncology for conditions including ''cancers'' of the cervix (mouth of uterus), ''prostate gland'', brain, and peritoneal ''cavity'' (the abdominal space that contains the stomach, ''liver'', and internal organs).''In dermatology, PDT with the photosensitizer Levulan Kerastick (20% delta-aminolevulinic acid HCl) is used for the treatment of very early, thin skin cancers called actinic keratoses (AK). The initial approval was specifically for the treatment of ''actinic keratosis'' of the face and ''scalp'' with application of the photosensitizer followed by a timed exposure to a special blue light source. PDT has also used for ''acne'', ''rosacea'', thin nonmelanoma skin cancers, sun damage, enlarged sebaceous glands, ''wrinkles'', ''warts'', ''hidradenitis suppurativa'', ''psoriasis'', and many other ''skin conditions''. It is not used to remove ''moles'' or ''birthmarks''. '   application of photosensitizer drug incubation period light activation"
What photosensitizer drugs are available?,"'FDA-approved photosensitizers include porfimer sodium (Photofrin), 5-aminolevulinic acid or ALA (Levulan), and methyl aminolevulinate [MAOP] (Metvix). More drugs may become available in the near future. Photofrin is used intravenously for internal cancers while Levulan and Metvix are applied topically for skin therapy.' "
"What light sources are available, and how are they applied?","'PDT light sources include laser light, intense pulsed light, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), blue light, red light, and many other visible lights (including natural sunlight). Photosensitizer drugs may become activated by one or several types of light. The optimal light source depends on the ideal wavelength for the particular drug used and target tissue.''The light source needs to be directly applied to the target tissue for an appropriate amount of time. For surface skin treatments, the light is directly applied to the area of the skin where the photosensitizer drug has been applied (such as face, scalp, arms, etc.). For internal cancers, delivering the light to the desired area is more challenging. The light may be delivered through small ''fiber''-optic cables into the body ''cavity'' or area being treated. Sometimes, endoscopes (a thin, lighted, elongated tube that is inserted into a body space) are used to deliver the light into the ''lungs'', stomach, or bladder.' "
How does photodynamic therapy work?,"'PDT works by direct injury to the target cells and tissues. This involves the production of an activated oxygen molecule that can injure or destroy nearby cells. Because the normal skin barrier is not present at the sites of the actinic keratoses, photosensitizing molecule is preferentially absorbed there and then activated by light. The activated oxygen destroys the adjacent abnormal tissue. Once the areas have healed following PDT, the areas are reexamined to see if additional treatments or biopsies are needed.''With traditional cryosurgery (freezing with liquid nitrogen), only the visible actinic keratoses can be treated. Since many actinic keratoses are often not evident, PDT might be preferable since it presumably would destroy these ""subclinical"" lesions. PDT allows for treatment of an entire area of sun damage simultaneously, but subsequent treatments may be necessary.' "
Does PDT make me permanently more sensitive to light?,"'No, PDT causes a temporary ''sensitivity to light'', including natural sunlight and some indoor lights. The light sensitivity resolves with time, depending on both the photosensitizer drug and dosage used.''Light avoidance is generally required after PDT. The duration depends on the drug and dosage used. Intravenous porphyrin may make the body, including the skin and eyes, sensitive to light for about 6 weeks after treatment. Proper protection, including long sleeves and ''sunglasses'', may be required. Topically applied aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate may cause skin sensitivity only on the treatment areas for approximately 24-72 hours. These do not usually cause sensitivity on other body parts other than where the drug was directly applied. Your physician will need to discuss with you the required sun- and light-avoidance period required after your particular treatment.' "
How is PDT used to treat the skin?,"'PDT using Levulan and a proprietary blue light is currently FDA approved for the treatment of early skin precancers called actinic keratoses (rough scaly spots generally on sun-exposed skin). PDT is also known as ""ALA/PDT treatment"" or ""Super Blue Light."" It has been referred to as a ""super photo facial"" when the photosensitizer is used with a machine called intense pulsed light or IPL. These treatments may help remove sun-damaged precancerous skin. Sun damage, fine lines, and blotchy pigmentation may also be improved because of the positive effect of PDT. PDT seems to reduce oil gland function and so is helpful in treating ''acne'' and ''rosacea''.'""Although PDT's use in skin was first investigated in 1990s for ""'actinic keratosis'"", it was not as popular or widely used because of the required long incubation times (usually 18-24 hours) and limited indications. Since approximately 2001, PDT has become more widespread primarily because of advances including shorter incubation times (30-60 minutes). In Europe, studies utilizing the exposure to ambient sunlight after application of the photosensitizer and a chemical sunblock (to prevent exposure to ultraviolet light) seemed to be effective in the treatment of actinic keratoses. This could eliminate the need for treatment to be administered in a physician's office."" "
What is a typical skin PDT session like?,"'You may be given a written procedure consent form to read and sign before your first treatment. The medical staff may take some pretreatment photography prior to applying the photosensitizer medication.''In the treatment room, you may be sitting or comfortably lying back on a table. Often a thorough cleansing of the face is done using ''alcohol'' and or acetone to degrease the skin.''The photosensitizer liquid or cream is applied topically to the whole area being treated (such as the entire face, scalp, back of the hands, back part of the forearms, legs, ''feet'', scalp, chest, or back).''The medication is allowed to air dry for a few minutes, and then you will wait anywhere from 30-60 minutes for the incubation time. Some areas such as chest, back, and particularly forearms and legs require longer incubation times of 2 to 18 hours, depending on skin pigmentation and anatomical site. PDT requires physician adjustments for specific individualized incubation times and treatment durations.''After the proper incubation time, you are exposed to the light source. There may be sensations of warmth, tingling, heat, or burning in some patients. A fan can be used to help cool off during the treatment. The treatment area is then washed off and ''sunscreen'' applied. Instructions are given on how to care for the skin at home.' "
"How much improvement can I expect with 
photodynamic therapy?","'No two individuals are the same, and results may vary. Some conditions can improve dramatically in some patients and not respond in others.''Overall, patients with severely ''sun-damaged skin'' with actinic ''keratosis'', mottled pigmentation, dull or sallow skin, and skin laxity, may see good to excellent improvement with PDT. There can be improvement of large pores, non-pitted ''acne'' ''scars'', and active acne.''Depending on the area being treated and the recommended incubation time, different numbers of treatment sessions spaced 4 to 6 weeks apart may be required to achieve the desired improvement and reduction in lesions. On average, a series of two to three treatments are performed. It is not always possible to predict ahead of time how many treatments your specific condition may take or how you will respond to PDT.''After photodynamic sun avoidance for 24-48 hours is necessary.' "
"Where can I have photodynamic therapy, and who performs the procedure?","""Photodynamic therapy for skin disease is usually comfortably performed in an outpatient setting like a doctor's office and without any sedation or anesthesia. You may check the ""'www.AAD.org'' for board-certified dermatologist members of the American Board of Dermatology in your area. Additionally, oncologists and other physicians may be trained in this area.''Most skin PDT is performed only by specially trained dermatologists and their medical staff. Other physicians, including oncologists, family physicians, internal medicine doctors, ''plastic'' surgeons, or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons and their medical staff who are trained, may also perform photodynamic therapy.' "
What are the advantages with photodynamic therapy for treating actinic keratoses?,"'The greatest advantage of PDT is the ability to selectively treat an entire area of skin damage and precancerous actinic keratoses (blanket or field treatment). PDT generally decreases the likelihood of lighter or darker skin spots (post-inflammatory hyper- or hypopigmentation) caused by routine freezing with liquid nitrogen. Additionally, PDT frequently may facilitate smoother skin and an overall improved appearance, tone, color, and enhanced skin texture.''In several studies, PDT has been preferred by many patients for ease of use and rapid recovery as compared to alternative treatments including freezing and topical fluorouracil (''Efudex''). The PDT side effects may be milder with less downtime than with fluorouracil.''For patients with many skin lesions, PDT may be generally more effective than repeated spot treatment with topical liquid nitrogen. Some patients are unable to tolerate the prolonged treatment required with fluorouracil or imiquimod (''Aldara'') because of the irritation, redness, and possible downtime with these topical creams. PDT is very well-tolerated, noninvasive (no needles or surgery required) procedure to help reduce sun damage and enhance the overall cosmetic outcome (particularly in sensitive areas of the face and chest).' "
Am I a good candidate for photodynamic therapy?,"'The best candidates for PDT may be those with lighter or fair skin with sun damage.''You may not be a good candidate for photodynamic therapy if you have darker skin that tends to turn brown or discolor with certain light or laser treatments. You may also not be a good candidate for PDT if you are very sensitive to light, ''burn'' extremely easily, would be unable to stay out of sunlight for the required 24-48 hours, or are taking medications which may make you very sensitive to sunlight or light-based therapies. People with certain medical diseases (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'') may not be candidates for PDT because of increased risk of burning from the light exposure.''Your decision on the best treatment choice may depend on different factors such as the location and type of skin lesions, your past treatments, your overall health, and level of comfort. Your physician can help you sort through the different treatments.''Your physician needs to know of any other medical conditions that may affect your procedure or overall ''wound'' healing. You would want to make sure to tell your physician beforehand if you have any extreme sensitivity to light-based treatments, take medications which make you very sensitive to light, have had a problem or bad effect from prior PDT, have ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', or suffer from a condition called ''porphyria''. During the exposure to light, there is a moderately uncomfortable burning sensation that most patients seem to tolerate without additional ''pain'' medication.''Your PDT physician needs to know if you have had a history of ''staph'' or other skin infections in the recent past. You will also want to advise your physician if you have a history of frequent ''cold sores'' (''herpes'' virus infections on your face). In that case, you may be prescribed an antiviral tablet (''cold''-sore ''prevention'' pill) to take before and after your procedure. You may be asked to wash with a special antibiotic soap or wash.''Patients may need to also advise their physician of any drug ''allergies'' such as to topical anesthetics or other photosensitizers. Additionally, the surgeon may need to know of any bleeding or ''bruising'' tendencies, ''hepatitis'', ''HIV/AIDS'', or ''pregnancy''.''Your physician will want to know of any factors that may affect your surgery or wound healing.'  "
What growths is PDT not good for?,'PDT is not as effective for thick actinic keratoses due to the inability of the photosensitizer drug to penetrate into the depths of the lesion. These growths may need to be destroyed using some other technique.' 
What are possible complications or side effects of photodynamic therapy?,"'Overall, most patients tolerate the minor procedure very well without any complications. However, PDT is associated with some possible minor risks and complications. Since an exaggerated light-sensitive reaction is expected by definition of PDT, most patients understand and expect some type of a ''sunburn'' or red reaction after skin PDT. Not everyone gets a ''sunburn'' reaction, however. Some patients may have no visible reaction or redness.''Possible risks and complications of photodynamic therapy include burning of the treated area, skin discoloration, skin redness, prominent tiny blood vessels (telangiectasia), ''pain'', infection, cold-sore activation, ''blisters'', scabs, unsightly scars, cosmetic disfigurement, skin discoloration, eye injury or swelling, ''allergic'' reactions, prolonged sun sensitivity, and reaction to topical anesthesia.''Minor, serious, or life-threatening reactions can occur with the use of anesthetics or with medications given before, after, or during a procedure.' "
Is there scarring from photodynamic therapy?,"'No, PDT usually does not leave scars in typical cases. Overall when you undergo PDT, there will be some type of a red skin reaction and irritation for 3 to 10 days after the treatment. Some people are more sensitive to PDT and the light treatment than others. Similarly, some people heal better or faster than others. Some residual redness may be more noticeable depending on the location and skin type. Some people may have temporary skin discoloration that may last weeks to months. Patients with darker skin types may have more skin discoloration after treatment.' "
What are alternatives for photodynamic therapy?,"'It is important to understand that as with any medical treatment, there are alternative treatments to PDT. You may want to discuss alternative treatment options with your doctor at your consultation appointment.''There are many options for treatment of an actinic keratosis (AK), including but not limited to freezing (''cryotherapy'' or cryosurgery), burning, chemical peels, creams (like fluorouracil and immune modulator creams like imiquimod), local destruction by curettage and desiccation (scrape and ''burn''), and other choices depending on the skin condition.''In acne, there are many alternatives to PDT, including oral ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane), oral antibiotics, topical washes, acne facials, and many acne creams.' "
What about insurance coverage and costs of photodynamic therapy?,"""Photodynamic therapy is currently considered a medical service for the treatment of some conditions, particularly for actinic keratosis. However, it may be considered cosmetic, off' label, or not medically indicated for conditions for which it is regularly used.""'Currently, some insurance plans cover the procedure under their provided benefits. However, with the many changes in insurance plans, it is always advisable to contact your insurance carrier prior to scheduling any treatment and confirm your eligibility and benefits.''Photodynamic therapy, like any procedure, will result in additional procedure charges above the routine office-visit fees. These fees may range from two to several hundred dollars depending on the area, number of treatments, and the type of insurance you purchase. The greater number of treatments and greater the amount of photosensitizer medication required, the higher the cost.''Insurance benefits vary, and reimbursement depends on what benefits you have contracted for with your insurance company. Currently, Medicare generally typically covers 80% of photodynamic therapy for actinic keratoses. If you have a secondary insurance plan, that may help cover the remaining 20% not covered by Medicare.''Standard commercial or non-Medicare insurances currently generally may cover a large percentage of PDT for actinic kurtosis unless you have to meet an out-of-pocket deductible first. You may want to get to know and understand your insurance benefits before having surgery. In many cases, you may also ask the billing office at the medical center or your insurance coordinator for an approximate estimate of your charges before scheduling the procedure.' "
How do I prepare for my procedure?,"'Your personal physician and their medical personnel will likely let you know the preoperative instructions specific for your condition.'""For many typical PDT procedures in a physician's office, most patients are advised to come in with a clean, washed area without any lotions or ""'makeup''. You may generally eat your regular ''diet'' on the day of their procedure and take all of your regular daily medications. Your skin should be fully clean and free of all makeup, moisturizers, and sunscreens. Bring a wide-brimmed hat (6 inches), sunglasses, and scarf when appropriate to the appointment. Patients are advised to wear comfortable casual clothes and bring a wide-brimmed hat for facial or scalp treatments. You should bring gloves or a long-sleeve shirt if having hands or forearms treated.''In nearly all cases, patients are usually able to drive after most procedures and do not necessarily need a driver unless they feel uncomfortable or have taken any sedative medications.''Since you will be in the office for generally at least one hour, you may want to bring some personal snacks, ''drinks'', and reading or knitting material. Personal music headsets may also provide relaxation and help pass time during your PDT application, incubation time, and treatment.''Most patients continue all prescribed medications, including ''aspirin'' and any blood thinners unless specifically advised otherwise only by the doctor.''While there is no absolute contraindication, ''smoking'' is discouraged for at least a few days before and 1 to 2 weeks after your procedure. As with any procedure, ''smoking'' can slow down wound healing and cause an increased risk of wound infections.''Heavy alcohol use is not advised at least a few days before PDT. Heavy alcohol use can cause more bleeding and thin your blood. An occasional glass of wine or small cocktail may not cause severe bleeding.' "
How is recovery after photodynamic therapy (PDT)?,"'Recovery is usually fairly easy and uneventful. Many patients have mild dryness and a faint to mild sunburn of the treated area. A small percent of patients may have moderate or marked discomfort and a harder recovery because of more skin dryness, redness, or burning.''Some of these patients have had inadvertent sun exposure even as short as a minute or two during their immediate post-treatment time, causing a more severe reaction.''You will want to plan to stay indoors and avoid any sunlight for 24-48 hours as directed by your physician. Overall, you may be able to resume all normal indoor activities the first day.''Most patients are able to their normal activities 24-48 hours after photodynamic therapy. Avoiding direct sunlight for the first 1 to 2 days in crucial to avoiding getting an exuberant (red) response. Your physician will need to let you know what activity precautions are required based on the area and size of your procedure.' "
Is there pain after PDT?,"'Typically, there is little pain with PDT. No two individuals are exactly the same, and individual reactions and tolerance to discomfort levels vary. Most patients report mild skin irritation including minimal to mild dryness and tight feeling of their skin after PDT. This discomfort is usually improved with frequent application of bland topical emollients or plain Vaseline.'""A small number of patients may actually complain that they felt nothing and didn't have any pain or peeling. Less commonly, a small percentage of patients for various reasons may have significant pain, a very exaggerated sunburn response, moderate overall discomfort, and pain from the tightness and warmth of the skin.""'If there is pain, many patients find that they prefer to take something for pain at the first hint of discomfort instead of waiting until the pain builds up to an unbearable level. If you have mild or moderate pain, your doctor may advise you to take ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or another ''pain reliever''. Rarely, prescription pain medications may be required for severe pain.''Your physician will let you know what pain medications are recommended for your specific condition.' "
How do I take care of my treatment area after photodynamic therapy?,"'It is generally required to check with your doctor for their specific ''wound care'' instructions before your procedure. Often, you will be asked to go home and stay indoors for the rest of the day. Your physician will usually give you more detailed instructions depending on the area and size of the procedure.''Many physicians suggest you shower and wash the area immediately and as often as you would like. Wound care may require gently washing the area with soap and water or hydrogen peroxide two to three times a day and applying an ''over-the-counter'' antibiotic ointment or a nonirritating moisturizer like Purpose, Cetaphil, or Aquaphor to the area. Avoidance of harsh or abrasive cleansers is advised. Picking or scrubbing the skin could cause in severe irritation or scarring.''Most patients are advised to try to avoid applying makeup or powder directly on a fresh or ''open wound'"" unless the surface is fully healed. A nonirritating sunscreen such as zinc or titanium may be applied immediately after the procedure before leaving the physician's office. Sunscreens are ideally also applied twice a day after PDT. It is important to follow your own physician's instructions for wound care.""'Mild to moderate redness and or swelling is not uncommon the first day or two after PDT and can be lessened by application of an ice bag, ice cubes, or ice chips in a small Ziploc bag, or frozen peas in their bag. Applying cool packs or ice every 5 to 15 minutes every hour for the first 8 to 24 hours after your procedure may be very soothing. Swelling may be more common for procedures around the eyes or lips. Sleeping propped up on a few pillows or in a reclining chair may help decrease swelling after treatment of the head and face area.'""Your physician should be notified of any infections, cold-sore outbreaks, extreme swelling, or other unexpected reactions. Rarely, a visit to the physician's office may be necessary for severe swelling or infection. Oral antibiotics, cortisone creams or tablets, or other medications may be required for adverse reactions.""'Your physician will need to know if pain is increasing after one to two days after your procedure or if you are having ''fever'"" or other concerning symptoms. In such cases, you may need to be seen at the physician's office."" "
"What is the chance that my actinic 
keratoses will recur?","'While PDT is a very effective treatment, there is a reasonable chance that you may continue to need periodic treatments for actinic keratoses, depending on your individual skin, severity of prior sun damage, and your compulsion to avoid the sun.''Actinic keratoses may recur or a new ''cancer'' may develop in the same or adjacent area even after photodynamic therapy or other treatments. Some skin actinic keratoses are more aggressive than others and need additional treatment and closer follow-up.''Sun-damaged skin frequently needs follow-up and possible further treatment. Several studies have shown that photodynamic therapy tends to have a cure rate comparable to the traditional treatment with fluorouracil (''Carac'', Efudex, and ''Fluoroplex'').''It is important to note that PDT is not curative in invasive ''skin cancer''. This may require one or more procedures such as biopsy, surgery, ''radiation'', or other procedures to fully treat those lesions.''Follow-up appointments with your dermatologist or physician are very important, especially in the first few years after photodynamic therapy. Many patients are seen every 4 to 6 months after their diagnosis of actinic keratoses of the skin.''Self-skin examinations monthly are good practice for patients with a history of ''skin cancer''. Any changing or new growth should be promptly checked by your physician. More regular follow-up appointments may be needed for those with more aggressive tumors or tumors in high-risk areas. Your physician will recommend the proper follow-up for your specific condition.' "
What is bocavirus?,"'Bocavirus (also termed HBoV or human bocavirus) is a small (20 nm in size) non-enveloped virus with a single strand of DNA that comprises its genome. The bocavirus genus is a member of the ''Parvoviridae'' family, and to date, three strains have been identified: HBoV, HBoV-2, and HBoV-3. Bocavirus is a new viral genus that was discovered in 2005 in upper respiratory secretions from acutely ill children. The name ''bocavirus'' was derived by combining the names ''bovine parvovirus'' with ''canine minutevirus'' with which bocavirus shares some genetic and structural characteristics. The ICTVdB (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses database) has detailed its genome and structure.''Although this virus has been found worldwide in humans and animals, there is ongoing research and discussion about this virus as being a pathogen that causes infection, either alone or in conjunction with other virus types. Many investigators consider this newly discovered virus genus as an ""emerging viral pathogen"" because it is only proven to be associated with infections but not yet proven to be a cause of them, either alone or in conjunction with other viruses. However, another member of the ''Parvoviridae'' family, a parvovirus termed B19, causes ''erythema infectiosum'' (''fifth disease'' or ""slapped cheek"" syndrome), hydrops fetalis (severe ''anemia'' in ''pregnant'' women), and aplastic crisis (cessation of red blood cell production) in individuals that have ''sickle cell disease''. Bocavirus has not been associated with these conditions caused by parvovirus B19.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of bocavirus infection?,"'Because bocavirus is usually only found in individuals (usually infants, children, and infrequently in young adults) with lower respiratory infections or ''diarrhea'', these are the following symptoms and signs associated with the presence of bocavirus:''The infants and children with these nonspecific symptoms often are very ill and require hospitalization. It is important to note that it is not clear yet that bocavirus is either completely or partially responsible for these signs and symptoms. Currently, most of the clinical articles that discuss bocavirus describe patients with at least several of the symptoms and signs listed above, with ''pneumonia'' as the major problem. Some investigators report months of bocavirus shedding (having tests demonstrate the presence of the virus in body secretions) in patients with ''cancer'' (''leukemia''), but the significance of this shedding is not clear.'   ARTI (also termed RTIs, acute respiratory tract infections), especially in infants and children Cough Wheezing Fever Cyanosis (bluish or grayish tint to skin due to lack of oxygen) Rhinorrhea (runny nose) Diarrhea Vomiting"
How does bocavirus infection spread?,"'Because bocavirus is a newly detected virus, many basic studies are still being planned or are ongoing. Consequently, conclusions about how the virus is spread are based on suppositions that are supported by some scientific findings, but not yet proved by scientific tests. Since the virus can be detected in high numbers in the respiratory tract and in respiratory secretions of some hospitalized patients, investigators suggest that bocavirus is mainly spread to other humans by respiratory secretions. However, it can also be found in stools (''diarrhea'') and in blood, so these may be alternative ways for the virus to spread. Unfortunately, to date, there are no animal or viral cell culture systems to investigate bocavirus strains. It is clear, however, that from the few epidemiological studies done that bocavirus can be found worldwide in about 1.5%-19% of the population, usually in sick children.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose a bocavirus infection?,"'Most investigators agree that bocavirus ""infection"" is a diagnosis by association as the virus has not yet proven to be definitively responsible for a disease state. There are no commercially available tests for any bocavirus strains. Researchers, however, use a ''polymerase chain reaction'' (PCR) to detect virus in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and samples of blood and diarrhea. These PCR tests detect the genetic material of the viruses, but the PCR tests are not widely available. Many researchers use the terms ""detected bocavirus"" or ""associated with"" instead of ""definitively diagnosed with bocavirus infection"" when they discuss the patients with symptoms described above. However stated, many investigators who work with these ill children clearly suspect bocavirus is playing some role in the disease process.' "
What is the treatment for a bocavirus infection?,"'There is no treatment, medical or antiviral, that is known to effectively target bocavirus strains. A few investigators suggest that since there is no definitive evidence that bocavirus causes infection or disease, either alone or in combination with other viruses, there should be no treatment directed toward bocavirus. Other investigators believe that since bocavirus strains are usually associated with patients with respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, treatments should be considered. Currently, the only available treatments (for example, oxygen, respiratory support, and hydration) are for the relief of symptoms since no specific anti-bocavirus treatments are available.' "
What is the prognosis of bocavirus infection?,"'The prognosis of patients with bocavirus detected is unclear because it is not known if bocavirus is responsible, alone or in part, for any disease or infection. However, when bocavirus strains are detected, they are frequently found associated (from about 45%-93% of patients tested by experienced investigators) with other viruses known to cause infections. The viruses that are identified in association with bocavirus are of several different types:''As research on bocavirus progresses, other types of associated viruses are likely to be found. The prognosis for patients with these viruses is usually good, especially if patients are seen and treated by a medical ''caregiver'' early in the infection. However, for a few patients who develop severe symptoms with these viral infections, the prognosis may range from fair to poor.' RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) Adenovirus Parainfluenza virus Enterovirus Herpes simplex virus"
Is it possible to prevent a bocavirus infection?,"'Bocavirus strains have not yet been shown definitively to cause infection; prevention methods await development and are likely to be investigated if these viruses are shown to participate in causing infection. Currently, there is no vaccine in development for human use.' "
What is body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)?,"'Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a serious illness in which a person is preoccupied with minor or imaginary physical flaws, usually of the skin, hair, and nose. A person with BDD tends to have ''cosmetic surgery'', and even if the surgery is successful, does not think it was and is unhappy with the outcome.' "
Symptoms of BDD,"'Getting cosmetic surgery can make BDD worse. They are often not happy with the outcome of the surgery. If they are, they may start to focus attention on another body area and become preoccupied trying to fix the new ""defect."" In this case, some patients with BDD become angry at the surgeon for making their appearance worse and may even become violent towards the surgeon.' Being preoccupied with minor or imaginary physical flaws, usually of the skin, hair, and nose, such as acne, scarring, facial lines, marks, pale skin, thinning hair, excessive body hair, large nose, or crooked nose. Having a lot of anxiety and stress about the perceived flaw and spending a lot of time focusing on it, such as frequently picking at skin, excessively checking appearance in a mirror, hiding the imperfection, comparing appearance with others, excessively grooming, seeking reassurance from others about how they look, and getting cosmetic surgery."
Treatment for BDD," Medications. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs are antidepressants that decrease the obsessive and compulsive behaviors. Cognitive behavioral therapy. This is a type of therapy with several steps:The therapist asks the patient to enter social situations without covering up her ""defect.""The therapist helps the patient stop doing the compulsive behaviors to check the defect or cover it up. This may include removing mirrors, covering skin areas that the patient picks, or not using make-up.The therapist helps the patient change their false beliefs about their appearance.

What is a boil? What are boil symptoms and signs?,"'A boil is a localized infection in the skin that begins as a reddened, tender area. Over time, the area becomes firm, hard, and increasingly tender. Eventually, the center of the boil softens and becomes filled with infection-fighting white blood cells from the bloodstream to eradicate the infection. This collection of white blood cells, bacteria, and proteins is known as pus. Finally, the pus ""forms a head,"" which can be surgically opened or may spontaneously drain out through the surface of the skin. Pus enclosed within tissue is referred to as an abscess. A boil is also referred to as a skin abscess. Boils can occur anywhere on the body, including the trunk, extremities, buttocks, groin, armpit, or other areas.'  "
What is a boil? What are boil symptoms and signs? (Part 2),"'There are several different types of boils:' Furuncle or carbuncle: This is an abscess in the skin usually caused by and infection with the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. A furuncle can have one or more openings onto the skin and may be associated with a fever or chills. The term furuncle is used to refer to a typical boil that occurs within a hair follicle. The term carbuncle is typically used to represent a larger abscess that involves a group of hair follicles and involves a larger area than a furuncle. A carbuncle can form a hardened lump that can be felt in the skin. The condition of having chronic, recurrent boils (furuncles or carbuncles) is referred to as furunculosis or carbunculosis, respectively."
What is a boil? What are boil symptoms and signs? (Part 3)," Cystic acne: This is a type of abscess that is formed when oil ducts become clogged and infected. Cystic acne affects deeper skin tissue than the more superficial inflammation from common acne. Cystic acne is most common on the face and typically occurs in the teenage years. Hidradenitis suppurativa: This is a condition in which there are multiple abscesses that form under the armpits and often in the groin area. These areas are a result of local inflammation of the sweat glands. This form of skin infection is difficult to treat with antibiotics alone and typically requires a surgical procedure to remove the involved sweat glands in order to stop the skin inflammation. Pilonidal cyst: This is a unique kind of abscess that occurs in the crease of the buttocks. Pilonidal cysts often begin as tiny areas of infection in the base of the area of skin from which hair grows (the hair follicle). With irritation from direct pressure, over time the inflamed area enlarges to become a firm, painful, and tender nodule that makes it difficult to sit without discomfort. These abscesses frequently form after long trips that involve prolonged sitting."
What causes boils to form?,"'There are many causes of boils. Some boils can be caused by an ''ingrown hair''. Others can form as the result of a splinter or other foreign material that has become lodged in the skin. Others boil, such as those of ''acne'', are caused by plugged sweat glands that become infected. Often the exact cause of a boil cannot be determined.''The skin is an essential part of our immune defense against materials and microbes that are foreign to our body. Any break in the skin, such as a cut or scrape, can develop into an abscess should it become infected with bacteria.' "
Boil vs. pimple,"'A ''pimple'' is a type of skin condition that can appear similar to a boil. ''Pimples'' are most commonly seen in people with ''acne'' of the face, back, or chest. ''Pimples'' may at times be filled with pus (like a boil) in addition to dead skin cells and oily secretions. Like boils, pimples start in pores that are openings for hair follicles in the skin. A boil is typically reddened and causes more ''pain'' than a pimple. Some pimples and boils may be indistinguishable, and these two conditions arise from a similar inflammatory process occurring in the hair follicles, with boils being more severe and representing true infections.' "
Are boils contagious?,"'The bacteria present inside the boil can be contagious to others, especially if there is direct skin-to-skin contact with the secretions from an open boil. (See the section on ''prevention'' for tips on how to prevent the spread of infection from a boil.)' "
What are risk factors for boils?,"""Anyone can develop a boil. However, people with certain illnesses or who take certain medications that weaken the body's immune system (the natural defense system against foreign materials or microbes) are more likely to develop boils. Diseases that are associated with impaired immune systems include ""'diabetes'' and ''kidney failure''. Diseases in which there is inadequate antibody production (such as hypogammaglobulinemia) can also increase the risk of developing boils.''Many medications can suppress the normal immune system and increase the risk of developing boils and other infections. These medications include cortisone medications (''prednisone'' [''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred''] and ''prednisolone'' [''Pediapred'' Oral Liquid, ''Medrol'']) and medications used for ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy''.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose boils?,"'The diagnosis of a boil can be made by observation of the typical signs and symptoms. Blood tests or specialized laboratory tests are not required to make the diagnosis of a boil. If the infection within a boil has spread to deeper tissues or is extensive, cultures of the pus may be taken from the ''wound'' area to identify the precise type of bacteria responsible for the infection. This can guide the choice of antibiotics for treatment.' "
What are boil treatments and home remedies?,"'Home treatment is an option for most simple boils. Ideally, treatment should begin as soon as a boil is noticed since early treatment may prevent later complications.''The primary home remedy for most boils is heat application, usually with hot or warm water soaks or warm compresses. It may be necessary to apply them 20 minutes at a time for three to four times daily. Heat application increases the circulation to the area and allows the body to better fight off the infection by bringing antibodies and white blood cells to the site of infection.''If a boil occurs as a result of shaving, it is recommended to avoid shaving in that area until the boil has healed to avoid spread of bacteria.''As long as the boil is small and firm, opening the area and draining the boil is not helpful, even if the area is painful. However, once the boil becomes soft or ""forms a head"" (that is, a small ''pustule'' or area of pus is noted in the boil), it can be ready to drain (lance). Once drained, ''pain'' relief can be dramatic. Most small boils, such as those that form around hairs, drain on their own with hot soaks. On occasion, and especially with larger boils, medical treatment is required. In this situation, the boil will need to be drained or ""lanced"" by a health care professional. Frequently, these larger boils contain several pockets of pus that must be opened and drained.''Over-the-counter'' antibiotics are often used to eliminate any accompanying bacterial infection, especially if there is an infection of the surrounding skin. However, antibiotics are not needed in every situation. In fact, antibiotics have difficulty penetrating the outer wall of an abscess well and often will not cure an abscess without additional surgical drainage.''When an antibiotic is used, the choice depends upon the type of infection that is present as well as the results of tests to identify the precise bacteria that infect the area. Examples of ''drugs'' that have been used in the treatment of boils include topical preparations of ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin'' and others), ''mupirocin'' (Bactroban), and ''cephalexin'' (''Keflex'').'  "
When should someone seek medical attention for a boil?,"'While boils typically resolve on their own and have an excellent prognosis, there are special situations in which medical care should be sought when boils develop. Rarely, boils may spread or persist, leading to more widespread infections.''Any boil or abscess in a patient with ''diabetes'' or a patient with an underlying disease that can be associated with a weakened immune system (such as ''cancer'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'"", etc.) should be evaluated by a health care professional. Additionally, many medicines, especially prednisone, that suppress the immune system (the natural infection-fighting system of the body) can complicate what would be an otherwise simple boil. Those who are taking such medications should consult their health care professional if they develop boils. (If someone is not sure about his or her medications' effects on the immune system, a pharmacist may be able to explain which medicines to be concerned about.)""'Any boil that is associated with a fever should receive medical attention. Increasing reddening of the nearby skin and/or formation of ''red streaks on the skin'' (signs that the infection may be spreading), the failure of a boil to ""form a head,"" and the development of multiple boils are other symptoms that warrant a visit to a health care professional. Medical attention is also required for boils in an infant. Boils located on the face, spine, groin, or in the rectum may also require medical attention.''A ""''pilonidal cyst'',"" a boil that occurs between the buttocks, is a special case. These almost always require medical treatment, including drainage and packing (putting gauze in the opened abscess to assure it continues to drain). Finally, any painful boil that is not rapidly improving should be seen by a health care professional.' "
What is the prognosis (outcome) for a boil?,'The majority of boils in healthy people resolve on their own with home care (described above) without forming a ''scar''. The prognosis is also excellent for boils that are treated in the health care setting by opening or lancing. Antibiotics may or may not be required after a boil has been lanced by a health care professional. Complications of a boil are rare and are more likely to occur in people with suppressed immune systems.' 
What kinds of health care specialists treat boils?,"'Many boils resolve without specific treatment, but a dermatologist is a doctor commonly consulted for management of a boil. Other health care specialists who may treat boils include a primary care doctor, which may be a family practitioner, pediatrician, or internal-medicine doctors. With severe boils or spreading infection, an infectious-disease specialist or surgeon may be consulted. Emergency-medicine doctors may treat certain cases of severe infection caused by boils or abscesses.' "
What are complications of boils?,"'Complications of boils include formation of a larger abscess, a worsening or spreading of infection to adjacent areas of skin or soft tissue (''cellulitis''), and very rarely, spread of the infection through the bloodstream to sites elsewhere in the body. Sometimes a boil may be caused by an organism typically associated with more serious infections, such as methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus'' aureus'' (''MRSA''), with a risk of spreading this infection to deeper tissues. Recurrence of the infection is another possible complication, which is more likely in certain types of boils. Recurrence is most common in the disease ''hidradenitis suppurativa'' and may also occur in situations in which the cause of the boil or abscess is persistent, such as the clogging of oil ducts seen in cystic acne.'  "
What can people do to prevent boils (abscesses)?,"'There are some measures that people can take to prevent boils from forming, although boils are not completely preventable. Good hygiene and the regular use of antibacterial soaps can help to prevent bacteria from building up on the skin. This can reduce the chance for the hair follicles to become infected and prevent the formation of boils. In some situations, a health care professional may recommend special cleansers such as pHisoderm to even further reduce the bacteria on the skin. When the hair follicles on the back of the arms or around the thighs are continually inflamed, regular use of an abrasive brush (loofah brush) in the shower can be used to help break up oil plugs and buildup around hair follicles.''Pilonidal cysts can be prevented by avoiding continuous direct pressure or irritation of the buttock area when a local hair follicle becomes inflamed. At that point, regular soap and hot water cleaning and drying can be helpful.''For acne and hidradenitis suppurativa (see above), topical or oral antibiotics may be required on a long-term basis to prevent recurrent abscess formation. As mentioned above, surgical resection of sweat glands in the involved skin may be necessary. Other medications, such as ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane), can be used for cystic acne and have been helpful in some patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. Recurrences are common in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa.''Finally, surgery may occasionally be needed, especially for pilonidal cysts that recur but also for hidradenitis suppurativa. For pilonidal cysts, surgically removing the outer shell of the ''cyst'' is important to clear the boil. The procedure is typically performed in the operating room. For hidradenitis suppurativa, extensive involvement can require surgical repair by a ''plastic'' surgeon.' "
What is a boil?,'A ''boil'' is a bacterial ''skin infection'' of a ''hair follicle''. ''Boils'' contain pus. ''Boils'' are usually caused by staphylococcal bacteria. ''Boils'' are also known as furuncles.' 
Are boils contagious?,"'There is some controversy about ''boils'' being ''contagious''. Some experts say the boils themselves are not ''contagious'"" because they can occur from bacteria normally found on the skin. Others, however, say that boils are contagious because it is possible for person-to-person transfer of bacteria if a person's infected boils touch the skin of another person, who then may also develop boils."" "
What is the incubation period for boils?,"'Although the most common range of the incubation period for staphylococci is about four to 10 days, boils caused by these bacteria that are normally found on the skin are considered to have a variable incubation period.' "
How will I know if I have boils?,"'A ''boil'' begins when the skin turns red and tender in the area of the infection. After about four to seven days, the tender lump often starts to turn the skin whitish as pus collects under the skin. Some boils may spontaneously burst and leak out pus. Others may expand to form an ''abscess''.' "
How do boils spread?,"'It is possible for boils to spread to another person if bacteria from the initially infected person contact the skin of another person who is susceptible to the infecting bacteria. However, a boil can spread in the skin of an infected individual to become an ''abscess'' or develop into a clump of boils (carbuncle). Severe infections can lead to ''fever'', ''lymph node'' swelling, and more severe complications of infection, such as ''sepsis''.' "
When will I know if I am cured of boils?,"'Boils can be cured once the pus drains out of the boil and the infecting bacteria are eliminated. When this occurs, the symptoms of skin redness, swelling, and ''pain'' resolve after a few days. Some smaller boils that are not deep in the skin may spontaneously drain while others may require a physician to incise the boil so that pus can drain out. Both topical antibiotics and occasionally oral antibiotics are given to eradicate infecting bacteria. Large boils may require gauze packing to help facilitate ''pus drainage''. The gauze is usually removed in one or two days.' "
When should I contact the medical caregiver about boils?,"'Individuals should seek medical care for boils if they start ''running'' a ''fever'', have severe ''pain'"" at the site of the boil, the boil doesn't drain, if other boils begin to appear, or if a red streak extends from a boil. Individuals with ""'heart murmurs'', immune system ''depression'', ''diabetes'', or those who are taking medicines that alter the immune system should contact their physician urgently if they develop a boil.' "
What is bone cancer? What is metastatic bone cancer?,"'Bone cancer'' is a ''malignant tumor'' that arises from the cells that make up the bones of the body. This is also known as primary bone ''cancer''. Primary bone tumors are tumors that arise in the bone tissue itself, and they may be benign or ''malignant'' (bone ''cancer''). Benign (non-cancerous) tumors in the bones are more common than bone ''cancers''.''When ''cancer'' is detected in bones, it either originated in the bones (as in primary bone cancer) or has spread to the bone after originating elsewhere (a ''metastasis'' or secondary cancer that spread to the bones). In fact, when cancer is detected in bone, it most often is a metastasis that has started in another organ or part of the body and then spread to the bones. This cancer that has metastasized to the bone is named for the site where the original cancer began (for example, metastatic ''prostate cancer'' that has spread to the bone). Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are among the types of cancers that commonly spread to the bone in their advanced stages. Less commonly, cancer can begin within the bone as primary cancer of the bone, and this is true bone cancer. Primary and metastatic secondary bone cancers are often treated differently and have a different prognosis.''There are other cancers that may begin in the bone even though they are not considered to be true bone cancers. ''Lymphoma'' is a cancer of the cells that are responsible for the immune response of the body. Lymphoma usually begins in the ''lymph nodes'', but it sometimes begins in the bone marrow. ''Multiple myeloma'' is another cancer of the immune cells that typically begins in the bone marrow. These tumors are not considered primary bone cancers because they do not arise from the actual bone cells.''This article focuses on primary bone cancer, which is cancer of the bone cells themselves.' "
What are bone cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Pain'' is the most common symptom of bone cancer. The bone ''pain'' may initially develop at certain times of the day, often at night, or with physical activity. The pain tends to progress and worsen over time. Sometimes, the pain may be present for years before the affected person seeks treatment. Sometimes bone cancer is detected incidentally when ''X-rays'' or imaging studies are performed for another reason. Occasionally, a mass, swelling, or lump is felt around the area of a bone cancer. Bone ''fractures'' can also occur at the site of bone cancer because the underlying bone structure has weakened. Less commonly symptoms are caused by compression or disruption of nerves and blood vessels in the affected area. These symptoms can include numbness, tingling, tenderness, or a decrease in blood flow beyond the site of the ''tumor'', causing a ''cold'' hand or foot with weak or absent pulses.'

What are the different types of bone cancer?,"'There are several different types of bone cancer, and they are often treated differently. Knowing the precise type of bone cancer is essential for developing an optimal treatment plan. Some of the most common types of bone cancer are as follows.''Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer. Osteosarcoma occurs most commonly in older children, teenagers, and young adults (10-19 years of age), and it is more common in males. The cancerous tissue in osteosarcoma in young people tends to develop at the ends of long bones in areas of active bone growth, often around the knee, either at the end of the thighbone (femur) or the shinbone (tibia) near the knee. The next most common location for bone cancer is in the bone of the arm (humerus). Nevertheless, it is possible for an osteosarcoma to develop in any bone. Depending on the appearance of the tumor cells under the microscope, there are also several different subtypes of osteosarcoma.''Chondrosarcoma is the second most common bone cancer. It arises from cartilage cells that are attached to or cover bone. It is more common in people older than 40 years of age, and less than 5% of these cancers occur in people under 20 years of age. It may either grow rapidly and aggressively or grow slowly. Chondrosarcoma is most commonly found in the bones of the hips and pelvis.''Ewing sarcoma, sometimes referred to as the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFTs), is an aggressive form of bone cancer that is most common in children 4-15 years of age. It can occur either in the bones or in the soft tissues and is believed to arise from primitive nerve tissue. ESFTs are more common in males than in females. The most common location for Ewing sarcoma is the middle portion of the long bones of the arms and legs.''Pleomorphic sarcoma is a cancer formerly referred to as malignant fibrous histiocytoma or MFH. This term is still used frequently. Pleomorphic sarcomas are typically not cancers of bone but of soft tissues. However, they may arise in the bone in up to 5% of cases. Pleomorphic sarcomas typically occur in adults and can be found anywhere in the body.''Fibrosarcoma is an uncommon type of bone cancer. It is most commonly arises behind the knee in adults.''Chordoma is a very rare cancer usually seen in people over 30 years of age. It is most commonly located in either the lower or upper ends of the spinal column.'

What kinds of bone cancer occur in children?,"'Osteosarcoma, the most common type of bone cancer, is most common in older children, teenagers, and young adults. Ewing sarcoma and ESFT are bone cancers that typically affect children.'  "
What causes bone cancer?,"'As with other cancers, there is no one cause of bone cancer. In general, cancers arise when normal cell growth and proliferation is disrupted, allowing abnormal cells (cancer cells) to divide and grow uncontrollably. A number of hereditary and environmental factors are likely involved in the development of bone cancers.'

  "
What are risk factors for bone cancer?,"'About 2,300 cases of bone cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. Primary bone cancers are not common and account for far less than 1% of all cancers. Bone cancers are more common in children and younger adults than in older people. Cancer found in the bones of an older adult usually has spread to the bone after originating from another location in the body.''Risk factors for bone cancers include the following:' Previous treatment with radiation therapy Previous chemotherapy with drugs known as alkylating agents Mutation in a gene known as the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene or other genes Associated conditions, such as hereditary retinoblastoma, Paget's disease of bone, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia Implantation of metal to repair previous fractures"
What tests are used to diagnose bone cancer?,"'A variety of imaging tests may be used to detect bone tumors, including bone cancers. Very early bone cancers may or may not be apparent on plain X-rays. ''CT scans'' and ''MRI'' scans are more precise in defining the location of bone cancers.''A ''bone scan'' is a test that uses radioactive material to produce images of the entire skeleton. This may allow the localization of bone cancer anywhere in the body. This test is not specific for bone cancers and can also reveal areas of inflammation as found with ''arthritis'', fractures, and infections.''While many bone cancers have a characteristic appearance on imaging studies, a biopsy (tissue sample) must be taken in order to precisely determine what kind of cancer is present and confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy is a procedure to acquire a sample of a piece of the tumor that is examined under a microscope. The tissue sample may be obtained with a needle inserted through the skin into the tumor or with a surgical operation.''At present, there are no screening tests available to detect early bone cancers.'  "
What is the treatment for bone cancer?,"'An operation to remove the cancer is the mainstay of treatment for bone cancers. Surgical techniques can remove most bone cancers without requiring amputation of the affected limb. In some cases, amputation may be avoided with limb-sparing surgery. Sometimes, muscles and other tissues that surround the cancer also have to be removed. Reconstructive surgery may be needed, in addition to cancer resection, to help maximize function of the limb.''Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and other bone cancers may require chemotherapy in addition to surgery.''Radiation'' therapy is the typical treatment for chondrosarcoma.'""Ewing sarcomas that do not respond well to high-dose chemotherapy may require radiation therapy and even a stem-cell transplant. In this procedure, the patient's ""'stem cells'' (blood cells that have the potential to develop into all the different kinds of blood cells) are harvested from the bloodstream. After high doses of chemotherapy medications to destroy the bone marrow, the harvested stem cells are next returned to the body, as with a ''blood transfusion''. Over the next three to four weeks, the stem cells produce new blood cells from the bone marrow.''Targeted therapies are specially designed treatments that aim treatment specifically at the cancer cells. For example, denosumab (Xgeva) is a monoclonal antibody that acts to block the activity of specialized bone cells called osteoclasts. This medication has been used in the treatment of giant cell tumors of bone that have recurred after surgery or cannot be removed by surgery. ''Imatinib'' (''Gleevec'') is a targeted therapy drug that can block the signals from certain mutated genes that cause tumor cells to grow. Imatinib has been used to treat some chordomas that have spread or recurred after treatment.''Clinical trials'' are another type of treatment for bone cancers. In clinical trials, doctors test promising new medications, combinations of medications, or procedures. Clinical trials are carefully controlled research studies. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be interested in participating in a clinical trial.'

What specialists treat bone cancer?,'Bone cancer is typically managed by surgical oncologists or orthopedic oncologists (for surgical removal of the tumor) and medical oncologists (for administration or chemotherapy). Radiation oncologists are involved in the treatment team if radiation therapy is planned. Palliative care physicians may be involved to manage pain and symptoms.' 
Are there any treatments or medications that relieve bone cancer pain?,"'Analgesics (pain-relieving medications) treat the pain of bone cancer. These may be nonprescription or prescription medications. Mild-to-moderate pain is treated with medications such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs''), including ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') and ''naproxen'' (''Naprelan'', ''Aleve'', ''Naprosyn'', ''Anaprox''). However, people taking anticancer chemotherapy drugs sometimes must avoid NSAIDs because of increased risk of bleeding.''Prescription medications are used for moderate-to-severe ''cancer pain''. Opioids -- stronger narcotic pain medications -- like ''codeine'', morphine, ''oxycodone'', hydromorphone, and ''fentanyl'' may be required to control severe pain. Sometimes a combination of medications is used to treat cancer pain. Opioid medications can be associated with side effects like drowsiness, ''constipation'', and ''nausea''.' "
What is the prognosis for bone cancer? What is the five-year survival rate for bone cancer?,"'The prognosis, or outlook, for survival for bone cancer patients depends upon the particular type of cancer and the extent to which it has spread. The overall five-year survival rate for all bone cancers in adults and children is about 70%. Chondrosarcomas in adults have an overall five-year survival rate of about 80%.''The five-year survival rate specifically for localized osteosarcomas is about 60%-80%. If the cancer has spread beyond bone, the survival rate is about 15%-30%. Osteosarcomas tend to have a more favorable prognosis if they are located in an arm or leg, respond well to chemotherapy, and are generally completely removed at surgery. Younger patients and females also tend to have a more favorable prognosis than males or older patients.''Ewing sarcomas have a five-year survival rate of about 70% when they are found in a localized stage. If they have spread outside of the bone, the survival rate drops to 15%-30%. Factors that are associated with a more favorable prognosis for Ewing sarcomas include smaller tumor size, age less than 10 years, having the cancer in an arm or leg (instead of in the pelvis or chest wall), and having a good response to chemotherapy drugs.'  "
Is it possible to prevent bone cancer?,"'Since the exact cause of bone cancer is poorly understood, there are no lifestyle changes or habits that can prevent these uncommon cancers.' "
What is osteoporosis?,"'Osteoporosis is a medical condition that is characterized by bones that are less dense than, and thus not as strong as, normal bone. Osteoporosis increases the risk of breaking a bone (fracture) with even minor ''trauma'', such as a fall from standing height, or even from a ''cough'' or sneeze. Unfortunately, people often do not realize they have osteoporosis until either they have a fracture or have a screening test ordered by their doctor to check for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis and low bone mass affect an estimated 44 million Americans. Of those, 10 million have osteoporosis, and the remaining 34 million have a lower than normal bone mass (medically termed ''osteopenia'') and are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis. Women are four times more likely to develop osteoporosis than men. Other health risk factors include older age, family history of osteoporosis, small and thin stature, inactive lifestyle, ''smoking'', ''alcohol'', and use of certain medications, including steroids.' "
How does osteoporosis occur?,"'In order to understand the role of bone mineral density scanning, it is important to know about how osteoporosis occurs. Bone is a living tissue and is constantly being remodeled. This is the natural, healthy state of continuous uptake of old bone (resorption) followed by the deposit of new bone. This turnover is important in keeping bones healthy and in repairing any minor damage that may occur with wear and tear. The cells that lay new bone down are called osteoblasts, and the cells responsible for resorption of old bone are called osteoclasts. Osteoporosis occurs as a result of a mismatch between osteoclast and osteoblast activity. This mismatch can be caused by many different disease states or hormonal changes. It is also commonly a result of ''aging'', change in normal hormones as occurs after ''menopause'', and with diets low in calcium and ''vitamin D''. In osteoporosis, osteoclasts outperform osteoblasts so that more bone is taken up than is laid down. The result is a thinning of the bone with an accompanying loss in bone strength and a greater risk of fracture. A thinning bone results in a lower bone density or bone mass.''There are two major types of bone. Cancellous bone (also known as trabecular bone) is the inner, softer portion of the bone, and cortical bone is the outer, harder layer of bone. Cancellous bone undergoes turnover at a faster rate than cortical bone. As a result, if osteoclast and osteoblast activity become mismatched, cancellous bone is affected more rapidly than cortical bone. Certain areas in the body have a higher ratio of cancellous bone to cortical bone such as the spine (vertebrae), the wrist (distal radius), and the hips (femoral neck).'""Most of a person's bone mass is achieved by early adulthood. After that time, the bone mass gradually declines throughout the rest of a person's life. There is a normal rate of decline in bone mass with age in both men and women. For women, in addition to age, the ""'menopause transition'' itself causes an extra degree of bone loss. This bone loss is greatest in the first three to six years after ''menopause''. Women can lose up to 20% of the total bone mass during this time. Since women generally have a lower bone mass to begin with in comparison with men, the ultimate result is a higher risk of fracture in postmenopausal women as compared to men of the same age. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that men may also be at risk for osteoporosis, especially if they have certain illnesses, a ''low testosterone'' level, are ''smokers'', take certain medications, or are sedentary. The best method to prevent osteoporosis is to achieve as high a bone mass by early adulthood with a proper ''diet'' and regular ''exercise'"". Unfortunately, osteoporosis is not often considered during this time in a person's life."" "
What is bone mineral density (BMD)?,"'The absolute amount of bone as measured by bone mineral density (BMD) testing generally correlates with bone strength and its ability to bear weight. The BMD is measured with a dual energy low-dose X-ray absorptiometry test (referred to as a DXA scan). By measuring BMD, it is possible to predict fracture risk in the same manner that measuring blood pressure can help predict the risk of ''stroke''.''It is important to remember that BMD testing cannot predict the certainty of developing a fracture. It can only predict risk. It is also important to note that a bone density scan, or test, should not be confused with a ''bone scan'', which is a nuclear medicine test in which a radioactive tracer is injected that is used to detect tumors, ''cancer'', ''fractures'', and infections in the bone.'""The World Health Organization has developed definitions for low bone mass (osteopenia) and osteoporosis. These definitions are based on a T-score. The T-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to a normal, healthy 30-year-old adult.""'Normal'': A bone BMD is considered normal if the T-score is within 1 standard deviation of the normal young adult value. Thus a T-score between 0 and -1 is considered a normal result. A T-score below -1 is considered an abnormal result.''Low bone mass (medically termed osteopenia)'': A BMD defines osteopenia as a T-score between -1 and -2.5. This signifies an increased fracture risk but does not meet the criteria for osteoporosis.''Osteoporosis'': A BMD more than 2.5 standard deviations from the normal (T score less than or equal to -2.5) defines osteoporosis.''Based on the above medical criteria, it is estimated that 40% of all postmenopausal Caucasian women have osteopenia and that an additional 7% have osteoporosis.' "
Who invented the bone density scan?,"'The bone density scan was invented by the late John R. Cameron (1922-2005), professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He earned a PhD in physics. He invented bone densitometry in the late 1960s. Bone densitometry, which uses precise, very small ''radiation'' measurements to determine the mineral content of bone, was one of his many important contributions to medical physics.' "
Who performs bone density scans?,"'Bone density scans, or DXA scans, are performed by a trained technician using a DXA machine. The results are then interpreted by a physician. Many different specialist interpret bone density scans, including radiologists, endocrinologists, ''rheumatologists'', gynecologists, and internists.' "
Where is a bone density test done?,"""Bone density tests can be done in a physician's office or in a radiology center in or out of the hospital where other tests such as mammograms, ""'CT scans'', and ''X-rays'' are performed.' "
What information is on a DXA report?,"'There is some variation in DXA reports depending on the facility performing the test. All reports should include the following:' The date of the test, location, and medical equipment used for the test (manufacturer and model of the densitometer) The reason the test was performed The overall diagnosis (normal bone density, osteopenia, or osteoporosis) based on the results of the scan It should mention the results of the test at each site tested. The hip and lumbar spine are always tested. Many medical facilities also measure bone density at the forearm. The bone density is usually reported with three different numbers. First, the actual bone density is reported. This is measured in grams per centimeter squared (g/cm2). Because the exact bone density varies based on the manufacturer and model of the densitometer, the bone density is also reported as a T-score and a Z-score. The T-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to a normal, healthy 30-year-old adult. The Z-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to the average person of the same age and gender. Comparison of the bone density to any prior tests performed at the same medical facility Many reports include a calculation estimate of the patient's risk of bone fracture based on the results of the bone density scan. This is reported as the risk over the following 10 years of breaking a bone. Some reports also include a vertebral fracture assessment, which uses the DXA to see if there are any bones in the spine that have already fractured. A notation suggesting how long before a follow-up test is needed"
Why is bone mineral density measurement important?,"""Determining a person's BMD helps a health care professional decide if a person is at increased risk for osteoporosis-related fracture. The purpose of BMD testing is to help predict the risk of future fracture so that the treatment program can be optimized. The information from a BMD is used to aid a decision as to whether nonprescription and/or prescription medicine therapy is needed to help reduce the risk of fracture. Additionally, if a patient has a fracture or is planning orthopedic surgery, a diagnosis of osteoporosis might affect the surgical plan. A fracture that could potentially heal in a cast with normal bone mass might require either a longer period of casting or even surgery if the patient has osteoporosis. Sometimes spinal surgeons treat patients with low bone density with bone building medication prior to surgery in order to improve the surgical outcome of bone that is operated on."" "
What is the relationship between BMD and fracture risk?,"'In patients with low bone mass at the hip or the spine (the two areas traditionally measured with DXA [formerly referred to as DEXA] scanning), there is a two- to threefold increase in the incidence of any osteoporotic fracture. In other words, low bone density at the measured areas of the spine and hip can even predict future osteoporotic fractures at other parts of the body besides the spine and hip. In subjects with a BMD in the osteoporosis range, there is approximately a five times increase in the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures.' "
Who should have BMD testing?,"'BMD testing is recommended for all women over the age of 65. Additionally, postmenopausal women under 65 years who have risk factors for osteoporosis other than ''menopause'' (these include a previous history of fractures, low body weight, ''cigarette smoking'', and a family history of fractures) should be tested. Finally, men or women with strong risk factors as listed below should discuss the benefit of DXA scanning with their health care professional to see if testing is indicated.''The following are potential risk factors for osteoporosis that might suggest the need for DXA scanning:' Personal history of fracture as an adult History of fracture in first-degree relative Low body weight or thin body stature Advanced age Current cigarette smoking Use of corticosteroid therapy for more than three months Impaired vision Estrogen deficiency at early age Dementia Poor health/frailty Recent falls Lifelong low calcium intake Low physical activity Alcohol intake of more than two drinks/day Thyroid disease Rheumatoid arthritis Excessive caffeine consumption Use of oral contraceptive (birth control pills)"
How is BMD measured?,"""Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, is the most common method to measure a patient's BMD. DXA, or densitometry, is relatively easy to perform and the amount of radiation exposure is low. A DXA scanner is a machine that produces two X-ray beams, each with different energy levels. One beam is high energy while the other is low energy. The amount of X-rays that pass through the bone is measured for each beam. This will vary depending on the thickness of the bone. Based on the difference between the two X-ray beams, the bone density can be measured. The radiation exposure from a DXA scan is actually much less than that from a traditional ""'chest X-ray''.''At present, DXA scanning gives information on the BMD two main areas, the hip and spine. Another bone that is often evaluated is the bone of the forearm. Although osteoporosis involves the whole body, measurements of BMD at one site can be predictive of fractures at other sites. Scanning generally takes 10 to 20 minutes to complete and is painless. The patient needs to be able to lie still on the table during the testing. There is no IV or other injection needed for this test. In preparation for a DXA, on the day of the test, you may eat a normal meal, but you should not take any ''calcium supplements'' for 24 hours prior to the test.''Certain conditions can alter the results of the DXA scan, making result less reliable. These include a lumbar spinal deformity (''scoliosis''), extensive ''degenerative arthritis'', a large amount of calcium in the blood vessels (''atherosclerosis''), or multiple fractures. These conditions can falsely elevate the measured BMD with the DXA scan.' "
What are other methods of measuring BMD?,"'There are small DXA scanners called peripheral DXA machines. These machines often measure BMD at the heel (calcaneus), shin bone (distal tibia), or kneecap (''patella''). Regular DXA machines have a standard reference (called NHANES III) that can be used for all machines, no matter the manufacturer. However, peripheral DXA machines do not yet have a uniform reference standard for the normal peak young adult bone mass that can apply to all machines and all manufacturers. This is necessary for peripheral DXA to be ready for more widespread use. Efforts are in progress to make the peripheral DXA technique more standardized. At present, it is best used as a screening test to consider whether or not a patient would benefit from further bone density testing.''Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) can be used to assess BMD. A standard CT scanner is used in this method. However, the amount of radiation exposure is higher than with DXA and the cost is greater. For these reasons, QCT is not in general clinical use.''Ultrasound'"" is a relatively new diagnostic tool to measure BMD. There is no radiation source with this procedure. An ultrasound beam is directed at the area being analyzed. The scattering and absorption of the waves allow for an assessment of bone density. The results are not as precise as with the other methods mentioned. This technique is relatively new, and there is considerable research being conducted in this area. Since ultrasounds can easily be performed in a physician's office, this method may become valuable for screening larger populations if its accuracy becomes more refined. If the BMD is low on the ultrasound test, you might be asked to have a DXA scan to confirm the results.""'New techniques that are being developed to measure both the BMD and even the quality of the bone are micro CT and MR, which use technologies related to CT and ''MRI'' scans. These are not yet available for clinical use.' "
How often should DXA scans be repeated to monitor treatment?,"'The frequency of monitoring osteoporosis treatment using DXA scans is highly controversial. Some health care professionals recommend DXA scanning at one- to two-year intervals to monitor changes in bone density during treatment. But recent scientific evidence questions the usefulness of such interval monitoring. Reasons why repeating bone density scans is extremely tricky include:' Bone density changes so slowly that the changes may be smaller than the measurement error of the machine. In other words, repeat DXA scans cannot distinguish between a ""real"" increase in bone density or a mere variation in measurement from the machine itself. Typically, BMD changes 1% per year, which is less than the error of a DXA machine (usually in the range of 3%). Changes of less than 2%-4% in the vertebrae and 3%-6% at the hip from test to test can be due to the precision error of the method. Whereas the real purpose of prescription osteoporosis treatment is to decrease future bone fractures, there is no good correlation between increases in bone density as measured by DXA with decreases in fracture risks with treatment. There are multiple examples of this in recent clinical studies. For example, the improvement in BMD only accounted for 4% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with raloxifene (Evista), 16% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with alendronate (Fosamax), and 18% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with risedronate (Actonel, Atelvia). Thus, improvement in BMD does not indicate the amount of the antifracture benefit of osteoporosis medication. Prescription medication may decrease a person's risk of fracture even when there is no apparent increase in BMD. Physicians and nonphysicians alike are often surprised to learn this information! Even if the DXA scan shows continued deterioration in bone density during treatment, no research data exists demonstrating that changing a medication, combining medications, or increasing medication doses will be safe and helpful in decreasing the future risk of fractures compared to just continuing the same medication. Even if a person's bone density deteriorates during treatment, it is quite likely that the person would have lost even more bone density without treatment. Recent research has shown that women who lose bone density after the first year of menopausal hormone therapy will gain bone density in the next two years, whereas women who gain in the first year will tend to lose density in the next two years of therapy. Therefore, bone density during treatment naturally fluctuates and may not be indicative of the fracture protection of the medication."
What is the cost of DXA?,"'The cost for DXA scanning varies depending on insurance policies and coverage. In general, a patient without health care coverage paying cash can expect to pay approximately $200-$300 U.S. for the procedure.' "
What about the accuracy of BMD testing in the doctor's office using smaller equipment?,"""There are several devices that are smaller than the standard DXA scanners that are being used in health care professional's offices to screen for low bone density. Very little scientific data is available about these smaller units. Most of the information comes directly from the equipment manufacturers themselves. Many of these models test peripheral bones in the ""'feet'' or hands. Other units use ''ultrasonography''. These techniques can be less accurate than BMD testing performed with state of the art equipment. Additionally, office-testing equipment can range dramatically in price and quality.''In general, these devices may be reasonable to measure overall fracture risk but are not useful in monitoring therapy. Their use might be limited to screening and results would require confirmation using DXA. In addition, expertise in using the equipment and interpreting the data can vary. At present, it is difficult to comment on these other methods of BMD testing. Interpretation of the results of these tests may be more difficult and not as reliable as the standard DXA scan. Some doctors use these as screening tools and recommend more formal DXA testing if they are abnormal.' "
Summary,"'Osteoporosis is a disease that results in a significant risk of fracture. The consequences of fracture can include hospitalization, immobility, a decrease in the quality of life, and even death.''From a larger perspective, it is a costly disease in terms of the health-care system and time lost from work. Early detection and therapy is the mainstay for trying to prevent these complications. BMD testing results correlate well with the risk of fracture, and the testing is easily performed in a time-efficient manner without any discomfort. Although many methods of BMD testing exist, the best currently is DXA scanning. It is imperative that testing ultimately be done using state-of-the-art equipment with capable highly trained personnel and a doctor well ''versed'' in interpreting the results.' "
What is a broken bone (fracture)?,"'Bones make up the skeleton of the body. They allow us the ability to interact with our environment and lift out body up against gravity. Bones are attachment points for muscles which allows us to run, jump, sit, kneel, grasp, and lift. Bones also protect organs from potential damage, and the bone marrow (tissue inside of bones) is responsible for blood cell production.'""Bones are the body's storage area for calcium. On a cellular level, calcium is always entering and exiting bone under the influence of the body's hormones. Parathyroid hormone increases calcium levels in the bloodstream, meaning, that it regulates it's release by bone and decreasing ""'bone density''. ''Calcitonin'' decreases blood calcium levels and helps restore calcium to bone. Calcium is needed in the blood stream to help muscle cells including the ''heart'' to function. Hormone levels will sacrifice calcium in bone to maintain blood calcium levels in a normal range. For that reason, calcium and ''Vitamin D'' are important to maintain calcium stores in the body.'  "
What causes a broken bone?,"'When a bone has an outside force exerted upon it, like a blow or a fall, there is potential that it cannot withstand the amount of force and it breaks. That loss of integrity results in a fracture. It is important to remember that a fracture, break, or ''crack'' all describe the same situation, an injury to the bone where it has been damaged. One term is not more serious than another. Fracture, break, and crack all mean the same thing.''Depending upon the situation, the amount of force required may not be very great. People with ''osteoporosis'', the bones lack calcium and are brittle, a minor injury or even gravity may create enough of a force to cause a vertebral compression fracture of the back or a ''hip fracture''.'

What are the most 	common types of broken bones?,"'Fractures are usually described by their location, how the bones are aligned, whether there are associated complications with blood and nerve function, and whether the skin is intact at the injury site.''The terms and definitions used in medicine to describe fractures allow health care professionals to describe exactly where in the bone the fracture is located. For a reference point, the heart is considered the center of the body and the anatomic descriptions are based on their location in reference to the heart. When describing a location on or in the body, imagine standing straight up, looking forward with the arms slightly away from your side, and the palms turned forward.''Common anatomic terms used to describe fractures include the following:''By thinking of the body in the anatomic position, fractures can be described by their location in the bone and how the parts are aligned and related to each other. Fractures are either displaced or non-displaced, meaning that they are adequately aligned or not. Some physicians suggest that all fractures have some displacement and prefer the term ""minimally displaced.""''The description of the fracture also includes the direction it takes within the bones.''Special terms:''Fractures are classified as open (if the skin is damaged) or closed (if the skin is intact). An open fracture may require an orthopedic surgeon to wash out the fracture site to prevent ''osteomyelitis'' (bone infection). Depending upon circumstances, the type of fracture, the amount of contamination to the skin and ''wound'"", and the person's condition, this procedure may take place in the operating room."" Proximal (closer to the center of the body) and Distal (further from the center): the elbow is proximal to the wrist and the wrist is distal to the elbow. Anterior (toward the front of the body) and Posterior (toward the back): The chest is anterior to the back and the back is posterior to the chest. Medial (toward the middle of the body) and Lateral (to the outer edge of the body): The ears are lateral to the nose and the nose is medial to the ears. Transverse: the fracture travels across the bone Oblique: the fracture occurs at an angle Spiral: –the fracture spirals or extends down the length of the bone Comminuted: the fracture has more than two parts, multiple fragments are present. Greenstick: In young children, the bones are not yet solid and when force is applied, it tends to bow and not break completely through. The term comes from a similar situation when trying to break a young branch off a tree. Torus: In children, when only one part of a bone buckles it is called a torus or incomplete fracture. Open fracture: An open fracture describes the situation where the bone penetrates through the skin. The skin is very important in protecting the inside of the body from infection. If the skin overlying a broken bone is damaged, whether it is cut, torn or scraped, there is potential for bacteria from the outside world to invade the broken bone and cause an infection."
Compression fracture,"'The spine is comprised of 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 ''lumbar vertebrae''. The spine holds the body erect against gravity and to protect the spinal cord. Compression fractures can be caused by ''osteoporosis'', injury, or ''trauma''.' People with osteoporosis lose calcium from the 
bones, and the vertebrae may become weak and unable to hold up against the forces of 
gravity, so they gradually compress over time. A compression fracture due to an injury may or may not 
					have spinal cord or nerve root irritation because of the 
					fracture. A compression fracture due to trauma most likely occurs 
					from a motor vehicle crash or fall from height."
Skull fracture,"'The purpose of the skull is to protect the brain. It is a flat bone and it takes a significant direct blow to cause a fracture. Because the main concern is an injury to the brain and not the skull injury , plain ''X-rays'' are not routinely performed to look for a skull fracture. Instead ''CT scan'' of the brain is recommended if there is concern about a ''brain injury''. Skull fractures are often associated with localized swelling and bleeding at the site of injury.''Basilar skull fractures'' describe damage to bone at the base of the brain. Physical findings may include bloody drainage from the ear or nose, ''bruising'"" behind the ear (Battle's sign), and ""'bruising'' around the eyes (Raccoon eyes).''With a ''depressed'' skull fracture,'' the bone is broken and fragments are pushed inward. Depending upon depth of the bony ''depression'' and whether there is brain tissue involvement, surgery may be required.''With an ''open skull fracture,'' the ''scalp'' is lacerated and the wound may connect with the fibrous coverings of the brain (meninges). Surgery is often performed to help prevent infection.' "
Stress fracture,"'Stress'' fractures are the result of multiple microtraumas where the bone cannot tolerate and absorb repeated stresses placed upon it. It is an overuse injury and is often seen in the lower leg especially with runners and other athletes. If untreated, and if the person continues to participate in offending activity, the ''stress'' fracture may progress to a completed fracture. These are most often seen in athletes who participate in ''running'', tennis, basketball, and other sports that involve running and jumping on hard surfaces.''March fracture is the name given to a ''stress fracture'' of the ''metatarsal'' bone of the foot. They are described in soldiers who are forced to walk or ""march"" for prolonged distances.' "
"What are the most 
	common bones that are broken?","'The most common fractures involve the clavicle (collarbone), the forearm (radius and ulna), the wrist, the ankle and the hip. Closed fractures are more common than open fractures (the skin overlying the injury is intact and not damaged).''In children, a fracture of the distal radius is most common. The break occurs in the radius near the wrist but usually does not involve the joint itself. ''1' "
Broken hand or fingers,"'Injuries to the hands and fingers are very common because they are exposed in daily activities. In addition to the bones, the health care professional will be interested in making certain there are no tendon or nerve injuries associated with any broken bone(s). Because the anatomy of the hand is so complex, complicated fractures may be referred to an orthopedic or ''plastic'' hand specialist. Many of them will only require splinting or casting, but occasionally surgery will be necessary.' "
Broken wrist,"'Falling on an outstretched hand is the most common reason for a wrist fracture. It is often the distal radius (see illustration) that is damaged, and the fracture may involve more than one bone. Aside from the radius, wrist fractures may also include fractures of the carpal bones of the wrist (carpus), those that connect the radius to the long bones of the hand (''metacarpals''). Doctors often look for fractures of the scaphoid bone (the bone between the bottom of the thumb and the top of the radius), and dislocations of the lunate (the bone next to the scaphoid bone) that may be difficult to see on plain X-ray.''In some cases, the wrist is splinted even if X-rays are normal because upon physical examination the doctor may be concerned about a potential occult or hidden fracture (the fracture is so small that it does not show up on an X-ray). '""Depending upon the bone that is injured and it's alignment, surgery may or may not be required. Regardless of the treatment, the goal is to have a normally aligned wrist, especially if the fracture involves the joint surface. Poor alignment may lead to ""'arthritis'' in the future.' "
Broken hip,"'Hip fractures are perhaps the most common fracture seen in people 75 years of age or older. While falls and trauma may be the obvious cause, many times, people are more susceptible to hip fracture because of ''osteoporosis'' and sometimes the hip will break spontaneously.''The hip joint is made up of the interconnection of two bones in a ball and socket: 1) the socket in the pelvis (acetabulum), and 2) the ball (femoral head). Hip fractures refer to the femur fracture.''Almost all hip fractures require surgery and the type of surgery depends upon where in the femur that the fracture is located.' "
Broken leg,"'Each of the many bones of the lower extremity is at risk for fracture. Leg fractures also may involve the ''knee joint'', and treatment depends upon the type of fracture. Similarly, fractures of the lower leg (tibia and fibula) and talus (the most proximal bone in the foot) may involve the ankle joint. ''Fractures and dislocations of the foot may be as complex as the hand. Because of the anatomy, they may also be more difficult to diagnosis on plain X-rays. ' "
Broken toe,'Broken toes are a common fracture and may be diagnosed by history and physical examination. X-rays may or may not be needed depending upon the clinical situation.' 
Broken shoulder,"'The clavicle (collarbone) fracture is one of the most commonly seen broken bones, fracture of the humeral head (the ball) is quite common an older person who falls. ''Depending upon the amount of comminution (into how many pieces the humeral head breaks) surgery may or may not be required. Initial treatment usually begins with a sling.''The scapula or shoulder blade is a flat bone and very difficult to break. The mechanism is usually a direct blow. Any scapula fracture needs to be evaluated for related injuries.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a broken bone?,"'Broken bones hurt. The lining of the bone (periosteum) is rich with nerve endings that can cause ''pain'' when inflamed; and the muscles surrounding the fracture go into spasm to prevent movement of the fracture site, and this spasm may intensify the ''pain''.''Bones have a rich blood supply and will bleed when injured. This will cause swelling and the blood that seeps into the surrounding tissue will also cause further pain. The discoloration due to the blood can show up as dark red or purple bruise in the area of the fracture site.'""Because muscles and tendons may not be damaged, the person may be able to move the injured extremity. For that reason, just because you can move the injured area, doesn't mean it's not broken.""'If there is damage to a nearby artery, the injury may be cool and pale (distal to the injury), and if there is nerve damage, there may be numbness (distally).'  "
When should I call a doctor if I think I have broken a bone?,'Most broken bones require medical care but the urgency of that care depends upon the type of fracture and the circumstances. ' 
How is a broken bone diagnosed?,"'Fractures may be difficult to diagnose in children because bones have not completely formed. Many parts of developing bone are comprised mostly of cartilage and have yet to have calcium deposited in them. Growing bone also has growth plates that may mimic or hide fractures. On occasion, the diagnosis of a fracture is made clinically based upon physical exam, even if the X-rays do not show an injury.' The doctor will take a 
history of the patient's injury, examine the injury, and look for potential 
					other injuries that may have occurred. The skin surrounding the injured area is inspected to look for a 
					laceration, scrape, or skin tear. The area of tenderness and swelling will be evaluated to identify the 
injured bone.  The type of X-ray that is ordered depends on the 
					specific injury. Sometimes plain X-rays do not identify the injury. If the 
					doctor is still concerned, CT scan or
					MRI might be 
					ordered."
What is the treatment for a broken bone?,"'The initial treatment of a fracture begins with stabilization and immobilization. In the field RICE (rest, ice, compression and elevation) may help make the patient more comfortable and prevent the fractured bones from moving. Often the pain associated with a fracture is due to spasm of the muscles surrounding the fracture site trying to prevent movement. Splinting may help relieve some of that pain. Depending upon the injury, EMS providers may consider traction to help with stabilization and pain control.''For non-open fractures, or other fractures that can be treated without emergency surgery, the goal is to immobilize the injury to maintain anatomic alignment to allow the bone to heal. ''Bone heals in three stages. '""In the emergency department, walk in clinic, or doctor's office, the extremity is usually splinted using a combination of soft padding, casting material (plaster, fiberglass), and ace wraps. This splint is not circumferential like a cast, because a fracture has the potential for swelling of the surrounding tissues, and if a tight cast were in place, that swelling could cause complications including significant pain and potential blood supply issues.""'Once the patient is discharged, their instructions are to elevate the injury and ice the area, even with the splint, to help decrease swelling and inflammation.''After a few days, once the initial swelling has resolved, a circumferential cast may replace the splint and will be worn until the fracture is healed. The time frame for healing depends upon the type of fracture and its location. X-rays may be used to help determine when it is time for the cast to be removed.''Finger and hand fractures may be more complicated. The hand is a complex web of tendons, blood vessels, and nerves that allow fine motor function. What might be acceptable healing and alignment in an arm or leg may not be appropriate in a hand. Some finger injuries need nothing more than a metal splint or buddy taping one finger to another for support, while others will need surgery. The type of treatment will depend upon the type of injury.''Most toe injuries heal very well own and need nothing more than buddy taping one toe to another for support.''The treatment for rib fractures involves pain control so that the patient can take deep breaths and allow the lung to expand beneath the injury site to prevent ''pneumonia''. Rib injuries are not wrapped or bandaged to help with pain control because this will limit their movement, and prevent lung expansion. Because of this, rib fractures generally take 4 to 6 weeks to heal and may cause pain throughout the healing process.'  Reactive stage: The blood clot that 
forms at the fracture site begins to organize and the body's building blocks 
start to bridge the gap between the two ends of the broken bone. Repair stage: Specialized cells 
located in the outer lining of the bone (periosteum), begin to form a lattice 
work or grids of cartilage and bone, called a callus, which spans the fracture. 
More bone is laid down to provide strength to the area. Remodeling phase: Over the next few 
years, the body will attempt to resculpt this mass of bone into it's original 
size and shape."
What about surgery for a broken bone?,"'The decision to operate on a fracture depends upon the type of fracture, whether it can heal in good alignment on its own, and whether other potential complications exist. ''Sometimes patients are taken to the operating room for a closed reduction (resetting of the bone) and splinting of the fracture. When a fracture is markedly displaced and misaligned, it may be too painful to move or manipulated the bone without an anesthetic.''If it appears that the fracture is unstable and cannot be held in place and in good alignment with just a splint or cast, an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) may be needed. An incision is made so that the bony pieces can be identified and aligned. Metal plates and screws, wires or rods may be used to stabilize the fracture. The hardware may be left in place forever or it may be there only temporarily until the fracture heals. Hip fractures almost always require ORIF to allow the patient to heal and regain the ability to walk.''Surgery may be required in situations where there is associated injury to arteries and nerves and they need to be repaired or decompressed.''Open fractures often have to go to the operating room to be washed out to prevent infection of the bone (osteomyelitis).'  "
How can fractures be prevented?,"'Many broken bones occur because of accidents in the home, at work or at play, and not all may be preventable. Using proper safety equipment and precautions may minimize the risk of injury, but it cannot be completely eliminated.''As we age, there is an increased risk for falls at homes and some preventive steps may help reduce fall risks. These include:''Bones also get old as we age and the management of osteoporosis is a life-long commitment. Increasing calcium content in bone will decrease the risk of spontaneous fracture, and also may make bone strong enough to potentially withstand an injury that otherwise would result in a fracture. Ways to prevent osteoporosis include: ' Make certain that lighting is adequate Shoes should not be slippery Loose rugs or uneven floors should be 
repaired High traffic areas like from the bed to 
the bath or from the kitchen to the living area need to be clear from hazards 
like excess furniture, extension cords, or boxes Bathrooms should have nonslip mats on 
the floor and in the bathtub or shower Install handrails for stairs and grab bars 
in the bathroom Increase weight bearing exercise  Make sure you are getting the right amount of calcium and Vitamin D in 
the diet. Take supplements if necessary. 
	
	Do not smoke   Avoid excess alcohol intake"
What is the prognosis for a broken bone?,"'Fractures are a common injury, but the prognosis depends upon the bone that is broken, the location of the break, whether any complications exist and the underlying medical condition of the individual. Most arm and leg fractures heal well, and the goal is for the person to return to their baseline level of activity.' "
What is bone marrow?,"'The soft spongy tissue in the center of bones is the bone marrow. The bone marrow contains the different types of cells (''stem cells'') that give rise to the ''red cells'', white blood cells, and platelets found in our blood. The marrow may also contain abnormal cells, proteins, or inflammatory reactions that are not normally present, such as ''cancer'' cells (for example, Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin ''lymphoma'' cells or ''leukemia'' cells) in some individuals. Since the production of red cells requires iron, the marrow is one of the places in the body that normally stores a supply of iron. When we are younger, our bone marrow contains very little fat. As we age, the percentage of fat in our marrow increases.' "
What is a bone marrow procedure (aspiration and/or biopsy)?,'A bone marrow procedure (commonly referred to as a bone marrow or bone marrow aspiration with or without biopsy or trephination) is a technique used to obtain a sample of the blood-forming portion (marrow) of the inner core of bone for examination in the laboratory. A bone marrow aspiration consists of inserting a special needle into a bone and withdrawing the bone marrow fluid by suction. A bone marrow biopsy takes out a larger piece of the bone marrow by coring out a sample of the marrow with a saw (termed a trephine) that ''cuts'' a small amount of bone tissue. This bone marrow examination can provide a more complete exam of the marrow than an aspirate.' 
What types of doctors perform bone marrow aspirates and/or bone marrow biopsies?,"'In general, internists, hematologists, oncologists, and transplant specialists are the doctors that usually perform bone marrow aspirates and/or biopsies.' "
Why are bone marrow biopsies or aspirations done?,"'Most bone marrow aspirations are performed to diagnose various conditions that affect the different types of blood cells. Abnormal blood counts can lead a doctor to suspect that there may be a problem in the bone marrow. Another frequent purpose of a bone marrow is to diagnose certain ''cancers'' or to determine the extent of a ''cancer'' (''cancer'' staging) that is present within the bone marrow. Bone marrow procedures can also detect uncommon nonhematologic conditions, both cancerous and noncancerous, including abnormal proteins (such as in ''amyloidosis''), inflammation (such as in ''sarcoidosis''), and infection (such as in ''tuberculosis''). This procedure can also be used to obtain marrow cells for transplantation.'""Bone marrow biopsies remove a core of bone to allow physicians to evaluate the structure and cellularity of the tissue with a microscope. These biopsies may reveal abnormalities of bone structure and any associated abnormal cells, protein deposits, or inflammatory processes. A bone marrow aspirate is primarily a liquid sample that reveals the mixed cell population of cells within the marrow. In contrast to a bone marrow biopsy, a bone marrow aspirate does not show the relationship of the cells to each other or to the bone, or the cells' precise location in relation to the bone. The procedures are often performed together, with an aspirate obtained prior to a biopsy.""  "
What bone is used to sample the bone marrow?,"'The most frequent site for obtaining bone marrow is the pelvic bone, known as the ilium (posterior iliac crest). A portion of this bone is readily accessible in most people from the lower back and is usually marked by shallow dimples on either side of the spine. Other sites include the front of the pelvic bone near the groin and the sternum (breastbone) at the front of the chest. However, the sternum is sampled only for aspiration and done in individuals older than 12 years of age. This site is considered to be ""a last resort"" because the sternum is thin and there is risk of penetrating the underlying soft tissues. The tibia (shinbone) is sampled only in infants younger than 1 year of age; it is not sampled in adults because it may not yield a sufficient sample of bone marrow cells.' "
How do physicians perform a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy?,"'Typically, only a local anesthetic is required to numb the skin and tissue down to the surface of the bone although some patients may require a sedative. A physician makes a small cut (less than ¼ inch) in the skin and then uses a hollow needle, whose center is filled by a removable metal rod (called a trocar), to penetrate through the dense outer shell of bone. This needle (the most popular is termed the Jamshidi needle) can be used for both aspiration of marrow liquid or for a needle biopsy core of solid material. Once inside the bone, the trocar is removed and a syringe is attached to the now hollow tube of the bone marrow needle. The bone marrow is withdrawn as a thick liquid by pulling back on the plunger of the syringe and collecting the liquid. This sample is known as the marrow aspirate. This part of the procedure only lasts a few seconds but is usually the most painful due to the sudden sense of a negative pressure inside the bone.''A biopsy can also then be obtained in addition to the marrow aspirate or when an aspirate cannot be obtained. The same needle is used but without the center portion in place. As the needle is partially rotated into the bone, it cuts a core that is trapped inside the needle. Once the needle is removed, this core can be extracted from the needle barrel. This core can then be prepared with fixatives and stains for examination under a microscope.''Since the skin cut for both bone marrow procedures is usually very small, no ''stitches'' are generally necessary and only a bandage is applied. Recovery from the procedures is usually rapid (about one day, although some patients may feel tenderness at the site for about a week). Any post-procedure bleeding should be addressed by your physician. Those patients who require IV sedation will require someone to bring them home and should remain fairly sedentary for about 24 hours.'""The cost of a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy varies greatly; it depends on the location (hospital or doctor's office), insurance coverage, and the country. Consequently, the cost range is wide (from about several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars) and may or may not include additional testing of the sample."" "
What is done with the bone marrow sample?,"'The bone marrow core biopsy is first placed in a liquid that keeps the cells in their natural condition (fixative solution). The sample is then placed in a solution to soften the bone and is finally processed like other biopsies in the tissue study (histology) laboratory. The liquid portion of the bone marrow is spread on glass slides and stained to make the bone marrow smears. The slides are then examined under the microscope, usually by a specially qualified technician followed by a physician such as a hematologist or pathologist. The results of aspiration or bone marrow biopsy are examined for abnormal-appearing cells, a reduced or increased amount of normal bone marrow cells as compared to normal marrow values, and the presence or absence of cancer cells as well as other abnormal structures. Portions of either sample may be submitted to the microbiology laboratory for cultures or other studies to identify infections. Certain conditions may require other specialized studies such as genetic testing or cell marker studies.' "
What diseases are diagnosed by bone marrow examination?,"'A wide variety of conditions can be diagnosed by examination of the bone marrow. The following examples illustrate some of the most frequent conditions, but there are many more. The presence or absence of cancer in the bone marrow can determine what treatments are recommended to a patient with cancer known to be elsewhere in the body. Some cancers (''leukemia'', ''multiple myeloma'', ''polycythemia'', pancytopenia) arise from cells in the marrow, so this is where the biopsy must be taken to confirm the diagnosis. Other cancers, like ''lymphomas'', can spread to the bones. A low blood-clotting element (''platelet count'') in the blood (''thrombocytopenia'') can be due to several causes. It is important to establish whether or not the cells that make the platelets (megakaryocytes) are still present in the marrow (''idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura'' [''ITP'']) or are gone (along with most other bone marrow cells as in aplastic ''anemia''). Most cases of ''anemia'' (low ''red blood cells'') can be diagnosed by simple blood tests. When these tests are negative, examining the marrow can reveal problems with the red blood cells that are uncommon causes of anemia (sideroblastic anemia, aplastic anemia). Persistent ''fevers'' can be caused by infections that reside in the marrow (atypical mycobacteria, ''brucellosis'') and a sample of the marrow may provide the best source of culture material.' "
"What are the risks 
or complications of a bone marrow procedure?","'Different individuals feel the ''pain'' caused by injection of the local anesthetic and the remainder of the procedure to a variable extent. There may be dull soreness for a day or two. Significant complications are very unusual but can include bleeding and infection and prolonged ''pain''. This procedure is only done by experienced physicians using special bone marrow needles. Bone marrow biopsies are done almost exclusively from pelvic bones. It is unsafe to perform a bone marrow biopsy on the sternum, so a special needle with a guard on it is used for sternal marrow aspirations to prevent the needle from going too deep. Some individuals may develop bleeding problems at the site or if an artery is cut.''Rare fatalities have been reported, usually during sternal marrow aspirations when the needle has penetrated the sternum and cut one of the arteries on the surface of the ''heart''.''Some researchers use bone marrow aspirates in ''clinical trials'' to collect marrow cells that can be modified for experimental treatments for several different diseases.' "
What is peripheral blood stem cell transplantation?,"'Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is a treatment which involve first harvesting specific cells called\xa0''stem cells'""\xa0from the peripheral blood of the donor. These cells are harvested by a type of filtration and then preserved, usually by freezing, and finally given to the recipient after he or she has received intensive treatment. The stem cells are usually given instead of bone marrow cells. They go to the recipient's bone marrow spaces and rebuild the bone marrow after the intensive treatment is over. The treatment does not involve surgery, but is nevertheless a form of transplantation."" "
What are stem cells?,"'Stem cells are small, round cells with a squat nucleus and scant surrounding cytoplasm. Although unremarkable in appearance, stem cells can perform what have been called ""acts of biological resurrection."" ' "
What do stem cells do?,"'Whereas other types of cells in the body have a limited lifespan and die after dividing their predetermined number of times, a stem cell can reproduce forever. The stem cell is immortal (in cellular terms). A stem cell can forgo immortality and differentiate. By doing so, it can turn into an ordinary blood cell, like a red blood cell (an erythrocyte), a white blood cell (a leukocyte), or a large cell (a megakaryocyte) that fragments into the platelets needed for blood to clot.' "
What is the value of stem cells for transplantation?,"'A relatively small number of stem cells can miraculously repopulate the whole bone marrow, provide an endless supply of stem cells, reconstitute the entire repertoire of blood cells, and restore that portion of the immune system.' "
Where do the stem cells come from for transplantation?,"'Under normal circumstances, stem cells are rarely seen in the blood stream. To recruit enough stem cells into the blood, stem cells are lured out of the bone marrow by a special regimen of ''drugs'' and thereby coaxed into entering the peripheral blood (the blood stream).' "
How are the stem cells removed from the blood?,"'The blood is filtered through a machine and the stem cells are skimmed off. The removal of the cells is termed ''pheresis'' or ''apheresis'' (from the Greek ""aphairesis"" for removal). The stem cells then may be used right away for the transplant or stored suspended in DMSO and frozen in liquid nitrogen until needed.' "
"How is the patient ""prepared""  for the transplantation?","'Before the transplant is done, the patient receives high-dose ''chemotherapy'' and/or ''radiation therapy'' over several days to destroy diseased cells (the leukemic cells, ''lymphoma'' cells, solid ''tumor'' cells, the diseased immune system cells in ''scleroderma'', etc.)' "
How is the transplantation actually done?,"'Once the chemotherapy is gone, the stem cells are defrosted and returned to the patient as a ''blood transfusion''. They are already biologically programmed to migrate to the bone marrow, where they can produce new blood and immune cells and replace the cells destroyed by the treatment.''The stem-cell preparation is infused into a vein and, once there in the blood stream, the stem cells act like homing pigeons and head straight for the bone marrow space.' "
What is the life expectancy after a bone marrow transplant?,"'The life expectancy, survival rate and quality of life after a ''bone marrow transplant'' have improved considerably with more accurate genetic matching with donors, following up transplantation with an antibiotic regimen to control infections, and improved post-transplant care, in general.''Cancer'' and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow, which is responsible for manufacturing blood cells, may require a bone marrow transplant from a healthy, genetically compatible donor. Ideally, the donor marrow replaces diseased cells to allow the body to maintain healthy levels of ''red blood cells'', white blood cells, and platelets.' "
How long can you live after a bone marrow transplant?,"'Understandably, transplants for patients with nonmalignant diseases have a much better success rate with 70% to 90 % survival with a matched sibling donor and 36% to 65% with unrelated donors.''The survival rates after transplant for patients with ''acute leukemia'' in remission are 55% to 68% with related donors and 26% to 50% if the donor is unrelated.''Transplanting the patient’s own bone marrow from an unaffected bone to a diseased one (autologous bone marrow transplant) along with ''chemotherapy'' has improved survival rates with certain ''cancers'' such as:''Autologous transplants have not enhanced the survival rates with other pediatric ''malignant'' cancers, with metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, or with metastatic Ewing sarcoma.''Patients in remission or with stabilized disease generally have a much better result than those with the disease in later stages or relapse.''Transplants of younger patients have a higher chance of success.''Additionally, when both the donor and recipient are ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV'') negative, survival rates are higher.' Ewing sarcoma Wilms tumor germ cell tumor neuroblastoma"
What is the risk of complications or side effects from bone marrow transplantation?,"'Prevention'' of viral infections and management of ''graft-versus-host disease'' (or ''GVHD'', in which immune cells in donor tissue attack the transplant patient’s own tissues), and reimmunization through vaccination are important for optimal survival.''Testing positive for small amounts of ''cancer'' cells after treatment (minimal residual disease or MRD) in children with ''acute lymphoblastic leukemia'' was a risk factor for relapse. The life expectancy increased markedly in those who tested negative for bone marrow MRD before their allogeneic transplant. The MRD-negative patients had a ''leukemia''-free survival rate of 83% and overall survival rate of 92% – much higher when compared with patients with persistent MRD.''Patients with persistent MRD pre-transplant had survival rates of 41% ''leukemia''-free and 64% overall. In patients with MRD measured after the transplant, the survival rate dropped to 35% leukemia-free and 55% overall.''Another study on adult survivors of bone marrow transplant revealed lower patient quality of life when any of the following conditions are present:''Currently, the success of bone marrow transplantation in treatment of many cancers – including some ''brain tumors'' – has fallen short of expectations. Researchers continue to improve transplant techniques, however, including improvements in matching donors and recipients, as well as better post-transplant care.' severe, chronic GVHD lower performance permanent disability resulting mental distress"
What Is Bone Marrow?,"'Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found inside bone. The bone marrow in the breastbone, skull, hips, ribs, and spine contains ''stem cells'"" that produce the body's blood cells. The three kinds of blood cells that the body needs to function -- oxygen-carrying ""'red blood cells'', infection-fighting white blood cells, and clot-forming platelets -- are all made in the bone marrow.' "
Who Is A Candidate For A Bone Marrow Transplant?,"'The decision to prescribe a bone marrow transplant is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, general physical condition, diagnosis, and stage of disease. Your doctor will also make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of the transplant procedure.' "
Where Does The Transplanted Bone Marrow Come From?,"'Bone marrow given during a transplant either comes from you or from a donor whose bone marrow ""matches"" yours.''The matching process is called human leukocyte antigen testing (HLA testing). A series of blood tests evaluate the compatibility or closeness of tissue between the donor and recipient. These test results are used to help the tissue-typing lab match a bone marrow transplant donor to you.' "
What Happens Before The Transplant?,"'A number of tests are performed before the bone marrow transplant procedure to make sure you are physically able to undergo a transplant. These tests also help the transplant team identify and treat any potential problems before the transplant.''Your ''heart'', ''lungs'' and kidney function will be tested. Your doctor may also order blood tests, a CAT scan, and a ''bone marrow biopsy''. A complete dental examination is required before the procedure to minimize your risk of infection, and other precautions will be taken as necessary to minimize the risk of infection.''The tests required before the bone marrow transplant are usually done on an outpatient basis. Your transplant coordinator will help arrange these tests for you.' "
Central Venous Catheter Placement,"'Before the bone marrow transplant can be performed, a central venous catheter is inserted through a vein in your chest during a simple surgical procedure. A central venous catheter is a slender, hollow, flexible tube that allows fluids, ''nutrition'' solutions, antibiotics, chemotherapy, or blood products to be delivered directly into your bloodstream without repeatedly having to insert a needle into your vein. The catheter can also be used to collect blood samples.' "
Stimulating Your White Blood Cells,"'""Colony-stimulating factors,"" which are hormone-like ''drugs'', are given before your bone marrow transplant to help your white blood cells recover from chemotherapy so that they can help fight the risk of infection. They also increase the number of stem cells in your blood.' "
Bone Marrow Harvesting,"'Bone marrow is withdrawn through a needle inserted into a bone in the hip. This procedure is performed in the operating room and the patient is given general anesthesia (''pain''-relieving medication that puts you to ''sleep''). If your own bone marrow cannot be used for transplantation and if a donor is not found, stem cells may be harvested from your circulating blood.' "
Chemotherapy And/Or Radiation Therapy,"'Very high doses of chemotherapy and/or ''radiation therapy'' are given to destroy the abnormal stem cells and blood cells. The high-dose therapy essentially ""wipes out"" your normal bone marrow. As a result, your blood counts (number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) quickly fall to low levels.''During this phase of treatment, you will be given intravenous (IV) fluids to ''flush'' out your kidneys and minimize the damage from chemotherapy. You will also be given medications to control ''nausea'', since chemotherapy often causes ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''.'""Because you will be in a fragile state of health and won't have enough white blood cells to protect you from infection, you will be isolated in your hospital room until after the new bone marrow begins to grow. Your healthcare providers will give you specific guidelines about the isolation procedure."" "
What Happens During The Transplant?,"'The day you receive your bone marrow transplant, the harvested bone marrow is infused into a vein through an intravenous tube. The bone marrow looks like dark, thick blood. It migrates to the large bone ''cavities'' (breast bone, skull, hips, ribs and spine), and begins producing normal blood cells after several weeks.' "
Will My Insurance Provider Cover My Bone Marrow Transplant?,"'Insurance reimbursement for bone marrow transplantation is not automatic. Many insurance companies require precertification letters of medical necessity.'""As soon as you know that a bone marrow transplant is a possibility, contact your insurance carrier. Don't assume your insurance will cover any or all costs associated with your transplant. It is essential to know your rights as a patient, understand your insurance policy, enlist the support of your employer, and have your physician work closely with you and your insurer to cover your bone marrow transplant.""'Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Taussig ''Cancer'' Center.''Edited by  Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, WebMD, February 2004.''Portions of this page copyright © ''The Cleveland Clinic''  2000-2004' "
What is a bone spur?,'A bone spur is a tiny pointed bony growth.'  
What causes bone spurs?,"'Bone spurs are usually caused by local inflammation, such as from degenerative ''arthritis'' (''osteoarthritis'') or tendinitis. This inflammation stimulates the cells that form bone to deposit bone in this area, eventually leading to a bony prominence or spur. For example, inflammation of the ligament that surrounds a degenerating disc between the vertebrae (the bony building blocks of the spine) is a very common cause of bone spurs of the spine. Inflammation of the Achilles tendon can lead to the formation of a bone spur at the back of the heel bone (calcaneus bone). Inflammation of the tissue on the bottom of the foot, ''plantar fasciitis'', can lead to a bone spur at the underside of the heel bone. These bone spurs are sometimes referred to as ''heel spurs''. A bone spur is medically referred to as an osteophyte. Rarely, bone spurs may occur as a result of congenital conditions. An osteochondroma is one type of these congenital spurs.'  "
Where do bone spurs occur?,"'Bone spurs develop in areas of inflammation or injury in nearby cartilage or tendons. Common locations for bone spurs are in the back, or sole, of the heel bone of the foot, around joints that have degenerated cartilage, and in the spine adjacent to degenerated discs. Congenital types (osteochondromas) commonly occur around the growth areas of the shoulder and knee.' "
What are symptoms of bone spurs?,"'Bone spurs may or may not cause symptoms. When they do cause symptoms, the symptoms depend on their location. Bone spurs can be associated with ''pain'', numbness, and tenderness if they are irritating other tissues, such as skin, fat pads, nerves, or tendons.''Heel spurs cause local ''foot pain'', tenderness, and sometimes swelling. This can lead to difficulty ''walking'' due to pain at the bottom of the foot with weight-bearing. Sometimes there is accompanying inflammation of the entire bottom of the foot (plantar fasciitis) when the heel spur occurs in the bottom of the heel bone. Occasionally, bone spurs in this location are a result of inflammatory arthritis, such as from ''reactive arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'', or ''diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis'"" (DISH or Forrestier's disease).""'Spurs in the spine can pinch adjacent nerves to cause numbness, tingling, and pain as well as weakness in the affected area of the body supplied by the nerve.''Some bone spurs do not cause symptoms and are incidentally detected by X-ray tests that are performed for other reasons. These spurs may have formed because of past injury to nearby tissues, such as tendons, that caused local inflammation of the bone, leading to the development of the bone spur.'  "
How are bone spurs diagnosed?,"'Bone spurs are detected by radiologic testing, such as with plain X-rays, ultrasound imaging, MRI scan, CT scan, and myelograms.' "
What are treatment options for bone spurs?,"'Bone spurs are treated only if they are causing symptoms. Initial treatment is directed toward decreasing inflammation and avoiding reinjury when possible. Local ''cold'' application can help when the location of the bone spur is accessible. Anti-inflammatory medications, administered both orally (''over-the-counter'' ''NSAIDs'') and by local steroid injection (Kenalog, Depomedrol, Celestone), are commonly used, depending on the location of the spur. Local mechanical measures, such as orthotics, or shoe inserts, and local bone spur pads might be considered, depending on the location of the bone spur. Bone spurs that are causing irritation of nerves, tendons or ligaments and that are resistant to conservative measures can require surgical operations for treatment.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for bone spurs?,"'Bone spurs that are not associated with symptoms may never cause problems and do not require treatment. The outlook for bone spurs causing symptoms varies. Bone spurs can cause mild symptoms or be severely disabling, especially if they are directly irritating nerves.' "
Is it possible to prevent bone spurs?,'There are no means of preventing bone spurs.' 
What is bone cancer? What is metastatic bone cancer?,"'Bone cancer'' is a ''malignant tumor'' that arises from the cells that make up the bones of the body. This is also known as primary bone ''cancer''. Primary bone tumors are tumors that arise in the bone tissue itself, and they may be benign or ''malignant'' (bone ''cancer''). Benign (non-cancerous) tumors in the bones are more common than bone ''cancers''.''When ''cancer'' is detected in bones, it either originated in the bones (as in primary bone cancer) or has spread to the bone after originating elsewhere (a ''metastasis'' or secondary cancer that spread to the bones). In fact, when cancer is detected in bone, it most often is a metastasis that has started in another organ or part of the body and then spread to the bones. This cancer that has metastasized to the bone is named for the site where the original cancer began (for example, metastatic ''prostate cancer'' that has spread to the bone). Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are among the types of cancers that commonly spread to the bone in their advanced stages. Less commonly, cancer can begin within the bone as primary cancer of the bone, and this is true bone cancer. Primary and metastatic secondary bone cancers are often treated differently and have a different prognosis.''There are other cancers that may begin in the bone even though they are not considered to be true bone cancers. ''Lymphoma'' is a cancer of the cells that are responsible for the immune response of the body. Lymphoma usually begins in the ''lymph nodes'', but it sometimes begins in the bone marrow. ''Multiple myeloma'' is another cancer of the immune cells that typically begins in the bone marrow. These tumors are not considered primary bone cancers because they do not arise from the actual bone cells.''This article focuses on primary bone cancer, which is cancer of the bone cells themselves.' "
What are bone cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Pain'' is the most common symptom of bone cancer. The bone ''pain'' may initially develop at certain times of the day, often at night, or with physical activity. The pain tends to progress and worsen over time. Sometimes, the pain may be present for years before the affected person seeks treatment. Sometimes bone cancer is detected incidentally when ''X-rays'' or imaging studies are performed for another reason. Occasionally, a mass, swelling, or lump is felt around the area of a bone cancer. Bone ''fractures'' can also occur at the site of bone cancer because the underlying bone structure has weakened. Less commonly symptoms are caused by compression or disruption of nerves and blood vessels in the affected area. These symptoms can include numbness, tingling, tenderness, or a decrease in blood flow beyond the site of the ''tumor'', causing a ''cold'' hand or foot with weak or absent pulses.'

What are the different types of bone cancer?,"'There are several different types of bone cancer, and they are often treated differently. Knowing the precise type of bone cancer is essential for developing an optimal treatment plan. Some of the most common types of bone cancer are as follows.''Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer. Osteosarcoma occurs most commonly in older children, teenagers, and young adults (10-19 years of age), and it is more common in males. The cancerous tissue in osteosarcoma in young people tends to develop at the ends of long bones in areas of active bone growth, often around the knee, either at the end of the thighbone (femur) or the shinbone (tibia) near the knee. The next most common location for bone cancer is in the bone of the arm (humerus). Nevertheless, it is possible for an osteosarcoma to develop in any bone. Depending on the appearance of the tumor cells under the microscope, there are also several different subtypes of osteosarcoma.''Chondrosarcoma is the second most common bone cancer. It arises from cartilage cells that are attached to or cover bone. It is more common in people older than 40 years of age, and less than 5% of these cancers occur in people under 20 years of age. It may either grow rapidly and aggressively or grow slowly. Chondrosarcoma is most commonly found in the bones of the hips and pelvis.''Ewing sarcoma, sometimes referred to as the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFTs), is an aggressive form of bone cancer that is most common in children 4-15 years of age. It can occur either in the bones or in the soft tissues and is believed to arise from primitive nerve tissue. ESFTs are more common in males than in females. The most common location for Ewing sarcoma is the middle portion of the long bones of the arms and legs.''Pleomorphic sarcoma is a cancer formerly referred to as malignant fibrous histiocytoma or MFH. This term is still used frequently. Pleomorphic sarcomas are typically not cancers of bone but of soft tissues. However, they may arise in the bone in up to 5% of cases. Pleomorphic sarcomas typically occur in adults and can be found anywhere in the body.''Fibrosarcoma is an uncommon type of bone cancer. It is most commonly arises behind the knee in adults.''Chordoma is a very rare cancer usually seen in people over 30 years of age. It is most commonly located in either the lower or upper ends of the spinal column.'

What kinds of bone cancer occur in children?,"'Osteosarcoma, the most common type of bone cancer, is most common in older children, teenagers, and young adults. Ewing sarcoma and ESFT are bone cancers that typically affect children.'  "
What causes bone cancer?,"'As with other cancers, there is no one cause of bone cancer. In general, cancers arise when normal cell growth and proliferation is disrupted, allowing abnormal cells (cancer cells) to divide and grow uncontrollably. A number of hereditary and environmental factors are likely involved in the development of bone cancers.'

  "
What are risk factors for bone cancer?,"'About 2,300 cases of bone cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. Primary bone cancers are not common and account for far less than 1% of all cancers. Bone cancers are more common in children and younger adults than in older people. Cancer found in the bones of an older adult usually has spread to the bone after originating from another location in the body.''Risk factors for bone cancers include the following:' Previous treatment with radiation therapy Previous chemotherapy with drugs known as alkylating agents Mutation in a gene known as the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene or other genes Associated conditions, such as hereditary retinoblastoma, Paget's disease of bone, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia Implantation of metal to repair previous fractures"
What tests are used to diagnose bone cancer?,"'A variety of imaging tests may be used to detect bone tumors, including bone cancers. Very early bone cancers may or may not be apparent on plain X-rays. ''CT scans'' and ''MRI'' scans are more precise in defining the location of bone cancers.''A ''bone scan'' is a test that uses radioactive material to produce images of the entire skeleton. This may allow the localization of bone cancer anywhere in the body. This test is not specific for bone cancers and can also reveal areas of inflammation as found with ''arthritis'', fractures, and infections.''While many bone cancers have a characteristic appearance on imaging studies, a biopsy (tissue sample) must be taken in order to precisely determine what kind of cancer is present and confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy is a procedure to acquire a sample of a piece of the tumor that is examined under a microscope. The tissue sample may be obtained with a needle inserted through the skin into the tumor or with a surgical operation.''At present, there are no screening tests available to detect early bone cancers.'  "
What is the treatment for bone cancer?,"'An operation to remove the cancer is the mainstay of treatment for bone cancers. Surgical techniques can remove most bone cancers without requiring amputation of the affected limb. In some cases, amputation may be avoided with limb-sparing surgery. Sometimes, muscles and other tissues that surround the cancer also have to be removed. Reconstructive surgery may be needed, in addition to cancer resection, to help maximize function of the limb.''Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and other bone cancers may require chemotherapy in addition to surgery.''Radiation'' therapy is the typical treatment for chondrosarcoma.'""Ewing sarcomas that do not respond well to high-dose chemotherapy may require radiation therapy and even a stem-cell transplant. In this procedure, the patient's ""'stem cells'' (blood cells that have the potential to develop into all the different kinds of blood cells) are harvested from the bloodstream. After high doses of chemotherapy medications to destroy the bone marrow, the harvested stem cells are next returned to the body, as with a ''blood transfusion''. Over the next three to four weeks, the stem cells produce new blood cells from the bone marrow.''Targeted therapies are specially designed treatments that aim treatment specifically at the cancer cells. For example, denosumab (Xgeva) is a monoclonal antibody that acts to block the activity of specialized bone cells called osteoclasts. This medication has been used in the treatment of giant cell tumors of bone that have recurred after surgery or cannot be removed by surgery. ''Imatinib'' (''Gleevec'') is a targeted therapy drug that can block the signals from certain mutated genes that cause tumor cells to grow. Imatinib has been used to treat some chordomas that have spread or recurred after treatment.''Clinical trials'' are another type of treatment for bone cancers. In clinical trials, doctors test promising new medications, combinations of medications, or procedures. Clinical trials are carefully controlled research studies. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be interested in participating in a clinical trial.'

What specialists treat bone cancer?,'Bone cancer is typically managed by surgical oncologists or orthopedic oncologists (for surgical removal of the tumor) and medical oncologists (for administration or chemotherapy). Radiation oncologists are involved in the treatment team if radiation therapy is planned. Palliative care physicians may be involved to manage pain and symptoms.' 
Are there any treatments or medications that relieve bone cancer pain?,"'Analgesics (pain-relieving medications) treat the pain of bone cancer. These may be nonprescription or prescription medications. Mild-to-moderate pain is treated with medications such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs''), including ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') and ''naproxen'' (''Naprelan'', ''Aleve'', ''Naprosyn'', ''Anaprox''). However, people taking anticancer chemotherapy drugs sometimes must avoid NSAIDs because of increased risk of bleeding.''Prescription medications are used for moderate-to-severe ''cancer pain''. Opioids -- stronger narcotic pain medications -- like ''codeine'', morphine, ''oxycodone'', hydromorphone, and ''fentanyl'' may be required to control severe pain. Sometimes a combination of medications is used to treat cancer pain. Opioid medications can be associated with side effects like drowsiness, ''constipation'', and ''nausea''.' "
What is the prognosis for bone cancer? What is the five-year survival rate for bone cancer?,"'The prognosis, or outlook, for survival for bone cancer patients depends upon the particular type of cancer and the extent to which it has spread. The overall five-year survival rate for all bone cancers in adults and children is about 70%. Chondrosarcomas in adults have an overall five-year survival rate of about 80%.''The five-year survival rate specifically for localized osteosarcomas is about 60%-80%. If the cancer has spread beyond bone, the survival rate is about 15%-30%. Osteosarcomas tend to have a more favorable prognosis if they are located in an arm or leg, respond well to chemotherapy, and are generally completely removed at surgery. Younger patients and females also tend to have a more favorable prognosis than males or older patients.''Ewing sarcomas have a five-year survival rate of about 70% when they are found in a localized stage. If they have spread outside of the bone, the survival rate drops to 15%-30%. Factors that are associated with a more favorable prognosis for Ewing sarcomas include smaller tumor size, age less than 10 years, having the cancer in an arm or leg (instead of in the pelvis or chest wall), and having a good response to chemotherapy drugs.'  "
Is it possible to prevent bone cancer?,"'Since the exact cause of bone cancer is poorly understood, there are no lifestyle changes or habits that can prevent these uncommon cancers.' "
What is borderline personality disorder (BPD)?,"'Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a ''mental illness'"" that is part of the group of mental illnesses called personality disorders. Like other personality disorders, it is characterized by a consistent pattern of thinking, feeling, and interacting with others and with the world that tends to result in significant problems for the sufferer. Specifically, BPD is associated with a pattern of unstable ways of seeing oneself, feeling, behaving, and relating to other people that markedly interferes with the individual's ability to function. Also, as with other personality disorders, the person is usually an adolescent or adult before they can be assessed as meeting full symptom criteria for BPD.""'Historically, BPD has been thought to be a set of symptoms that includes both mood problems (neuroses) and distortions of reality (psychosis) and therefore was thought to be on the borderline between mood problems and ''schizophrenia''. However, it is now understood that while the symptoms of BPD may straddle those symptom complexes, this illness is more closely related to other personality disorders in terms of how it may develop and occur within families. BPD is now understood to occur equally in men and women in the general population, while mostly in women in groups of people who are receiving mental health treatment (clinical populations). The frequency with which this disorder occurs is also thought to be considerably higher than previously thought, affecting nearly 6% of adults over the course of a lifetime.'  "
What other disorders often occur with BPD?,"'Men with BPD are more likely to also have a substance-related disorder and women with this illness are more likely to suffer from an eating disorder. In adolescents, BPD tends to co-occur with more anxious and peculiar personality disorders like schizotypal and passive aggressive personality disorder, respectively. Adults who have ''antisocial personality disorder'', also colloquially called sociopaths, may be more likely to also have BPD. Interestingly, even people who have some symptoms (traits) of BPD but do not meet full diagnostic criteria for the illness can have traits of both BPD and ''narcissistic personality disorder''.''While there has been some controversy as to whether or not BPD is truly its own disorder or a variation of ''bipolar disorder'', research supports the theory that BPD, like virtually every medical or other mental health disorder, can present in nearly as many unique and complex ways as there are people who have it. In other words, some individuals with BPD will have that disorder alone, while others will have it in combination with bipolar or another mental disorder. Still others will appear to have BPD but really qualify for the diagnosis of ''bipolar disorder'' and vice versa.''Obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD'') can also co-occur with BPD. It is thought to be particularly true of people who have ''OCD'' and bipolar disorder. BPD is not recognized worldwide. It is most closely diagnosed as emotionally unstable personality disorder in the International Classification of Disease, or ICD-10. Although countries like China and India recognize mental disorders that have some symptoms in common with BPD, its existence is not formally recognized.' "
What causes borderline personality disorder?,"'Although there is no specific cause for BPD, it is understood to be the result of a combination of biological predispositions, ways of understanding the world, and social stressors (biopsychosocial model). Biologically, people with BPD are more likely to have abnormalities in the size of the hippocampus, in the size and functioning of the amygdala, and in the functioning of the frontal lobes, which are the areas of the brain that are understood to regulate emotions and integrate thoughts with emotions. Although some research indicates that people with BPD seem to have areas of the brain that are more and less active compared to individuals who do not have the disorder, other research contradicts that.''While BPD is not thought to be genetic, it can somewhat run in families. Psychologically, BPD seems to make a person more vulnerable to having unstable ''moods'', particularly impulsive aggression. Socially, this disorder predisposes sufferers to developing insecurity, to be more likely to excessively expect to be criticized or rejected and negatively personalize disinterest or ''inattention'' from other people. These tendencies result in BPD sufferers having significantly impaired social relationships. In addition to these problems, people with BPD are more likely to have suffered from ''trauma'' in the form of childhood abuse or neglectful ''parenting''.' "
What are the risk factors for borderline personality disorder?,"'Adults who come from families of origin where divorce, neglect, sexual abuse, substance abuse, or death occurred are at higher risk of developing BPD. In children, the risk for developing this disorder appears to increase when they have a learning problem or certain temperaments. Adolescents who develop ''alcohol abuse'' or ''addiction'' are also apparently at higher risk of developing BPD compared to those who do not.' "
What are borderline personality disorder symptoms and signs?,"'As per the ''DSM'' (''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'') definition, in order to qualify for the diagnosis of BPD, an individual must have at least five of the following symptoms:'   Distorted, unstable self-image, in that they may drastically and rapidly change in the way they understand their own likes, dislikes, strengths, challenges, goals, and even their basic value as a person, even to the point of having feelings of worthlessness Repeatedly unstable relationships, in that individuals with this disorder repeatedly, rapidly, and drastically change from seeing another person as nearly perfect (idealizing) to seeing the same person as being bad or nearly worthless (devaluing) Unstable emotions (affects), in that the sufferer experiences marked, rapid mood swings (for example, severe depression/dysphoria, guilt, anger, irritability, joy, euphoria, anxiety, including panic attacks and sadness) that are stress related, even if the stresses may be seen as minor or negligible to others Frantic efforts to avoid loneliness or being abandoned, whether the abandonment is real or imagined Significant impulsivity (the person tends to act before thinking), in at least two aspects that can be self-damaging (for example, sexual behaviors, eating or spending habits, driving behaviors, or in the use of substances) Repeated self-mutilating behaviors, thoughts of suicide, suicidal behaviors, threats, or attempts Chronic, persistent feelings of emptiness Inappropriate, intense hostility or anger, a lack of restraint or other difficulty managing those or other potentially negative emotions when they occur Transient, stress-related paranoid thoughts or severe dissociation (lapses in memory)"
How do health care professionals diagnose borderline personality disorder?,"'There is no specific definitive test, like a blood test, that can accurately assess that a person has BPD. People who are concerned that they may suffer from BPD might further consider that possibility by taking a self-test, either an online or printable test. To determine the presence of this disorder, practitioners conduct a mental health interview that looks for the presence of the symptoms, also called diagnostic criteria, described previously. As with any mental health assessment, the health care practitioner will usually work toward ruling out other mental disorders, including mood problems, ''depression'', ''anxiety'' disorders including ''anxiety'' attacks or generalized ''anxiety'', eating disorders such as ''binge eating disorder'', ''bulimia'' and ''anorexia'', and other personality disorders including ''narcissistic personality disorder'', dependent personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder, drug-abuse problems as well as problems being in touch with reality, like ''schizophrenia'' or delusional disorder. Besides determining if the person suffers from BPD, the mental health professional may assess that while some symptoms (traits) of the disorder are present, the person does not fully qualify for the condition.'""The professional will also likely try to ensure that the person is not suffering from a medical problem that may cause emotional symptoms. The mental health practitioner will therefore often inquire about when the person has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood testing, and any other tests that a medical professional deems necessary to ensure that the individual is not suffering from a medical condition instead of or in addition to emotional symptoms. Due to the use of a mental health interview in establishing the diagnosis and the fact that this illness can be quite resistant to treatment, it is of great importance that the practitioner conduct a thorough evaluation and interview family members, when appropriate with the patient's permission. This is to assure that the person is not incorrectly assessed as having BPD when he or she does not."" "
What is the treatment for borderline personality disorder?,"'Clinical trials'' have determined that different forms of psychotherapy have been found to effectively treat BPD. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a method of psychotherapy in which the therapist specifically addresses four areas that tend to be particularly problematic for individuals with BPD: self-image, impulsive behaviors, mood instability, and problems in relating to others. To address those areas, treatment with DBT tries to build four major behavioral skill areas: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.'""Another psychotherapy approach that is specifically designed to treat BPD is mentalization-based treatment. Based on understanding of how, when, and the quality of attachments people form, its goal is to improve the person's ability to understand his or her own and others' mental states. This treatment approach uses weekly individual therapy and group sessions over 18 months.""'Talk therapy that focuses on helping the person understand how their thoughts and behaviors affect each other (cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT) has also been found to be effective treatment for BPD. Schema therapy, also called schema-focused cognitive therapy, is based on a theory that many maladaptive ways of thinking (cognitions) are the result of past experiences. This approach to psychotherapy has also been found to alleviate the symptoms of BPD.'""Other psychotherapy approaches that have been used to address BPD include interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and psychoanalytic therapy. IPT is a type of psychotherapy that addresses how the person's symptoms are related to the problems that person has in relating to others. Psychoanalytic therapy, which seeks to help the individual understand and better manage his or her ways of defending against negative emotions, has been found to be effective in addressing BPD, especially when the therapist is more active or vocal than in traditional psychoanalytic treatment and when this approach is used in the context of current rather than past relationships. Considered a form of psychodynamic psychotherapy, transference-focused psychotherapy involves the therapist clarifying, confronting, and interpreting the evolving reactions that the person with BPD has toward the therapist that are thought to be a repetition of the person's previous relationships (transference). Some BPD sufferers are found to benefit from this form of therapy, as well.""'The use of psychiatric medications, like antidepressants (for example, ''fluoxetine'' [''Prozac''], ''sertraline'' [''Zoloft''], ''paroxetine'' [''Paxil''], ''citalopram'' [''Celexa''], ''escitalopram'' [''Lexapro''], ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix) ''venlafaxine'' [''Effexor''], ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), ''duloxetine'' [''Cymbalta''], vilazodone (Viibryd) or ''trazodone'' [''Desyrel'']), mood stabilizers (for example, ''divalproex'' sodium [''Depakote''], ''carbamazepine'' [''Tegretol''], or ''lamotrigine'' [''Lamictal'']), or antipsychotics (for example, ''olanzapine'' [''Zyprexa''], ''risperidone'' [''Risperdal''], ''aripiprazole'' [''Abilify''], paliperidone [Invega], iloperidone [Fanapt], asenapine [Saphris]), lurasidone (''Latuda''), or brexpiprazole (Rexulti) may be useful in addressing some of the symptoms of BPD but do not manage the illness in its entirety. On a positive note, some women who suffer from both BPD and bipolar disorder may experience a decrease in how irritable and angry they feel, as well as a decrease in how often and severely they become aggressive when treated with a mood-stabilizer medication like Depakote. On the other hand, the use of medications in the treatment of individuals with BPD may sometimes cause more harm than good. For example, while people with BPD may experience suicidal behaviors no more often than other individuals with a severe mental illness, they often receive more medications and therefore suffer from more side effects. Also, given how frequently many sufferers of BPD experience suicidal feelings, great care is taken to avoid the medications that can be dangerous if taken in overdose.''Partial hospitalization is an intervention that involves the individual with mental illness being in a hospital-like treatment center during the day but returning home each evening. In addition to providing a safe environment, support and frequent monitoring by mental health professionals, partial hospitalization programs allow for more frequent mental health interventions like professional assessments, psychotherapy, medication treatment, as well as development of a treatment plan for after discharge from the facility. While funding a long-term stay in a partial hospitalization facility may be difficult, studies show that when it is provided using a psychoanalytic or psychodynamic approach, it may help the person with BPD enjoy a decrease in the severity of general discontent, anxiety, ''depression'', and inability to feel pleasure, as well as decreasing the frequency of suicide attempts and full hospitalizations. This treatment may also help the individual develop improved relationships with others such that the BPD sufferer may be less likely to engage in social isolation. Contrary to earlier beliefs, BPD has been found to significantly improve in response to treatment with appropriate inpatient hospitalization. Family members of individuals with BPD might benefit from participation in a support group.'  "

What are borderline personality disorder complications?,"'The presence of BPD often worsens the course of another mental condition with which it occurs. For example, it tends to change the symptoms of ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' and to worsen ''depression''.''Individuals with BPD are at risk for self-destructive behaviors like self-mutilation, as well as for attempting or completing suicide. While cutting and other forms of self-harm, as well as suicidal behaviors seem to be associated with alleviating negative feelings, it is thought that self-mutilating behaviors are more an expression of anger, punishing oneself, distracting oneself, and maladaptively eliciting more normal feelings. In contrast, suicide attempts are thought to be more often associated with feeling survivors will be better off for their death. People who engage in self-mutilation are more likely to commit suicide compared to those who do not self-mutilate.''Although most individuals with a mental disorder do not engage in violent behavior, those who suffer from BPD have a somewhat increased risk for such behaviors. That risk is also increased for individuals who suffer from narcissism, antisocial personality disorder, have a history of previously engaging in violent behavior, frequent use of sedative medications, or experience several changes in their psychiatric medications in general.''Complications of BPD also often involve families of the person with the disorder. For example, a parent with BPD is vulnerable to having depressive symptoms in their children.' "
What is the prognosis of people with borderline personality disorder?,"""Improvement in any personality disorder is not the same as being cured, in that while the symptoms of BPD do tend to diminish (remit) with time, some often remain. Therefore, full recovery can be difficult to achieve. But how well or poorly people with BPD progress over time seems to be influenced by how severe the disorder is at the time that treatment starts, the state of the individual's current personal relationships, whether or not the sufferer has a history of being abused as a child, as well as whether or not the person receives appropriate treatment and how long it takes for that to occur. Simultaneously suffering from depression, other emotional problems, or a low level of conscientiousness have been found to be associated with a greater likelihood of the symptoms of BPD returning (relapsing). Conversely, having steady employment or school status once symptoms of BPD subside (remit) tends to protect BPD sufferers from experiencing a future relapse.""'People with BPD are at higher risk for having long-term substance abuse. Other complications that are associated with this personality disorder include unemployment, social isolation, reckless driving, legal problems, as well as suicide attempts and completion.' "
Is it possible to prevent borderline personality disorder?,"'Societal interventions like ''prevention'' of child abuse, ''domestic violence'', and substance abuse in families can help decrease the occurrence of a number of very different mental health problems. In contrast, specific prevention of BPD tends to focus on recognizing traits of the disorder as early as possible, followed by intensive treatment.' "

Introduction,"'Botox'' is a brand name of a toxin produced by the bacterium ''Clostridium botulinum''. There are other brand names for ''botulinum'', such as Xeomin. In large amounts, this toxin can cause ''botulism'', which you probably associate with ''food poisoning''. Despite the fact that one of the most serious complications of ''botulism'' is ''paralysis'', scientists have discovered a way to use it to human advantage. Small, diluted amounts can be directly injected into specific muscles causing controlled weakening of the muscles. ''The FDA approved such usage in the late 1980s upon the discovery that Botox could stop ailments like ''blepharospasm'' (uncontrolled blinking) and ''strabismus'' (''lazy eye''). Doctors have been using Botox for years to successfully treat ''wrinkles''  and facial creases. In April 2002, Botox gained FDA approval for treatment of moderate-to-severe frown lines between the eyebrows - called glabellar lines. However, Botox is often used for other areas of the face as well.' "
How Does Botox Work?,"'Botox blocks signals from the nerves to the muscles. The injected muscle can no longer contract, which causes the ''wrinkles'' to relax and soften.'""It is most often used on forehead lines, crow's ""'feet'' (lines around the eye) and frown lines. ''Wrinkles'' caused by sun damage and gravity will not respond to Botox.' "
How Is a Botox Procedure Performed?,'Getting Botox takes only a few minutes and no anesthesia is required. Botox is injected with a fine needle into specific muscles with only minor discomfort. It generally takes three to seven days to take full effect and it is best to avoid ''alcohol'' at least one week prior to treatment. ''Aspirin'' and anti-inflammatory medications should be stopped two weeks before treatment as well in order to reduce ''bruising''.' 
How Long Does a Botox Injection Last?,"'The effects from Botox will last four to six months. As muscle action gradually returns, the lines and wrinkles begin to re-appear and wrinkles need to be re-treated. The lines and wrinkles often appear less severe with time because the muscles are being trained to relax.' "
What Are the Side Effects of Botox?,"'Temporary ''bruising'' is the most common side effect of Botox. ''Headaches'', which resolve in 24-48 hours, can occur, but this is rare. A small percentage of patients may develop ''eyelid'"" drooping. This usually resolves in three weeks. This usually happens when the Botox moves around so you shouldn't rub the treated area for 12 hours after injection or lay down for three to four hours."" "
Who Should Not Receive Botox?,"'Patients who are ''pregnant'', ''breastfeeding'"" or have a neurological disease should not use Botox. Since Botox doesn't work for all wrinkles, a consultation with a doctor is recommended."" "
Will Insurance Pay For Botox?,"'Insurance coverage varies for Botox injections, depending largely on the medical necessity of your condition. Botox is not generally covered by insurance when used for cosmetic purposes. Check with your insurance carrier for coverage details.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
How is Botox used to treat multiple sclerosis?,"'Botox'' can be used to treat many symptoms associated with ''multiple sclerosis''.'   Patients who have spasticity affecting their arms or legs may be good candidates for botulinum toxin injections to relieve painful spasms and improve mobility to help with bathing or dressing. Botox may be especially beneficial in situations in which patients have a difficult time tolerating oral anti-spasticity medications due to side effects. Botox has also been used to treat overactive bladder symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Some patients with multiple sclerosis develop problems with their vocal cords, called dysphonia. Very small amounts of Botox injected into the vocal cords are used to treat this condition. It is important to recognize that Botox is used to decrease spasticity and cannot improve muscle strength."
What is Botox?,"'Botox is one specific brand of purified botulinum toxin, which is the toxin produced by the bacterium ''Clostridium botulinum''. Medical uses of botulinum toxin began in 1980, when targeted weakening of eye muscles was identified as a potential treatment of ''strabismus'"", a condition in which the eyes don't line up correctly.""'Although many different types of botulinum toxin have been identified, only types A and B are approved for the use in treatment of muscle problems. In addition to Botox, other approved forms of botulinum toxin A include Dysport and Xeomin. Myobloc is the approved form of botulinum toxin B.''When used for clinical purposes, the toxin is used in small amounts, leading to ''weakness'' in the muscles into which it is injected. This weakness can be beneficial in various conditions characterized by too much muscle activity, such as ''dystonia'' or spasticity. This is in distinct contrast to the disease ''botulism'', which occurs when the non-purified bacterium is ingested and the toxin is dispersed through the body causing widespread weakness.   ' "
What is multiple sclerosis?,"'Multiple Sclerosis (''MS'') is a disease that causes ''demyelination'"" of the brain and spinal cord. When this occurs, axons (the parts of the nerve cells that conduct impulses to other cells) don't work well. As more areas are affected by this loss of myelin, patients develop symptoms."" The specific symptom that someone might experience is related to the area of injury in the brain or spinal cord. Patients might describe numbness, tingling, or weakness. The weakness may be mild or severe enough to cause paralysis of one side of the body. In some cases, patients may develop incontinence or even an inability to empty their bladder. As multiple sclerosis progresses, some patients are left with muscle spasticity or an involuntary painful contraction of certain muscles."
What is spasticity?,"'Spasticity is a condition in which muscles exhibit almost constant contracture or activity, leading to loss of range of motion, decreased function, and even ''pain''.'   Spasticity occurs after an area of the brain or spinal cord has been injured, leading to weakness and increased tone. When an arm or leg which is affected by spasticity is moved by an examiner, there is involuntary resistance to that movement. Often, this spasticity is made worse when the speed (or velocity) of the movement increases. Spasticity is often seen after a stroke, traumatic brain or spinal cord injury, or in cases of multiple sclerosis. In some cases, spasticity can be associated with development of involuntary tremors."
Who is a good candidate for Botox injections?," Patients who have limited areas of spasticity, such as one arm or one leg, are often very good candidates for botulinum toxin treatments. Patients who have been poorly tolerant of oral medications due to sleepiness, dry mouth, or even cognitive problems may also benefit from the use of botulinum toxin injections to treat their spasticity. Patients who have certain underlying neuromuscular diseases, such as myasthenia gravis, or who are being treated with medications that block the neuromuscular junction, should not be given botulinum toxin injections, as widespread or prolonged weakness may occur."
How many Botox injections are needed? How do Botox injections work?,"""The exact number of injections needed to treat a patient's condition is highly individualized. One patient may respond to as few as two or three injections, while another patient may require many more.""  Botox works by blocking the release of acetylcholine from nerve endings. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter required by muscles for muscular contraction. By eliminating the ability of a muscle to contract, it relaxes, thereby decreasing spasticity and tone. The blockade of acetylcholine does not occur immediately. Most patients do not begin to see the effect of a botulinum toxin injection for a few days, and it may take a few weeks for the maximum benefit to become apparent. Additionally, the benefit of botulinum toxin injections is not permanent; after a few months (typically three), the effect of the injections is no longer seen, and the injections need to be repeated."
What are the potential risks and side effects of Botox injections?,"'Botox injections'' have been determined to be safe and effective when given by experienced injectors. However, there is a risk of weakness in the area which has been injected. If this occurs, the weakness may interfere with function of that area. As with any injection, there is a potential for ''pain'', bleeding, or infection at the injection site. With a large injection of the toxin, there is a possibility that there may be widespread dispersion of the toxin leading to problems with ''breathing'' or swallowing.' "
How much do Botox injections cost? Does insurance cover Botox injections?,"'The exact cost of Botox injections is dependent on many factors, including the amount of toxin used, the number of sites injected, and whether electromyography (''EMG'') or ''ultrasound'"" guidance is used to determine placement of the toxin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Botox for the treatment of upper limb spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis and other conditions, and insurance companies will often cover the majority of the costs associated with this procedure. In some cases insurance companies may also cover the cost of “off-label” uses of Botox, but this is dependent on the company and the patient's policy. Most companies will be able to identify if this is a covered benefit before the injections take place."" "
How can I expect to feel after getting Botox injections?,"'Immediately after receiving botulinum toxin injections, you may not feel any specific change, other than some slight soreness at the injection sites.' After a few days, there will be evidence of some decrease in the spasticity of the targeted area. This may be associated with decreased pain and even improved function. Rarely, some patients experience a flu-like reaction or generalized achiness and fatigue which may last for a few days. If this type of reaction occurs, discuss your symptoms with your physician."

What is botulism?,"'Botulism is a serious illness that causes flaccid paralysis of muscles. A neurotoxin, generically called botulinum toxin, causes botulism and the bacterium ''Clostridium botulinum'' (and rarely by ''C. butyricum'' and ''C. baratii'') produces the neurotoxin. There are seven distinct neurotoxins (types A-G) that ''Clostridium botulinum'' produces, but types A, B, and E (and rarely F) are the most common that produce the flaccid paralysis in humans. The other types mainly cause disease in animals and birds, which also develop flaccid paralysis. Most ''Clostridium'' species produce only one type of neurotoxin; however, the effects of A, B, E, or F on humans are essentially the same. Botulism does not spread from person to person. Botulism develops if a person ingests the toxin (or rarely, if it is inhaled or injected) or if the ''Clostridium ''spp. organisms grow in the ''intestines'' or wounds in the body and toxin is released.''The recorded history of botulism begins in 1735, when the disease was first associated with German sausage (food-borne disease or ''food poisoning'' after eating sausage). In 1870, a German physician by the name of Muller derived the name botulism from the Latin word for ''sausage''. ''Clostridium botulinum'' bacteria were first isolated in 1895, and a neurotoxin that it produces was isolated in 1944 by Dr. Edward Schantz. From 1949 to the 1950s, the toxin (named BoNT A) was shown to block neuromuscular transmissions in the nervous system by blocking the release of acetylcholine from motor nerve endings. Botulism toxin(s) are some of the most toxic substances known to man; while the toxin has been considered for use as a biological weapon, it has also been used to treat many medical conditions. In 1980, Dr. Alan B. Scott used the toxin to treat ''strabismus'' (deviation of the eye), and in December 1989, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved BoNT-A (''Botox'') for the treatment of ''strabismus'', ''blepharospasm'', and hemifacial spasm in young patients. The use of Botox to treat glabellar lines (''wrinkles'' and frown lines) was approved in 2002 by the FDA for cosmetic improvements; the FDA has approved many additional uses (for example, underarm ''sweating'', and ''muscle pain'' disorders) since 2002.''In 2017, at least 10 patients were hospitalized with botulism. All of the patients who got botulism ate a nacho cheese sauce served at a ''gas'' station near Sacramento, Calif. One patient had to spend at least three weeks in the intensive care unit with paralysis. There is one suspected death due to this botulism outbreak. In 2018, Kraft Heinz produced Taco Bell cheese dip was determined to have a risk of Clostridium contamination. Although no one has developed botulism to date, Kraft Heinz voluntarily recalled about 7,000 cases of the product because of a possible botulism risk.' "
What causes botulism?,"'Neurotoxin, synthesized and secreted by ''Clostridium botulinum'' bacteria (and a few other ''Clostridium'' species), cause botulism. The toxin causes the disease by blocking the release of acetylcholine from motor nerve endings. This result produces the symptoms associated with botulism.' "
What are risk factors for botulism?,"'The risk for developing botulism is increased by ingesting foods that may be improperly treated to kill ''C. botulinum'"" bacteria and their spores (for example, some home-canning methods or a failure in a canning company's production of canned foods like tomatoes or fish) and to denature any toxins. Some honey preparations may contain small amounts of the bacterial spores; infants under the age of 1 year are at risk if they are given honey. ""'Corn'' syrup was once implicated as a cause of botulism in infants, but this was eventually proven not to be the source of toxin. Botulism risk is increased if wounds become contaminated with soil or fecal material.' "
How many kinds of botulism are there?,"'There are three main kinds of botulism, which are categorized by the way in which the disease is acquired:''Three other kinds of botulism have been described but are seen rarely. The first is adult intestinal colonization that is seen in older children and adults with abnormal gastrointestinal tracts. Only rarely does intestinal infection with ''Clostridium botulinum'' occur in adults because the adult GI tract inactivates ingested ''Clostridium botulinum'' bacteria through gastric acid and enzymatic activity. Typically, the adult form of this intestinal botulism is related to abdominal surgical procedures that interfere with such inactivation mechanisms. The second kind (injection botulism) is seen in patients injected with inappropriately high amounts of therapeutic neurotoxin (for example, Botox, Dysport, Myobloc), while the third kind (''inhalation'' botulism) has occurred in laboratory personnel who work with the neurotoxins. All six kinds of botulism are potentially fatal.' Food-borne botulism is caused by eating foods that contain the botulinum neurotoxin. Recent small outbreaks have occurred in Canada due to fermented fish and in New York due to unrefrigerated bulk tofu contamination. Wound botulism is caused by neurotoxin produced within a wound that is infected with the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. Infant botulism occurs when an infant consumes the spores of the botulinum bacteria. The bacterial spores germinate, then grow in the intestines, and release the neurotoxin."
How serious is botulism?,"'Botulinum neurotoxin is considered one of the most potent, lethal substances known. As little as about 1 nanogram/kg can be lethal to an individual, and scientists have estimated that about 1 gram could potentially kill 1 million people. This small amount of toxin capable of killing humans has made the toxin a candidate for use in weapons for biowarfare and ''bioterrorism''. All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies. Foodborne botulism can be especially dangerous because many people can be poisoned by eating even small amounts of neurotoxin-contaminated food because the toxin is easily absorbed by the ''digestive system''. A botulism outbreak is a public health emergency that is reportable to the U.S. government.' "
How does botulism neurotoxin affect the body?,"'A neurotoxin actually paralyzes the nerves so that the muscles cannot contract. This happens when the neurotoxin enters nerve cells and eventually interferes with the release of acetylcholine so the nerve cannot stimulate the muscle to contract. Unless the nerve can regenerate a new axon that has no exposure to the neurotoxin, the interference at the neuromuscular junction is permanent. This is why it takes so long to recover from botulism and also why cosmetic and therapeutic uses of diluted neurotoxin can be effective for relatively lengthy time periods.' "
What kind of organism is Clostridium botulinum?,"'Clostridium botulinum'' is the name of bacteria commonly found in soil all over the world. The bacteria are considered to be anaerobic, which means these organisms grow best in low or absent oxygen levels. ''Clostridium ''bacteria are gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria that form spores that allow the bacteria to survive in a dormant state until exposed to conditions that can support growth. There are seven types of botulism neurotoxin designated by the letters A through G. Only types A, B, E, and F cause illness in humans.' "
How common is botulism?,"'Because of better canning processes, especially with home canning or home processing of food, the number of yearly cases of foodborne botulism has dropped to about 1,000 worldwide. In the United States, on average, 110 cases of botulism are reported each year. Of these, nearly 25% of cases are foodborne botulism, approximately 72% are infant botulism, and the remainder (about 3%) are wound botulism, which until recently was rare. Outbreaks of foodborne botulism involving two or more people are usually caused by eating contaminated home canned foods. The number of cases of foodborne and infant botulism has changed little in recent years. However, the incidence of wound botulism has increased, especially in California, from the use of black-tar ''heroin'', which causes infected wounds at heroin injection sites.' "
What are botulism symptoms and signs?,"'The classic symptoms of botulism include''The classic symptoms may also be accompanied by other symptoms and signs such as''Constipation'"" may occur. The health care professional's examination may reveal that the gag reflex and the deep tendon reflexes like the knee-jerk reflex are decreased or absent.""'Infants with botulism appear lethargic, weak, and floppy, feed poorly, become constipated, and have a weak cry and poor muscle tone. In infants, ''constipation'' is often the first symptom to occur.''These are all symptoms and signs related to the muscle paralysis that is caused by the bacterial neurotoxin. If untreated, these symptoms and signs may progress to cause paralysis in various parts of the body, often seen as a descending paralysis of the arms, legs, trunk, and ''breathing'' muscles that can lead to death.'   double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, muscle weakness (resulting in a flaccid paralysis). dilated pupil(s), dizziness, fatigue, constipation, abdominal discomfort or pain, nausea, vomiting, drooling, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, slow or absent reflexes, urinary retention, facial weakness, eye muscle weakness, and paralysis."
How soon do botulism symptoms appear?,"'In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18-36 hours after eating a contaminated food, but they can occur as early as six hours or as late as 10 days afterward.'  "
What health specialists treat botulism?,"""In addition to the patient's primary care physician, other health care professionals may be appropriate to consult; for example, for hospitalized patients, a critical care specialist, ""'neurologist'', infectious-disease specialist, and a pediatric specialist if a child or infant has the disease.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose botulism?,"""The patient's history and physical examination may suggest botulism, but these clues are usually not enough to allow a diagnosis of botulism. Symptoms of other diseases, such as a ""'stroke'', Guillain-Barré syndrome (another disease of muscle paralysis), and ''myasthenia gravis'' (which also causes weakness and ''eyelid'' drooping) can appear similar to those of botulism. Special tests may be needed to exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, spinal fluid examination, nerve conduction test (electromyography, or ''EMG''), and a Tensilon test for ''myasthenia gravis''. However, if botulism is strongly suspected (for example, several patients with botulism symptoms who ate from the same home-preserved food container), samples should be obtained for a mouse inoculation test (see below) and then the patients should be treated immediately with botulism antiserum. These tests will help distinguish botulism from infections with ''Salmonella'', ''E. coli'', and other ''Clostridium'' species (tetani).'""The most direct way to confirm the diagnosis is to identify the botulinum neurotoxin in the patient's blood, serum, or ""'stool'"". This is done by injecting the patient's serum or ""'stool'' into the peritoneal ''cavity'' of mice. An equal amount of serum or stool from the patient is treated with multivalent antitoxin and injected in other mice. If the antitoxin-treated serum- or stool-injected mice live while those injected with untreated serum or stool die, then this is a positive test for botulism and is called the mouse inoculation test. The bacteria can also be isolated from the stool of people with foodborne and infant botulism, but this is not a definitive test. However, stool cultures can help differentiate botulism from ''E. coli'', ''Salmonella'', and other infectious agents.'  "
What is the treatment for botulism?,"""If diagnosed early, foodborne and wound botulism can be treated with an antitoxin that blocks the action of neurotoxin circulating in the blood. The trivalent antitoxin (effective against three neurotoxins: A, B, and E) is dispensed from quarantine stations by the U.S. government's Centers for Disease Control and ""'Prevention'' (CDC). The antitoxin can prevent the disorder from worsening, but recovery still takes many weeks. Another heptavalent antitoxin (effective against seven neurotoxins: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) may be available from the U.S. Army or FEMA. However, HBAT (botulinum antitoxin, heptavalent) is replacing other antitoxins and is available from the CDC Emergency Operations Center; call 770-488-7100 for information and supplies.''Physicians may remove whatever contaminated food is still in the gut by inducing ''vomiting'' or by using enemas. Wounds should be treated, usually surgically, to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria. Good supportive care (intravenous [IV] fluids, breathing support, for example) in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all botulism types.'""Enemas may be used to remove unabsorbed toxin; however, magnesium salts, citrate, and sulfate are not used as they may add to the toxin's strength. Antibiotics (high-dose IV ""'penicillins'' or other antibiotics) are not used in foodborne botulism but are used in wound botulism; surgical debridement may also be needed. Consultation with an infectious-disease specialist is recommended to help manage treatment protocols.''Antitoxin was not routinely given for the treatment of infant botulism. However, now recommended is the use of BabyBIG (human immune globulin given IV) that is considered safe and effective. Unfortunately, it can only be obtained from the California Department of Public Health (call 510-231-7600), and it reportedly costs $45,300. The respiratory failure and paralysis that occur with severe botulism may require a patient to be on a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator) for weeks and may require intensive medical and ''nursing'' care (nasogastric suction, IV augmented ''nutrition'', and Foley catheter, for example). After several weeks, the paralysis slowly improves as axons in the nerves are regenerated.'  "
What are complications from botulism?,"'Botulism can result in death from respiratory failure. In the past 50 years, the rate of death from botulism has fallen significantly. Unfortunately, a patient with severe botulism may require not only a breathing machine for ventilation but also intensive medical and nursing care for several months to survive.''Patients who survive an episode of botulism poisoning may experience ''fatigue'' and shortness of breath for years, and long-term therapy may be needed to aid recovery.''In 2009, the FDA increased its label precautions on the three available products: Botox, Dysport, and Myobloc. All three are different formulations of the toxin and are not interchangeable with regard to dosing. In addition, the FDA cautions that all the symptoms of botulism can occur if the treatments are inappropriately given, especially in high doses or if some of the solution seeps out of the localized area where it is injected. The FDA further warned health care professionals that suppliers of medical toxins that do not have FDA approval may supply faulty products that could harm individuals.' "
What is the prognosis of people with botulism?,"'Untreated botulism has a mortality rate (death rate) of about 50%. Appropriately treated patients with botulism currently still have a mortality rate of about 3%-5%. Some patients may experience various degrees of paralysis for many months. In general, the earlier the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, the better is the prognosis. However, outcomes may be considered only fair in some patients who develop ''chronic fatigue'' and shortness of breath for many years after the initial diagnosis and treatment of botulism.' "
Is it possible to prevent botulism?,"'Yes, botulism prevention is possible. Foodborne botulism has often come from improperly prepared home canned foods such as asparagus, green beans, beets, and ''corn''. However, there have been outbreaks of botulism from more unusual sources such as chopped ''garlic'' in oil, agave nectar, chili peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, tomato sauce, improperly handled baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil, and home canned or fermented fish. People who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to prevent or kill ''Clostridium'' bacteria, their spores, and neutralize its neurotoxin. Oils that are infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes that have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Bacon should be cooked well since bacon preservatives (salts), which inhibit clostridial spores, have been reduced. Because botulism neurotoxin is destroyed by high temperatures (85 C for five minutes), people who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to help ensure that the food is safe to consume and reduce the possibility of getting ''food poisoning''. Other canned foods that are commercially produced (especially low-acid foods like vegetables, meats, and seafood) and bulging (the can is deformed and looks like it is over-pressurized) or if abnormal-smelling preserved foods are found, they should be discarded. Do not taste-test them or attempt to ''boil'' the food!''Because honey can contain spores of ''Clostridium botulinum'' and this has been a source of infection for infants, children less than 12 months of age should not be fed honey. Honey is relatively safe for people 1 year of age and older.''Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds or skin ''cuts'' and avoiding injectable street ''drugs''.'""The FDA publishes recall lists of commercially produced foods that may contain botulinum toxin. One large recall was Castleberry Food Company's hot dog chili sauces and dog food in 2007. In October 2009, Plumb Organics issued a recall of ""'baby food'' (apple and carrot preparations) that was thought to be tainted with botulinum toxin. In October 2015, Seaquest Seafood Corp., in California, recalled its Sunrise brand marinated fish. Several types were recalled by the FDA due to potential ''Clostridium botulinum'' contamination. Several other FDA recalls have occurred in 2015, including one in Ohio due to home canned potatoes that killed one and sickened about 50-60 others. Avoiding such potential sources of toxin can prevent botulism.''Vaccine'' development for the major human types of botulism neurotoxin is currently being investigated, but there is no vaccine commercially available or approved for public use by the FDA. However, in the United States, an investigational pentavalent (against neurotoxins A, B, C, D, and E) botulinum toxoid vaccine can be distributed by the CDC for laboratory workers at high risk of exposure to botulinum toxin and by the military for protection of troops against attack. Unfortunately, it takes several months to induce immunity. In 2009, a research finding with molecules that mimic botulism toxin binding sites was described that may provide another method to block toxin from binding to nerve tissues, but this approach is only in the research phase of development.''The herb ''milk thistle'' has been suggested by alternative medicine proponents (mainly in Europe) to treat food poisoning (especially mushroom poisoning) and to help detoxify the ''liver''. There are no good data on its use in preventing or treating botulism.' "
Is botulism neurotoxin really considered to be a potential biological weapon?,"'Yes. However, the neurotoxin rapidly inactivates when exposed to air and is relatively unstable even in liquid formulations in contrast to other disease agents like organisms that cause ''anthrax''. Even with these drawbacks, the neurotoxin has been used sporadically in attempts to harm or kill individuals. Botulinum toxin could be used to contaminate food supplies, but some experts suggest that dissemination of the toxin as an aerosol would be more effective. During the Gulf War, Iraq reportedly produced 20,000 L of botulinum toxin and used 12,000 L for field-testing and to fill warheads, but the shells were not used. The Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan tried and failed three times to use the toxin as an aerosol weapon. Scientists in Russia also have experimented with botulinum toxin as a weapon. These situations are described in detail in the literature that discusses chemical and biological warfare.' "
Why are botulism neurotoxins used as cosmetic treatments or treatments for some medical conditions?,"'Interestingly, purified and highly diluted botulism toxin is being used to treat conditions that are characterized by abnormal muscle contractions. (Some examples of these conditions are ''torticollis'', spasmodic dysphonia, ''achalasia'', ''strabismus'', oromandibular ''dystonia'', cervical ''dystonia'', and blepharospasm.)''Wrinkles'' are caused by repeated normal muscle contractions...no muscle contractions, no ''wrinkles''. Consequently, many people elect to have an FDA-approved formulation of the dilute toxin injected to reduce or stop wrinkles in the skin. This wrinkle treatment was first approved by the FDA in 2002. Possible side effects of this treatment include ''bruising'', ''ptosis'' (abnormal drooping of a body part, especially the eyelid), ''nausea'', and dysphasia (''difficulty with speech''), but other side effects may also occur. The last reference listed below shows pictures of frown line treatment with Botox.''Some physicians use botulinum toxin ''type A'' as a treatment of gastrointestinal complications of ''diabetes''.'  "
What is the Bourbon virus?,"'Of the ''viruses'' of the genus ''Thogotovirus'' (family ''Orthomyxoviridae'') known to cause human disease, Bourbon virus is the most recently discovered. Bourbon virus got its name from the location where the first human case was discovered. In 2014, a man became seriously ill in Bourbon County, Kansas, several days after working outdoors and finding several engorged ticks attached to him. Multiple tests for bacterial and viral causes did not detect a cause of the illness. After an 11-day illness during which he continued to have ''fevers'', he developed multi-organ failure and died. The CDC performed reverse transcriptase ''polymerase chain reaction'' (RT-''PCR'') testing on samples of his blood, initially looking for Heartland virus. The CDC instead discovered a novel RNA virus, and further analysis confirmed that it belonged to the ''Thogotovirus'' genus. Bourbon virus is the only one of the three ''viruses'' of this type (including Thogoto and Dhori viruses) to be found in the United States. The others were found in Nigeria.''Surveillance testing of ticks has been conducted since 2015 in Bourbon and Linn Counties after the new virus was discovered. The majority of ticks collected have been soft-bodied ticks of the species ''Amblyomma americanum'' (also called the Lone Star tick), which was found to carry both Heartland virus and Bourbon virus. It is still unclear how frequently the tick species acquires or transmits Bourbon virus. Only a few cases of Bourbon virus disease have been reported since 2015 in the southern U.S. and Midwest.''In addition to Heartland and Bourbon virus, the Lone Star tick can carry and transmit ''Powassan'' virus, which causes a serious ''encephalitis''. Its range is mainly in the Southeast U.S. but can be found in the Northeast and Midwest. The Lone Star tick can also transmit southern tick-associated ''rash'' illness (STARI) and ehrlichiosis. It also is associated with meat ''allergy'' (alpha gal syndrome) that causes mild to severe reactions (including ''anaphylaxis'') after eating red meat.' "
What causes Bourbon virus disease?,'Bourbon virus causes Bourbon virus disease.' 
What are risk factors for Bourbon virus disease?,"'The bite of the Lone Star tick (''Amblyomma americanum'"") transmits the virus. Thus, the risk factors for Bourbon virus disease include activities that increase the risk of tick bites from this tick species. The Lone Star tick inhabits the Southeastern U.S. and Midwest, but it is spreading to the north and west. Researchers don't know whether the Bourbon virus spreads via this tick in other areas or by other insects.""'The risk factors for Lone Star tick bites include hiking or ''walking'' in wooded grassy areas. Unlike other tick-borne diseases, it is not known how long the tick must be attached to transmit Bourbon virus.' "
Is Bourbon virus disease contagious?,'Bourbon virus disease does not appear to spread from person to person or from an animal to a human.' 
What is the incubation period for Bourbon virus disease?,"'The incubation period for Bourbon virus disease is not known, but at least two cases have described tick bites within 3 days of developing symptoms. It is not known whether the virus may have been transmitted by other tick bites earlier than these.' "
What are Bourbon virus disease symptoms and signs?,"'Very little is known about Bourbon virus disease. Based on the few cases reported so far, symptoms and signs include ''fevers'', extreme ''fatigue'', pale pink ''rash'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', severe ''headache'', and body aches. Laboratory findings include low white blood cell count (leukopenia), ''low platelet count'' (''thrombocytopenia''), and elevation of ''liver'' enzyme tests.' "
What tests diagnose Bourbon virus disease?,'The CDC is able to test for the genetic material of Bourbon virus using ''PCR'' techniques.' 
What doctors treat Bourbon virus disease?,"'Emergency specialists, internal medicine specialists (including critical care and hospital medicine specialists), pediatricians, and infectious disease specialists are most likely to play roles in managing a case of Bourbon virus disease in the hospital.' "
What are treatment options for Bourbon virus disease?,"'There is no currently recommended antiviral medicine for this virus, and antibiotics are not useful for treating viruses. The treatment of Bourbon virus disease focuses on supportive care, which treats the symptoms of the disease as it progresses. A patient may need critical care in an intensive care unit, including respiratory and other support.''Studies of Bourbon virus infection in mice suggest a possible role of deficient immunity to viral infections in causing disease. Treatment of mice with alpha-''interferon'', as well as antiviral ''drugs'' used to treat other RNA viruses, were found to effectively reduce viral replication. Both ''ribavirin'' and favipiravir (T-705; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) were tested. While ''ribavirin'' and alpha-''interferon'' are commercially available ''drugs'', favipiravir is an investigational drug that has shown promise against ''influenza'' and some hemorrhagic ''fever'' viruses. It is possible that one or more of these drugs may be useful in treating human Bourbon virus infections in the future. Favipiravir may also hold promise in preventing the disease after exposure (prophylaxis).' "
Are there home remedies for Bourbon virus disease?,'There are no known home remedies for treating Bourbon virus disease.' 
What is the prognosis and survival rate for Bourbon virus disease?,"'The prognosis and overall survival rate of Bourbon virus disease have not been determined because of the limited number of known cases. At least two of the individuals with Bourbon virus disease, one in Kansas, and one in Missouri, have died.' "
How can people prevent Bourbon virus disease?,"'For now, based on limited knowledge, it is possible that people can prevent Bourbon virus disease by preventing bites from Lone Star ticks. You can prevent tick bites when hiking by staying on trails and avoiding areas of high grass or that are wooded, as well as wearing long sleeves and long pants, and tucking hems into socks. Clothing and camping gear can be treated with 0.5% permethrin products. Use insect repellants that are U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered and contain 2-undecanone, DEET, picaridin, IR3535, para-menthane-diol, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Treat clothing, boots, and tents with products containing 0.5% permethrin. EPA has an online repellent search tool that can help with choosing the best options.' "
About BSE,"'BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is a progressive neurological disorder of cattle that results from infection by an unusual transmissible agent called a prion. The nature of the transmissible agent is not well understood. Currently, the most accepted theory is that the agent is a modified form of a normal protein known as prion protein. For reasons that are not yet understood, the normal prion protein changes into a pathogenic (harmful) form that then damages the central nervous system of cattle.'""Research indicates that the first probable infections of BSE in cows occurred during the 1970's with two cases of BSE being identified in 1986. BSE possibly originated as a result of feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that contained BSE-infected products from a spontaneously occurring case of BSE or scrapie-infected sheep products. Scrapie is a prion disease of sheep. There is strong evidence and general agreement that the outbreak was then amplified and spread throughout the United Kingdom cattle industry by feeding rendered, prion-infected, bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.""'The BSE epizootic in the United Kingdom peaked in January 1993 at almost 1,000 new cases per week. Over the next 17 years, the annual numbers of BSE cases has dropped sharply; 14,562 cases in 1995, 1,443 in 2000, 225 in 2005 and 11 cases in 2010. Cumulatively, through the end of 2010, more than 184,500 cases of BSE had been confirmed in the United Kingdom alone in more than 35,000 herds.''There exists strong epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for a causal association between a new human prion disease called variant ''Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'' (vCJD) that was first reported from the United Kingdom in 1996 and the BSE outbreak in cattle. The interval between the most likely period for the initial extended exposure of the population to potentially BSE-contaminated food (1984-1986) and the onset of initial variant CJD cases (1994-1996) is consistent with known incubation periods for the human forms of prion disease.''Through February 2015, BSE surveillance has identified 24 cases in North America: 4 BSE cases in the United States and 20 in Canada. Of the 4 cases identified in the United States, one was born in Canada; of the 20 cases identified in Canada, one was imported from the United Kingdom (see figure above).' "
BSE Cases Identified in the United States,"'There have been 4 cases of BSE identified in the United States. The following information provides descriptions of these 4 cases:' On December 23, 2003, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a presumptive diagnosis of the first known case of BSE in the United States. It was in an adult Holstein cow from Washington State. This diagnosis was confirmed by an international reference laboratory in Weybridge, England, on December 25. Trace-back based on an ear-tag identification number and subsequent genetic testing confirmed that the BSE-infected cow was imported into the United States from Canada in August 2001. Because the animal was non-ambulatory (a ""downer cow"") at slaughter, brain tissue samples were taken by USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as part of its targeted surveillance for BSE. However the animal's condition was attributed to complications from calving. After the animal was examined by a USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) veterinary medical officer both before and after slaughter, the carcass was released for use as food for human consumption. During slaughter, the tissues considered to be at high risk for the transmission of the BSE agent were removed. On December 24, 2003, FSIS recalled beef from cattle slaughtered in the same plant on the same day as the BSE positive cow. On June 24, 2005, the USDA announced receipt of final results from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, England, confirming BSE in a cow that had conflicting test results in 2004. This cow was from Texas, died at approximately 12 years of age, and represented the first endemic case of BSE in the United States. On March 15, 2006, the USDA announced the confirmation of BSE in a cow in Alabama. The case was identified in a non-ambulatory (downer) cow on a farm in Alabama. The animal was euthanized by a local veterinarian and buried on the farm. The age of the cow was estimated by examination of the dentition as 10-years-old. It had no ear tags or distinctive marks; the herd of origin could not be identified despite an intense investigation. In August 2008, several ARS investigators reported that a rare, genetic abnormality that may persist within the cattle population ""is considered to have caused"" BSE in this atypical (H-type) BSE animal from Alabama. On April 24, 2012, the USDA confirmed a BSE case in a dairy cow in California. This cow was tested as part of the USDA targeted BSE surveillance at rendering facilities in the United States. The cow was 10 years and 7 months old and was classified as having the L-type BSE strain."
BSE Cases Identified in Canadian-born Cattle,"'As of February 18, 2015, 20 BSE cases in Canadian-born cattle have been identified, 19 in Canada and 1 in the U.S. Of these 20 cases, 14 were known to have been born after the implementation of the 1997 Canadian feed ban ; 13 of these 14 were born after March 1, 1999. (See Figure above: BSE Cases in North America, by Year and Country of Death, 1993-02/2015). This latter date is particularly relevant to the U.S. because since a USDA rule went into effect on November 19, 2007, Canadian cattle born on or after March 1, 1999 have been legally imported into this country for any use. One of the 20 Canadian-born BSE cases was reported in an animal that was most likely born before or possibly very shortly after implementation of the 1997 feed ban. Based on the known or most likely year of birth, an average of 1.4 cases of BSE occurred among the group of animals born each year in Canada from 1991 through 2004. The highest reported number of cases by birth year in a single year, 3 BSE cases, occurred in 2000, 2001 and 2002. The most recently reported case extends the period of BSE transmission in Canada through at least the early half of 2009.' "
Strains of BSE,"'There is increasing evidence that there are different strains of BSE: the typical BSE strain responsible for the outbreak in the United Kingdom and two atypical strains (H and L strains).''All (3) of the U.S.-born BSE cases and two of the 20 Canadian-born BSE cases were 10 years of age or older and caused by atypical BSE strains. Of these 5 older North American cases, 3 were linked to an atypical BSE strain known as the H-type. The strain type for the other two older North American cases, a 13-year-old BSE-infected Canadian cow and a 10-year-old BSE-infected US cow, have been identified as the L-type.' Typical BSE strain -- The BSE strain responsible for most of the BSE cases in Canada is the same classic or typical strain linked to the outbreak in the United Kingdom. It is known to be preventable through elimination of BSE contaminated feed and has been causally linked to vCJD in humans. This typical strain has not yet been identified in any U.S.-born cattle. Atypical BSE strain -- In July 2007, the UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) suggested that atypical BSE may be a distinct strain of prion disease. Unlike typical BSE, cases of atypical BSE, according to SEAC, may have risen spontaneously (although transmission through feed or the environment cannot be ruled out). Recently reported French surveillance data support this theory that unlike typical BSE, atypical BSE appears to represent sporadic disease."
Feed Bans,"'As of October 26, 2009, a regulation issued by FDA in April 2009 came into effect establishing an enhanced BSE-related feed ban in the United States. This enhanced ban will further harmonize BSE feed control measures in the U.S. with those in Canada (see below). In addition, FDA continues to enforce its important 1997 mammalian-to-ruminant feed ban through its BSE inspection and BSE feed testing programs.''As of July 12, 2007, an enhanced BSE-related feed ban came into effect in Canada. CFIA established this ban to more effectively prevent and quickly eliminate BSE from Canada. The enhanced ban prohibits most proteins, including potentially BSE infectious tissues known as ""specified risk materials"" (SRM) from all animal feeds, pet foods, and fertilizers, not just from cattle feed as required by the ban instituted in 1997. The 1997 feed ban in Canada was similar to the feed ban instituted in the United States that same year. As recently reported by CFIA, removing SRM from the entire animal feed system addresses risks associated with the potential contamination of cattle feed during production, distribution, storage, and use. Applying the same measure to pet food and fertilizer materials addresses the possible exposure of cattle and other susceptible animals to these products. CFIA expects that with this new ban, BSE should be eliminated from the Canadian cattle herd by about the year 2017.''The Canadian-born cow confirmed to be infected with BSE in 2015 illustrates the difficulty in determining the effectiveness of previously instituted feed bans to prevent BSE transmissions. The initial feed bans established in both the United States and Canada were instituted in 1997. After an assessment by USDA and its Canadian counterparts, the Canadian feed ban was judged to be fully effectiveness as of March 1999. However, largely because of recognized limitations of this ban and the ban established in the United States, new, enhanced feed bans went into effect in Canada, July 12, 2007, and in the U.S., October 26, 2009. While USDA has confirmed no U.S.-born cattle as having a classic form of BSE, Canadian cattle born after March 1999 have been legally imported into the United States for any purpose since November 19, 2007.' "
BSE Prevalence,"'Based on World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) standards for BSE surveillance, the reported national prevalence rates of BSE in North American cattle, particularly in animals born in the United States, is very low, and therefore, difficult to measure accurately. In September 2007, the USDA published updated results of the two statistical models used by Harvard University investigators to estimate the prevalence of BSE in Canada. The results incorporated the 11 Canadian-born animals with BSE that had been reported at that time. A key advantage of these models is that they provide statistical confidence limits that measure some of the uncertainty associated with expected estimates. This model estimated that the true prevalence of BSE in Canada has been 90% likely to be between 18-fold and 48-fold higher than the previously published best estimate of the prevalence of BSE in the United States (3.0 to 8.0 cases per million in Canada compared to a best estimate of 0.167 cases per million in the United States). The previously published best estimate of Canada\'s BSE prevalence in 2006 using the BSurveE model was 23-fold higher than that of the United States and is the estimate of the BSE prevalence in Canada that continues to be used in the Harvard Risk Assessments\' ""worst case"" analyses when evaluating the risk of imported Canadian cattle causing BSE to spread among U.S. animals.' "
What Is Bowel Diversion Surgery?,"'Bowel diversion surgery allows ''stool'' to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the ''large intestine'' is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any part of the small or ''large intestine''.''Some bowel diversion surgeries (those called ostomy surgery)divert the bowel to an opening in the abdomen where a ''stoma'"" is created. A surgeon forms a stoma by rolling the bowel's end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. An ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect ""'stool''.''Other bowel diversion surgeries reconfigure the ''intestines'' after damaged portions are removed. For example, after removing the colon, a surgeon can create a colon like pouch out of the last part of the small intestine, avoiding the need for an ostomy pouch.''Cancer'', ''trauma'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''), bowel obstruction, and ''diverticulitis'' are all possible reasons for bowel diversion surgery.''' "
Which Parts of the Gastrointestinal Tract Are Affected by Bowel Diversion Surgeries?,"'Bowel diversion surgeries affect the large intestine and often the small intestine.''Small Intestine''''The small intestine runs from the stomach to the large intestine and has three main sections: the duodenum, which is the first 10 inches; the jejunum, which is the middle 8 ''feet''; and the ileum, which is the final 12 ''feet''. Bowel diversion surgeries only affect the ileum.''''\xa0''Large Intestine''''The large intestine is about 5 feet long and runs from the small intestine to the anus. The colon and rectum are the two main sections of the large intestine. Semisolid digestive waste enters the colon from the small intestine. Gradually, the colon absorbs moisture and forms stool as digestive waste moves toward the rectum. The rectum is about 6 inches long and is located right before the anus. The rectum stores stool, which leaves the body through the anus. The rectum and anus control bowel movements.' "
What are the different types of bowel diversion surgery?,"'Several surgical options exist for bowel diversion.''Some people only need a temporary bowel diversion; others need permanent bowel diversion.' Ileostomy diverts the ileum to a stoma. Semisolid waste flows out of the stoma and collects in an ostomy pouch, which must be emptied several times a day. An ileostomy bypasses the colon, rectum, and anus and has the fewest complications. Colostomy is similar to an ileostomy, but the colon (not the ileum)is diverted to a stoma. As with an ileostomy, stool collects in an ostomy pouch. Ileoanal reservoir surgery is an option when the large intestine is removed but the anus remains intact and disease-free. The surgeon creates a colonlike pouch, called an ileoanal reservoir, from the last several inches of the ileum. The ileoanal reservoir is also called a pelvic pouch or J-pouch. Stool collects in the ileoanal reservoir and then exits the body through the anus during a bowel movement. People who have undergone ileoanal reservoir surgery initially have about six to 10 bowel movements a day. Two or more surgeries are usually required, including a temporary ileostomy, and an adjustment period lasting several months is needed for the newly formed ileoanal reservoir to stretch and adjust to its new function. After the adjustment period, bowel movements decrease to as few as 4 to 6 a day. Continent ileostomy is an option for people who are not good candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery because of damage to the rectum or anus but do not want to wear an ostomy pouch. As with ileoanal reservoir surgery, the large intestine is removed and a colon-like pouch, called a Kock pouch, is made from the end of the ileum. The surgeon connects the Kock pouch to a stoma. A Kock pouch must be drained each day by inserting a tube through the stoma. An ostomy pouch is not needed and the stoma is covered by a patch when it is not in use."
Which bowel diversion surgery is appropriate?,"'The type, degree, and location of bowel damage, and personal preference, are all factors in determining which surgery is most appropriate. For example, people whose disease affects the ileum are poor candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery or continent ileostomy because of the increased risk of disease recurrence and the need for pouch removal.''Discussing treatment options with a doctor and seeking the advice of an ostomy nursea (specialist who cares for people with bowel diversions)are highly recommended.' "
Concerns Related to Bowel Diversion,"'Although bowel diversion surgery can bring great relief, many people fear the practical, social, and psychological issues related to bowel diversion. An ostomy nurse is trained to help patients deal with these issues both before and after surgery. People living with an ostomy or who need bowel diversion surgery may also find useful advice and information through local or online support groups.' "
Bowel Diversion Surgery at A Glance," Bowel diversion surgery allows stool to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the large intestine is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any portion of the small or large intestine. The type, degree, and location of bowel damage, and personal preference, are all factors in determining which bowel diversion surgery is most appropriate. An ostomy nurse can help patients deal with the practical, social, and psychological issues related to bowel diversion."
Hope through Research,"'The National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases conducts and supports basic and clinical research into many digestive disorders, including ''inflammatory bowel disease'' and ''diverticular disease''.''Participants in ''clinical trials'' can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research.

What is borderline personality disorder (BPD)?,"'Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a ''mental illness'"" that is part of the group of mental illnesses called personality disorders. Like other personality disorders, it is characterized by a consistent pattern of thinking, feeling, and interacting with others and with the world that tends to result in significant problems for the sufferer. Specifically, BPD is associated with a pattern of unstable ways of seeing oneself, feeling, behaving, and relating to other people that markedly interferes with the individual's ability to function. Also, as with other personality disorders, the person is usually an adolescent or adult before they can be assessed as meeting full symptom criteria for BPD.""'Historically, BPD has been thought to be a set of symptoms that includes both mood problems (neuroses) and distortions of reality (psychosis) and therefore was thought to be on the borderline between mood problems and ''schizophrenia''. However, it is now understood that while the symptoms of BPD may straddle those symptom complexes, this illness is more closely related to other personality disorders in terms of how it may develop and occur within families. BPD is now understood to occur equally in men and women in the general population, while mostly in women in groups of people who are receiving mental health treatment (clinical populations). The frequency with which this disorder occurs is also thought to be considerably higher than previously thought, affecting nearly 6% of adults over the course of a lifetime.'  "
What other disorders often occur with BPD?,"'Men with BPD are more likely to also have a substance-related disorder and women with this illness are more likely to suffer from an eating disorder. In adolescents, BPD tends to co-occur with more anxious and peculiar personality disorders like schizotypal and passive aggressive personality disorder, respectively. Adults who have ''antisocial personality disorder'', also colloquially called sociopaths, may be more likely to also have BPD. Interestingly, even people who have some symptoms (traits) of BPD but do not meet full diagnostic criteria for the illness can have traits of both BPD and ''narcissistic personality disorder''.''While there has been some controversy as to whether or not BPD is truly its own disorder or a variation of ''bipolar disorder'', research supports the theory that BPD, like virtually every medical or other mental health disorder, can present in nearly as many unique and complex ways as there are people who have it. In other words, some individuals with BPD will have that disorder alone, while others will have it in combination with bipolar or another mental disorder. Still others will appear to have BPD but really qualify for the diagnosis of ''bipolar disorder'' and vice versa.''Obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD'') can also co-occur with BPD. It is thought to be particularly true of people who have ''OCD'' and bipolar disorder. BPD is not recognized worldwide. It is most closely diagnosed as emotionally unstable personality disorder in the International Classification of Disease, or ICD-10. Although countries like China and India recognize mental disorders that have some symptoms in common with BPD, its existence is not formally recognized.' "
What causes borderline personality disorder?,"'Although there is no specific cause for BPD, it is understood to be the result of a combination of biological predispositions, ways of understanding the world, and social stressors (biopsychosocial model). Biologically, people with BPD are more likely to have abnormalities in the size of the hippocampus, in the size and functioning of the amygdala, and in the functioning of the frontal lobes, which are the areas of the brain that are understood to regulate emotions and integrate thoughts with emotions. Although some research indicates that people with BPD seem to have areas of the brain that are more and less active compared to individuals who do not have the disorder, other research contradicts that.''While BPD is not thought to be genetic, it can somewhat run in families. Psychologically, BPD seems to make a person more vulnerable to having unstable ''moods'', particularly impulsive aggression. Socially, this disorder predisposes sufferers to developing insecurity, to be more likely to excessively expect to be criticized or rejected and negatively personalize disinterest or ''inattention'' from other people. These tendencies result in BPD sufferers having significantly impaired social relationships. In addition to these problems, people with BPD are more likely to have suffered from ''trauma'' in the form of childhood abuse or neglectful ''parenting''.' "
What are the risk factors for borderline personality disorder?,"'Adults who come from families of origin where divorce, neglect, sexual abuse, substance abuse, or death occurred are at higher risk of developing BPD. In children, the risk for developing this disorder appears to increase when they have a learning problem or certain temperaments. Adolescents who develop ''alcohol abuse'' or ''addiction'' are also apparently at higher risk of developing BPD compared to those who do not.' "
What are borderline personality disorder symptoms and signs?,"'As per the ''DSM'' (''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'') definition, in order to qualify for the diagnosis of BPD, an individual must have at least five of the following symptoms:'   Distorted, unstable self-image, in that they may drastically and rapidly change in the way they understand their own likes, dislikes, strengths, challenges, goals, and even their basic value as a person, even to the point of having feelings of worthlessness Repeatedly unstable relationships, in that individuals with this disorder repeatedly, rapidly, and drastically change from seeing another person as nearly perfect (idealizing) to seeing the same person as being bad or nearly worthless (devaluing) Unstable emotions (affects), in that the sufferer experiences marked, rapid mood swings (for example, severe depression/dysphoria, guilt, anger, irritability, joy, euphoria, anxiety, including panic attacks and sadness) that are stress related, even if the stresses may be seen as minor or negligible to others Frantic efforts to avoid loneliness or being abandoned, whether the abandonment is real or imagined Significant impulsivity (the person tends to act before thinking), in at least two aspects that can be self-damaging (for example, sexual behaviors, eating or spending habits, driving behaviors, or in the use of substances) Repeated self-mutilating behaviors, thoughts of suicide, suicidal behaviors, threats, or attempts Chronic, persistent feelings of emptiness Inappropriate, intense hostility or anger, a lack of restraint or other difficulty managing those or other potentially negative emotions when they occur Transient, stress-related paranoid thoughts or severe dissociation (lapses in memory)"
How do health care professionals diagnose borderline personality disorder?,"'There is no specific definitive test, like a blood test, that can accurately assess that a person has BPD. People who are concerned that they may suffer from BPD might further consider that possibility by taking a self-test, either an online or printable test. To determine the presence of this disorder, practitioners conduct a mental health interview that looks for the presence of the symptoms, also called diagnostic criteria, described previously. As with any mental health assessment, the health care practitioner will usually work toward ruling out other mental disorders, including mood problems, ''depression'', ''anxiety'' disorders including ''anxiety'' attacks or generalized ''anxiety'', eating disorders such as ''binge eating disorder'', ''bulimia'' and ''anorexia'', and other personality disorders including ''narcissistic personality disorder'', dependent personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder, drug-abuse problems as well as problems being in touch with reality, like ''schizophrenia'' or delusional disorder. Besides determining if the person suffers from BPD, the mental health professional may assess that while some symptoms (traits) of the disorder are present, the person does not fully qualify for the condition.'""The professional will also likely try to ensure that the person is not suffering from a medical problem that may cause emotional symptoms. The mental health practitioner will therefore often inquire about when the person has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood testing, and any other tests that a medical professional deems necessary to ensure that the individual is not suffering from a medical condition instead of or in addition to emotional symptoms. Due to the use of a mental health interview in establishing the diagnosis and the fact that this illness can be quite resistant to treatment, it is of great importance that the practitioner conduct a thorough evaluation and interview family members, when appropriate with the patient's permission. This is to assure that the person is not incorrectly assessed as having BPD when he or she does not."" "
What is the treatment for borderline personality disorder?,"'Clinical trials'' have determined that different forms of psychotherapy have been found to effectively treat BPD. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a method of psychotherapy in which the therapist specifically addresses four areas that tend to be particularly problematic for individuals with BPD: self-image, impulsive behaviors, mood instability, and problems in relating to others. To address those areas, treatment with DBT tries to build four major behavioral skill areas: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.'""Another psychotherapy approach that is specifically designed to treat BPD is mentalization-based treatment. Based on understanding of how, when, and the quality of attachments people form, its goal is to improve the person's ability to understand his or her own and others' mental states. This treatment approach uses weekly individual therapy and group sessions over 18 months.""'Talk therapy that focuses on helping the person understand how their thoughts and behaviors affect each other (cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT) has also been found to be effective treatment for BPD. Schema therapy, also called schema-focused cognitive therapy, is based on a theory that many maladaptive ways of thinking (cognitions) are the result of past experiences. This approach to psychotherapy has also been found to alleviate the symptoms of BPD.'""Other psychotherapy approaches that have been used to address BPD include interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and psychoanalytic therapy. IPT is a type of psychotherapy that addresses how the person's symptoms are related to the problems that person has in relating to others. Psychoanalytic therapy, which seeks to help the individual understand and better manage his or her ways of defending against negative emotions, has been found to be effective in addressing BPD, especially when the therapist is more active or vocal than in traditional psychoanalytic treatment and when this approach is used in the context of current rather than past relationships. Considered a form of psychodynamic psychotherapy, transference-focused psychotherapy involves the therapist clarifying, confronting, and interpreting the evolving reactions that the person with BPD has toward the therapist that are thought to be a repetition of the person's previous relationships (transference). Some BPD sufferers are found to benefit from this form of therapy, as well.""'The use of psychiatric medications, like antidepressants (for example, ''fluoxetine'' [''Prozac''], ''sertraline'' [''Zoloft''], ''paroxetine'' [''Paxil''], ''citalopram'' [''Celexa''], ''escitalopram'' [''Lexapro''], ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix) ''venlafaxine'' [''Effexor''], ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), ''duloxetine'' [''Cymbalta''], vilazodone (Viibryd) or ''trazodone'' [''Desyrel'']), mood stabilizers (for example, ''divalproex'' sodium [''Depakote''], ''carbamazepine'' [''Tegretol''], or ''lamotrigine'' [''Lamictal'']), or antipsychotics (for example, ''olanzapine'' [''Zyprexa''], ''risperidone'' [''Risperdal''], ''aripiprazole'' [''Abilify''], paliperidone [Invega], iloperidone [Fanapt], asenapine [Saphris]), lurasidone (''Latuda''), or brexpiprazole (Rexulti) may be useful in addressing some of the symptoms of BPD but do not manage the illness in its entirety. On a positive note, some women who suffer from both BPD and bipolar disorder may experience a decrease in how irritable and angry they feel, as well as a decrease in how often and severely they become aggressive when treated with a mood-stabilizer medication like Depakote. On the other hand, the use of medications in the treatment of individuals with BPD may sometimes cause more harm than good. For example, while people with BPD may experience suicidal behaviors no more often than other individuals with a severe mental illness, they often receive more medications and therefore suffer from more side effects. Also, given how frequently many sufferers of BPD experience suicidal feelings, great care is taken to avoid the medications that can be dangerous if taken in overdose.''Partial hospitalization is an intervention that involves the individual with mental illness being in a hospital-like treatment center during the day but returning home each evening. In addition to providing a safe environment, support and frequent monitoring by mental health professionals, partial hospitalization programs allow for more frequent mental health interventions like professional assessments, psychotherapy, medication treatment, as well as development of a treatment plan for after discharge from the facility. While funding a long-term stay in a partial hospitalization facility may be difficult, studies show that when it is provided using a psychoanalytic or psychodynamic approach, it may help the person with BPD enjoy a decrease in the severity of general discontent, anxiety, ''depression'', and inability to feel pleasure, as well as decreasing the frequency of suicide attempts and full hospitalizations. This treatment may also help the individual develop improved relationships with others such that the BPD sufferer may be less likely to engage in social isolation. Contrary to earlier beliefs, BPD has been found to significantly improve in response to treatment with appropriate inpatient hospitalization. Family members of individuals with BPD might benefit from participation in a support group.'  "

What are borderline personality disorder complications?,"'The presence of BPD often worsens the course of another mental condition with which it occurs. For example, it tends to change the symptoms of ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' and to worsen ''depression''.''Individuals with BPD are at risk for self-destructive behaviors like self-mutilation, as well as for attempting or completing suicide. While cutting and other forms of self-harm, as well as suicidal behaviors seem to be associated with alleviating negative feelings, it is thought that self-mutilating behaviors are more an expression of anger, punishing oneself, distracting oneself, and maladaptively eliciting more normal feelings. In contrast, suicide attempts are thought to be more often associated with feeling survivors will be better off for their death. People who engage in self-mutilation are more likely to commit suicide compared to those who do not self-mutilate.''Although most individuals with a mental disorder do not engage in violent behavior, those who suffer from BPD have a somewhat increased risk for such behaviors. That risk is also increased for individuals who suffer from narcissism, antisocial personality disorder, have a history of previously engaging in violent behavior, frequent use of sedative medications, or experience several changes in their psychiatric medications in general.''Complications of BPD also often involve families of the person with the disorder. For example, a parent with BPD is vulnerable to having depressive symptoms in their children.' "
What is the prognosis of people with borderline personality disorder?,"""Improvement in any personality disorder is not the same as being cured, in that while the symptoms of BPD do tend to diminish (remit) with time, some often remain. Therefore, full recovery can be difficult to achieve. But how well or poorly people with BPD progress over time seems to be influenced by how severe the disorder is at the time that treatment starts, the state of the individual's current personal relationships, whether or not the sufferer has a history of being abused as a child, as well as whether or not the person receives appropriate treatment and how long it takes for that to occur. Simultaneously suffering from depression, other emotional problems, or a low level of conscientiousness have been found to be associated with a greater likelihood of the symptoms of BPD returning (relapsing). Conversely, having steady employment or school status once symptoms of BPD subside (remit) tends to protect BPD sufferers from experiencing a future relapse.""'People with BPD are at higher risk for having long-term substance abuse. Other complications that are associated with this personality disorder include unemployment, social isolation, reckless driving, legal problems, as well as suicide attempts and completion.' "
Is it possible to prevent borderline personality disorder?,"'Societal interventions like ''prevention'' of child abuse, ''domestic violence'', and substance abuse in families can help decrease the occurrence of a number of very different mental health problems. In contrast, specific prevention of BPD tends to focus on recognizing traits of the disorder as early as possible, followed by intensive treatment.' "

Facts you should know about enlarged prostate (BPH),"  The prostate gland is a gland surrounding the neck of the bladder (the bladder outlet) that produces a fluid that becomes part of the semen. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. The treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia is usually reserved for patients with bothersome symptoms that affect quality of life and may affect sexual function. Medical and surgical approaches are available to treat BPH. Surgical treatment is recommended if there are kidney problems related to BPH, urinary retention that fails to improve, recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent bladder stones, bloody urine (gross hematuria), or failure to improve with medical therapy. BPH is very common and can cause bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms, including frequent urge to urinate, getting up at night to urinate, difficulty urinating, and dribbling of urine at the end of urination."
What is the prostate gland?,'The prostate is a small organ about the size of a walnut. It lies below the bladder (where urine is stored) and surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder). The prostate makes a fluid that helps to nourish sperm as part of the semen (ejaculatory fluid).''Prostate problems are common in men 50 and older. Most can be treated successfully without harming sexual function.' 
What is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?,"'Benign prostatic hyperplasia'"" (BPH) is nonmalignant (noncancerous) enlargement of the prostate gland, a common occurrence in older men. It is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia and abbreviated as BPH and benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). It's also referred to as an ""'enlarged prostate'' gland. BPH must be differentiated from ''prostate cancer''. ''Prostate cancer'' can cause symptoms like BPH but is more commonly associated with an increase in PSA and an abnormal prostate on rectal examination or ''ultrasound'' evaluation.'  "
What causes BPH? At what age do men develop the condition?,"'Medical professionals do not have a good understanding of what causes an ''enlarged prostate''.'""BPH generally begins in a man's 30s, evolves slowly, and most commonly only causes symptoms after 50."" "
How common is the condition? Are there any risk factors?,"'BPH is extremely common. Advanced age is a risk factor for an ''enlarged prostate''. BPH affects 40%-50% of men aged 51-60 years, but only 10% need medical or surgical intervention.' "
What happens in BPH? What are BPH symptoms and signs?,"'In benign prostatic hyperplasia, the prostate gland grows in size. It may compress the urethra, which courses through the center of the prostate. This can impede the flow of urine from the bladder through the urethra to the outside. Lower urinary tract symptoms from BPH can be due to one of the factors: (1) dynamic, (2) static, and (3) compensatory. Dynamic factors are related to the tone of the muscle surrounding the prostate and the outlet of the bladder whereas static factors are related to the enlargement of the prostate tissue. Dynamic and static symptoms are prostate-related symptoms. Compensatory factors are the result of changes that occur in the bladder as a result of the bladder working harder to push urine past the bladder neck and prostate.''Signs and symptoms of BPH include lower urinary tract symptoms (LUT) of weak urine stream, difficulty starting the urine stream (hesitancy), straining to urinate, inability to completely empty the bladder, ''inability to urinate'' (''urinary retention''), ''blood in the urine'' (hematuria), leakage of urine (''urinary incontinence''), decreased urine flow (slow urine stream), and post-void dribbling of urine.''BPH may also be related to the development of bladder stones, recurrent ''urinary tract infections'', and backup of urine in the kidneys (''hydronephrosis'').'  "
Is BPH a type of cancer?,'No! BPH is completely benign. It is ''not'' a precursor (a forerunner) to prostate ''cancer''. A man can have both BPH and prostate ''cancer''.' 
What procedures or tests diagnose this prostate problem?,"'A doctor or other health care professional usually can detect an enlarged prostate by rectal examination. A medical professionals may perform a rectal examination to ensure that there are no ""nodules,"" which are hard, irregular areas in the prostate suspicious for prostate ''cancer'', as well as to assess the size of the prostate. Assessment of prostate size and shape is better assessed with an abdominal or transrectal ultrasound or ''cystoscopy''. A cystoscope is a long, thin telescope-like instrument that has a light source and ''lens'' allowing one to look at the urethra, the prostate, and the bladder when inserted through the opening at the tip of the penis. Cystoscopy and/or ultrasound is recommended prior to surgical treatment of BPH. Other tests that medical professionals may perform include: (1) bladder scanner postvoid residual determination (this is often performed in the office after urination to determine the amount of urine left behind in the bladder after urination and determines if one is emptying completely) and (2) uroflowmetry (a test in which one voids into a special urine collection device that can measure the rate and pattern of urine flow). Lastly, a PSA is often obtained and if abnormal may require further evaluation to rule out prostate cancer.''The American Urological Association (AUA) recommends that men with BPH complete the AUA-symptom index (AUA-SI), which assesses the degree to which symptoms bother. It is a useful way to assess changes in bothersome symptoms with treatment.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat the problem?,"'Primary care providers (PCP) may start medical management of BPH associated with bothersome symptoms in the absence of severe symptoms (urinary retention, hematuria, kidney problems). A referral to a ''urologist'' is indicated if symptoms do not improve on medical therapy, if severe symptoms are present, or there is risk of prostate cancer.''A urologist is a specialist in diseases of the urinary system, including diagnosing and treating problems of the prostate gland.' "
Are there natural or home remedies to treat BPH or enlarged prostate?,"'Watchful waiting often is chosen by men who are not bothered by signs or symptoms of BPH. They have no treatment except to get regular checkups with assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms and signs and wait to see whether the condition gets worse. Several ''over-the-counter products'' and phytotherapies have been tried to treat BPH. Beta sitosterol is a phytosterol found in vegetable oil, nuts, and avocados. There are limited studies evaluating its effect on BPH. Other studied therapies include ''pygeum'' africannum, cernilton, and serenoa repens (saw palmetto). Although these therapies do not require a prescription, it is important that you discuss the use with your primary care physician, as interactions with other medications or medical problems may exist.''Dietary and lifestyle changes may help with symptoms and signs. Strategies to help improve symptoms include limiting the amount of ''alcohol'' and ''caffeine'' consumed, decreasing fluid intake 2 hours before bedtime, going to the bathroom before ''sleep'', and minimizing long trips or other activities where a restroom is not readily available. Double voiding, voiding once then waiting 1 minute and trying to void again may help with bladder emptying. ''Constipation'' can aggravate symptoms and thus eating more ''fiber'' and exercising can help prevent ''constipation''. Talk with your doctor about medications prescribed and ''over-the-counter'' medications that you use, as commonly used medications such as ''antihistamines'' and decongestants can aggravate symptoms and signs. Studies suggest that diets high in meat or dairy products may increase the risk of prostate enlargement thus increasing the intake of fruits, vegetables, and healthy ''fats'' may be helpful.'  "
What are medications and surgery procedures that treat BPH?,"'There are several different ways to treat BPH, and the treatment may vary with the different factors. Alpha-blockers and PDE-5 inhibitors commonly treat the dynamic factors associated with BPH, whereas 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and surgical interventions treat the static factors, and anticholinergics and beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists treat the compensatory factors.''Men should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each of these options. Although surgical intervention tends to produce the most significant impact on symptoms, it is associated with greater risk and is typically reserved for individuals who fail medical therapy, either by lack of adequate symptom improvement or side effects of the medication.''Medical treatment'' of BPH is usually reserved for men who have an elevated AUA-SI (bothersome symptoms):''Surgery or office procedures'' may also be used to treat BPH, most commonly in men who have not responded satisfactorily to medicine or those who have more severe problems, such as a complete inability to urinate, kidney problems due to the BPH, recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent bladder stones, or gross hematuria (''bloody urine'').' Alpha-blockers treat the dynamic part of BPH by relaxing the smooth muscles of the prostate and the bladder neck, which helps to relieve urinary obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate in BPH. Several alpha-blockers treat BPH, some of which are more selective for the prostate and bladder neck smooth muscles. Medication side effects can include headaches, fatigue, problems ejaculating, decreased semen volume, or lightheadedness. Commonly used alpha-blockers in BPH include tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (Uroxatral), silodosin (Rapaflo), and older medications such as terazosin (Hytrin) or doxazosin (Cardura). Silodosin is a more selective alpha-blocker, which is specific to the lower urinary tract. It has a similar efficacy as other alpha-blockers but may have a higher risk of sexual side effects. Naftopidil is an alpha-blocker that is like tamsulosin. It is approved in several countries throughout the world but not currently in the U.S. These medicines generally lead to improvement in symptoms within several weeks and have no effect on prostate size and do not produce any permanent changes. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitor) treat the dynamic part of BPH by decreasing the tone of the smooth muscle in the bladder, prostate, and the urethra. They appear to be less effective on improving maximal urine flow rate than alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors have been used cautiously in combination with alpha-blocker therapy. Tadalafil (Cialis) is the only FDA-approved PDE5 inhibitor for treatment of BPH. PDE5 inhibitors are more commonly used for erectile dysfunction. Side effects of PDE5 inhibitors include facial flushing, headaches, upset stomach, nasal congestion, dizziness, and backache. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors treat the static component of BPH by blocking the conversion of the male hormone testosterone into its active form in the prostate (DHT). The prostate enlargement in BPH is directly dependent on DHT, so these drugs lead to an approximate 25% reduction in prostate size over 6 to 12 months. For this reason, improvement in urinary symptoms most commonly takes this long to occur. Examples of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors include the drugs finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart). Side effects of finasteride may include declining interest in sex, problems getting an erection, and problems with ejaculation. The reduction in DHT is the cause of the decrease in libido and erectile troubles, but these symptoms appear to decrease over time on the medication. Combination therapy with alpha blocker and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors has been demonstrated to result in greater improvements in lower urinary tract symptoms compared to monotherapy as well as decrease the risk of urinary retention or need for BPH-related surgery, but there is an increased risk of adverse events such as sexual dysfunction (erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculatory dysfunction). Anticholinergic and beta 3 adrenoceptor agonists treat the compensatory factors. Both anticholinergic agents and beta 3 adrenoceptor agonists are FDA approved for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of frequency and urgency with or without urgency incontinence. Men with BPH may develop changes in the bladder that result in OAB symptoms. These medications are not used alone to treat men with BPH and LUT, rather they may be used in men on alpha-blocker therapy with improvement in their obstructive symptoms (decreased urine stream, straining to void, incomplete emptying) but who still have storage-related symptoms (frequency and urgency). It is important that one is monitored on combination therapy to ensure adequate bladder emptying. Anticholinergic agents decrease overactivity of the bladder muscle. Several anticholinergics are available, differing in the mode of administration, the duration of action and muscarinic receptor affinity and side effects. Such agents include oxybutynin (Ditropan, Ditropan XL, Oxytrol, Gelnique), tolterodine (Detrol, Detrol LA), trospium chloride (Sanctura, Sanctura XR), darifenacin (Enablex), fesoterodine (Toviaz), and solifenacin (Vesicare). Side effects of anticholinergic agents include dry mouth, facial flushing, constipation, blurred vision, urinary retention, and cognitive problems. Beta 3 adrenoceptors agonists work to relax the bladder muscle. Currently, there is only one FDA-approved beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist, mirabegron (Myrbetriq). Beta 3 adrenoceptor agonists have comparable efficacy to anticholinergic agents. Side effects of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists include increased blood pressure, urinary retention, sinus pain, dry mouth, and constipation. Physicians have used transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the longest period and consider it the gold standard procedure. After giving a patient anesthesia, the doctor inserts a special instrument (a resectoscope) into the urethra through the penis. The resectoscope is similar to a cystoscope but has a small instrument that is connected to an electrical current, which allows the urologist to resect (cut away) the prostate tissue that is bulging into the urethra under direct visualization. Risks of TURP include hematuria (blood in urine), injury to bladder, electrolyte abnormalities, painful or difficult urination, retrograde ejaculation (the ejaculate going backwards into the bladder), and rarely erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Transurethral incision of the prostate. Doctors perform this procedure using a resectoscope, but instead of removing the prostate tissue, deep incisions are made into the prostate. This procedure has fewer side effects than a TURP, however is only useful for small prostate glands. Laser procedures: A number of different laser procedures are available to treat BPH. These include transurethral vaporization of the prostate (TUVP), photo selective vaporization of the prostate (PVP), and laser enucleation of the prostate by holmium laser (HOLEP) or by thulium (THuLEP). Laser procedures have less risk of bleeding, however, require specific equipment and skills. HOLEP, PVP, and THuLEP are procedures that should be considered in men who are at higher risk of bleeding such as those taking blood thinners (anticoagulants). Transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT): Medical professionals generally perform this procedure in the office, and it involves the use of microwave energy delivered to the prostate to kill some of the cells leading eventually to shrinkage of the prostate. TUMT is associated with a higher need for retreatment than TURP. Prostate urethral lift (PUL) is a minimally invasive procedure in which four to five sutures are placed to hold back prostate tissue on both sides of the urethra. The procedure is performed by guiding a device into the urethra through the tip of the penis. The device moves the prostate tissue away from the urethra and uses a needle to the sutures to hold the prostate tissue back. A medical professional often performs a cystoscopy to ensure that the prostate is not too large and that there is no ""middle lobe,"" an enlargement of the prostate in the middle of the urethra. The improvements in urine flow rate and LUT are less than with a TURP, however, it is not associated with the sexual side effects of TURP. Water vapor thermal therapy can be used if the prostate is not too large. It is not as efficacious as TURP and is associated with an increased retreatment rate compared to TURP. Aquablation is a new procedure that is more restricted with prostate size, and there are currently limited long-term results available regarding its efficacy and retreatment rates. Further clinical trials are needed to determine its role in the management of BPH. Simple prostatectomy is a more invasive procedure typically reserved for men with very large prostate glands. It can be performed through an incision on the lower abdomen, laparoscopically or robotic-assisted. Due to its more invasive nature, simple prostatectomy has a higher risk of complications than the minimally invasive treatments and takes longer to recover. Simple prostatectomy does not remove the entire prostate and is not a procedure performed for prostate cancer and thus differs from radical prostatectomy, a cancer-related procedure."
Are there other non-cancerous prostate problems?,"'Yes, aside from BPH, there are a number of prostate problems that also have nothing at all to do with prostate cancer. Among these benign disorders of the prostate are acute ''prostatitis'' and ''chronic prostatitis'' and, rarely, prostatic infarct (a localized area of dead prostate tissue as a result of inadequate blood supply).''Acute prostatitis is a bacterial infection of the prostate. It can occur in men at any age. Symptoms include ''fever'', ''chills'', and ''pain'' in the lower back and between the legs. This problem also can make it hard or painful to urinate. Doctors prescribe antibiotic medicines for acute prostatitis and recommend that the patient drink more liquids. Treatment is usually successful.''Chronic prostatitis is a ''prostate inflammation'' that tends to recur over time. It is usually not associated with true bacterial infection but causes similar symptoms of pain and discomfort, without ''fevers'' or chills. Chronic prostatitis is difficult to treat, and the exact cause is not well understood. Antibiotics may be used in some cases as well as anti-inflammatory medicines such as ''ibuprofen''. In many cases, symptoms will resolve on their own.''Prostate infarct is a localized area of dead prostate tissue as a result of inadequate blood supply. Prostate infarct is uncommon and may cause sudden increases in the ''PSA test''.' "
Is it possible to prevent prostate problems?,"'The best protection against prostate problems is to have regular medical checkups that include a careful prostate exam. See a doctor promptly if the following symptoms occur:''Regular checkups are important even for men who have had surgery for BPH. Surgery does not protect against prostate cancer because only part of the prostate is removed. In all cases, the sooner a doctor finds a problem, the better the chances that treatment will work.' A frequent urge to urinate Painful urination Bloody urine Difficulty in urinating Dribbling of urine"
Prostatitis vs. BPH quick comparison of differences and similarities," Both BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and prostatitis are problems with the prostate gland, a gland surrounding the neck of the bladder in males. The prostate gland is responsible for releasing prostatic fluid that helps make up part of the semen. The normal prostate gland is about the size of a walnut. As it increases in size, for whatever reason, it can press on the urethra and cause urinary problems. Both prostatitis and BPH can result in an enlarged prostate. Most men over 50 years old have some prostate enlargement with no symptoms, while bacterial prostatitis usually occurs in men younger than 35 years old and non-infectious prostatitis occurs in older men. You can have either BPH or prostatitis, and have no signs or symptoms. Nevertheless, both can cause pain (dysuria or pain with urination). Prostatitis is caused by infections (usually bacterial) or other related health problems, while doctors don’t know exactly what causes an enlarged prostate, but they think it may be related to hormones. BPH can be treated but not cured, but prostatitis is curable in many patients. The large majority of men with prostatitis have an infection of the prostate gland, while those with BPH do not have an infection."
What is prostatitis?,'The definition of prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate tissue. Causes of the inflammation can be from infection or other health problems.' 
What is BPH (enlarged prostate)?,"'Most men over the age of 50 have some prostate enlargement due to the proliferation of the cells that comprise the prostate gland. Most of these men have BPH, or ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'', even though do not have any symptoms. This gland enlargement is noncancerous and is termed ''benign prostatic hypertrophy'' or BPH. There is only one type of BPH, “benign,” meaning non-cancerous or not ''malignant'' in medical terms.' "
Are prostatitis and BPH the same prostate gland problem?,"'The answer to this question is yes and no, because both may have some similar health symptoms (problems), but each prostate problem have different causes. Yes, BPH is by definition an ''enlarged prostate'', and no, because the cause is not an infection/inflammation like prostatitis. However, not all enlarged prostates are due to BPH. An enlarged prostate may be caused by BPH, prostatitis, and ''prostate cancer''.' "
Do prostatitis and BPH cause pain?,"'Both BPH and prostatitis may cause pain. However, if BPH causes pain, it usually occurs with urination (dysuria).''Prostatitis may cause ''painful urination'', painful ejaculations, and generalized groin/''abdominal pain''. Prostatitis pain may be more constant and may be due to the inflammation of the prostatic tissue and/or adjacent tissues. Experts point out that often the source of pain from prostatitis is unclear.' "
How can I tell the difference between prostatitis and BPH (signs and symptoms)?,"'If you do not have any symptoms of BPH or any of the types of prostatitis, which can be the situation for some men, you may not be able to tell if you have either problem. However, a doctor or other health care professional can detect enlargement of the prostate with a digital rectal exam (digital examination of the rectal area and prostate), even if you don’t have any symptoms.''If you do have symptoms, they are related to the increase in size of your prostate gland. When the gland enlarges, it can constrict the urethra and produce one or more of these symptoms.''The ''symptoms of prostatitis'' depend upon the type of prostatitis.''Some men may have some of these symptoms with both BPH and prostatitis. If you are over age 50, it is more likely BPH than prostatitis, and if you are under age 35, acute bacterial prostatitis is more likely than BPH. In some patients, prostatitis may be recurrent (you may get the condition again).'   The need to urinate frequently during the day or night The sudden urgent need to urinate Difficulty initiating urinary stream Feeling like you still need to urinate even though you recently urinated Feeling like you need to push or strain to empty your bladder A decrease in the force of the urine stream Loss of small amounts of urine (dribbling urine) Fever Chills Muscle soreness Joint discomfort Feeling tired Prostatic discomfort and/or pain Painful urination (dysuria) Low back pain and/or abdominal pain Possible urethral discharge Urinary stream problems such as frequency, urgency, weak urine stream Intermittent painful urination Intermittent obstructive urinary tract symptoms Recurrent urinary tract infections (with some symptoms for type I) Pelvic pain and/or discomfort Obstructive urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, painful urination, and incomplete urination Pain with ejaculation Erectile dysfunction (ED) By definition, type IV has no symptoms, but sometimes is diagnosed from a prostate biopsy or suspected when a prostate-specific antigen test (PSA blood test) is elevated."
What causes prostatitis vs. BPH?,"'The cause of BPH or enlarged prostate is by benign growth that enlarges the prostate gland. Researchers do not know exactly what causes the gland to enlarge, but they have speculated that it might be related to hormonal changes as men age.''In men under the age of 35, the most common type of prostatitis is acute bacterial prostatitis, while in older patients non-bacterial prostatitis is the most common type. There are four types or syndromes of prostatitis.''The cause of acute bacterial prostatitis is by bacteria that may be present in the urethra and then infect the prostate gland. Chronic bacterial prostatitis (about 75% of infections are due to ''E. coli'') occurs because of inadequate treatment or because of a structural/functional problem in the urinary tract. Researchers and doctors do not completely understand the cause of chronic prostatitis, but it is speculated that the cause may be initiated by neurological injury and/or related to infection.' Type I - Acute bacterial prostatitis Type II - Chronic bacterial prostatitis Type III Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome Type IV is asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis."
"Where is the prostate gland located, and what does it look like?", 
What should I do if I think I may have prostate problems?,"'Regardless of which problem you may think you have, you should see your primary care doctor. To make the diagnosis your doctor will take a complete history, physical exam that includes a digital rectal exam, and other appropriate diagnostic tests, for example, a ''urinalysis'', urine culture, blood tests such as the ''PSA test'', ''electrolytes'', ''creatinine'', and occasionally blood urea nitrogen levels. Your doctor may order other tests, for example, an ''ultrasound'', ''endoscopy'', urine flow rate studies, and biopsy of the prostate gland. Your doctor also may refer you to a specialist called a urologist, especially if you require surgery as part of your treatment.' "
Are the treatments for prostatitis and BPH different?,"'The treatment for an enlarged prostate and prostatitis are very different.''BPH treatment may include an interactive questionnaire to determine the extent of your symptoms. The results of the questionnaire may influence what medications or other treatments you may need. ''Drugs'' used to treat BPH include:''Some patients with more severe prostatic enlargement may need surgery. A transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the usual procedure to reduce pressure on the urethra by reducing the size of the prostate.''Treatment for prostatitis depends on the type.'  Alpha receptor blockers (alpha-1, alpha- adrenergic, 5-alpha reductase) Phosphodiesterase inhibitors Anticholinergic agents Bacteria acute and chronic prostatitis (type I and type II) are typically treated and cured with antibiotics like fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim. These infections typically take longer to cure so you may have to take antibiotics for as long as 4-8 weeks. Some infections of the prostate gland are resistant or unresponsive to treatment so antibiotics like gentamicin or doxycycline may need to be injected directly into the gland. Type III, chronic bacterial prostatitis and pelvic pain syndrome, is treated similarly with antibiotics, however, alpha-blockers and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), for example, aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Aleve, Advil), naproxen (Naproxen) also are used. Type IV, asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, in most patients requires no treatment. However, some doctors prescribe antibiotics and NSAIDs for this condition."
Can prostatitis and BPH be cured (prognosis)?,"'The prognosis for BPH for most patients that undergo treatment is good to fair, depending upon how well patients respond. BPH that requires surgery may result in complications such as ''erectile dysfunction''. The prognosis for patients with more severe BPH symptoms that require surgery and medication for symptom relief is fair. There is no cure for BPH.''Most men with prostatitis (all types) may have significant symptom relief, and most men can be cured with long-term appropriate antibiotic treatments. The prognosis for prostatitis ranges from good to fair because some patients have a tendency to have recurrent bouts of the condition.' "
What are dental braces?,"'Dental  ''braces'' are devices that are placed directly on ''teeth'' in order to move them. For most of us, braces are the most common method for achieving optimally aligned ''teeth''. Aside from straightening teeth, braces are used to improve the relationship of how our teeth come together between the upper and lower jaws. Braces for tooth movement fall under the dental specialty of “''orthodontics''” which is the study and treatment of improper bites (malocclusion). Orthodontic treatment with braces is used for cosmetic as well as functional improvement in respect to teeth position.'""The  “braces” are the actual devices that are attached to teeth. They usually consist of “brackets” that are bonded to the teeth and a metal wire that is inserted into the brackets. The metal wires are “tightened” and work together with the brackets to move teeth into the desired positions. There are other components that are also used in conjunction with braces to move teeth, jaw, and bone such as headgear and expansion devices. While orthodontics work on teeth movement, it sometimes involves working with one's facial bone growth to achieve favorable jaw dimensions and relationship."" "
Who is a good candidate for braces?,"""Braces can be for any age group, but there are optimal times to begin treatment. These days, it is recommended that children have an orthodontic evaluation at the age of 7 to determine if early intervention is needed or advantageous. If recommended, early intervention optimizes results by taking advantage of a child's skeletal bone growth and may require two-phase orthodontic treatment. The first phase (“phase-one”) is considered interceptive orthodontic treatment as it addresses overcrowding of teeth or bite problems at an early age. As an example of interceptive treatment, a narrow upper jaw that has crowded teeth and does not fit correctly with the lower jaw can be widened with an expansion device called a “palatal expander.” This lets the upper jaw line up better with the lower jaw and allows room for upper teeth to fit in alignment. Widening the palate can only occur during a small window of time in a growing child before the bone becomes too developed to change. During “phase-one,” braces may or may not be used depending on the specific situation. After “phase-one,” there is a resting period to allow most or all of the permanent teeth to come in.""'Around the age of 12 or 13, “phase-two” treatment may begin. During this phase, the alignment of all the permanent teeth is addressed using full braces.''If the window of time for two-phase orthodontic treatment has already passed, results can still be achieved with only one phase of treatment. However, if there is significant crowding of teeth, dental extractions may be required to create room for teeth to move into alignment. Another method for creating room for teeth movement is called “interproximal reduction” (IPR). IPR involves minimal removal of tooth structure on the sides of the teeth to create more room. This method is limited to mild teeth crowding.''Essentially, anyone who desires to have straighter teeth or improve their bite may be a good candidate for braces. A thorough evaluation with a qualified clinician is very important in determining whether one is a good candidate for braces.' "
What are the different types of braces?,"'There are various types of braces available today. Choosing the right type depends on various considerations such as aesthetics, cost, and ''allergy'' concerns.''Metal wired braces:'' These are the most common and traditional type of braces. They are typically made out of stainless steel. Metal brackets are fixed (bonded) onto the teeth and secure a wire with elastic ties made out of rubber. As an alternative to using elastic ties, “self-ligating” brackets are used to clip onto the wire.''Ceramic wired braces:'' Also called “clear braces,” these provide a cosmetic alternative to the metal wired braces. The brackets are ceramic to match the shade of teeth and clear elastic ties are used. Self-ligating ceramic brackets are also available. The downside to ceramic braces is that they are more prone to breakage compared to the metal braces.''Lingual braces:'' These are braces that are placed on the lingual surface (backside) of the teeth and are not easily visible. This is mainly for cosmetic purposes and usually lengthens the time for treatment.''Other metal braces:'' Gold-plated stainless steel or titanium brackets are usually used for those with nickel ''allergies''.''Clear aligners:'' These braces are made of a clear ''plastic''  that is custom-made without the use of brackets or wires on the teeth. These are also known as “clear braces” and present a very comfortable option for treatment. However, there are limitations to this method. Clear aligners can only tilt and rotate teeth in their position. Conversely, the use of brackets with traditional braces enables the whole bodily movement of a tooth (and its root) into the desired position.' "
How do braces work?,"'Braces work by a slow and controlled process using force and constant pressure. For traditional braces, the wire that is attached to the brackets works to put pressure on the teeth to move to a specified direction.''Teeth move through a biomechanical process called “bone remodeling.” When braces put pressure on a tooth, the “periodontal membrane” and bone surrounding this tooth are affected. The periodontal membrane completely surrounds a tooth in its socket and it essentially helps anchor the tooth to bone. With pressure from braces, the periodontal membrane of a tooth is stretched on one side and compressed on the other side. This effectively loosens the tooth out of its socket. The compressed side (the direction of pressure) is where bone is broken down to accommodate the new position of the tooth while the stretched side is where new bone is made. This process needs to be done very slowly and explains why wearing braces can take some time to achieve the desired results.' "
What is the procedure for getting braces?,"'The initial step for obtaining braces involves a thorough evaluation and record taking with an experienced clinician. Dental impressions (molds) are taken to make models for study and ''X-rays'' are taken to look at teeth positions. Measurements are taken in the mouth as well. Once thoroughly evaluated, a treatment plan is created. This plan will specify what has been diagnosed for correction, treatment recommendations, and an estimated time for how long treatment will take. A discussion between the clinician and patient takes place where all the risks, benefits, and alternatives of treatment are reviewed.''If necessary, all dental extractions are performed prior to the placement of braces or other orthodontic appliances. For the two-phase process, appliances such as palatal expanders and headgear are used during the “phase-one” treatment to correct any developing skeletal growth problem.''For placement of traditional braces, brackets are bonded with special dental cement to all the teeth in the arch. For some clinicians, elastic spacers are placed between the molars for 1 to 2 weeks prior to placement of the brackets to make room for metal bands with attached brackets. These metal bands are typically placed around the last molars and are able to withstand the forces of chewing better than bonded brackets in the back teeth.'""After the brackets and/or metal bands are in place, a metal wire (or “archwire”) is placed in the brackets and secured with elastic rubber bands (or clipped into place with self-ligating brackets). Of note, elastic rubber bands come in a variety of colors and can be an appealing component of a child's orthodontic experience.""'For clear aligner braces, accurate dental impressions (molds) are taken in order to have a set of aligners made. The aligners are a sequence of clear trays that fit over the teeth to achieve movement. Each tray is worn for a period of time before progressing to the next tray.' "
Do braces hurt?,"'Placement of traditional braces is usually ''pain'' free, but the teeth and jaws will feel sore afterwards. This is due to the slow movement of teeth that is taking place. This initial soreness usually lasts for about a week and then for a couple of days after each adjustment of the archwire during treatment. This discomfort also applies to clear aligners as tooth movement is taking place. During this time, it helps to have a soft food ''diet'' and use ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) ''pain'' medications such as  ''ibuprofen'' or ''acetaminophen'' when appropriate. Initially, orthodontic wax can be used to cover rough areas that rub against the cheeks until the mouth becomes more accustomed to the brackets and wires.'  "
How much do braces cost? Does insurance cover orthodontic treatment?,"'Cost of treatment is very individual as every mouth is different. Cost will depend on treatment time, steps involved and will vary by location. An estimated cost range for “phase-one” treatment is $2,000 to $4,000. For “phase-two” treatment, an estimated cost range is $2,000 to $7,000. Clear aligner treatment costs more by about 20 to 50 percent.''Orthodontic treatment can be a covered benefit through dental insurance. Limitations may exist depending on the dental insurance plan.'  "
What is it like to have braces?,"'There is no doubt that braces can initially be uncomfortable and be a cosmetic concern. Aside from the teeth soreness, the inconveniences of wearing braces include: constantly getting food stuck when eating, having to spend more time cleaning the teeth, and having to be cautious of the types of food that can be eaten. However, more often than not, individuals are happy to have gone through the process of orthodontic treatment to improve their smile or correct their bite. The results of treatment can be very rewarding.' "
What happens after braces come off?,"'Once braces come off, more records (molds and X-rays) are taken to evaluate the end result. Additionally, plans for a dental retainer are made to keep the newly-positioned teeth in place. Without a retainer, the teeth can shift. There are usually two types of retainers -- removable or fixed. A removable retainer is made of acrylic and metal wires or a clear rigid plastic tray and can be easily removed for ease of brushing and flossing the teeth. A fixed retainer is usually bonded to the back (""lingual"") side of the teeth. The advantages of this type of retainer are that it cannot be lost and it is more effective in retaining teeth position. Typically, retainers need to be worn full-time after braces are removed for a period of time and then, for removable retainers, followed by part-time wear at night indefinitely. For adults completing orthodontic treatment, retainers usually need to be worn for a lifetime. The dentist or orthodontist will recommend how long to wear the retainers as each case is different.' "
What Happens During Brachytherapy?,"'First  angioplasty  is performed, and a ""ribbon"" of radioactive isotopes is placed through the catheter to the site of blockage. The ribbon stays in place for about 4 to 15 minutes, and the catheter is removed.' "
Are There Risks Associated With Brachytherapy?,"'Yes. In some cases, blood clots (thrombosis) may occur at the site of ''radiation'' months after the procedure is performed.  ''Antiplatelet medications''  are given after the procedure to decrease the risk of late ''blood clot'' formation.''Because brachytherapy is a new treatment, the long-term effects are still unknown. Studies are still underway to evaluate its effects. Two forms of brachytherapy - gamma radiation and beta radiation - were approved by the FDA in 2002.' "
Who Should Get Brachytherapy?,"'Brachytherapy is not appropriate for everyone. Those who seem to benefit most from this type of therapy for in-stent restenosis include people at higher risk for re-stenosis, for example, those with ''diabetes'' or long stenotic areas (long areas of narrowing).''Since ''blood clot'' formation is a side effect of brachytherapy for restenosis, people who have had recent ''heart attacks'', poor ''heart function'' and blood clots may not be eligible for this treatment.' "
Should I Have Brachytherapy?,"'If you are at high risk for in-stent restenosis, with careful monitoring, brachytherapy may be a treatment option for you. It is best to discuss this with your doctor and an interventional cardiologist with experience in ''radiation therapy'' to see if brachytherapy is right for you.''Reviewed by the doctors at  The Cleveland Clinic Heart Center.''Edited by  Charlotte E.

Childbirth class options introduction,"'Many women and couples desire to take part in formal classes as part of their birthing plan. While a number of class formats and emphasis is available, what they have in common is that they all prepare a mother for giving birth. Classes may cover techniques for non-drug ''pain management'' as well as information about ''labor and delivery''. ''Childbirth'' classes can also teach expectant women what to expect in the postpartum period. In addition, information regarding ''breastfeeding'' is commonly presented. ''While classes focused on birthing techniques commonly start around the seventh month of ''pregnancy'', other types of classes may start in early ''pregnancy''. Your health care professional can help you decide when and if a ''childbirth'"" class is a good option for you. Classes can be held at hospitals, community centers, health care practitioners' offices or other settings. Video or book versions of classes are also available.""'The following is a brief overview of some of the most well-known childbirth class options in the United States.' "
What is the Lamaze technique?,"'The Lamaze technique is one of the best known methods, and one of the most commonly used childbirth class method in the United States. Lamaze classes are designed to inform women about their options for support during the birth process. The Lamaze program does not encourage or discourage the use of medications and medical interventions during the birth process. Women are presented with information and options to make the decision that is best for her.''Some of the topics covered in Lamaze technique classes include:''Lamaze classes are generally taught in small groups of up to 12 couples. Typically, there is at least 12 hours of instruction time.' The progress of normal labor The delivery and postpartum period Pain relief techniques such as massage 
and relaxation methods Other kinds of support during labor Communication Breastfeeding Medical procedures that may be 
recommended Living a healthy lifestyle"
What is The Bradley Method?,"'The Bradley method is also known as husband-coached childbirth. It is a process that prepares a woman to give birth without the use of ''pain'"" control medications. It also prepares the woman's partner to be an effective birth coach. The method does include preparation for problems or unexpected situations like unplanned Cesarean section delivery. The course is taught over 12 sessions. Topics covered in the classes include:"" Healthy lifestyle choices  Relaxation techniques for use during 
labor ""Rehearsals"" for labor Postpartum care Breastfeeding Training for the partner in coaching 
techniques Ways to avoid a Cesarean section 
(C-section)"
What is The Alexander Technique?,"'The Alexander Technique is a strategy for improving movement, balance, coordination, and flexibility. This technique is used by many individuals--not just ''pregnant'"" women. In expectant women it may be used to increase the mother's comfort during pregnancy, increase the effectiveness of pushing, lessen any discomfort associated with ""'nursing'', and assist the overall recovery from childbirth. Some ''pregnant'' women choose to take weekly lessons in the technique throughout their pregnancy.' "
What is HypnoBirthing?,'HypnoBirthing is a method that is based on self-hypnosis techniques to achieve a healthy and natural birth process. It is sometimes referred to as the Morgan method. Pre-birth ''parenting'' and the consciousness of the unborn baby are among the topics covered in the training sessions. It is commonly given in a series of 4 or 5 class sessions of 2 ½ to 3 hours each.' 
10 questions to ask when choosing a childbirth class,"'Asking the following questions may help women decide on a childbirth class. There are no right or wrong answers. Thinking about these issues may help you clarify your own interests and goals.' When and where does the class meet? How many 
sessions are offered? Is the class designed for expectant mothers 
or for couples? Is there training for the expectant woman's 
partner? Is this important to you? What is the cost of the class? Will 
insurance cover the cost? How are the teachers trained? Does the teacher have experience with this 
type of class? What is the class size? What kinds of medical interventions are 
covered in the class? Does the class promote natural birth without 
medications or does the class allow women to choose medical intervention? Does the class run throughout pregnancy or only in the later 
stages?"
What are the signs and symptoms of brain aneurysm?,"'The ''headache'' associated with a leaking aneurysm is severe. Blood is very irritating to the brain and surrounding membranes and causes significant ''pain''. Patients may describe the ""worst ''headache'' of their life,"" and the health care practitioner needs to have an appreciation that a brain aneurysm may be the potential cause of this type of ''pain''. The ''headache'' may be associated with ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and change in vision. A subarachnoid hemorrhage also causes pain and ''stiffness'' of the neck because the meninges become inflamed. However, the ""worst headache of their life"" complaint needs to be matched with physical findings to be considered a risk factor for a leaking aneurysm.'  "
What is a brain aneurysm and what causes a brain aneurysm?,"'The Circle of Willis is the junction of the four major arteries, two carotid arteries and two vertebral arteries, that supply the brain with ''nutrition'' (especially oxygen and glucose). This loop of arteries is located at the base of the brain and sends out smaller branch arteries to all parts of the brain. The junctions where these arteries come together may develop weak spots. These weak spots can balloon out and fill with blood, creating the outpouchings of blood vessels known as aneurysms. These sac-like areas may leak or rupture, spilling blood into surrounding brain tissue.''Aneurysms have a variety of causes including ''high blood pressure'' and ''atherosclerosis'', ''trauma'', heredity, and abnormal blood flow at the junction where arteries come together.''There are other rare causes of aneurysms. Mycotic aneurysms are caused by infections of the artery wall. Tumors and trauma can also cause aneurysms to form. ''Drug abuse'', especially ''cocaine'', can cause the artery walls to inflame and weaken.''Brain aneurysms are a common occurrence. At autopsy, incidental aneurysms that have never caused any symptoms or issues are found in more than 1% of people. Most aneurysms remain small and are never diagnosed. Some, however, may gradually become larger and exert pressure on surrounding brain tissue and nerves and may be diagnosed because of ''stroke''-like symptoms including:''The greater concern is a brain aneurysm that leaks or ruptures, and potentially causes ''stroke'' or death.

How is brain aneurysm diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of brain aneurysm begins with a high index of suspicion by the health care practitioner. The history of the headache, an acute onset of the headache, associated with a ''stiff neck'' and an ill-appearing patient on physical examination, typically lead the health care practitioner to consider the diagnosis and order a CT (''computerized tomography'') scan of the head. If the ''CT scan'' is performed within 72 hours of the onset of the headache, it will detect 93% to 100% of all aneurysms. In the few cases that are not recognized by CT, the health care practitioner may consider performing a lumbar puncture (LP, or ''spinal tap'') to identify blood in the cerebrospinal fluid that runs in the subarachnoid space. Some hospitals will consider CT angiography of the brain instead of the LP.''If the CT or the LP reveals the presence of blood, angiography is performed to identify where the aneurysm is located and to plan treatment. Angiography, where a catheter is threaded into the arteries of the brain and dye is injected while pictures are taken, can demonstrate the anatomy of the arteries and uncover the presence and location of an aneurysm.

What is the treatment for brain aneurysm?,"'Treatment for a symptomatic aneurysm is to repair the blood vessels. Clipping and coiling are two treatment options.''Both these options have the risk of damaging the blood vessel and causing more bleeding, damaging nearby brain tissue, and causing the surrounding blood vessels to go into spasm; depriving brain tissue of blood supply and causing a stroke.''Prior, during, and after surgery, attention is paid to protect the brain and its blood vessels from potential further damage. Vitals signs are monitored frequently, and ''heart'' monitors are used to watch for ''abnormal heart rhythms''. Medications may be used to control ''high blood pressure'' and prevent blood vessel spasm, ''seizure'', agitation, and pain.'   Clipping: A neurosurgeon can operate on the brain by cutting open the skull, identifying the damaged blood vessel and putting a clip across the aneurysm. This prevents blood from entering the aneurysm and causing further growth or blood leakage. Coiling: An interventional neurologist, neurosurgeon, or interventional radiologist can thread a tube through the arteries, as with an angiogram, identify the aneurysm, and fill it with coils of platinum wire or with latex. This prevents further blood from entering the aneurysm and resolves the problem."
What is the outcome of brain aneurysm?,"'Brain aneurysms are deadly. About 10% of patients with a ruptured aneurysm die before receiving medical care. If untreated, another 50% will die within a month, with a 20% risk of rebleed by the end of the first two weeks. Aside from the bleeding issues, there is significant risk of artery spasm leading to stroke.''Survival rates are increased in patients who present early to the hospital. Early diagnosis, aneursym repair, and control of blood vessel spasms with appropriate medications are all associated with increased survival.' "
What are future directions for the treatment of brain aneurysm?,"'For those who survive an initial aneurysm rupture, blood vessel spasm (vasospasm) may be the villain in causing continued ''brain damage''. Experiments to develop new ''drugs'' to control vasospasm are ongoing.

"
What is brain cancer?,"'Brain cancer is a disease of the brain in which cancer cells (''malignant'' cells) arise in the brain tissue (cancer of the brain). Cancer cells grow to form a mass of cancer tissue (tumor) that interferes with brain functions such as muscle control, sensation, memory, and other normal body functions. Tumors composed of cancer cells are called malignant tumors, and those composed of mainly noncancerous cells are called benign tumors. Cancer cells that develop from brain tissue are called primary ''brain tumors'' while tumors that spread from other body sites to the brain are termed metastatic or secondary ''brain tumors''. Statistics suggest that brain cancer occurs infrequently (1.4% of all new cancer patients per year), so it is not considered to be a common illness and is likely to develop in about 23,770 new people per year with about 16,050 deaths as estimated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the American Cancer Society. Only about 5% of brain tumors may be due to hereditary genetic conditions such as ''neurofibromatosis'', tuberous sclerosis, and a few others.'  "
What are the types of brain cancers?,"'The most common primary brain tumors are usually named for the brain tissue type (including brain stem cancers) from which they originally developed.' Five brain tumors are gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, vestibular schwannomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (medulloblastomas).Gliomas have several subtypes, which include astrocytomas (for example, an astrocytoma is a brain cancer composed of abnormal brain cells known as astrocytes), oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, and choroid plexus papillomas. Glioblastomas arise from astrocytes and are usually highly aggressive (malignant) tumors; doctors diagnosed Senator John McCain with this form of brain tumor. Gliomas have several subtypes, which include astrocytomas (for example, an astrocytoma is a brain cancer composed of abnormal brain cells known as astrocytes), oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, and choroid plexus papillomas. Glioblastomas arise from astrocytes and are usually highly aggressive (malignant) tumors; doctors diagnosed Senator John McCain with this form of brain tumor. These names all reflect different types of cells in the normal brain that can become cancers. When the grades are coupled with the tumor name, it gives doctors a better understanding of the severity of brain cancer. For example, a grade III (anaplastic) glioma is an aggressive tumor, while an acoustic neuroma is a grade I benign tumor. However, even benign tumors can cause serious problems if they grow big enough to cause increased intracranial pressure or obstruct vascular structures or cerebrospinal fluid flow."
What are four grades of brain cancers?,"""Not all brain tumors are alike, even if they arise from the same type of brain tissue. Tumors are assigned a grade depending on how the cells in the tumor appear microscopically. The grade also provides insight as to the cell's growth rate. NCI lists the following grades from benign to most aggressive (grade IV):"" Grade I: The tissue is benign. The cells look nearly like normal brain cells, and they grow slowly. Grade II: The tissue is malignant. The cells look less like normal cells than do the cells in a grade I tumor. Grade III: The malignant tissue has cells that look very different from normal cells. The abnormal cells are actively growing and have a distinctly abnormal appearance (anaplastic). Grade IV: The malignant tissue has cells that look most abnormal and tend to grow quickly."
What are the stages of brain cancer?,"'Brain cancers are staged (stage describes the extent of the cancer) according to their cell type and grade because they seldom spread to other organs, while other cancers, such as breast or ''lung cancer'', are staged according to so-called TMN staging which is based on the location and spread of cancer cells. In general, these cancer stages range from 0 to 4; with stage 4 indicating the cancer has spread to another organ (highest stage is 4).' "
What is metastatic brain cancer?,"'Cancer cells that develop in a body organ such as the lung (primary cancer tissue type) can spread via direct extension, or through the lymphatic system and/or through the bloodstream to other body organs such as the brain. Tumors formed by such cancer cells that spread (metastasize) to other organs are called metastatic tumors. Metastatic brain cancer is a mass of cells (tumor) that originated in another body organ and has spread into the brain tissue. Metastatic tumors in the brain are more common than primary brain tumors. They are usually named after the tissue or organ where the cancer first developed (for example, metastatic lung or ''breast cancer'' tumors in the brain, which are the most common types found). Occasionally, an abbreviated name may be used that often confuses people; for example, ""small cell brain cancer"" actually means ""''small cell lung cancer'' that has metastasized to the brain."" People should not hesitate to ask their doctor about any terms they do not understand or about the origin of their cancer.' "
What causes brain cancer?,"'Primary brain tumors arise from many types of brain tissue (for example, glial cells, astrocytes, and other brain cell types). Metastatic brain cancer is caused by the spread of cancer cells from a body organ to the brain. However, the causes for the change from normal cells to cancer cells in both metastatic and primary brain tumors are not fully understood. Data gathered by research scientists show that people with certain risk factors are more likely to develop brain cancer.''Individuals with risk factors, such as having a job in an oil refinery, handlers of jet fuel or chemicals like benzene, chemists, embalmers, or rubber-industry workers, show higher rates of brain cancer than the general population. Some families have several members with brain cancer, but heredity (genetic passage of traits from parents to children) as a cause for brain tumors has not been proven. Other risk factors such as ''smoking'', ''radiation'' exposure, and viral infection (''HIV'') have been suggested but not proven to cause brain cancer. There is no good evidence that brain cancer is ''contagious'', caused by head ''trauma'', or caused by cell phone use. Although many lay press and web articles claim that ''aspartame'' (an ''artificial sweetener'"") causes brain cancer, the FDA maintains that it does not cause brain cancer and base their findings on over 100 toxicological and clinical studies regarding the sweetener's safety."" "
Do cell phones cause brain cancer?,"'There is an ongoing concern by a number of people that cell phones cause brain cancer. Some reports in the popular press and some web sites suggest that avoiding cell phone use and using a macrobiotic ''diet'' will help avoid brain cancer. This situation has been exacerbated by a recent ruling to put cell phones on a list of items that ""may"" cause cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This was done because the IARC suggested that an increase in gliomas may occur with high use of cell phones. The IARC classified cell phones as group 2b carcinogens; these substances are considered possibly carcinogenic, but evidence is limited in both humans and experimental animals. The report does not say that cell phones cause brain cancer.''Currently, many researchers are convinced there is no good evidence for these cancer-causing claims. In December 2010, a large study of about 59,000 cell phone users, with use times ranging over five to 10 years, indicated that no substantial change in brain cancer incidence could be found in these individuals. Investigators suggest that ""high usage"" of cell phones over long time periods is yet to be investigated. With over 5 billion phones in use and no significant increase in gliomas (the most frequent type of brain cancer) reported worldwide, many investigators think that normal cell use likely causes no harm. However, for those readers who want to minimize any electromagnetic radiation dose from cell phones, the reader can consult the web for a list of phones that produce the highest and lowest radiation levels (for example, ''http://reviews.cnet.com/2719-6602_7-291-2.html?tag=page;page''). In addition, the use of earphones or the speaker function will allow usage without the phone having close proximity to the brain. The American Cancer Society has a detailed review of most of the major studies done on this topic to date (''http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/cellular-phones''). In addition, the National Cancer Institute has an up-to-date article that discusses the ""cell phone and cancer risk"" controversy in great detail (''http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet'').' "
What are brain cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Although there are few early warning signs, the most common signs and ''symptoms of brain cancer'' may include one or more of the following:''Other common symptoms that can occur include''These symptoms can also occur in people who do not have brain cancer, and none of these symptoms alone or in combination can predict that a person has brain cancer. Cancer can occur in any part of the brain (for example, occipital, frontal, parietal, or temporal lobes, brainstem, or meningeal membranes [meninges; singular is meninx]). Primary cerebral ''lymphoma'' can occur but is rare; so are craniopharyngiomas that are derived from the ''pituitary gland''. A few brain cancers may produce few or no symptoms (for example, some meningeal and pituitary gland tumors).'   Difficulty walking and/or dizziness/vertigo Seizures Muscle weakness (for example, arm and leg weakness) Headaches (persistent and/or severe) nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, a change in a person's alertness, sleepiness, mental capacity reduction and/or confusion, memory problems, changes in speech, such as difficulty speaking, impaired voice, or inability to speak, personality changes, hallucinations, weakness on one side of the body, coordination problems, fatigue, and pins and needles sensations and/or reduced sensation of touch."
What type of doctors treat brain cancer?,"""Usually, the patient's primary care physician or pediatrician helps to coordinate the treatment team of doctors to individually treat the patient. The treatment team may consist of oncologists, neurologists, radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, and additional personnel like occupational and physical therapists and possibly speech therapists, depending upon the outcome of initial treatments. For patients who have terminal and/or inoperable brain cancer, ""'hospice'' and other organizations may help the patient and their family and friends coordinate supportive care.' "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose brain cancer?,"'The initial test is an interview that includes a medical history and physical examination of the person by a health care provider. The results of this interaction will determine if other specific tests need to be done.''The most frequently used test to detect brain cancer is a ''CT scan'' (''computerized tomography''). This test resembles a series of ''X-rays'' and is not painful, although sometimes a dye needs to be injected into a vein for better images of some internal brain structures. Another test that is gaining popularity because of its high sensitivity for detecting anatomic changes in the brain is MRI (''magnetic resonance imaging''). This test also shows the brain structures in detail better than CT. If the tests show evidence (tumors or abnormalities in the brain tissue) of brain cancer, then other doctors such as neurosurgeons and neurologists that specialize in treating brain ailments will be consulted to help determine what should be done to treat the patient. Occasionally, a tissue sample (biopsy) may be obtained by surgery or insertion of a needle to help determine the diagnosis. Other tests (white blood cell counts, ''electrolytes'"", or examination of cerebrospinal fluid to detect abnormal cells or increased intracranial pressure) may be ordered by the health care practitioner to help determine the patient's state of health or to detect other health problems. These tests help differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous conditions in the brain that may produce similar symptoms (for example, Hippel-Lindau disease or diseases in the spinal cord or the nervous system outside of the brain)."" "
What is the treatment for brain cancer?,"""A treatment plan is individualized for each brain cancer patient. The treatment plan is constructed by the doctors who specialize in brain cancer, and treatments vary widely depending on the cancer type, brain location, tumor size, patient age, and the patient's general health status. A major part of the plan is also determined by the patient's wishes. Patients should discuss treatment options with their health care providers.""'Surgery, ''radiation therapy'', and chemotherapy are the major treatment categories for most brain cancers. Individual treatment plans often include a combination of these treatments. Surgical therapy attempts to remove all of the tumor cells by cutting the tumor away from normal brain tissue. This surgery that involves opening the skull (craniotomy) is often termed invasive surgery to distinguish it from noninvasive radiosurgery or radiation therapy described below. Some brain cancers are termed inoperable by surgeons because attempting to remove the cancer may cause further ''brain damage'' or death. However, a brain cancer termed inoperable by one surgeon may be considered operable by another surgeon. Patients with a diagnosis of an inoperable brain tumor should consider seeking a second opinion before surgical treatment is abandoned.'""Radiation therapy attempts to destroy tumor cells by using high-energy radiation focused onto the tumor to destroy the tumor cells' ability to function and replicate. Radiosurgery is a nonsurgical procedure that delivers a single high dose of precisely targeted radiation using highly focused gamma-ray or X-ray beams that converge on the specific area or areas of the brain where the tumor or other abnormality is located, minimizing the amount of radiation to healthy brain tissue. Equipment used to do radiosurgery varies in its radiation source; a gamma knife uses focused gamma rays, and a linear accelerator uses photons, while heavy-charged particle radiosurgery uses a proton beam. Tomotherapy is a type of radiotherapy in which radiation is delivered in a highly precise and individualized manner that minimizes radiation exposure to healthy tissue; it has also been used to treat brain cancer.""'Chemotherapy attempts to destroy tumor cells using chemicals (''drugs'') that are designed to destroy specific types of cancer cells. There are many chemical agents used; specific drug therapies are numerous, and each regimen is usually designed for the specific type of brain cancer and individualized for each patient. For example, bevacizumab (''Avastin'') is a drug approved for treatment of glioblastomas (''glioblastoma'' multiforme). Chemotherapy can be administered intrathecally (into the cerebrospinal fluid by a ''spinal tap'' or through a surgically placed permanent reservoir under the ''scalp'' attached through a sterile tubing placed into the fluid-containing chambers in the brain), by IV administration, and biodegradable chemically impregnated polymers. All treatments attempt to spare normal brain cells.''Other treatment options may include hyperthermia (heat treatments), immunotherapy (immune cells directed to kill certain cancer cell types), or steroids to reduce inflammation and brain swelling. These may be added on to other treatment plans.''Clinical trials'' (treatment plans designed by scientists and physicians to try new chemicals or treatment methods on patients) can be another way for patients to obtain treatment specifically for their cancer cell type. Clinical trials are part of the research efforts to produce better treatments for all disease types. Stem cell treatments for brain and brain stem cancers and other conditions may be available, because research with patients is ongoing using these potential therapies. The best treatment for brain cancer is designed by the team of cancer specialists in conjunction with the wishes of the patient.' "
Are there any home remedies for brain cancer?,"'There are many home remedies that make claims of being effective in treating brain cancer (and many other cancers). Most are ''nutrition'' or ''supplements'' like herbs, fish oils, chokeberry, and many others. Most have little or no research data to support their claims. Before using such compounds, discuss their use with your doctors.' "
What are the side effects of brain cancer treatment?,"'Side effects of brain cancer treatment vary with the treatment plan (for example, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) and the overall health status of the patient. Most treatment plans try to keep all side effects to a minimum. For some patients, the side effects of brain cancer treatment can be severe. Treatment plans should include a discussion of potential side effects and the likelihood of them developing, so the patient and their caregivers (family, friends) can make appropriate treatment decisions in conjunction with their medical team. Also, if side effects develop, the patient has some knowledge of what to do about them such as when to take certain medicines (for example, ''anti-nausea'' medication is frequently given) or when to call their doctor to report health changes.''Surgical side effects include an increase in current symptoms, damage to normal brain tissue, brain swelling, and seizures. Other symptoms of changes in brain function such as muscle weakness, mental changes, and decreases in any brain-controlled function can occur. Combinations of these side effects may happen. The side effects are most noticeable shortly after surgery but frequently decline over time. Occasionally, the side effects do not go away.''Chemotherapy usually affects (damages or kills) rapidly growing cancer cells but also can affect normal tissue. Chemotherapy is usually given intravenously so the drugs can reach most body organs. Common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, vomiting, ''hair loss'', and loss of energy. The immune system is often ''depressed'' by chemotherapy, which results in a high susceptibility to infections. Other systems, such as the kidneys and the reproductive organs, may also be damaged by chemotherapy and are complications of therapy. Most of the side effects decline over time, but some may not.''Radiation therapy has most of the same side effects as chemotherapy. Most radiation therapy is focused onto the brain cancer tissue, so some systems do not receive direct radiation (immune system, kidneys, and others). The effects on systems not receiving the direct radiation are usually not as severe as those seen with chemotherapy. However, hair and skin are usually affected, resulting in ''hair loss'' (sometimes permanently) and reddish and darkened skin that needs protection from the sun.'  "
What is the prognosis of treated brain cancer?,"'Survival of treated brain cancer varies with the cancer type (low-grade versus aggressive and/or inoperable, for example), location, overall age, and general health of the patient. In general, most treatment plans seldom result in a cure. Reports of survival rate or life expectancy greater that five years (which is considered to be long-term survival) vary from less than about 5% to a high of 86%, no matter what treatment plan is used; recovery (cure) from brain cancer is possible, but realistically, complete recovery does not occur often. However, about 75% of children will survive pediatric brain cancer longer than five years; often because of chronic diseases, the elderly have poorer outcomes except with the lowest grade tumors.'""So, why use any treatment plan? Without treatment, brain cancers are usually aggressive and result in death within a short time span. Treatment plans can prolong survival and can improve the patient's quality of life for some time. Again, the patient and caregivers should discuss the prognosis when deciding on treatment plans.""'In general, life expectancy in patients with brain cancer is usually described as a survival rate five years after diagnosis. The survival rate is expressed as a percentage of people still alive five years after the diagnosis and/or treatment. The survival rates vary with the type and grade of brain cancer and the age of the patient. For example, glioblastomas in patients aged 20-44 have a five-year survival rate of 19% and only a 5% rate in patients aged 55-64. In contrast, patients with a meningioma (a benign brain tumor) in the same age groups have survival rates of 87% and 71%, respectively. These survival rates change as advancements in treatment plans improve; the patient and his/her doctors should discuss these rates as they are only estimates, and each person is different. Survival with no reoccurrence of the disease after five years is considered a cure by some; however, close follow-up with doctors is usually recommended to quickly evaluate any possible recurrence of the cancer.'  "
What can I do to help my family (and me) cope with my diagnosis of brain cancer?,"""Discuss your concerns openly with your doctors and family members. It is common for brain cancer patients to be concerned about how they can continue to lead their lives as normally as possible; it is also common for them to become anxious, depressed, and angry. Most people cope better when they discuss their concerns and feelings. Although some patients can do this with friends and relatives, others find solace in support groups (people who have brain cancer and are willing to discuss their experiences with other patients) composed of people who have experienced similar situations and feelings. The patient's treatment team of doctors should be able to connect patients with support groups. In addition, information about local support groups is available from the American Cancer Society at ""'http://www.cancer.org/docroot/home/index.asp'' or the American Brain Tumor Association at ''https://www.abta.org/''.' "
Is it possible to prevent brain cancer?,"'Although there is no way to prevent brain cancers, early diagnosis and treatment of tumors that tend to metastasize to the brain may reduce the risk of metastatic brain tumors. The following factors have been suggested as possible risk factors for primary brain tumors: radiation to the head, ''HIV'' infection, and environmental toxins. However, no one knows the exact causes that initiate brain cancer, especially primary brain cancer, so specific preventive measures are not known. Although web sites and popular press articles suggest that macrobiotic diets, not using cell phones, and other methods will help prevent brain cancer, there is no reliable data to support these claims.' "
Where can I get more information about my type of brain cancer?,"""There are many types of brain cancer. For more specific information about a cancer type, questions and discussions with the patient's treatment team are the best way to obtain specific information. Also, there are many online resources available about brain cancer types. Often, these resources provide additional detailed information about pathology, statistics, treatments, and support groups for brain cancer patients."" "
What is concussion?,"'Concussion'' describes a ''brain injury'' where, after an injury, there are functional changes that occur in how the brain works but no structural damage can be seen on standard imaging tests like ''CT scan''.''Mild ''traumatic brain injury'' (MTBI), or concussion, can be defined as a short-lived loss of brain function due to head ''trauma'' that resolves spontaneously. With concussion, function may be interrupted while there is no structural damage to the brain.' "
What causes concussion?,"'The brain floats in cerebrospinal fluid and is encased in the skull. These protections allow it to withstand many of the minor injuries that occur in day-to-day life. However, if there is sufficient force to cause the brain to bounce against the rigid bones of the skull, then there is potential for injury. It is the acceleration and deceleration of the brain against the inside of the skull that can cause the brain to be irritated and interrupt its function. The acceleration can come from a direct blow to the head or face, or from other body trauma that causes the head to shake. While temporary ''loss of consciousness'' due to injury means that a concussion has taken place, most ''concussions'' occur without the patient being knocked out. Studies of football players find that most of those affected were not aware that they had sustained a ''head injury''.'  "
What are the types of concussion?,"'All injuries to the brain are potentially serious and devastating. Historically, attempts to decide what symptoms could define a concussion as more or less severe and serious have not been able to adequately describe potential risk or guide the care provider and patient as to when the brain is fully healed. ''Concussions in sports are more easily studied than in the general public because of their frequency and the numerous studies on their evaluation and treatment. At present, it is reasonable to think of only one type of concussion, since the mechanism is to shake the brain. More importantly, it is important to recognize that there can be a broad spectrum of symptoms and severity for concussions and understand that most concussion symptoms will resolve themselves within a week or 10 days.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of concussion?,"'The signs and symptoms of concussion may be obvious or very subtle. Most patients are unaware that they have sustained a concussion and may not connect their symptoms with a head injury. This is especially true when symptoms develop hours after the initial injury and those events may have been forgotten. Being knocked out (loss of consciousness) or having a ''seizure'' after a head injury are not common and may be very dramatic, but these two symptoms do not predict the severity of the concussion. Symptoms like mild ''confusion'', disorientation, and irritability are most commonly seen. Symptoms tend not to be objective and may be hard to describe or be appreciated by the patient. Often it is family members or friends who are more aware of the situation.''Typical symptoms of concussion include:'""Because of all of the above, students may suffer a drop off in their school work and grades, while adults' work performance may suffer.""'Physical Signs'   Headache Difficulty concentrating or feeling “foggy” Slower reaction times Dizziness, lightheadedness Nausea Difficulty with bright lights or loud sounds Irritability Changes in sleep patterns, either insomnia or sleeping more The purpose of the physical examination is to look for abnormalities that would point to bleeding in the brain or to a neck injury and spinal cord damage. The neurologic exam in patients with concussion should be normal."
How is concussion diagnosed?,"'Taking a history of what happened to the patient is the important first step in the diagnosis and treatment of a concussion. Understanding the mechanism of injury and the sequence of events afterwards is important in deciding the potential risk for bleeding and swelling in the brain.''The history will try to find out if there was an underlying medical problem that caused the injury. For example, in older patients who fall and hit their head and are briefly unconscious, the question becomes: Did the patient hit their head and get knocked out? Or did they pass out due to a ''stroke'' or other problem, then fall and hit their head?''Medications and past history are important considerations. Patients who take blood thinners like ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') or dabigatran (Pradaxa) are at higher risk for bleeding when they get hit in the head.''Physical examination will include a complete neurologic examination and may include looking for ''weakness'', ''paralysis'', or change of sensation in the body. Balance and coordination may be evaluated. Vision and ''hearing'' may also be checked.''The head will be examined looking for signs of injury including the potential for skull or facial bone ''fracture''. The neck may also be evaluated since neck injury can be associated with head trauma.''The concept of minor head injury refers to patients who have had trauma to their head and are fully awake. The question becomes whether a CT scan of the head is needed to look for bleeding or swelling in the brain. Rules have been developed to guide the health care professional and allow the appropriate use of CT scanning. Both the Canadian CT head rules and the New Orleans rules are effective in screening patients who have had a concussion but do not need an operation.''The Canadian CT rules suggest that a CT is required only if any of the following criteria are met (please note that these criteria apply to patients aged 16 to 65).''High risk for neurosurgical intervention:''Medium risk of brain injury on CT:''These guidelines also do not apply to patients who are taking anticoagulation or blood-thinning medications.''Please note that the rules do not consider loss of consciousness or ''seizure'' in determining the potential severity of brain injury.'""The GCS was developed to assess a patient's neurologic status based on speech, eye opening, and movement. The scale is used as part of the initial evaluation of a patient and is meant to be repeated over the course of the patient's care. Since it is relatively easy to do, the GCS can be used by health care professionals with different skill levels to assess changes in patient status.""'A normal awake patient has a GCS of 15. A dead patient has a GCS of 3.''X-rays'' of the skull are not indicated in minor head trauma, since normal X-rays do not mean that there is normal brain function.''Since concussion is defined as a temporary change in brain function, it is important to examine the patient on more than one occasion. Brain function may or may not correlate with the resolution of symptoms. Neuropsychologic testing may be used to assess brain function to decide when to allow a patient to return to full activity.' Glasgow Coma Score <15 at 2 hours after injury *see below Suspected open or depressed skull fracture Any sign of basal skull fracture [blood behind the eardrum, ""raccoon eyes"" or bruising around the eyes, cerebrospinal fluid leaking from the nose or ears, or Battle's sign (bruising behind the ear)] More than two episodes of vomiting, age >65 years Amnesia before impact of greater than 30 minutes Dangerous mechanism (for example, pedestrian hit by car, thrown from a moving vehicle, fall from height)"
What is the treatment for concussion?,"'\tTime is the ally in concussion treatment since most symptoms resolve relatively quickly. Treatment is directed at symptom control for ''headaches'', ''nausea'', ''dizziness'', and ''insomnia''.'""\tBrain rest is an important concept. In today's high tech connected world, the brain is often asked to process information at a high rate of speed from television, computers, and smartphones. Limiting use of those devices may be helpful in allowing the brain to recover more quickly.""'\tUltimately, the brain will recover at its own pace. While most concussion patients will recover within 7 to 10 days, some patients will experience symptoms for weeks or months. The length of recovery is not necessarily related to the initial injury.''\tDiscussion with employers may be needed to alert them to issues of poor work performance due to difficulty with concentration and comprehension. Similarly, school officials should be notified about the potential for decrease in school function.''\tReturn to sports depends upon complete resolution of concussion symptoms and it is important not to return to practice or competition too soon. A concussed brain may be more prone to repeated injury.'  "
How can concussion prevented?,"'As with most accidents, injury ''prevention'' is the first consideration. The following are all important steps to prevent concussion and severe head injuries:' workplace safety using helmets where required or recommended; using seatbelts in motor vehicles; wearing helmets while bicycling and motorcycle riding; and head protection should be worn when participating in some sports. Proper technique is also important to prevent injuries. "
What is the future of concussion?,"'Public education is important in raising awareness for concussion and its complications. Players, coaches, and parents are being educated in how to recognize symptoms and prevent the return of the player to the field until it is safe. Similarly, educational efforts at the workplace are increasing awareness of the signs and symptoms of concussion.''Research continues as to the when the best time is to return to full activity. A variety of computer based programs (ImPACT™) are being used as screening tests to measure reaction times and emotional changes. Once a patient “passes” these tests, repeat evaluation by a care professional is usually required before return to full activity.''Patients with severe head trauma may have genetic factors that affect their prognosis. A variety of hormones and chemicals may affect brain function and recovery. The impact of this research on patients with minor head injury and concussion is as yet uncertain.' "
Brain damage introduction,"'Brain damage is an injury that causes the destruction or deterioration of brain cells.''In the U.S., every year, about 1.4 million people have some type of ''brain injury''. And approximately 5.3 million people suffer from the effects of brain damage. About 50,000 die as a result of brain injury. Medical costs and lost productivity are estimated at between $48 billion and $60 billion per year.' "
What are the types of brain damage and how severe are they?,"'All traumatic brain injuries are head injuries. But ''head injury'"" is not necessarily brain injury. There are two types of brain injury: traumatic brain injury and acquired brain injury. Both disrupt the brain's normal functioning.""'Both traumatic brain injury and acquired brain injury occur after birth. And neither is degenerative. Sometimes, the two terms are used interchangeably.''There is a kind of brain damage that results from genetics or birth ''trauma'"". It's called congenital brain damage. It is not included, though, within the standard definition of brain damage or traumatic brain injury.""'Most brain injuries cause focal -- or localized -- brain damage, such as the damage caused when a bullet enters the brain. In other words, the damage is confined to a small area. Closed head injuries frequently cause diffuse brain damage, which means damage to several areas of the brain. For example, both major speech and language areas might be involved.''The severity of brain damage can vary with the type of brain injury. A mild brain injury is temporary. It causes such symptoms as ''headaches'', ''confusion'', memory problems, and ''nausea''. In a moderate brain injury, symptoms can last longer and be more pronounced. In both cases, most patients make a good recovery.''With a serious brain injury, the person may suffer life-changing and debilitating problems. People who are in a ''coma'' or a minimally responsive state are examples of those who are likely to have permanent brain damage.' Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is caused by an external force -- such as a blow to the head -- that causes the brain to move inside the skull or damages the skull. This in turn damages the brain. An Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) occurs at the cellular level. It is most often associated with pressure on the brain. This could come from a tumor. Or it could result from neurological illness, as in the case of a stroke."
What causes brain damage?,"'When the brain is starved of oxygen for a prolonged period of time, brain damage may occur. Brain damage can occur as a result of a wide range of injuries, illnesses, or conditions. Because of high-risk behaviors, males between the ages of 15 and 24 are most vulnerable. Young children and the elderly also have a higher risk.''Causes of traumatic brain injury include:''Causes of acquired brain injury include:'   car accidents blows to the head sports injuries falls or accidents physical violence poisoning or exposure to toxic substances infection strangulation, choking, or drowning stroke heart attacks tumors aneurysms neurological illnesses abuse of illegal drugs"
What are the symptoms of brain damage?,"'There are numerous symptoms of brain damage, whether traumatic or acquired. They fall into four major categories:''Cognitive symptoms of brain damage include:''Perceptual symptoms of brain damage include:''Physical symptoms of brain damage include:''Behavioral/emotional symptoms of brain damage include:' cognitive perceptual physical behavioral/emotional difficulty processing information difficulty in expressing thoughts difficulty understanding others shortened attention span inability to understand abstract concepts impaired decision-making ability memory loss change in vision, hearing, or sense of touch spatial disorientation inability to sense time disorders of smell and taste balance issues heightened sensitivity to pain persistent headaches extreme mental fatigue extreme physical fatigue paralysis tremors seizures sensitivity to light sleep disorders slurred speech loss of consciousness irritability and impatience reduced tolerance for stress sluggishness flattened or heightened emotions or reactions denial of disability increased aggressiveness"
How are brain damage and brain injuries treated?,"'Anyone who has a head or brain injury needs immediate medical attention.''A brain injury that seems mild -- referred to as a ''concussion'' -- can be as dangerous as clearly severe injuries. The key factor is the extent and location of the damage. Brain injury does not necessarily result in long-term disability or impairment. But the correct diagnosis and treatment is needed to contain or minimize the damage.''The extent and effect of brain damage is determined by a neurological exam, neuroimaging testing such as X-rays or CT scans, and neuropsychological assessment such as checking reflexes. Doctors will stabilize the patient to prevent further injury, ensure blood and oxygen are flowing properly to the brain, and ensure that ''blood pressure'' is controlled.''About half of severely injured patients require surgery to repair a ruptured blood vessel or to relieve pressure on the brain.''If a patient is severely injured, rehabilitation may be ordered to assist in long-term recovery. That may include:'  physical therapy occupational therapy speech and language therapy psychological support"
Can I prevent brain injuries?,"'Most injuries that cause brain damage are preventable. Here are some rules to follow to reduce the risk of brain damage:''WebMD Medical Reference'   Never shake a child. Install window guards to keep young children from falling out of open windows. Install shock-absorbing material on playgrounds. Wear helmets during sports or cycling. Wear seatbelts in cars, and drive carefully. Avoid falls by using a stepstool when reaching for high items. Install handrails on stairways. Don't keep guns; if you do, keep them unloaded and locked away. Don't use illegal drugs. Drink alcohol only in moderation, and never drink and drive."
What is a brain hemorrhage?,"'A brain hemorrhage is bleeding in or around the brain. It is a form of ''stroke''. Causes of brain hemorrhage include ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), abnormally weak or dilated (''aneurysm'') blood vessels that leak, ''drug abuse'', and ''trauma''. Many people who experience a brain hemorrhage have symptoms as though they are having a ''stroke'', and can develop ''weakness'' on one side of their body, difficulty speaking, or a sense of numbness. Difficulty performing usual activities, including problems with ''walking'' or even falling, are not uncommon symptoms. About 13% of all ''strokes'' are hemorrhagic ''strokes'', or caused by bleeding into the brain.''Brain hemorrhage is often labeled according to precisely where it occurs in the brain. In general, bleeding anywhere inside of the skull is called an intracranial hemorrhage. Bleeding within the brain itself is known as an intracerebral hemorrhage. Bleeding can also occur between the covering of the brain and the brain tissue itself, referred to as a subarachnoid hemorrhage. If a ''blood clot'' occurs between the skull and the brain, it is known as either a subdural or epidural ''hematoma'' depending on whether it is below or above the tough covering (dura) of the brain. Subdural and epidural hematomas are more likely to occur as a result of a ''traumatic brain injury'' or after a fall and will not be addressed in detail here.''It is important to recognize that when bleeding occurs within the brain itself, ''headache'"" may not occur, as our brains don't have the ability to sense the ongoing disturbance. However, the coverings of the brain (meninges) are extremely sensitive and if bleeding occurs there, as when an ""'aneurysm'' ruptures, a sudden and severe ''headache'' is a common ''stroke'' symptom.' "
What causes a brain hemorrhage?,"'The most common cause of a brain hemorrhage is elevated ''blood pressure''. Over time, ''high blood pressure'' can weaken arterial walls and lead to rupture. When this occurs, blood collects in the brain leading to symptoms of a ''stroke''. Other causes of hemorrhage include ''aneurysm'' -- a weak spot in the wall of an artery -- which then balloons out and may break open. Arteriovenous malformations (''AVM'') are abnormal connections between arteries and veins and are usually present from birth and can cause brain hemorrhage later in life. In some cases, people with ''cancer'' who develop distant spread of their original ''cancer'' to their brain (metastatic disease) can develop brain hemorrhages in the areas of brain where the ''cancer'' has spread. In elderly individuals, amyloid protein deposits along the blood vessels can cause the vessel wall to weaken leading to a hemorrhagic ''stroke''. ''Cocaine'' or ''drug abuse'' can weaken blood vessels and lead to bleeding in the brain. Some prescription ''drugs'' can also increase the risk of brain hemorrhage.'  "
What are symptoms and signs of a brain hemorrhage?,"'Although ''headache'' is frequently associated with bleeding in the brain, it is not always present. Most often, the symptoms associated with a brain hemorrhage are dependent on the particular area of the brain that is involved. If the bleeding is in the part of the brain associated with vision, there may be problems seeing. Problems with balance and coordination, ''weakness'' on one side, numbness, or sudden ''seizure'' may occur. The speech center for many people is located in the left side of the brain and bleeding into this area may cause marked speech disturbances. If the bleeding is in the lower brain (brainstem), where most of the automatic body functions are regulated, a patient may become unresponsive or go into a ''coma''. Additionally, sometimes symptoms of brain hemorrhage may come on very abruptly and rapidly worsen. Alternatively, the symptoms may progress slowly over many hours or even days.'  "
How do doctors diagnose a brain hemorrhage?,"'If any kind of ''stroke'' is suspected, immediate evaluation is needed. Examination may reveal evidence of ''brain injury'' with weakness, slurred speech, and/or loss of sensations. Generally, a radiology examination is necessary, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') scan. The CT or ''MRI'' can highlight various features and location of brain bleeding. If bleeding inside of or around the brain is noted, further testing may be ordered to try to determine the cause of the bleeding. This additional testing can help to determine if abnormal blood vessels are present as well as the next step in either diagnosis or treatment. In certain situations, a ''spinal tap'' (''lumbar puncture'') may be required to confirm evidence of bleeding or rule out other brain problems.' "
What is the treatment for a brain hemorrhage?,"'Patients with bleeding inside of the brain must be monitored very closely. Early treatment includes stabilizing ''blood pressure'' and ''breathing''. A ''breathing'' assist machine (ventilator) can be required to ensure that enough oxygen is supplied to the brain and other organs. Intravenous access is needed so that fluids and medications can be given to the patient, especially if the person is unconscious. Sometimes specialized monitoring of ''heart'' rhythms, blood oxygen levels, or pressure inside of the skull is needed.''After a person has been stabilized, then a determination of how to address the bleeding is made. This stabilization and decision-making process takes place very rapidly. The decision to perform surgery is based on the size and location of the hemorrhage. Not everyone with an intracranial hemorrhage needs to have surgery.''Various medications may be used to help decrease swelling around the area of the hemorrhage, to keep blood pressure at an optimal level, and to prevent ''seizure''. If a patient is awake, ''pain'' medication may be needed.'  "
What is the prognosis after a brain hemorrhage? Is recovery possible?,"'Many patients who have experienced a brain hemorrhage do survive. However, survival rates are decreased when the bleeding occurs in certain areas of the brain or if the initial bleed was very large.''If a patient survives the initial event of an intracranial hemorrhage, recovery may take many months. Over time and with extensive rehabilitation efforts, including physical, occupational, and speech therapy, patients can regain function. However, some can be left with persistent weakness or sensory problems. Other patients may have residual ''seizures'', ''headaches'', or memory problems.'  "
Special situations,"'Infants less than 32 weeks gestational age are at higher risk of developing intracranial bleeding, due to the immaturity of the blood vessels. A significant percentage of premature infants may develop some amount of intracranial hemorrhage. This can lead to ''hydrocephalus'', or an enlargement of the fluid-filled spaces of the brain, and can be very serious. If delivery cannot be delayed, certain medications can be given to the mother in an effort to help prevent this condition.' "
Facts you should know about head injuries," Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) account for thousands of deaths each year in the U.S. As well, significant numbers of people suffer temporary or permanent disability due to brain injury. Head injury does not necessarily mean brain injury. The bony skull protects the brain. Scalp lacerations or skull fractures may or may not have associated brain injury. Bleeding into and surrounding the brain usually occurs at the time of injury and over time may continue so that there is increasing pressure within the skull. However, symptoms may develop immediately or appear gradually over time. Medical care should be sought for any patient who is not fully awake after an injury. Activate emergency medical services or call 9-1-1. Computerized tomography looks for bleeding and swelling in the brain. Not all patients with minor head injuries require CT scanning. Bleeding in the brain may require neurosurgery to remove blood clots and relieve pressure on the brain. Not all brain injuries require neurosurgery. Prevention is key to avoiding head injury. The use of bicycle helmets, motorcycle helmets, and seat belts can decrease the risk of head injury.
"
What is a head injury?,"'While head injuries are one of the most common ''causes of death'' and disability in the United States, many patients with head injuries are treated and released from the emergency department after receiving treatment.Brain injury may be caused by a direct blow to the head, but shaking may also cause damage. The head is perched on the neck, and rapid acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause the brain to be damaged. The face and jaw are located in the front of the head, and brain injury may also be associated with injuries to these structures. It is also important to note that a head injury does not always mean that there is also a brain injury.''The brain is a soft and pliable structure that is almost jelly-like in feel and is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained between layers of meninges, thin layers of tissue that cover the brain. There are three layers of meninges: 1) the pia mater, 2) the arachnoid mater, and 3) the dura mater. The CSF is present in the space beneath the arachnoid layer called the subarachnoid space.''The dura mater is very thick and has septae, or partitions, that help support the brain within the skull. The septae attach to the inner lining of the bones of the skull. The dura mater also helps support the large veins that return blood from the brain to the ''heart''.''The spaces between the meninges are usually very small and compressed, but they can fill with blood when ''trauma'' occurs. This buildup of blood takes up space and increases pressure within the skull, potentially pressing into brain tissue and causing damage.''The skull protects the brain from trauma but it does not absorb much impact from a blow. Direct blows may cause fractures of the skull. There can be a ''contusion'' or ''bruising'' and bleeding to the brain tissue directly beneath the injury site. However, the brain can bounce around, or slosh, inside the skull and because of this, the brain injury may not necessarily be located directly below the trauma site. A contre-coup injury describes the situation in which the brain is damaged when the initial blow to the head causes the brain to bounce away from that forceful blow and hit the skull directly opposite the trauma site. Acceleration/deceleration and rotation are the common types of forces that can cause injuries away from the area of the skull that received the trauma.''Head injuries due to bleeding are often classified by the location of the blood within the skull.''Skull fractures are described by which bone is broken, whether there is an associated laceration of the scalp (open ''fracture''), and whether the bone is ''depressed'' and potentially pushed into the brain tissue.''Brain injuries often occur in combination with one another. The effects of brain injury depend upon the amount of brain tissue damaged and the level of pressure within the skull and its effects on the brain.' Epidural hematoma: With an epidural hematoma, the bleeding is located between the dura mater and the skull (epi=outside). This injury 
most often occurs along the side of the head where the middle meningeal artery runs in a groove along the temporal bone. This bone is relatively thin and offers less protection than other parts of the skull. As the bleeding continues, the hematoma or clot expands. There is little space in the skull for the hematoma to grow and as it expands, the adjacent brain tissue is compressed. With increased pressure the brain begins to shift and becomes compressed against the bones of the skull. The pressure tends to build quickly because the septae that attach the dura to the skull bones create small spaces that trap blood. Symptoms of head injury and decreased level of consciousness occur as the pressure increases. Subdural hematoma: A subdural hematoma is located beneath the dura mater (sub=below), between it and the arachnoid layer. Blood in this space is able to dissipate into a larger space because there are no septae limiting the blood flow. However, after a period of time, the amount of bleeding may cause increased pressure and cause symptoms similar to those seen with an epidural hematoma. Subarachnoid bleed: Subarachnoid bleeding occurs in the space beneath the arachnoid layer where the cerebrospinal fluid is located. Often there is intense headache and vomiting with subarachnoid bleeding. Because this space connects with the spinal canal, pressure buildup tends not to occur. However, this injury often occurs in combination with the other types of bleeding in the brain and the symptoms may be compounded. Intracerebral bleed: Intracerebral bleeding occurs within the brain tissue itself. Sometimes the amount of bleeding is small, but like bruising in any other part of the body, swelling or edema may occur over a period of time, causing a progressive decrease in the level of consciousness and other symptoms of head injury. Sheer injury: Sometimes, the damage is due to sheer injury, where there is no obvious bleeding in the brain, but instead the nerve fibers within the brain are stretched or torn. Another term for this type of injury is diffuse axonal injury. Edema: All injuries to the brain may also cause swelling or edema, no different than the swelling that surrounds a bruise on an arm or leg. However, because the bones of the skull cannot stretch to accommodate the extra volume caused by swelling, the pressure increases inside the skull and causes the brain to compress against the skull. Skull fracture: The bones of the skull are classified as flat bones, meaning that they do not have an inside marrow. It takes a significant amount of force to break the skull, and the skull does not absorb any of that impact. It is often transmitted directly to the brain."
What are the causes of head injury?,"'By definition, trauma is required to cause a head injury, but that trauma does not necessarily need to be violent. Falling down a few steps or falling into a hard object may be enough to cause damage. Motor vehicle crashes account for about 17% of traumatic brain injuries, while 35% are from falls. The majority of head injuries occur in males.''Penetrating head injuries describe those situations in which the injury occurs due to a projectile, for example a bullet, or when an object is impaled though the skull into the brain. ''Closed head injuries refer to injuries in which no lacerations are present. ''The brain may also be injured without a direct blow to the skull. If there is trauma in which the head shakes back and forth, it may cause the brain to shake and slosh around inside the skull and become injured.'  "
What are the symptoms of a head injury?,"'The symptoms of head injury can vary from almost none to ''loss of consciousness'' and ''coma''. As well, the symptoms may not necessarily occur immediately at the time of injury. While a brain injury occurs at the time of trauma, it may take time for enough swelling or bleeding to occur to cause symptoms that are recognizable.''Initial symptoms may include a change in mental status, meaning an alteration in the wakefulness of the patient. There may be loss of consciousness, lethargy, and ''confusion''. ''Head injury symptoms may also include:''Some of these symptoms are similar to those of a ''stroke''. Other symptoms may be subtler and include''Late signs of significant head injury and raised pressure within the brain and skull include a dilated pupil, ''high blood pressure'', low pulse rate, and abnormal ''breathing'' pattern. These are critical changes in the physical examination and indicate that brain death may be near.''''Coma'"" may be present if the patient doesn't awaken completely and is defined as a prolonged episode of altered level of consciousness. There are different levels of coma, and the Glasgow coma scale is one way of measuring its depth.""   vomiting, difficulty tolerating bright lights, leaking cerebrospinal fluid from the ear or nose, bleeding from the ear, speech difficulty, paralysis, difficulty swallowing, and numbness of the body. nausea, dizziness, irritability, change in personality, sleep changes, including insomnia or persistent sleepiness, difficulty concentrating and thinking, and amnesia."
What is the Glasgow coma scale?,"'The Glasgow Coma Scale was developed to provide health care practitioners a simple way of measuring the depth of coma based upon observations of eye opening, speech, and movement. Patients in the deepest level of coma:''Those in lighter comas may offer some response, to the point they may even seem awake, yet meet the criteria of coma because they do not respond normally to their environment.''An awake person has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, while a person who is dead would have a score of 3. The abnormal motor responses of flexion and extension describe arm and leg movement when a painful stimulus is applied. The term ""''decorticate''"" means that the cortex of the brain, the part that deals with movement, sensation, and thinking, is not working. ""''Decerebrate''"" means that the cerebrum (the whole brain), the cortex, and the brainstem that controls basic bodily functions like breathing and heartbeat, is not working.''The scale is used as part of the initial evaluation of a patient, but does not assist in making the diagnosis as to the cause of coma. Since it ""scores"" the level of coma, the Glasgow Coma Scale can be used as a standard method for pre-hospital emergency providers to determine the severity of head injury. It also allows the next provider in the chain of care to compare their assessment to the previous one. In this way, there is a standard score to determine whether the patient is improving or decompensating from the injury scene during the transitions to the ER, to the operating room, or ICU.' do not respond with any body movement to pain, do not have any speech, and do not open their eyes."
When should I contact a doctor about a head injury?,"'It is not normal to be unconscious or not fully awake. Emergency medical services (call 9-1-1 in your areas if it is available) should be activated for persons who have sustained an injury.'""Because head injuries may also be associated with neck injuries, victims should not be moved unless they are in harm's way. If possible, it is important to wait for trained medical personnel to help with immobilizing and moving the patient.""'If the patient is awake and feeling normal, it may be worthwhile seeking medical care if there was significant trauma. These patients may be considered to have a minor head injury or ''concussion''. There is a significant amount of research that has been done to decide which people with head injuries should be admitted to the hospital for observation or have a CT (computerized tomography) scan of the head to look for bleeding.''Many guidelines exist to help a physician decide who might have a brain injury associated with a head injury. These guidelines (Ottawa or Canadian CT rules, New Orleans CT rules) apply to people ages 16 to 65 who are fully awake and have a Glasgow coma scale of 15. Potential brain injury may exist if the patient had any of the following:''Those older than 65 years of age are at increased risk of bleeding from head injury because the ''aging'' brain shrinks away from the skull, causing the veins that ''bridge'' from the skull to the brain surface to be more easily torn.''The rules deciding what patient might need a ''CT scan'' do not apply when the patient is taking a blood thinner or anti-platelet medication. Even minor injury may cause significant bleeding within the skull, potentially causing brain injury.' amnesia to events preceding the injury, vomiting, alcohol or drug intoxication, seizure, trauma above the collarbones, significant headache, and dangerous mechanism of injury like a fall from more than five stairs or being hit by a car. Examples of blood thinners include warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and dabigatran (Pradaxa). Examples of anti-platelet medications include clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta).
"
How do medical professionals diagnose a head injury?,"'As with most injuries and illnesses, finding out what happened to the patient is very important. The health care professional will take a history of the events. The information may be provided by the patient, people who witnessed the event, emergency medical personnel, and if applicable, the police. The circumstances are very important since it is important to find out the severity and intensity of the trauma sustained by the head. Please be aware, even ''small head'' ''bumps'' or shaking can cause a brain injury.''In all trauma patients, especially those who have an injury around the collarbone, care needs to be taken to consider whether a neck or cervical spine injury has occurred. Often the neck is immobilized until this concern can be addressed.''Physical examination begins with assessing the ABCs (''airway'', breathing, circulation) to make certain that the patient is stable and does not need emergent life-saving interventions. This is especially important in those patients who are unconscious and may not be able to maintain their own airway or breathe on their own.''If the patient is not fully awake, the examination will initially try to determine the level of coma. The Glasgow Coma Scale number is useful in tracking whether the patient is improving or declining in function over time.''If no other injuries are found on examining the body, attention will be paid to the head and the neurologic exam.''The skull may be examined for signs of trauma, including bruising (contusion) and swelling (hematoma). Palpating or feeling the skull may find evidence of a ''fracture''. If a laceration is present, it is important to know if there is a ''broken bone'' beneath it. The face may be examined as well, since the face provides protection to the front of the head.''The health care professional may also examine the patient for evidence of a basilar skull fracture, in which an injury has occurred to the bones that support the brain. Signs of this type of fracture include:''The neurologic exam may include evaluation of the cranial nerves, the short nerves that leave the brain and control the face muscles, eye movements, swallowing, ''hearing'', and sight, among other functions.''The exam may include evaluation of muscle tone and strength of the arms and legs; sensation in the extremities (including light touch, ''pain'"", and vibration); and if the neck is determined not to be injured, the patient's ability to walk may be assessed.""'Depending upon the findings of the physical examination, a CT scan may be needed to look for bleeding in the brain.''It is important to remember that injuries to other parts of the body may also be present, and the evaluation of the head injury may occur at the same time as the evaluation of other injuries.' bruising of the tissues around the eyes (called raccoon eyes), bruising behind the ear (Battle's sign), bleeding from the ear canal, or cerebrospinal fluid leaking from the ear or nose."
How is a head injury treated?,"'The treatment of a head injury depends upon the type of injury. For patients with minor head injuries (''concussions''), nothing more may be needed other than observation and symptom control. ''Headache'' may require pain medication. ''Nausea'' and vomiting may require medications to control these symptoms.''Bleeding''Intracerebral bleeding'"" or bleeding in the spaces surrounding the brain require a neurosurgical consultation, although not all bleeding requires an operation. The decision to operate will be individualized based upon the injury and the patient's medical status.""'One option may include craniotomy, drilling a hole into the skull or removing part of one of the skull bones to remove or drain a ''blood clot'', and thereby relieve pressure on brain tissue.''Other times, the treatment is supportive, and there may be a need to monitor the pressure within the brain. The neurosurgeon may place a pressure monitor through a drilled hole through the skull to monitor the pressure. The slang term for this procedure is ""placing a bolt.""''Supportive care is often required for those patients with significant amounts of bleeding in their brain and who are in coma. Many times, the patient requires ''intubation'' to help control breathing and to protect them from vomiting and aspirating vomit into the ''lungs''. Medications may be used to sedate the patient for comfort and to prevent injury if the bleeding causes combativeness. Medications may also be used to try to control swelling in the brain if necessary.'  "
What is the prognosis for a head injury?,"'The goal for the treatment of any patient is to return to the level of function that they had prior to the injury. This maybe a challenge with head injury, and the return of function depends upon the severity of the injury to the brain.'  "
How can a head injury be prevented?,"'Prevention is the best way to treat a head injury.'  In sporting activities, the use of a helmet may help decrease the risk of injury. Similarly, wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle or bicycle helps minimize the risk of brain injury. Seatbelts can help prevent a head injury during a motor vehicle crash. Since alcohol is a risk factor for falls and other injuries, it should be used responsibly. Falls are a concern in the elderly. Homes can be made less fall-prone by installing assist devices on walls and in bathrooms. Loose floor coverings such as area rugs should be avoided, since walking from one floor covering to another increases the risk of falls. If needed, canes and walkers may be helpful as walking assistive devices."
What about a head injury in infants and young children?,"'A minor head injury in an infant is described by the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' as the following, ""A history or physical signs of blunt trauma to the scalp, skull, or brain in an infant or child who is alert or awakens to voice or light touch.""''In children and infants younger than 2 years of age, it is more difficult to assess their mental status and guidelines that work for adults do not necessarily apply to this age group. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) has developed an algorithm that helps decide when a CT scan of the head might be appropriate.''For children younger than 2 years of age:''CT scan is recommended for those patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 15, ''altered mental status'', or a palpable skull fracture. ''For those with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15 but with an occipital, temporal, or parietal hematoma (that is swelling on the back or side of the head), significant trauma, or loss of consciousness for greater than 5 seconds, or for those not acting normally according to their parents, a CT scan may be considered based upon the following: ''In some situations, observation instead of CT scan may be appropriate. For all others, CT scan is not recommended.''For children older than 2 years of age:''CT scan is recommended for those patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 15, altered mental status, or a basilar skull fracture.''For patients with loss of consciousness, vomiting, severe ''headache'', or a severe mechanism of injury, a CT scan may be considered based upon the following:''In some situations, observation instead of CT scan may be appropriate. For all others, CT scan is not recommended.'   physician experience, multiple physical findings, worsening symptoms during observation in the ER, age less than 3 months, or parental preference. physician experience, multiple physical findings, worsening symptoms during observation in the ER, or parental preference."
Facts you should know about brain lesions," The brain is perhaps the most important organ in the body, responsible for the unconscious autonomic activities like breathing, blood pressure and temperature control, sensation, movement, and thought processes. Neurons and glia are the two types of cells that make up the brain. Each area of the brain has a responsibility for brain function. A brain lesion describes an area of damaged brain. It may be isolated or there may be numerous areas affected. Symptoms of a brain lesion depend upon what part of the brain is affected and may be minimal or life-threatening. Diagnosis of brain lesions begin with a careful history and physical examination of the affected individual. The brain may be imaged in a variety of ways including CT, MRI and angiography. Treatment and prognosis of brain lesions depend upon the underlying illness or injury, and the amount of damage sustained by the brain."
Brain anatomy,"'The brain is responsible for regulation the functions of the body, from the unconscious (controlling ''blood pressure'', ''heart'' rate and respiratory rate) to the conscious acts like ''walking'' and talking. Add the intellectual processes of thought and the brain is a busy part of the ''human body''. ''The brain has many parts. The cerebrum consists of two hemispheres which are responsible for movement, sensation, thought, judgment, problem solving, and emotion. The brain stem sits beneath the cerebrum and connects it to the spinal cord. The brain stem houses the structures that are responsible for the unconscious regulation of the body such as wakefulness, heart and lung function, hunger, temperature control, and swallowing. The cerebellum is located beneath and behind the cerebrum and is responsible for posture, balance, and coordination.''While the brainstem is important in maintaining body function, the cerebrum allows body motion and most importantly, is responsible for all the things that make humans special, like thinking and emotion. There are four lobes in each hemisphere: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital.''Brain cells use ''glucose'' almost exclusively for their energy needs and unlike other organs in the body, the brain cannot store glucose for future use. If ''blood sugar'' levels fall, brain function can be immediately compromised.''The brain gets its blood supply through four major arteries, the right and left carotids and the right and left vertebral arteries. They join together at the base of the brain at the Circle of Willis. Smaller blood vessels then branch out to provide oxygen and glucose rich blood to all regions of the brain.''The brain is composed of billions of cells that use chemicals and electricity to communicate between themselves and the rest of the body. There are two major types of cells, neurons and glial cells; there are subtypes of these cells.' Frontal lobe is the area responsible for personality and movement. The pre-frontal portion is perhaps the most evolved part of the brain and specifically allows judgment, planning and organization, problem solving, and critical thinking. This is the area that gives us the ability to feel emotion and have empathy. Finally, this is where impulse control resides. Parietal lobes are where sensation is processed and interpreted. Aside from touch, pressure and pain, there is also the concept of spatial cognition, where the brain recognizes where the body is in relationship to the area around it. Temporal lobes are where the functions of memory, speech, and hearing are located. Occipital lobes are where vision is located. Neurons are the cells that process and transmit information in the brain. Each cell has two connectors, the axon and dendrite. The axon of one neuron connects with the dendrite of another at junction or synapse. Special chemicals called neurotransmitters help transfer the electrical impulse across the synapse so that one neuron can excite another. Glial cells are located between neurons and help support their activity.  Microglial cells are part of the immune system within brain tissue helping clear dead cells and other debris.  Astrocytes help clear neurotransmitter chemicals so that the synapse can be ready to react to the next signal that might arrive.  Oligodendrocytes produce and maintain the myelin sheath that coats and insulates the axon making electrical conduction more efficient.  Ependymal cells produce CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) which is located within the ventricles of the brain and in the subarachnoid space that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Aside from allowing the brain to float in the skull, CSF acts as a cushion against trauma and also helps wash away some of the metabolic waster protects that are produced with brain function."
What are brain lesions?,"'A brain lesion describes damage or destruction to any part of the brain. It may be due to ''trauma'' or any other disease that can cause inflammation, malfunction, or destruction of a brain cells or brain tissue. A lesion may be localized to one part of the brain or they may be widespread. The initial damage may be so small as to not produce any initial symptoms, but progresses over time to cause obvious physical and mental changes.''A brain lesion may affect the neuron directly or one of the glial cells thereby indirectly affecting neuron functions.' "
What causes brain lesions?,"   Trauma is the most widely recognized cause of an acute brain injury. Bleeding or swelling within the skull can directly damage brain cells or the pressure that can build within the skull can compress the brain and compromise its ability to function. Trauma can also damage the brain on a microscopic level. Shear injuries describe damage to the synapse connections between brain cells decreasing their ability to communicate with each other. Recent reports have linked concussions to the gradual destruction of brain cells that can affect personality and thinking. Inflammation within brain tissue can affect function. This inflammation may be due to infections that cause meningitis and encephalitis. Other infections may cause discrete changes within the brain tissue. Neurocysticercosis, for example, is the most common cause of epilepsy in the developing world; the parasite causes small calcifications that are scattered throughout the brain. Infections may also form abscesses within the brain that can lead to symptoms. Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that may affect brain function include sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Some of the brain damage may be caused by inflammation to the blood vessels in the brain, which causes strokes. Certain diseases affect only specific cells within the brain. For example, the symptoms of multiple sclerosis are caused by damage to the glial cells that manufacture and maintain the myelin sheath that insulates axons. Without this normal nerve covering, electrical transmission is compromised and symptoms may occur. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias occur when neuron cells are affected and die prematurely. Stroke or cerebral infarction (cerebral=brain + infarction=loss of blood supply) describes the condition where blood supply to part of the brain is lost and the brain stops functioning. There are numerous reasons for blood supply to decrease. There may be gradual narrowing of an artery to part of the brain, blockage may occur should debris from a diseased carotid artery break loose, or a clot may travel or embolize from the heart. Bleeding may occur from a cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation or because of uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure). Tumors that originate from brain cells or those that metastasize from other organs can affect brain function in two ways. The tumor can destroy brain cells so that their function is lost, or the tumor can take up space and cause pressure and swelling that affects brain cell function. This may occur with benign or cancerous tumors. Common tumors that arise from the brain include meningiomas, adenomas, and gliomas. Pituitary adenomas are common benign tumors that grow in the sella tursica, where the pituitary gland sits and near where the optic nerves travel from the eyes to the occiput in the back of the brain. As the tumor grows it can push on the optic nerve and cause visual changes and blindness. Glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant tumor is the most common type of astrocytoma that arises from astrocytes and is a glioma. Victims of this tumor include Senator Ted Kennedy, George Gershwin, and Ethel Merman. Cerebral palsy describes the condition where a developing infant's brain is deprived of oxygen and fails to develop normally. This may occur in the uterus before birth or may be due to an injury or illness that happens within the first couple of years of life. Often it is an infection or bleeding that is the cause, though many times the reason for cerebral palsy is never found."
What are the types of brain lesions?,"'There are many types of brain lesions. The brain can be affected by a host of potential injuries that can decrease its function. The type of lesion depends upon the type of insult that the brain receives.''Aging'':'' Some lesions occur as a result of ''aging'' with loss of brain cells as they naturally age and die. If enough cells die, atrophy can occur and brain function decreases. This may present with symptoms of loss of memory, poor judgment, loss of insight and general loss of mental agility.''Genetic:'"" Lesions related to a person's genetic ""'makeup'', such as people with ''neurofibromatosis''.''Vascular:'' Loss of brain cells also occurs with ''stroke''. With ischemic strokes (CVA) blood supply to an area of the brain is lost, brain cells die and the part of the body they control loses its function.''Bleeding:'' Strokes can also be hemorrhagic, where bleeding occurs in part of the brain, again damaging brain cells and causing loss of function. Uncontrolled ''high blood pressure'', AV malformations, and brain aneurysms are some causes of bleeding in the brain.''Trauma:'' Bleeding in the brain may be caused by trauma and a blow to the head. Bleeding may occur within brain tissue or in the spaces surrounding the brain. Epidural and subdural hematomas describe ''blood clots'' that form in the spaces between the meninges or tissues that line the brain and spinal cord. As the clot expands, pressure increases within the skull and compresses the brain.''Acceleration/deceleration injury:'' Sometimes trauma can affect the brain with no evidence of bleeding on ''CT scan''. Acceleration deceleration injuries can cause significant damage to brain tissue and connections causing microscopic swelling. ''Shaken baby syndrome'' is a good example of acceleration/deceleration type injury, where the brain bounces against the inner lining of the skull.''Infection and inflammation:'' Infectious agents resulting in diseases such as ''meningitis'', brain abscesses or ''encephalitis''Tumors:'' Tumors are types of brain lesions and may be benign (meningiomas are the most common) or ''malignant'' like ''glioblastoma'' multiforme. Tumors in the brain may also be metastatic, spreading from ''cancers'' that arise primarily from another organ. Symptoms occur depending upon the location and size of the tumor.''Immune:'' Immunologic causes may also affect the brain, for example diseases like ''multiple sclerosis''.''Plaques:'' Some investigators suggest that abnormal deposits of material that form plaques may be a type of disease that causes damage and eventual brain cell death in diseases like '""Alzheimer's disease""'.''Toxins:'' Toxins may affect brain function and may be produced within the body or may be ingested. The most common ingested poison is ''alcohol'', though other chemicals can adversely affect the brain. Individuals can develop ''encephalopathy'' due to a variety of chemicals and substances that build up in the blood stream. Ammonia levels rise in patients with ''liver'' failure while patients with ''kidney failure'' can become uremic.''Multiple types:'' The type of lesion depends upon its cause and symptoms depend upon its location and amount of brain irritation or damage that has occurred. Some brain lesions types may occur from more than one cause, such as '""Alzheimer's disease""' that may be related to plaque formation, brain cell death, and possibly genetics. Research is ongoing and is likely to provide better insights into these various brain lesion types.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of brain lesions?,"'Symptoms of a brain lesion depend upon what part of the brain is affected. Large parts of the brain can be involved in some diseases and there may be relatively few symptoms. Alternatively, very tiny lesions may be catastrophic if they occur in a critical part of the brain. For example, the reticular activating system (RAS) is a tiny area located within the brainstem that is effectively the master on/off switch of the brain. If a midbrain ''stroke'' affects this area, the result is permanent ''coma'"". A patient needs the RAS and one functioning hemisphere of the cortex to be awake. If the patient is unconscious, then the RAS isn't working or there is significant damage to both sides of the brain.""'Initial signs and symptoms of a brain lesion are often non-specific and may include:''If any of these symptoms arise suddenly, the person should be evaluated immediately, usually in an emergency department that is well equipped (CT scanner, ''MRI'', easy access to neurosurgeons and neurologists). '   Headache Nausea Fever (if an infection is present) Neck pain and stiffness (if the meninges are inflamed) Affected vision (if there is damage along the pathway from the optic nerve to the occiput) Affected speech (if there is damage to Broca's area) Speech includes saying and understanding words.  Difficulty making words (due to weakness of the muscles that control the mouth) Weakness or paralysis to one side of the body Seizures Memory loss and confusion Personality changes, loss of concentration, aggression and loss of personal control Worst headache of your life"
How do doctors diagnose brain lesions?,"'The diagnosis of a brain lesion begins with the health care practitioner taking a history and asking the patient questions about the symptoms such as:''Depending upon the circumstances, the patient may not have insight or may not remember the symptoms or complaints, and it may be up to a family member, ''caregiver'', or friend to supply the appropriate information.''Medical history and physical exams''Past medical history of the patient, exploring associated symptoms and complaints may be helpful in determining the diagnosis.''Physical examination is very helpful in trying to localize a potential brain lesion. A careful neurologic exam may be useful in finding weakness, change in sensation (including light touch, ''pain'', vibration, and position sense), and coordination. Mental status, agility, other organ systems are often assessed. For example, patients who have an irregular heart rate called ''atrial fibrillation'' are at risk for ''stroke''. ''Stroke'' risk may also be increased in patients with carotid stenosis and the health care practitioner may listen over the neck for a bruit (an abnormal sound made by blood rushing through a narrowed carotid artery).''Depending upon the clinical situation, imaging of the brain such as ''computerized tomography'' (CT) and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI) may be useful in making the diagnosis of a brain lesion. ''Angiography'' can be added to either CT or MRI to visualize the blood vessels in the brain.''Lumbar puncture'' (''spinal tap'') is often considered to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for infection, bleeding, or abnormal proteins; depending upon the clinical situation.''Blood tests are usually preformed, to explore any illnesses that can also involve the brain.'   When did they start? Do they come and go or are they constant? Have they progressed over time? What makes them better or worse?"
What is the treatment for brain lesions?,'Treatment for brain lesions depends upon the specific diagnosis of the brain lesion.'  
Is it possible to prevent brain lesions?,"'Many brain lesions are neither preventable nor predictable. However, general guidelines for health maintenance may help prevent some brain lesions. The same recommendations to help prevent ''heart disease'' also are appropriate to help prevent strokes:' Don't smoke Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes Always wear a helmet when participating in activities where the head is exposed to danger (for example, riding a bicycle or motorcycle, skiing, skateboarding, and rollerblading). Avoiding radiation and environmental toxins may reduce the chances for brain cancer development."
What is the prognosis for brain lesions?,"'The prognosis for surviving and recovering from a brain lesion depends upon the cause. In general, many brain lesions have only a fair to poor prognosis because damage and destruction of brain tissue is frequently permanent. However, some people can reduce their symptoms with rehabilitation training and medication. ''A few brain lesions may have a good prognosis if only a small amount of less vital brain tissue is involved and/or early interventions are successful (for example, surgical removal of a small benign tumor, early effective antimicrobial treatment of meningitis, or ''transient ischemic attack'' [''TIA'' or ''mini-stroke'']). ''Unfortunately, some brain lesions are relentless, progressive and ultimately have a poor prognosis (for example, '""Alzheimer's""' disease). ' "
What are brain tumors?,'A tumor in the brain isn’t like tumors in other parts of your body. It has limited room for growth because of the skull. This means that a growing tumor can squeeze vital parts of the brain and lead to serious health problems. Learning about the possible symptoms of brain tumors can help you know when to tell a doctor about them.' 
What are the early warning symptoms and signs of a brain tumor?,"'Cancer that has spread to the brain from another part of the body is called a metastatic brain tumor. Metastatic brain tumors are much more common than primary tumors.\xa0''The symptoms of a brain tumor depend on tumor size, type, and location. Symptoms may be caused when a tumor presses on a nerve or harms a part of the brain. Also, they may be caused when a tumor blocks the fluid that flows through and around the brain, or when the brain swells because of the buildup of fluid.''The most common early warning symptoms and signs of brain tumors include:''Most often, these symptoms are not due to a brain tumor. Another health problem could cause them. If you have any of these symptoms, you should tell your doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated early before it has grown. Some people with brain tumors have seizures, especially in someone who does not have a history of seizures.'   A new onset or change in pattern of headaches Headaches in the morning Headaches that gradually become more frequent and severe Nausea and vomiting for no reason Changes in speech, vision, or hearing Problems balancing or walking Changes in mood, personality, or ability to concentrate Problems with memory Muscle jerking or twitching (seizures or convulsions) Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs Gradual loss of sensation or movement in an arm or a leg Confusion in everyday matters Personality or behavior changes"
What are the types of benign and cancerous brain tumors?,"""When most normal cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. There are two types of brain tumors, primary and cancerous.""   Primary brain tumors can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).Usually, benign tumors can be removed, and they seldom grow back.Benign brain tumors usually have an obvious border or edge. Cells from benign tumors rarely invade tissues around them.They don't spread to other parts of the body.Benign tumors can press on sensitive areas of the brain and cause serious health problems.Unlike benign tumors in most other parts of the body, benign brain tumors are sometimes life threatening.Benign brain tumors may become turn into cancer.

Unlike benign tumors in most other parts of the body, benign brain tumors are sometimes life threatening. Benign brain tumors may become turn into cancer. Malignant brain tumors (also called brain cancer) contain cancer cells:Malignant brain tumors are generally more serious and often are a threat to life.They are likely to grow rapidly and crowd or invade the nearby healthy brain tissue.Cancer cells may break away from malignant brain tumors and spread to other parts of the brain or to the spinal cord. They rarely spread to other parts of the body. Malignant brain tumors are generally more serious and often are a threat to life. They are likely to grow rapidly and crowd or invade the nearby healthy brain tissue. Cancer cells may break away from malignant brain tumors and spread to other parts of the brain or to the spinal cord. They rarely spread to other parts of the body."
What are the grades for benign and cancerous brain tumors?,"'Doctors group brain tumors by grade. The grade of a tumor refers to the way the cells look under a microscope:''Cells from low-grade tumors (grades I and II) look more normal and generally grow more slowly than cells from high-grade tumors (grades III and IV).\xa0Over time, a low-grade tumor may become a high-grade tumor. However, the change to a high-grade tumor happens more often among adults than children.' Grade I: The tissue is benign. The cells look nearly like normal brain cells, and they grow slowly. Grade II: The tissue is malignant. The cells look less like normal cells than do the cells in a Grade I tumor. Grade III: The malignant tissue has cells that look very different from normal cells. The abnormal cells are actively growing (anaplastic). Grade IV: The malignant tissue has cells that look most abnormal and tend to grow quickly."
What are the common types and grades for primary brain tumors?,"'There are many types of primary brain tumors. Primary brain tumors are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they begin. For example, most primary brain tumors begin in glial cells. This type of tumor is called a glioma.''Among adults, the most common types are:''Among children, the most common types and stages of brain tumors\xa0are:'   Astrocytoma: The tumor arises from star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes. It can be any grade. In adults, an astrocytoma most often arises in the cerebrum.Grade I or II astrocytoma: It may be called a low-grade glioma.Grade III astrocytoma: It's sometimes called a high-grade or an anaplastic astrocytoma.Grade IV astrocytoma: It may be called a glioblastoma or malignant astrocytic glioma. Grade I or II astrocytoma: It may be called a low-grade glioma. Grade III astrocytoma: It's sometimes called a high-grade or an anaplastic astrocytoma. Grade IV astrocytoma: It may be called a glioblastoma or malignant astrocytic glioma. Meningioma: The tumor arises in the meninges. It can be grade I, II, or III. It's usually benign (grade I) and grows slowly. Oligodendroglioma: The tumor arises from cells that make the fatty substance that covers and protects nerves. It usually occurs in the cerebrum. It's most common in middle-aged adults. It can be grade II or III. Medulloblastoma: The tumor usually arises in the cerebellum. It's sometimes called a primitive neuroectodermal tumor. It is grade IV. Grade I or II astrocytoma: In children, this low-grade tumor occurs anywhere in the brain. The most common astrocytoma among children is juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. It's grade I. Ependymoma: The tumor arises from cells that line the ventricles or the central canal of the spinal cord. It's most commonly found in children and young adults. It can be grade I, II, or III. Brain stem glioma: The tumor occurs in the lowest part of the brain. It can be a low-grade or high-grade tumor. The most common type is diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma."
What are the causes and risk factors for brain tumors?,"""When you're told that you have a brain tumor, it's natural to wonder what may have caused your disease. But no one knows the exact causes of brain tumors. Doctors seldom know why one person develops a brain tumor and another doesn't.""'Researchers are studying whether people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop a brain tumor. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease.''Studies have found the following risk factors for brain tumors:''Researchers are studying whether using cell phones, having had a ''head injury'', or having been exposed to certain chemicals at work or to magnetic fields are important risk factors. Studies have not shown consistent links between these possible risk factors and brain tumors, but additional research is needed.' Ionizing radiation: Ionizing radiation from high dose x-rays (such as radiation therapy from a large machine aimed at the head) and other sources can cause cell damage that leads to a tumor. People exposed to ionizing radiation may have an increased risk of a brain tumor, such as meningioma or glioma. Family history: It is rare for brain tumors to run in a family. Only a very small number of families have several members with brain tumors."
What procedures and tests diagnose the type and grade of a brain tumor?,"'If you have symptoms that suggest a brain tumor, your doctor will give you a physical exam and ask about your personal and family health history. You may have one or more of the following tests:''However, if the tumor is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgeon may not be able to remove tissue from the tumor without harming normal brain tissue. In this case, the doctor uses MRI, CT, or other imaging tests to learn as much as possible about the brain tumor.' Neurologic exam: Your doctor checks your vision, hearing, alertness, muscle strength, coordination, and reflexes. Your doctor also examines your eyes to look for swelling caused by a tumor pressing on the nerve that connects the eye and the brain. MRI: A large machine with a strong magnet linked to a computer is used to make detailed pictures of areas inside your head. Sometimes a special dye (contrast material) is injected into a blood vessel in your arm or hand to help show differences in the tissues of the brain. The pictures can show abnormal areas, such as a tumor. CT scan: An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures of your head. You may receive contrast material by injection into a blood vessel in your arm or hand. The contrast material makes abnormal areas easier to see. Your doctor may ask for other tests: Angiogram: Dye injected into the bloodstream makes blood vessels in the brain show up on an x-ray. If a tumor is present, the x-ray may show the tumor or blood vessels that are feeding into the tumor. Spinal tap: Your doctor may remove a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that fills the spaces in and around the brain and spinal cord). This procedure is performed with local anesthesia. The doctor uses a long, thin needle to remove fluid from the lower part of the spinal column. A spinal tap takes about 30 minutes. You must lie flat for several hours afterward to keep from getting a headache. A laboratory checks the fluid for cancer cells or other signs of problems. Biopsy: The removal of tissue to look for tumor cells is called a biopsy. A pathologist looks at the cells under a microscope to check for abnormal cells. A biopsy can show cancer, tissue changes that may lead to cancer, and other conditions. A biopsy is the only sure way to diagnose a brain tumor, learn what grade it is, and plan treatment. Surgeons can obtain tissue to look for tumor cells in two ways:Biopsy at the same time as treatment: The surgeon takes a tissue sample when you have surgery to remove part or all of the tumor. See the Surgery section.Stereotactic biopsy: You may get local or general anesthesia and wear a rigid head frame for this procedure. The surgeon makes a small incision in the scalp and drills a small hole (a burr hole) into the skull. CT or MRI is used to guide the needle through the burr hole to the location of the tumor. The surgeon withdraws a sample of tissue with the needle. A needle biopsy may be used when a tumor is deep inside the brain or in a part of the brain that can't be operated on.

Why do I need a biopsy? How will the biopsy results affect my treatment plan? What kind of biopsy will I have? How long will it take? Will I be awake? Will it hurt? What are the chances of infection or bleeding after the biopsy? Are there any other risks? How soon will I know the results? If I do have a brain tumor, who will talk with me about treatment? When?"
Should you ask for a second opinion before you start treatment for a brain tumor?,"'Before starting treatment, you might want a second opinion about your diagnosis and treatment plan. Some people worry that the doctor will be offended if they ask for a second opinion. Usually the opposite is true. Most doctors welcome a second opinion. And many health insurance companies will pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Some companies require a second opinion.'""If you get a second opinion, the doctor may agree with your first doctor's diagnosis and treatment plan. Or the second doctor may suggest another approach. Either way, you'll have more information and perhaps a greater sense of control. You can feel more confident about the decisions you make, knowing that you've looked at your options.""""It may take some time and effort to gather your medical records and see another doctor. In many cases, it's not a problem to take several weeks to get a second opinion. The delay in starting treatment usually won't make treatment less effective. To make sure, you should discuss this delay with your doctor. Some people with a brain tumor need treatment right away.""'There are many ways to find a doctor for a second opinion. You can ask your doctor, a local or state medical society, a nearby hospital, or a medical school for names of specialists.''Also, you can request a consultation with specialists at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.' Adults and children with a brain tumor: Specialists in the NCI Neuro-Oncology Branch provide consultations. The telephone number is 301-594-6767 or 866-251-9686. Children with a brain tumor: Specialists in the NCI Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Section of the Pediatric Oncology Branch provide consultations. The telephone number is 301-496-8009 or 877-624-4878."
What are the treatments for benign and cancerous brain tumors?,"'People with brain tumors have several treatment options. The options are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Many people get a combination of treatments.''The choice of treatment depends mainly are:''For some types of ''brain cancer'', the doctor also needs to know whether cancer cells were found in the cerebrospinal fluid.''Your doctor can describe your treatment choices, the expected results, and the possible side effects. Because cancer therapy often damages healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. You and your health care team can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your medical and personal needs.''You may want to talk with your doctor about taking part in a clinical trial, a research study of new treatment methods. See the Taking Part in Cancer Research section.''Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral. Specialists who treat brain tumors include neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and neuroradiologists.''Your health care team may also include an oncology nurse, a registered dietitian, a ''mental health'' counselor, a social worker, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a speech therapist, and a physical medicine specialist. Also, children may need tutors to help with schoolwork. (The Rehabilitation section has more information about therapists and tutors.)''Can you recommend other doctors who could give me a second opinion about my treatment options? How often should I have checkups?'   The type and grade of brain tumor Its location in the brain Its size Your age and general health What type of brain tumor do I have? Is it benign or malignant? What is the grade of the tumor? What are my treatment choices? Which do you recommend for me? Why? What are the expected benefits of each kind of treatment? What can I do to prepare for treatment? Will I need to stay in the hospital? If so, for how long? What are the risks and possible side effects of each treatment? How can side effects be managed? What is the treatment likely to cost? Will my insurance cover it? How will treatment affect my normal activities? What is the chance that I will have to learn how to walk, speak, read, or write after treatment? Would a research study (clinical trial) be appropriate for me?"
What is the most common type of surgery to remove brain tumors?,"""Surgery is the usual first treatment for most brain tumors. Before surgery begins, you may be given general anesthesia, and your scalp is shaved. You probably won't need your entire head shaved.""   Surgery to open the skull is called a craniotomy. The surgeon makes an incision in your scalp and uses a special type of saw to remove a piece of bone from the skull. You may be awake when the surgeon removes part or all of the brain tumor. The surgeon removes as much tumor as possible. You may be asked to move a leg, count, say the alphabet, or tell a story. Your ability to follow these commands helps the surgeon protect important parts of the brain. After the tumor is removed, the surgeon covers the opening in the skull with the piece of bone or with a piece of metal or fabric. The surgeon then closes the incision in the scalp. Sometimes surgery isn't possible. If the tumor is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgeon may not be able to remove the tumor without harming normal brain tissue. People who can't have surgery may receive radiation therapy or other treatment. You may have a headache or be uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. However, medicine can usually control pain. Before surgery, you should discuss the plan for pain relief with your health care team. After surgery, your team can adjust the plan if you need more relief. You may also feel tired or weak. The time it takes to heal after surgery is different for everyone. You will probably spend a few days in the hospital. Other, less common problems may occur after surgery for a brain tumor. The brain may swell or fluid may build up within the skull. The health care team will monitor you for signs of swelling or fluid buildup. You may receive steroids to help relieve swelling. A second surgery may be needed to drain the fluid. The surgeon may place a long, thin tube (shunt) in a ventricle of the brain. (For some people, the shunt is placed before performing surgery on the brain tumor.) The tube is threaded under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. Excess fluid is carried from the brain and drained into the abdomen. Sometimes the fluid is drained into the heart instead. Infection is another problem that may develop after surgery. If this happens, the health care team will give you an antibiotic. Brain surgery may harm normal tissue. Brain damage can be a serious problem. It can cause problems with thinking, seeing, or speaking. It can also cause personality changes or seizures. Most of these problems lessen or disappear with time. But sometimes damage to the brain is permanent. You may need physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. See the Rehabilitation section. Do you suggest surgery for me? How will I feel after the operation? What will you do for me if I have pain? How long will I be in the hospital? Will I have any long-term effects? Will my hair grow back? Are there any side effects from using metal or fabric to replace the bone in the skull? When can I get back to my normal activities? What is my chance of a full recovery?"
What is radiation treatment for brain tumors?,"'Radiation therapy kills brain tumor cells with high-energy x-rays, gamma rays, or protons.'""Radiation therapy usually follows surgery. The radiation kills tumor cells that may remain in the area. Sometimes, people who can't have surgery have radiation therapy instead.""'Doctors use external and internal types of radiation therapy to treat brain tumors:''Some people have no or few side effects after treatment. Rarely, people may have nausea for several hours after external radiation therapy. The health care team can suggest ways to help you cope with this problem. Radiation therapy also may cause you to become very tired with each radiation treatment. Resting is important, but doctors usually advise people to try to stay as active as they can.''Also, external radiation therapy commonly causes ''hair loss'' from the part of the head that was treated. Hair usually grows back within a few months. Radiation therapy also may make the skin on the scalp and ears red, dry, and tender. The health care team can suggest ways to relieve these problems.''Sometimes radiation therapy causes brain tissue to swell. You may get a ''headache'' or feel pressure. The health care team watches for signs of this problem. They can provide medicine to reduce the discomfort. Radiation sometimes kills healthy brain tissue. Although rare, this side effect can cause headaches, seizures, or even death.''Radiation may harm the ''pituitary gland'' and other areas of the brain. For children, this damage could cause learning problems or slow down growth and development. In addition, radiation increases the risk of secondary tumors later in life.' External radiation therapy: You'll go to a hospital or clinic for treatment. A large machine outside the body is aimed to direct beams of radiation at either the whole brain or more commonly, at specific portions of the brain. Some people need radiation aimed at the spinal cord also. The treatment schedule depends on your age, and the type and size of the tumor. Fractionated external beam therapy, in which small doses or fractions of radiation are given usually once each day, is the most common method of radiation therapy used for people with brain tumors. Giving the total dose of radiation over several weeks helps to protect healthy tissue in the area of the tumor. Treatments are usually 5 days a week for several weeks. A typical visit lasts less than an hour, and each treatment takes only a few minutes.Some treatment centers are studying other ways of delivering external beam radiation therapy:Intensity-modulated radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: These types of treatment use computers to more closely target the brain tumor to lessen the damage to healthy tissue.Proton beam radiation therapy: The source of radiation is protons rather than X-rays. The doctor aims the proton beam at the tumor. The dose of radiation to normal tissue from a proton beam is less than the dose from an X-ray beam.Stereotactic radiation therapy: Narrow beams of X-rays or gamma rays are directed at the tumor from different angles. For this procedure, you wear a rigid head frame. The therapy may be given during a single visit (stereotactic radiosurgery) or over several visits.

The therapy may be given during a single visit (stereotactic radiosurgery) or over several visits. Internal radiation therapy (implant radiation therapy or brachytherapy): Internal radiation isn't commonly used for treating brain tumors and is under study. The radiation comes from radioactive material usually contained in very small implants called seeds. The seeds are placed inside the brain and give off radiation for months. They don't need to be removed once the radiation is gone. Why do I need this treatment? When will the treatments begin? When will they end? How will I feel during therapy? Are there side effects? What can I do to take care of myself during therapy? How will we know if the radiation is working? Will I be able to continue my normal activities during treatment?"
What is chemotherapy treatment for brain tumors?,"'Chemotherapy, the use of ''drugs'' to kill cancer cells, is sometimes used to treat brain tumors. Drugs may be given in the following ways:' By mouth or vein (intravenous): Chemotherapy may be given during and after radiation therapy. The drugs enter the bloodstream and travel throughout the body. They may be given in an outpatient part of the hospital, at the doctor's office, or at home. Rarely, you may need to stay in the hospital. The side effects of chemotherapy depend mainly on which drugs are given and how much. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, headache, fever and chills, and weakness. If the drugs lower the levels of healthy blood cells, you're more likely to get infections, bruise or bleed easily, and feel very weak and tired. Your health care team will check for low levels of blood cells. Some side effects may be relieved with medicine. In wafers that are put into the brain: For some adults with high-grade glioma, the surgeon implants several wafers into the brain. Each wafer is about the size of a dime. Over several weeks, the wafers dissolve, releasing the drug into the brain. The drug kills cancer cells. It may help prevent the tumor from returning in the brain after surgery to remove the tumor. People who receive an implant (a wafer) that contains a drug are monitored by the health care team for signs of infection after surgery. An infection can be treated with an antibiotic. What will it do? Will I have side effects? What can I do about them? When will treatment start? When will it end? How will treatment affect my normal activities?"
Is it important to have a nutritious diet plan if you have a brain tumor?,"""It's important for you to take care of yourself by eating well. You need the number of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy.""""Sometimes, especially during or soon after treatment, you may not feel like eating. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of treatment (such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, or mouth ""'blisters'') can make it hard to eat well. Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another healthcare provider can suggest ways to deal with these problems.' "
What about follow-up care after brain tumor treatment?," You'll need regular checkups after treatment for a brain tumor. For example, for certain types of brain tumors, checkups may be every 3 months. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. If you have any health problems between checkups, you should contact your doctor. Your doctor will check for return of the tumor. Also, checkups help detect health problems that can result from cancer treatment. Checkups may include careful physical and neurologic exams, as well as MRI or CT scans. If you have a shunt, your doctor checks to see that it's working well."
Will you need rehabilitation therapy after brain tumor treatment or surgery?,"'Rehabilitation can be a very important part of the treatment plan. The goals of rehabilitation depend on your needs and how the tumor has affected your ability to carry out daily activities.''Some people may never regain all the abilities they had before the brain tumor and its treatment. But your health care team makes every effort to help you return to normal activities as soon as possible.''Several types of therapists can help:''Children with brain tumors may have special needs. Sometimes children have tutors in the hospital or at home. Children who have problems learning or remembering what they learn may need tutors or special classes when they return to school.' Physical therapists: Brain tumors and their treatment may cause  paralysis. They may also cause weakness and problems with balance. Physical therapists help people regain strength and balance. Speech therapists: Speech therapists help people who have trouble speaking, expressing thoughts, or swallowing. Occupational therapists: Occupational therapists help people learn to manage activities of daily living, such as eating, using the toilet, bathing, and dressing. Physical medicine specialists: Medical doctors with special training help people with brain tumors stay as active as possible. They can help people recover lost abilities and return to daily activities."
What supportive care is available for people with a brain tumor and their caregivers?,"'Brain tumor support information for patients and caregivers\xa0''Your healthcare team can help you with the following problems:''Support for brain tumor treatments, and managing its symptoms''For tips on coping, you may want to read the NCI booklet Taking Time: Support for People With Cancer.' Learning you have a brain tumor can change your life and the lives of those close to you. These changes can be hard to handle. It's normal for you, your family, and your friends to need help coping with the feelings that such a diagnosis can bring.  Brain tumors and its treatments can lead to other health problems. It is common to have concerns about brain tumor treatments or surgery, plus; the side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills can be overwhelming to manage. You may also worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing daily activities.  You may receive supportive care to prevent or control these problems. You can have supportive care before, during, and after cancer treatment. It can improve your comfort and quality of life during treatment.  Brain cancer treatments are intended to slow the progress of cancer. Some people decide not to have antitumor treatment, and receive only supportive care to manage their symptoms. Swelling of the brain: Many people with brain tumors need steroids to help relieve swelling of the brain. Seizures: Brain tumors can cause seizures (convulsions). Certain drugs can help prevent or control seizures. Fluid buildup in the skull: If fluid builds up in the skull, the surgeon may place a shunt to drain the fluid. Information about shunts is in the Surgery part of the Treatment section. Sadness and other feelings: It's normal to feel sad, anxious, or confused after a diagnosis of a serious illness. Some people find it helpful to talk about their feelings. See the Sources of Support section for more information. Doctors, nurses, and other members of your healthcare team can answer questions about brain tumor treatment, working, or other activities. Social workers, counselors, or members of the clergy can be helpful if you want to talk about your feelings or concerns. Often, social workers can suggest resources for financial aid, transportation, home care, or emotional support. Support groups also can help. In these groups, people with brain tumors, family members, or caregivers can meet with other patients or their families to share what they have learned about coping with the disease and the effects of treatment. Groups may offer support in person, over the telephone, or on the Internet. You may want to talk with a member of your health care team about finding a support group. Information specialists at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) and at LiveHelp (http://www.cancer.gov/livehelp) can help you locate programs, services, and publications. They can send you a list of organizations that offer services to people with cancer."
EEG Introduction,"'An EEG, or electroencephalogram, is a test that can help diagnose ''epilepsy'"". During an EEG, the electrical signals of the brain are recorded. This electrical activity is detected by electrodes, or sensors, placed on the patient's ""'scalp'' and transmitted to a polygraph that records the activity.''Electrical signals produced by the brain neurons are picked up by the electrodes and transmitted to a polygraph, where they produce separate graphs on moving paper using an ink writing pen or on a computer screen.' "
How Do I Prepare For an EEG?,"'To prepare for your EEG you should:''Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor prior to your procedure.''Wash your hair the night before the test. Do not use hair cream, oils, or spray afterward.' "
What Happens During the EEG?,"'During an EEG, you lie down on the examining table or bed while about 20 electrodes are attached to your scalp. You are asked to relax and lie first with your eyes open, then later with them closed. You may be asked to breathe deeply and rapidly or to stare at a flashing light -- both of these activities produce changes in the brain-wave patterns. If you are prone to ''seizures'', it is rare that you may experience one during the test. If you are being evaluated for a ''sleep'' disorder, EEG may be performed continuously during the night while you are asleep. Such a recording, which may involve an evaluation of other body functions during ''sleep'', such as ''respiration'' and pulse, is referred to as polysomnography.' "
What Happens After an EEG?,"'When the EEG is done, the electrodes are removed and the glue that held them in place is washed away with acetone. You may have to use additional acetone at home to completely remove the glue. Unless you are actively having ''seizures'' or are restricted by your doctor, you may drive home. If the EEG was performed overnight, you should arrange to have someone drive you home. If you stopped taking anticonvulsant ''drugs'' for the EEG, you can usually start taking them again.''A ''neurologist'' examines the EEG recording for abnormalities in the brain-wave pattern, which may reflect diseases of the nervous system.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What are symptoms of a branchial cyst?,"'Branchial ''cysts'' usually cause no immediate problem. They can cause a pressure sensation in the area affected. Sometimes it develops a sinus or drainage pathway to the surface of the skin from which ''mucus'' can be expressed.  They are typically not tender. Rarely, however, they can become infected.'  "
What are structures in the neck that can be similar to a branchial cyst?,"'There can be other structures in the neck area of a similar character.  These include' Cystic hygroma: This structure is a malformation of the lymphatic system in the neck region. The lymphatic system is composed of a series of vessels that drain a milky white liquid (lymph) that contains fluid and white blood cells for fighting infection.  In comparison with a branchial cleft cyst, a cystic hygroma is also smooth and soft but is located behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Thyroglossal duct cyst: This structure commonly drains from inside the floor of the mouth to an opening similar to that of a branchial cleft cyst, but it's located in the center of the neck in the area of the larynx (voice box). Swelling of the thyroid gland: This soft structure has two lobes that are located on either side of the windpipe (trachea) at the level of the vocal cords.  There is a thin connection of thyroid tissue that bridges the two lobes and crosses over the trachea. Miscellaneous: collections of fat (lipomas), collections of blood vessels (hemangiomas), sebaceous cysts, etc."

What are Braxton Hicks contractions?,"'Braxton Hicks contractions are contractions of the uterus that occur during the third trimester of pregnancy. They are perfectly normal and have been said to represent contractions that occur as the uterus is preparing to give birth. In some women, they occur as early as the ''second trimester''. Sometimes, Braxton Hicks contractions have been referred to as ""false ''labor''.""''In contrast to the contractions of ''true labor'', Braxton Hicks contractions do not occur at regular intervals, do not get stronger over time, and do not last longer over time. They do not occur at predictable intervals, and they may disappear altogether for a time. They tend to become more frequent toward the end of pregnancy.''Braxton Hicks contractions are named after an English doctor, John Braxton Hicks, who first described them in 1872.'  "
What causes Braxton Hicks contractions?,"'Common events can sometimes trigger Braxton Hicks contractions, for example:' Increased activity of mother or baby Touching of the maternal abdomen Dehydration Sexual intercourse Distended maternal bladder"
What do Braxton Hicks contractions feel like?,'Braxton Hicks contractions are not typically as painful as those of true ''labor contractions''. Some women describe them as a tightening sensation across the lower abdomen. They may feel similar to ''menstrual cramps'' in some women. The abdomen may become firm to the touch. They do not occur at regular intervals.'  
Which home remedies help relieve Braxton Hicks contraction discomfort and pain?,"'If Braxton Hicks contractions are uncomfortable, you can take these measures:' Change positions, take a walk, or rest if you have been active. Drink a glass of water, or a cup of herbal tea. Perform relaxation exercises, deep breathing, or mental relaxation. Eat something. Bathe in a warm bath for up to 30 minutes."
When should I call my doctor about Braxton Hicks contractions?,"'Call your doctor or ''midwife'"" if you haven't reached 37 weeks and the contractions are increasing in frequency, are more painful, or you have any of the signs of preterm ""'labor'':'  Increasing vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, or spotting; Increasing low back pain or pelvic pressure; More than four contractions an hour; Menstrual-like cramping or abdominal pain."
What are Braxton Hicks contractions? What are true or real labor contractions?,"'Braxton Hicks contractions'' or ""''false labor'',"" are irregular contractions that occur during the ''third trimester'' of ''pregnancy'', or possibly in the ''second trimester''. ''Braxton Hicks'' contractions usually are milder than those of ''real labor''\xa0are, and they do not occur at regular intervals.''True ''labor contractions'' occur at regular intervals and are stronger than ''Braxton Hicks contractions''.' "
What do Braxton Hicks vs. real contractions feel like?,"'In both ''Braxton Hicks'' and real ''labor contractions'', the lower abdominal area and/or groin seem to tighten or squeeze, and then relaxation follows.'  Braxton Hicks contractions do not occur at regular time intervals, and they can occur at any time of day. However, many pregnant women report that they can feel Braxton Hicks contractions at night when the bladder is full, and during exercise or sex. Braxton Hicks contractions may not be painful, particularly when they begin earlier in pregnancy. True labor contractions during childbirth usually get closer together, become stronger, and happen at intervals that become closer together. Many women often describe the pain of real labor contractions as occurring in a wave-like fashion."
How can I tell the difference between Braxton Hicks vs. true labor?,"  Some pregnant women experience Braxton Hicks (false labor) contractions during the second trimester. When this occurs, the contractions do not come in regular intervals, and most women do not notice them. False labor contractions do not worsen over time and do not occur closer together. They may even lessen or go away when you move or change body positions. Braxton Hicks contractions may cause an uncomfortable tightening sensation but usually are not as painful as the real thing, or true labor contractions. Sometimes women who are experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions believe that they represent real labor and experience a “false alarm” due to these symptoms. True labor or real labor contractions usually begin after the 37th week of pregnancy, except in the case of preterm or early labor. They are a sign that labor is starting, they occur at regular time intervals, and become stronger (more intense and painful), and closer together over time. Labor contractions and pain are most likely to occur close to your due date when true labor starts in preparation for the birth of your baby. You also may have other signs of labor, such as your water breaking (leaking amniotic fluid), the passing of the vaginal mucus plug, and/or ""bloody show,"" when the mucus plug is blood-tinged."
How long do Braxton Hicks last? How long do real labor contractions last?,"'Before you are 37 weeks pregnant you should contact your care provider, obstetrician, or go to the hospital if you have labor contractions that are becoming more frequent (every 10 minutes or sooner) and painful. You should also seek medical assistance if you have\xa0''abdominal pain'',\xa0''low back pain'', cramping, a feeling of pressure in the pelvis or lower abdomen,\xa0''vaginal bleeding'', or a change in\xa0''vaginal discharge''.''After the 37th week, your healthcare team will advise you when you should call them or go to the hospital. With true labor, the contractions will happen regularly and become stronger, lasting about 30 to 90 seconds, and do not go away. Always contact your obstetrician or\xa0''midwife''\xa0if your water breaks, you have\xa0''vaginal bleeding'', are experiencing severe\xa0''pain'', or have any change in your symptoms that is concerning.'

You also may have other signs of labor, such as your water breaking (leaking amniotic fluid), the passing of the vaginal mucus plug, and/or ""bloody show,"" when the mucus plug is blood-tinged."
How long do Braxton Hicks last? How long do real labor contractions last?,"'Before you are 37 weeks pregnant you should contact your care provider, obstetrician, or go to the hospital if you have labor contractions that are becoming more frequent (every 10 minutes or sooner) and painful. You should also seek medical assistance if you have\xa0''abdominal pain'',\xa0''low back pain'', cramping, a feeling of pressure in the pelvis or lower abdomen,\xa0''vaginal bleeding'', or a change in\xa0''vaginal discharge''.''After the 37th week, your healthcare team will advise you when you should call them or go to the hospital. With true labor, the contractions will happen regularly and become stronger, lasting about 30 to 90 seconds, and do not go away. Always contact your obstetrician or\xa0''midwife''\xa0if your water breaks, you have\xa0''vaginal bleeding'', are experiencing severe\xa0''pain'', or have any change in your symptoms that is concerning.' Braxton Hicks contractions can vary in length, from less than 30 seconds to up to 2 minutes or more. Labor contractions usually last from 30 to 90 seconds."
When should I decide about breastfeeding?,"""Generally, it is a good idea for the new mom to meet with the baby's doctor prior to the birth in order for all to get to know each other in a controlled, non-rushed, quiet environment. This is a perfect opportunity to discuss your concerns and wishes about feeding your baby. One important reason to have the decision to breastfeed made before the delivery is that it can be very difficult or even impossible to start using formula and then later try to switch to breast milk. This is because the ability of the breasts to produce milk diminishes soon after ""'childbirth'' without the stimulation of breastfeeding.'  "
Why is the choice so important?,"""During your baby's first year of life, he/she will more than triple his/her total body weight, and the vast majority of this ""'weight gain'' will come from the milk that he/she ''drinks''. According to the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'', human milk is the preferred feeding for all infants. This includes premature and sick newborns, with rare exceptions. Of course, breast milk would appear to be the most ideal food for your ''newborn''. Breast milk is the food least likely to cause ''allergic'' reactions, it is inexpensive, it is readily available at any hour of the day or night; ''babies'' accept the taste readily; and the immunity factors in breast milk can help the baby fight off some infections.''Although breast milk is the ideal food for human infants, because of medical or other reasons, some women opt for formula feeding. ''Infant formulas'' have been developed to artificially duplicate human milk, although no formulas have been developed that are an exact replacement for human milk.' "
What are the disadvantages and benefits of breastfeeding?,"'The nutritional advantages of breast milk are certainly numerous. The amino acids in breast milk, the building blocks of proteins, are well balanced for the human baby, as are the sugars (primarily lactose) and ''fats'"". The baby's intestinal tract is best aided in its digestion by the ""'vitamins'', enzymes, and minerals found in breast milk. Breast milk also contains infection-fighting antibodies from the mother, and breastfed babies are believed to be at a reduced risk for many acute and chronic infections early in life. The ''cholesterol'' content is also high in human milk and very low in formulas. Cholesterol promotes brain growth and provides the building blocks of hormones, ''vitamin D'', and intestinal bile.''Breast milk is also the least expensive way to feed an infant. However, the mother must maintain good ''nutrition'' and continue taking any vitamin/mineral ''supplements'' her doctor recommended during the pregnancy.''Formula-fed babies may also have the risk of developing an ''allergy'' to a particular formula. When a baby develops an ''allergy'' to formula, he or she may have symptoms that include irritability, crying after feedings, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', or a skin ''rash''. Concerns that your baby is having a formula ''allergy'"" should be discussed with your baby's doctor.""'Nursing helps most women ''lose weight'' (though not fluid) after delivery, as 500 calories or more are used by breastfeeding each day. Women who breastfeed also have a reduced risk for postpartum bleeding and a reduced risk for ovarian and ''breast cancer'' in the future.''Breastfeeding facilitates bonding between mother and baby. There is a well-accepted extra closeness that breastfeeding mothers experience that is both hormonal and emotional in nature.''The only disadvantages for the baby in breastfeeding occur when things are not going well, for example, if there\'s an inadequate supply of breast milk or an inefficient suck reflex in the baby. However, it is unusual for a mother not to produce enough milk for her baby unless she is not breastfeeding correctly or frequently enough. The disadvantages that most commonly arise involve the rest of the family. Siblings and dad sometimes feel ""left out"" of baby care since mom is the only one who can do the nursing. However, other family members can be involved in helping with different aspects of the baby\'s care, and this gives them a valuable feeling of importance and allows mom a chance to rest.''Breastfed babies eat more often than formula-fed babies since breast milk is more quickly digested and leaves the stomach empty more frequently. This puts a little more ''stress'"" on the mother because of the potential necessity for more frequent feedings. If the mother develops certain medical conditions, whether or not to continue breastfeeding may need to be reassessed. These conditions should always be discussed with the doctor. However, it is rare that breastfeeding would need to be discontinued completely. In any interaction, the mother's doctor and/or pharmacist should be informed that she is breastfeeding. Some medicines should be avoided during breastfeeding. Numerous other medications have not yet been adequately studied in the context of breastfeeding and the possible effects on the baby. If a breastfeeding mother is required to take a medication which has not been fully studied, she may want to consider discussing this matter with her doctor."" "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of formula feeding?,"""For some parents, or when the baby has certain medical conditions, it is very important to know exactly how much their baby is receiving at each feeding, and formula/bottle-feeding allows exact measurement. Foods, medications, or physical conditions in the mother are no longer a concern for the baby who is receiving formula. The entire family can immediately become intimately involved in all aspects of the baby's care, including feedings, allowing the mother to get more rest. Formula-fed babies actually need to eat somewhat less often since formula is less readily digested by the baby than human milk. The disadvantages of formulas are primarily their expense, the lack of maternal infection-fighting antibodies that are in breast milk, and the fact that no formula can exactly duplicate the ideal composition of breast milk."" "
"Can 
I use both forms of feedings for my baby?","""According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, exclusive breastfeeding is ideal nutrition and sufficient to support optimal growth and development for approximately the first 6 months after birth. Furthermore, it is recommended that breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mutually desired. Infants weaned before 12 months of age should not receive cow's milk feedings but should receive iron-fortified ""'infant formula''.''Supplementing breastfeeding with formula is usually discouraged, although it may be helpful in cases where the mother is not producing an adequate supply of milk or the baby is not able to breastfeed well.''Lactation aids are also available as an option to avoid using a bottle when supplementation is necessary.' "
Is there any special preparation required for breastfeeding?,"'Education about the benefits and practice of breastfeeding are keys to optimal preparation. Your local hospital may offer breastfeeding classes as part of the ''childbirth'' class, or you can join your local La Leche League or other breastfeeding support group. These classes can put you in touch with a lactation specialist who may later be your personal lactation consultant. These classes can also help you to learn proper positioning and latch-on techniques.''Contrary to some popular beliefs, it is not necessary to stimulate or prepare the nipples in advance for breastfeeding. Moreover, some techniques of stimulating the nipples may actually be harmful.''No specific physical preparation is necessary for optimal breastfeeding, although some doctors may want to know about things like inverted nipples or previous breast surgery even before the baby is born. General good health measures and adequate hydration are helpful measures. Most doctors recommend continuing basic ''prenatal vitamins'' while breastfeeding.' "
When can breastfeeding begin?,"'Breastfeeding can begin within minutes after birth for most babies. Most babies take a few licks or sucks and then pause at the beginning. Frequent bursts of sucking interrupted by pauses is the usual pattern for the first few hours and sometimes even the first few days.''The first milk the mother produces, called colostrum, is the best food for a newborn. The ''nipple'' stimulation that occurs during breastfeeding also helps the uterus contract and can help stop uterine bleeding.''When a baby begins to open its eyes, look around, and put his or her fist into his or her mouth, then it is time to offer your breast. Breastfeeding experts recommend that the baby not be given ''sugar'' water or other types of bottle feedings in the hospital unless specifically prescribed by the doctor. Some experts recommend not starting a pacifier until good breastfeeding is established.' "
What is the proper technique for breastfeeding?,"'Observing other breastfeeding mothers and talking with breastfeeding support organizations can help new breastfeeding mothers learn techniques for optimal breastfeeding that can help reduce the likelihood of any discomfort or complications. These techniques are briefly outlined below.'""After the mother has assumed a position comfortable for her, she can nestle the baby in a cradle hold (cradling the baby with the mother's arm on the same side as the breast being presented). The baby's body should be on its side, so that the baby does not have to turn his or her head to reach the nipple."" First, manually express a few drops of milk to moisten the nipple. Cup the breast with your hand and using the milk-moistened nipple, gently massage baby's lips, encouraging the baby to open its mouth. When the baby's mouth is opened, the nipple is inserted into the center of the baby's mouth while pulling the baby in very close. The baby's gums should take in at least a 1-inch radius of the areola. The mother may have to make adjustments for the baby's breathing by changing the angle of baby's position slightly or using the thumb to press gently on the breast to uncover the baby's nose. Hold the breast throughout the feeding so the weight of your breast does not tire your newborn's mouth. When feeding is over, to avoid trauma to your nipples, do not pull your nipple from baby's mouth without first breaking the suction by inserting your finger into the corner of baby's mouth."
When should I use a breast pump?,"'Many women find the convenience of a breast pump to be an invaluable aid in breastfeeding. Basically, breast pumps allow the nursing mother to expel (and store, if desired) breast milk at times when she is not available to nurse the breastfed baby.''There are different types of breast pumps. Large, dual-action pumps are typically used in the hospital setting and may be rented for home use. The options for personal use and purchase include automatic models that are comparable to hospital-grade pumps, small electric or battery-operated units that double- or single-pump, and one-handed manual pumps.''Breast pumps may be useful for working mothers who wish to provide a supply of breast milk for their newborn and keep up their own milk production. Sometimes, women must stop breastfeeding on a temporary basis due to an infection or need to take certain medications. In these cases, use of a breast pump can keep milk production active during the breastfeeding hiatus.' "
Should I eliminate certain foods from my diet while breastfeeding?,"""Some babies appear to be sensitive to certain foods in the mother's ""'diet'', while other babies never appear to have negative reactions to foods. A baby may become fussy, may have trouble sleeping, or may develop ''gas'' after the mother eats certain types of foods with strong flavors. Some of the most common triggers of fussiness in babies include ''chocolate'', spices, citrus fruits, and gas-causing vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, and broccoli. However, not all babies will have a reaction to particular foods.''Most experts recommend limiting consumption of ''caffeine'' while breastfeeding, since high levels of ''caffeine'"" can make the baby fussy or disturb the baby's ""'sleep'' patterns. Having more than one alcoholic beverage is also not recommended, since two or more alcoholic ''beverages'' at one time can increase blood ''alcohol'' levels to a point where the alcohol enters the breast milk. If a nursing mother consumes more than two drinks, she should wait at least 2 hours until nursing the baby to allow for elimination of alcohol from the body. If the breasts become engorged, it is fine to pump and discard breast milk while waiting. Studies have also shown that alcohol can interfere with the body\'s ability to ""let down"" (enable the free flow of breast milk) during breastfeeding.''Symptoms of allergy'' in a nursing baby may or may not be due to something eaten by the mother. If an ''allergic reaction'"" to mother's food is present in the baby, it usually develops 2-6 hours after the mother consumed the offending food.""'Because of concerns about ''mercury poisoning'', the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that nursing mothers limit their exposure to mercury in fish. The FDA and EPA advise eating no more than 6 oz. (about 1 serving) of canned albacore or ""white"" tuna a week and limiting intake of canned ""light"" tuna and other cooked fish to about 12 oz. (about 2 servings) per week. Nursing mothers should completely avoid eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (also called golden or white snapper) because of potentially high levels of mercury.' "
Clogged milk ducts,"'Clogged milk ducts may appear as small, red, tender lumps within the breast. Milk ducts may become clogged with dried milk or other material. The goal of treatment is opening these blocked ducts. This can be aided by increasing the breastfeeding frequency and offering the affected breast first, as well as pumping the breast after breastfeeding if the baby is not emptying the breast.''Moist heat packs can be applied to the affected area to increase blood flow and healing. A warm shower and massaging of the area may also enhance resolution of this problem.''Sometimes, the baby will refuse the affected breast because the milk develops a sour taste. Pump the breast and empty it as well as possible. Continue to offer that breast to the baby until he/she accepts the affected breast again.' "
Sore nipples,"'Sore nipples can be relieved by exposing the nipples to the air as much as possible. Using a hair dryer on a low setting to dry nipples after breastfeeding may also provide relief. Nipples should be washed only with water, never with soap, alcohol, benzoin, or premoistened towelettes. Petroleum-based ointments and other cosmetic preparations should not be used, but unmedicated lanolin may help alleviate nipple cracking.' "
When should one seek medical care for problems with breastfeeding?,"'It is important to call your health care provider if the above techniques do not alleviate the problem or if you develop serious symptoms such as ''fever'' or signs of ''mastitis'' (a breast inflammation that may be caused by an infection). Symptoms of mastitis include increasing ''pain'' in the breast, ''fever'', ''chills'', sweats, ''breast swelling'' and/or hardness, and redness of the skin over the affected area. A delay in treating mastitis could lead to a more severe infection and possible breast ''abscess''.' "
Can supplements or medications increase a low milk supply?,"'Most experts agree that increasing the number of feedings and receiving coaching and assistance on proper breastfeeding technique can help increase what is perceived to be a low milk supply. Some women find that using breast pumps after each feeding stimulates milk production because of the increased degrees of emptying of the breast.''Medications that are reported to increase milk production are known as galactogogues. The most common examples are ''dopamine'' receptor antagonists (such as ''metoclopramide'' [''Reglan'', Reglan ODT, ''Metozol ODT'', Octamide] and ''domperidone''). However, there have been no data to demonstrate that these ''drugs'' are more effective than interventions that focus on improving breastfeeding technique and increasing breastfeeding frequency. Most doctors do not support the use of these medications to augment milk supply.''Although a number of ''dietary supplements'' and/or herbal preparations have been claimed to stimulate milk production, including alfalfa, ''fenugreek'', or blessed thistle, there is little scientific data to support the claims that any herbal or dietary supplement can significantly increase milk production, and safety data on the use of these ''supplements'' in nursing mothers is incomplete.' "
Is it possible to breastfeed while pregnant?,"'While breastfeeding typically is associated with a decrease in ''fertility'', it is possible to become ''pregnant'' while breastfeeding, and breastfeeding does not provide 100% effective ''birth control''. For most women, it is safe to continue breastfeeding if they desire, provided they ensure that they are receiving adequate nutrition and fluid intake. While breast milk from a pregnant mother is still nutritionally strong, the hormonal changes of pregnancy will result in some changes in the content of the breast milk and the way the breast milk tastes.''Some women who have had premature ''labor'' in previous ''pregnancies'' may be advised to stop breastfeeding if they become pregnant. This is because the stimulation of the nipples that occurs during breastfeeding may trigger contractions of the uterus. In a woman prone to preterm ''labor'', these weak uterine contractions might increase her risk of developing preterm ''labor''. Both pregnancy and breastfeeding place high demands on the body in terms of nutritional support and rest. Other women may be advised to stop breastfeeding during pregnancy if their nutritional status is poor or if they are suffering from extreme ''fatigue'"" due to the pregnancy. These decisions should be made with advice from the mother's doctor."" "
Is smoking harmful when breastfeeding?,"'Tobacco smoking'' is always harmful, and all mothers should be encouraged to ''quit smoking'' prior to pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, ''smoking'' cigarettes is not considered to be a reason for not breastfeeding, since breastfeeding is the optimal nutrition for newborns. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics\' policy statement on breastfeeding, ""tobacco ''smoking'' by mothers is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, but health care professionals should advise all tobacco-using mothers to avoid ''smoking'' within the home and to make every effort to wean themselves from tobacco as rapidly as possible.""''Nursing mothers should understand that ''nicotine'' is passed to the baby in breast milk, and they should never nurse their baby immediately after smoking or while smoking. Babies exposed to ''secondhand smoke'' also are at risk for a number of health issues, so if a woman smokes, she should nurse her baby after smoking, in a room away from ''cigarette'' smoke. Of course, the safest policy for both mother and baby is to abstain from tobacco use while breastfeeding and forever thereafter.' "
"Do breast implants, surgeries, or reductions affect breastfeeding?","'Strictly speaking, neither ''breast augmentation'' surgery nor ''breast reduction'"" surgery are indications that a woman should not breastfeed. However, all types of breast surgery can interfere with milk production. In women who have received implants, the location of the implant and the type of incision used in the procedure will determine the extent, if any, to which the implant may affect breast milk production or nursing ability. In some cases, operations on a woman's breast may have involved incisions in the nipple area (such as surgeries for biopsies), and in these cases, the milk ducts may have been disrupted. Surgical disruption of milk ducts and ""'scar tissue'' may also predispose women to plugged ducts, mastitis, or milk retention ''cysts'' during breastfeeding.''Concerns have been expressed in the past that the content of ''breast implants'' (particularly with silicone implants) could leak out and be absorbed into breast milk, but studies have failed to show that this is a risk. Ideally, a woman who is planning breast surgery should discuss in advance with her surgeon the risks that the procedure may pose to future breastfeeding.' "
How should one wean a baby from breastfeeding?,"'Weaning is the process of transitioning from breastfeeding to other sources of nourishment. There are no established standards on when to wean a baby, although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies receive only breast milk for the first 6 months of life and a combination of solid foods and breast milk until the baby is at least 1 year old.''Sometimes babies will signal their mothers that it is time to begin weaning; they may nurse for shorter periods of time or appear indifferent, fussy, or distractible when nursing. Other babies may even be resistant to weaning even when the mother is ready. As babies begin to eat more solid foods, their consumption of breast milk may decrease, making breast engorgement less of a problem for the mother.''Weaning does not have to take place all at once. For example, a woman may choose to continue breastfeeding only in the evening, and to wean during the day. Weaning is also easier when the baby has been exposed to another source of milk, such as taking breast milk from a bottle.''No matter when weaning occurs, experts suggest that the process take place gradually. Many women wean by dropping one breastfeeding session a week. Slowing down the process can also help milk production gradually decrease, making engorgement less of a problem. Some mothers prefer to leave the weaning process up to the child; when a child is eating solid foods at every meal, there is often a decreased interest in breastfeeding.' "
Facts you should know about breasts," The breasts are medically known as the mammary glands. The mammary glands are made up of lobules, milk-producing glandular structures, and a system of ducts that transport milk to the nipple. Lymphatic vessels in the breast drain excess fluid. Breast growth begins at puberty in humans, in contrast to other types of primates in which breasts enlarge only during lactation. Breast tissue develops in the fetus along the so-called ""milk lines,"" extending from the armpit to the groin."
What are the breasts (mammary glands)?,"'The breasts, located on the front of the chest, are medically known as the mammary glands. The term ""breast"" is sometimes used to refer to the area at the front of the chest.' "
What are the anatomical features of the breast?,"'The mammary gland is made up of lobules -- glandular structures that produce milk in females when stimulated to do so. The lobules drain into a system of ducts, connecting channels that transport the milk to the nipple. Between the glandular tissue and ducts, the breast contains fat tissue and connective tissue.''Both males and females have breasts. The structure of the male breast is nearly identical to that of the female breast, except that the male breast tissue lacks the specialized lobules, as there is no physiologic need for milk production by the male breast. Abnormal enlargement of the ''male breasts'' is medically known as ''gynecomastia''.''The breast does not contain muscles. Breast tissue is located on top of the muscles of the chest wall. Blood vessels and lymphatic vessels (a system of vessels that drains fluid) are located throughout the breast. The lymphatic vessels in the breast drain to the ''lymph nodes'' in the underarm area (axilla) and behind the breast bone (sternum).'""In females, milk exits the breast at the nipple, which is surrounded by a darkened area of skin called the areola. The areola contains small, modified sweat glands known as Montgomery's tubercules. These glands secrete fluid that serves to lubricate the nipple during ""'breastfeeding''.' "
What are the most common medical conditions affecting the breasts?,"'Breast health is a source of concern for most women. Although ''breast cancer'' is a fairly common ''malignancy'' affecting one out of every eight women in the U.S. at some point in life, benign (non-cancerous) conditions of the breast are much more common. In fact, most masses and lumps in the breasts are not ''cancer''. ''Breast cancer'' occurs in males as well, but it accounts for a small percentage of all breast ''cancers''.''Among the benign breast conditions, ''cysts'' and fibrocystic changes are common. One type of benign ''tumor'' in particular, known as a fibroadenoma, is common in young women. Infections of the breast tissue can also occur, particularly during breastfeeding. ''Mastitis'' is the medical term for inflammation of the breast. '  "
What happens to the breasts in pregnancy?,"'During ''pregnancy'', the breasts grow further due to stimulation by ''estrogens'' (female hormones). The growth during pregnancy is more uniform than that observed at puberty. The amount of tissue capable of producing milk is approximately the same in all women, so women with smaller breasts produce the same amount of milk as women with larger breasts. During pregnancy, the areola becomes darker and enlarges in size.' "
How does breast tissue develop?,"'Breast tissue begins to form in the fourth week of fetal life. In the fetus, breast tissue develops along two ""milk lines"" that start at the armpit and extend to the groin. Uncommonly, an extra (ancillary) breast can develop along this line. On the skin surface, an extra nipple (supernumerary nipple) may develop along this line. ''' "
How are human breasts different from other species?,"""In other primates (such as apes), the breasts develop only when they are producing milk. After the young have been weaned, the breasts flatten again. In humans, the breasts enlarge at puberty and stay enlarged throughout a woman's life. "" "
What should I know about breast augmentation (breast implants)?, Smooth implants have less chance of rippling (waviness of skin) than textured (roughened) implants. Smooth implants have a higher incidence of capsule contracture (hardening of the implant) than textured implants. Implants placed under the muscle result in more pain postoperatively but have a lower incidence of capsule contracture and rippling. Infection and bleeding are rare but must be treated promptly. A certain number of patients may need another surgery to correct a problem. The aesthetic results of breast implants are best appreciated by the patient who feels the need for larger breasts.
What is breast augmentation?,"'Augmentation of the breast consists of insertion of a silicone bag (prosthesis) under the breast (submammary) or under the breast and chest muscle (subpectoral) and then filling the bag with saline (salt water). This prosthesis expands the breast area to give a fuller breast (increased cup size), give a better contour, and give more cleavage.' "
How is the incision made for breast implants?,'The incision (cut) may be placed at various locations such as: under the breast at the breast fold; periareolar which is at the edge of the ''areola'' (brown area consisting of ''nipple'' and surrounding area); within the areola; in the armpit (axillary); or in the umbilical area.''The thinnest ''scar'' is usually in the areola. The umbilical incision approach is used with an endoscope (tube with a light for visualization and placement of the breast implant).' 
What are smooth and textured types of breast implants?,'There are two types of breast implants?''What are the choices of implant positions? '  The smooth surface implant requires a large pocket and is associated with a 10% incidence of capsule contracture (tightening of the scar around the implant causing firmness or hardness). The smooth implant has only an occasional occurrence of rippling or wrinkling which gives the overlying skin a wavy appearance. A textured (roughened surface) implant is associated with a 3% incidence of capsule contracture but has a 7-9% occurrence of rippling. The easiest surgical placement of the implant is under the breast tissue (submammary). A slightly more difficult surgical placement is under the chest muscle (submuscular or subpectoral) but this position is associated with a lower incidence of capsule contracture and slightly less occurrence of rippling. There is more pain postoperatively than with a submammary placement.
What are the options for breast implant size?,"'The ultimate size of the breast is mainly a personal decision by the patient. Cup size is an inexact estimate of the final size since cup sizes vary with the bra manufacturer and how tight or loose the patient wears her bra as well as how much breast tissue is already present. Describing the preferred cup size does aid the surgeon, but it also helps to look at pictures or photos to show the physician the desired final look.''The most accurate method of estimating the implant size (in ounces) is to fill a ''plastic'"" bag with measured amounts of water and place in a bra with the patient's estimated cup size. One can see with the bra on and covered by a sweater what the final result will approximate.""'Patients most often comment that, ""I wish I had gone larger,"" although there is a rare patient who feels she is too large.' "
What are risks and complications of breast augmentation?,"'Although infection is rare, it can be a very distressing problem. Signs of infection are ''fever'', redness, swelling, and discomfort. If the infection does not respond rapidly to antibiotic treatment, the implant must be removed and the implant can be replaced three (3) months after the ''wound'' is completely healed.''If bleeding occurs into the implant pocket after surgery, the implant must be surgically removed, the bleeding controlled, the wound washed out, and the implant replaced. Signs of bleeding include marked swelling, increasing pain, and ''bruising''.''Hardening of the breast with distortion and sometime pain may require surgical incision of the fibrous scar capsule around the implant (capsulotomy) or partial or total removal of the scar capsule (capsulectomy). The implant can be immediately placed back in the new packet. About 30-35% of patients have recurrent capsule contracture.''Other means of treating the contracture is replacement of a smooth implant with a textured one or placing the implant in a new pocket either under the breast or under the muscle.''If capsule contracture occurs multiple times, the patient may decide to remove the implants permanently.''Sometimes the implant will slip out of the position in which it was initially placed and appear too high, too low, or to one side. Most of the time, this requires surgical repair.''The implant will block some areas of the breast from being visualized on ''mammography''. This is usually less if the implant is placed under the muscle.''Because breast implants might affect the clarity of the ''mammogram'', patients who have multiple close family members with ''breast cancer'' probably should not have breast implants.''With all the ''confusion'' in the newspaper, magazines and on the T.V. or radio, there has been a fear that silicone implants may cause autoimmune disease. At this time there is no scientific evidence that silicone causes autoimmune disease.''According to the FDA, breast implants can cause anaplastic large cell ''lymphoma'', in rare cases.''Implants that have been in a patient for many years may cause calcifications in the scar capsule around the implant. These calcifications can almost always be distinguished from the calcifications which may indicate ''breast cancer''.''An implant may leak from ''weakness'' in the patch or valve area, a hole from incomplete inflation, or other factors. The more modern saline implants have been estimated to leak in 1-5% of cases.'  "
How long do breast implants last?,"'It is not known how long implants will last. In the body, the wall of the implant may weaken and become disrupted. This is more likely when there is an impact injury, such as from the steering wheel of a car or fall. The implant may or may not last a lifetime and depends upon the manufacturing process and other, as yet, unknown factors.''Most patients are extremely happy with breast augmentation. There is a certain amount of increased self esteem and self confidence which may result.''The patient who desires augmentation should not be influenced by family or friends as to whether or not the surgery should be performed and what size is most desirable. This is a very personal matter to most patients and satisfaction is best when the patient makes the decisions.' "
What is a breast biopsy?,"'A breast biopsy is a procedure in which part or all of a suspicious area in the breast is removed and examined, usually for the presence of ''breast cancer''. The growth sample is suctioned out through a needle or cut out using a surgical procedure. A pathologist then examines and evaluates it under a microscope to identify noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (''malignant'') tissue.''Words used to refer to the abnormal area or growth before and after diagnosis may include lump, mass, lesion, calcification, and ''tumor''.''Imaging studies such as ''mammography'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI), or ultrasound may be used to guide the procedure, known as an image-guided breast biopsy. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses a special mammography machine to help guide the biopsy equipment to the site of the breast abnormality.''The following are the different types of breast biopsy procedures:'   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA): A thin needle suctions out cells from an abnormal area; a physician examines the cells to see if cancer cells are present. Hollow or core needle biopsy: This thicker needle is used to remove a small cylinder of tissue from the abnormal area. Biopsy with a vacuum-powered device Surgical excision of tissue: This may be an excisional biopsy, in which all the abnormal area is excised or removed, or an incisional biopsy, which removes only a portion of the abnormal area for examination by the pathologist."
What is the purpose of a breast biopsy?,"'The breast biopsy is used to determine whether or not a worrisome abnormality or area of calcification is ''cancer'' and, if it is ''cancer'', what type it is and how to develop a treatment plan. When no ''breast cancer'' is detected, the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring. The percentage of breast biopsies that are positive for cancer varies according to the individual hospital or clinic, but in general, only about 20% of ''breast lumps'' are cancerous. The majority of breast biopsies do not detect cancer.' "
"What specialties of physicians and 
other health care professionals perform breast biopsies?","'Many physicians and health care professionals can be involved in evaluating a woman for a breast biopsy.' For example, breast abnormalities during a physical examination might be noticed by a family physician, internist, gynecologist, or nurse practitioner. Women themselves are frequently the first to detect abnormalities in their breasts. Radiologists are specialists in interpreting X-rays such as mammograms, as well as other imaging studies. Radiologists or surgeons often perform the procedure to obtain these breast tissue samples. Anesthesiologists (specialists in administering anesthesia and monitoring a patient's vital signs) are sometimes necessary during some surgical procedures. Pathologists are physician specialists who examine and identify under a microscope the type of cells in the samples and determine whether or not cancer is present."
Who should have a breast biopsy?,"'Anyone, female or male, with a suspicious breast growth, abnormality detected on imaging study, or other ''symptoms of breast cancer'' should undergo a biopsy. Ninety-nine percent of all breast ''cancers'' occur in females, however, males can and do get breast cancer. Therefore, men should regularly examine their breasts as females do for lumps or other ''cancer symptoms''. (Males with the ''genetic disorder'' ''Klinefelter syndrome'', which is associated with increased breast development, have approximately the same risk of developing breast cancer as females.)'  "
In what setting is the breast biopsy done?,"""Breast biopsies are performed in the doctor's office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital operating room. The setting depends on the size and location of the growth, the patient's general health, and the type of biopsy performed. Because physicians can perform biopsies in a short time with minimal risk of serious complications, the patient usually does not need to remain hospitalized overnight unless an underlying health problem requires close monitoring. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses mammography images to guide the location of the biopsy. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may also be used to guide the breast biopsy procedure."" "
What may a benign result indicate?,"'Among the most common benign growths in the breast are ''cysts'' (sacs filled with fluid or semisolid material), intraductal papillomas (small wart-like growths that project above a tissue surface), and lumps formed by fat necrosis (the death of tissue often as a result of ''trauma'' to the breast). A fibroadenoma is the most common type of benign (noncancerous) breast tumor and is found in young women.' "
How is a suspicious breast growth discovered?,"""A suspicious breast growth may be found by a patient's self-examination, a physician's clinical examination, or a screening procedure such as a ""'mammogram''. Small calcium deposits, known as calcifications, are often identified in imaging studies of breast cancers and precancers. These may also be present in benign lesions.' "
What breast symptoms should I be concerned about?,"'Females and males (regardless of age) who discover a lump in a breast should see a doctor for testing. They also should see a doctor if they find a lump in an armpit or above a collarbone (either of which could indicate the presence of spreading cancer).''A doctor or health care professional should be consulted if a person has''It is important to remember that these signs and symptoms do not necessarily indicate the presence of cancer.' red or irritated breast skin, scaly skin on the breast, dimpling skin on the breast, swelling breast skin, nipple discharge other than milk, nipple retraction or inversion, nipple itching, a change in the size or shape of a breast, or breast pain."
What should the patient tell the doctor about the growth?,"'The patient should tell the health care professional when the growth appeared, what its size was at the time of discovery compared to its present size, and where it is located. The patient should also outline any family history of breast cancer, as well as any personal history of breast problems of any kind.' "
How does a health care professional confirm the presence of a breast growth?,"'A physician confirms the presence of a growth by taking a medical history (and asking numerous questions), performing a clinical examination that includes palpating (feeling) the breast, and interpreting the results of a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes other imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI.''Ultrasound sends sound waves into the breast that bounce back to a receiver that can record an image on a computer screen to visualize interior structures. This technique can help distinguish between a ''cyst'' and a solid growth. The physician may also order the laboratory analysis of any nipple discharge (other than milk) to examine for the presence of atypical or cancer cells. After confirming the presence of a suspicious growth or mass, the physician orders a biopsy.' "
"Is anesthesia needed for a 
breast biopsy?","'For nonsurgical biopsies, the patient may need no anesthesia at all or just a local anesthetic (one that numbs the suspicious area only). Sometimes, a patient receives a sedative (calming drug) with the local anesthesia.''For surgical biopsies, the patient may receive a local anesthetic (with or without a sedative) or general anesthesia (one that induces ''sleep''). Patients requiring general anesthesia may have to fast eight to 12 hours before undergoing a biopsy.' "
What are the possible complications from a breast biopsy?,"'Except for a minor sting from the injected anesthesia, patients usually feel no ''pain'' before or during a procedure.''The risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding, is small for nonsurgical procedures and slightly higher for surgical procedures.' "
How long is the recovery time after breast biopsy?,"'After a procedure, some patients may experience some soreness and ''pain'' as well as ''bruising'' and minor skin discoloration of the breast that usually resolves within a week or so. Usually, an ''over-the-counter'' drug such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is sufficient to alleviate any discomfort.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nonsurgical procedures versus surgical breast biopsies?,"'Generally, nonsurgical biopsies are less stressful, do not disfigure the skin, leave no internal ''scar'' to interfere with the accuracy of future mammograms, and minimize the risk of complications.''However, nonsurgical biopsies are not always as reliable as surgical biopsies in producing a diagnosis, and the results at times may be inconclusive. For this reason, some patients who undergo a nonsurgical biopsy must also undergo a follow-up surgical biopsy.' "
What are the different types of breast biopsy procedures and what do they involve?,"'Breast biopsy procedures include''These procedures are described in greater detail later in this article.'   fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and surgical biopsy."
How is a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) done?,"'A fine needle aspiration biopsy can be done in several different ways:''By analyzing the samples immediately after their withdrawal, a doctor may be able to determine that they came from a cyst and simply discard them, diagnosing the growth as benign. In all other cases, fluid and tissue samples are placed on slides and then analyzed by a pathologist in a laboratory. Atypical cells found in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may signal that cancer is present or that repeat biopsies are necessary.' Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for palpable growths: A palpable growth is one that can be felt. The patient usually sits up while the doctor inserts a small hollow needle with a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) fluid and cells from the growth for testing. The doctor simply feels (palpates) the suspicious area to the needle to the site. When the needle reaches the mass, the doctor suctions out a sample with the syringe. The doctor repeats this procedure several times. If the mass is a cyst, the withdrawn samples will consist mainly of fluid and the cyst may collapse, relieving any pain the patient feels. If the mass is solid, the samples will consist primarily of tissue cells. Guided FNA for non-palpable growths: When a growth is too small or deep to palpate (feel), the doctor must locate it with one of several imaging techniques. First, the patient lies face-down on a table with the breasts suspended through an opening. With stereotactic mammography, mammograms of the suspicious breast site are taken from different angles to form a virtual three-dimensional (stereotactic) image that precisely pinpoints the location of the suspicious area. The computer then uses a motor to guide a small hollow needle to the site to remove the samples. The withdrawn samples are then analyzed for the presence of cancer. Ultrasound and MRI are other imaging techniques that may be used to guide breast biopsies."
How is a core needle biopsy done?,"'A core needle biopsy can also be done in several different ways:' Core needle biopsy for palpable growths: This procedure is similar to FNA for palpable growths except that that the needle used has a wider diameter and is equipped with a cutter that removes cores of tissue up to a ½ inch long. A key advantage of this procedure is that the samples are larger than in FNA and thus enhance the possibility of making an accurate laboratory analysis. Guided core needle biopsy for non-palpable growths: This procedure also uses a wide needle with a cutter that removes cores of tissue large enough to enhance the accuracy of laboratory analysis. However, because the growth is deep in the breast or otherwise not palpable, stereotactic imaging, ultrasound, or MRI is used to locate the growth."
How is a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy done?,"'Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is procedure that uses a special instrument and imaging guidance to remove breast tissue samples through a single small skin incision. This technique allows the surgeon to remove more tissue through a single incision than is possible with a traditional core biopsy and is a much less invasive procedure than an open surgical biopsy.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy involves the placement of a biopsy probe using radiology imaging studies for guidance. Stereotactic mammography, ultrasound, and MRI have all been successfully used to identify the abnormal areas to be sampled by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Once the biopsy probe has been positioned, a vacuum pulls the breast tissue through an opening in the probe into the sampling chamber of the device. Then a rotating cutting device in the instrument removes the tissue sample, which is carried through the biopsy probe to a tissue collection receptacle.''The surgeon or radiologist then turns a control knob on the biopsy probe that moves the sampling chamber to a new position. This procedure is repeated until all desired areas have been sampled. In this way, samples can be taken all around a suspicious area through a single insertion of the biopsy probe. With a traditional core biopsy, sampling of multiple areas would involve repeated insertions of the biopsy instrument.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia and leaves a small incision that does not require ''stitches'' for closure. It takes less than an hour to perform, and patients can usually return to normal activities soon after the procedure.' "
"How is a 
surgical biopsy of the breast done?","'A surgical biopsy can be an excisional (removing the entire abnormal area) or an incisional (removing only part of the abnormal area) biopsy. The surgical biopsy can be done in different ways:''The doctor closes the opening with ''sutures'' or clips that remain in place for about a week. Patients who receive general anesthesia rather than a local will require about an hour to recover from drowsiness after the surgery.' Surgical biopsy of palpable growths (lumpectomy): This procedure removes part or all of a breast growth, or lump. The doctor makes an incision 1 or 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 cm) across and removes the sample. If the lump is small and measures 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less across, the doctor usually removes the entire lump for testing (excisional biopsy). If the lump is large, the doctor usually removes only a portion of it for testing (incisional biopsy). If cancer is found, the rest of the lump can be removed at the time of the biopsy or at a later time. Surgical biopsy for non-palpable lumps: This procedure is similar to lumpectomy except that the growth is first located by mammography or other imaging studies and then ""marked."" The doctor inserts a needle that conveys a wire with a hook on the end into the breast, all the while using the image as a guide. After anchoring the hooked wire to the lump, the doctor withdraws the needle and performs the surgery. Another option is to inject a dye to mark the spot rather than using a hooked wire."
What is the time frame for receiving the results of a breast biopsy?,"'For small biopsies and fine-needle aspirations, the results may be available the next day. The results of most breast biopsies will be available within a few days. Sometimes special testing must be performed, and the results may be delayed and take longer. This does not necessarily mean that a cancer is present. For example, sometimes the tissue sections must be recut to reveal deeper layers of the tissue to allow for optimal evaluation by the pathologist. In other cases, special tissue stains may be necessary to help the pathologist assess the tissue sample under the microscope. The radiologist or surgeon performing the procedure will be able to give you a better idea of the approximate time frame and how the result will be communicated to you.' "
What Causes Stress Among Breast Cancer Patients?,"'Stress'' is common among ''breast cancer'"" patients. Stressors related to the disease may include the uncertainty of one's future, the unpredictability of disease, disability, and financial difficulties.""'Common stress signals can include disturbed ''sleep'', ''fatigue'', body aches, ''pain'', ''anxiety'', irritability, tension, and ''headaches''.' "
How Can I Reduce Stress?,"'Stress can build, influencing how you feel about life. Prolonged stress may lead to frustration, anger, hopelessness, and -- at times -- ''depression''. The person with the illness is not the only one affected. Family members are also influenced by the health changes of a loved one. To reduce stress:' Keep a positive attitude. Accept that there are events you cannot control. Be assertive instead of aggressive. ""Assert"" your feelings, opinions or beliefs instead of becoming angry, combative or passive. Learn to relax. Exercise regularly. Your body can fight stress better when you are physically fit. Eat well-balanced meals. Rest and sleep. Your body needs time to recover from stressful events. Don't rely on alcohol or drugs to reduce stress."
How Can I Learn To Relax?,"'There are a number of exercises that you can do to relax. These exercises include ''breathing'', muscle and mind relaxation, relaxation to music, and biofeedback. A few that you can try are listed below. First, be sure that you have a quiet location that is free of distractions, a comfortable body position (sit or recline on a chair or sofa) and a good state of mind. Try to block out worries and distracting thoughts.' "
What Are Some Effective Relaxation Exercises?,"'Two-minute relaxation. ''Switch your thoughts to yourself and your breathing. Take a few deep breaths, exhaling slowly. Mentally scan your body. Notice areas that feel tense or cramped. Quickly loosen up these areas. Let go of as much tension as you can. Rotate your head in a smooth, circular motion once or twice. (Stop any movements that cause ''pain''.) Roll your shoulders forward and backward several times. Let all of your muscles completely relax. Recall a pleasant thought for a few seconds. Take another deep breath and exhale slowly. You should feel relaxed.''Mind relaxation. ''Close your eyes. Breathe normally through your nose. As you exhale, silently say to yourself the word ""one,"" a short word such as ""peaceful"" or a short phrase such as ""I feel quiet."" Continue for 10 minutes. If your mind wanders, gently remind yourself to think about your breathing and your chosen word or phrase. Let your breathing become slow and steady.''Deep breathing relaxation.'' Imagine a spot just below your navel. Breath into that spot and fill your abdomen with air. Let the air fill you from the abdomen up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. With every long, slow breath out, you should feel more relaxed.''How Can I Make My Life Better?''The most important step you can take is to seek help as soon as you feel less able to cope. (See ""What Types Of Help Are Available?"" below.) Taking action early will enable you to understand and deal with the many effects of your illness. Learning to manage stress will help you maintain a positive physical, emotional, and spiritual outlook on life.' "
How Do I Keep Track Of My Medical Information?," Do not be afraid to ask your doctor, nurse, or other healthcare provider to repeat any instructions or medical terms that you don't understand. Your healthcare providers should always be available to answer your questions and address your concerns. Make use of resources and support services offered by your hospital and in the community. Learning more about your disease will help you feel more comfortable with your treatment. Ask your family and friends to help you sort through the information you receive. Talk with other patients and families about breast cancer and its treatment."
What Types Of Help Are Available?,"'There are many sources of help available to provide support for patients and their families. Among them are:''Social Workers.''Social workers are just one part of the care-giving team who can offer treatment in a compassionate setting. They can help you and your family discuss any concerns about your diagnosis, treatment, or personal situation.''Social workers can provide education, counseling regarding lifestyle changes, and referrals to community or national agencies and support groups. Your social worker can also help your family find temporary lodging in your community, provide information about community resources, and help you with any other needs.''Individual Counseling''Sometimes people have problems that are better addressed in a one-on-one atmosphere. By participating in individual counseling, you may feel more comfortable expressing sensitive or private feelings you have about your illness and its impact on your lifestyle and relationships.''Counseling services can help patients and their families discuss issues of concern and develop and enhance coping abilities. In addition, mental-healthcare providers can create a treatment plan to meet your specific needs. Strategies can be designed to help you regain a sense of control over your life and improve your quality of life, something everyone deserves. If necessary, medicine to treat ''depression'' may be prescribed.''Support Groups''Support groups are a very useful sharing experience. They provide an environment where you can learn new ways of dealing with your illness.'""Sometimes, others who have been through similar experiences can explain things differently than your healthcare providers. You may also want to share approaches you've discovered with them. And you will gain strength in knowing that you are not facing hardships alone.""""Remember that others may share information or experiences that do not apply to you. Never replace your physician's advice with that given to another patient.""'The American ''Cancer'"" Society's Reach to Recovery program offers special help to breast ""'cancer'' patients.

Call 1-800-ACS-2345 for more information.""'Financial Counseling''A financial counselor can answer questions you may have about financial issues related to your medical care.' "
What If I Become Unable To Make Decisions About My Health Care?,"'You may want to consider advance directives, such as living wills and durable ''power of attorney''.'""The living will exercises a patient's right to refuse or accept medical treatment that artificially prolongs his/her life and provides clear instructions regarding the patient's choice of extended medical care.""'This document is prepared while the patient is fully competent, in case he/she becomes unable to make this decision at a later time.''The durable power of attorney for healthcare is the right of patients to appoint another person to speak for them if they become incapable of expressing their medical treatment preference. An attorney should devise this document so that it conforms to state laws and court precedents.' "
Should I Write A Will?,"'No one likes to think about his or her own mortality, but everyone should have a will to ensure that those who survive you will know how to carry out your wishes. This document should be prepared with your attorney.' "
What Should Family Members And Friends Keep In Mind?,"'The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is a time of stress and may be difficult for family and friends.

Encourage your loved one to be as active and independent, as possible, to help him or her regain a sense of self-reliance and confidence. Be realistic about your own needs. Be sure you are sleeping enough, eating properly, and taking some time off for yourself. It is hard to offer much help when you are exhausted. If you take care of your needs, it may be easier to meet the needs of your loved one. Don't hesitate to ask other family members and friends for help. They will appreciate the opportunity to help."
What Is Lymphedema?,"'Lymphedema'' is an abnormal buildup of fluid that causes swelling, most often in the arms or legs. The condition develops when lymph vessels or lymph nodes are missing, impaired, damaged, or removed.''There are two types of ''lymphedema'': primary and secondary.''Primary lymphedema is rare and is caused by the absence of, or abnormalities in, certain lymph vessels at birth.''Secondary lymphedema occurs as a result of a blockage or interruption that alters the flow of lymph through the lymphatic system and can develop from an infection, ''cancer'', surgery, ''scar tissue'' formation, ''trauma'', ''deep vein thrombosis'' (a ''blood clot'' in a vein), ''radiation'', or other ''cancer'' treatment.' "
Who Is at Risk for Developing Lymphedema?,"'People who have had any of the following procedures may be at risk for developing lymphedema:''Lymphedema can occur within a few days, months, or years after surgery. A small amount of swelling is normal for the first four to six weeks after surgery.' Simple mastectomy in combination with axillary (arm pit) lymph node removal. Lumpectomy 
in combination with axillary lymph node removal. Modified radical mastectomy in combination with axillary lymph node 
removal. Combined cancer surgery and radiation therapy to a lymph node region (such as the neck, armpit, groin, 
pelvis or abdomen). Radiation therapy to a lymph node region."
What Happens After My Breast Cancer Surgery?,"'Lymphedema develops after breast surgery because there is an alteration in the pathway that drains the fluids involved in the immune system. It can occur at any time after the surgery. If untreated, it can become worse.''Following surgery, a physician will examine you and take arm measurements. Sometimes, there may be redness or ''pain'' in the arm, which may be a sign of inflammation. Depending on your symptoms, your physician will then consider the best treatment options for you.' "
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Lymphedema?,"'If you suspect any of the symptoms of lymphedema listed below, call your health care provider right away. Prompt treatment can help get the condition under control.' Swelling in the arms, hands, fingers, shoulders, chest, or legs. The swelling may occur for the first time after a traumatic event (such as 
bruises, cuts, sunburn, and sports injuries), after an infection in the part of the body that was treated for cancer, or after an airplane trip lasting more than three hours. A ""full"" or heavy sensation in the arms or legs. Skin tightness. Decreased 
flexibility in the hand, wrist, or ankle. Difficulty fitting into clothing in one specific area. Tight-fitting 
bracelet, watch, or ring that wasn't tight before."
How Is Lymphedema Diagnosed?,"'Lymphedema is diagnosed after a careful evaluation of your medical history, including past surgeries and treatments, an evaluation of current medications and symptoms, and a complete physical exam. Sometimes, additional tests may be needed.' "
How Is Lymphedema Treated?,"'Lymphedema treatments vary, depending on the stage and cause of the illness. The most important aspect of treatment is learning how to care for your health. Your doctor or nurse will teach you and your family how to follow your prescribed treatment.''If the initial signs and symptoms of swelling are caused by infection, antibiotics may be prescribed. Other treatments may include bandaging, proper ''skin care'' and ''diet'', compression garments, exercises, and manual lymphatic drainage, a gentle form of skin stretching/''massage''.' "
How Can I Help Prevent Lymphedema?,"'Lymphedema can be prevented or controlled if it develops by following the recommendations below.''Maintain good ''nutrition''Exercise'' regularly''Avoid infections''Stay alert for signs of infection''Avoid tight clothing, shoes or jewelry''Avoid heavy lifting with the affected arm (even a purse or bag)''Keep your skin meticulously clean''Take precautions during visits to your doctor''Inform your doctor of any symptoms' Reduce foods high in salt and fat. Include at least two to four servings of fruits and three to five servings of vegetables in your daily meal plan. Eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients you need. Use the package label information to help you to make the 
best selections for a healthy lifestyle. Eat foods high in fiber such 
as whole-grain breads, cereals, pasta, rice, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Drink plenty of water. Maintain your ideal body weight. A registered dietitian or your health care 
provider can help calculate your ideal body weight. Avoid alcoholic beverages. Always check with 
your doctor first before starting a new exercise program. To improve cardiovascular 
fitness, you should perform aerobic activities (including walking, swimming, 
low-impact aerobics or specially prescribed exercises) for 20 to 30 minutes at least three times a week. Take time to 
include a five-minute warm-up, including stretching exercises, before any aerobic activity and include a five to 10-minute 
cool down after the activity. If your normal exercise routine includes weight lifting with your arms, check with your 
doctor about the best time to resume this activity and if there are any weight restrictions. Discontinue any exercise 
that causes unexpected pain. If your arm or leg (on the side where you had surgery) becomes tired during exercise, cool 
down, then rest and elevate it. Wear gloves while doing housework or gardening. Avoid cutting your cuticles when manicuring your nails. Use care when cutting your toenails. Frequently wash your 
hands with soap and warm water, especially before preparing food, and after using the bathroom or after touching soiled 
linens or clothes. Protect your skin from scratches, sores, burns and 
other irritations that might lead to infection. Use electric razors to remove hair and replace the razor head frequently. Use insect repellents to prevent bug bites. Immediately report any signs of infection to your physician. Fever over 100 degrees F (38 degrees C) Sweats or chills Skin

movements of the affected arm (such as scrubbing, pushing or pulling). Do not carry a purse or bag on your shoulder (the side 
where you had surgery). Dry your skin thoroughly (including creases and 
between fingers and toes) and apply lotion. Ask to have your 
blood pressure checked on the unaffected arm. And avoid injections or blood drawing on the surgical side 
if possible. Notify your doctor if you have redness, swelling, a 
skin rash or blistering on the side of your body where you had surgery, or if you have a temperature over 100 degrees F 
(38 degrees C). These warning signs of infection could be an early sign of lymphedema and should be treated immediately."
What Can I Do if I Already Have Lymphedema?,"'To help decrease the risk of further swelling, continue following the recommendations for preventing lymphedema listed above. In addition:' Avoid extreme temperature 
changes. Do not use hot tubs, whirlpools, saunas or steam baths. Use warm, rather than very hot, water when bathing or washing

provider if you should wear a compression sleeve on your affected arm or a stocking on your affected leg. For long flights, 
additional bandages may be needed. Talk to your health care provider before traveling. When sitting or sleeping, elevate 
your affected arm or leg on pillows. Avoid prolonged lying on your affected side. Your doctor may refer you to an 
occupational therapist who specializes in managing lymphedema. The therapist will assess your condition and develop an individual 
treatment plan to manage your lymphedema. Therapy may include specific exercises or a complete exercise program, limitation of 
certain activities that are vigorous or repetitive, and recommendations for a compression sleeve, bandages, manual lymph drainage 
and possibly a pump. Continue to see your health-care provider for frequent follow-up visits, as recommended."
What Is the Outlook for Lymphedema?,"'Lymphedema cannot be cured. However, with proper care and treatment, the affected limb can be restored to a normal size and shape. In addition, lymphedema can be treated and controlled so that it does not progress further.''If left untreated, lymphedema can lead to increased swelling and a hardening of the tissue, resulting in decreased function and mobility in the affected limb. It can also lead to chronic infections and other illnesses.''It is important to receive treatment promptly if you recognize symptoms of lymphedema.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What Is a Clinical Trial?,"'A clinical trial is a research program conducted with patients to evaluate a new medical treatment, drug or device. The purpose of a ''breast cancer'' clinical trial is to find new and improved methods of treating the disease. ''Clinical trials'' make it possible to apply the latest scientific and technological advances to patient care.''During a ''breast cancer'' clinical trial, researchers, usually physicians, use the best available treatment as a standard to evaluate new treatments. These treatments may be a new drug, surgery or an alternative medicine.''First, researchers study new treatment options in the laboratory in test tubes and animals. If those results are promising, new treatments are further evaluated in a small group of people, and, finally, in a larger clinical trial.''When a new medical treatment is studied for the first time in humans, no one knows exactly how it will work. With any new treatment, there are possible risks as well as benefits. Clinical trials help physicians discover the answers to these questions:' Is the treatment safe and effective? Is the treatment potentially better than the treatments currently available? What are the side effects of the treatment? Does the treatment have any possible risks? How well does the treatment work?"
What Are the Different Types of Breast Cancer Clinical Trials?,"'All clinical trials are conducted in phases, each designed to find out specific information. Each new phase of a clinical trial builds on information from previous stages.''Participants may be eligible for clinical trials in different phases, depending on their health. Most clinical trial participants take part in Phases III and IV.''Phase I clinical trials'' study the safety of the new treatment.''Phase II clinical trials'' occur if the treatment is found to be safe in the phase 1 trial. Phase II studies look at whether the treatment is effective.''Phase III clinical trials'"" compare the new treatment with the standard treatment to determine if it's any better.""'If a treatment does well in phase II studies, it is often approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).''Phase IV clinical trials'' occur after the drug is approved FDA. These studies look at ways to use the new treatment more effectively. For example, in phase IV trials researchers may test a drug in combination with other ''drugs'"". Or they may study a new dose. Or they may study the drug's effectiveness to treat a particular disease or a select group of patients."" "
What Are the Advantages of Participating in a Breast Cancer Clinical Trial?," You may receive a new treatment before it is widely available to the public. You can provide researchers with the information they need to continue developing new procedures and introducing new treatment methods. Your treatment costs may be decreased, since many of the tests and physician visits that are directly related to the clinical trial are paid for by the company or agency sponsoring the study. Be sure to discuss your treatment costs with the physicians and nurses conducting the clinical trial."
What Are the Disadvantages of Participating in a Breast Cancer Clinical Trial?," All of the risks and side effects of the new treatment usually are not known at the beginning of the clinical trial. There may be unknown side effects, as well as hoped-for benefits. It's important to note that most treatments have potential side effects. Patients are informed of any known possible side effects before they join a clinical trial. They're also informed of any ""new"" side effects that become known while they are participating in the trial. If you participate in a randomized clinical trial, you may not receive the new treatment being studied. Many breast cancer clinical trials compare a new treatment along with current therapy versus the current therapy alone. Participants are randomly assigned to one or the other group. This will be explained to you before you decide to take part. As with other forms of therapy, the new treatment may not work for you, even if it helps others. Insurers do not always cover all of the costs associated with taking part in a clinical trial. Be sure to talk to your insurance provider before you decide to participate. There may be inconveniences, such as more frequent testing, more time at the doctor's office, and travel commitments."
Who Looks Out For Me if I Decide to Enroll in Breast Cancer Clinical Trial?,"""Clinical trial participants are willing volunteers. Even though patients may be asked by their physicians to take part in a clinical trial, it is up to you to make the final decision. However, there are many safeguards in place to look out for the welfare of volunteers. These safeguards can't guarantee that you won't have complications, but they try to reduce risk as much as possible."" "
What Happens if I Join a Breast Cancer Clinical Trial?,"'Before you take part in any research study, you will be asked to give informed consent to participate. Informed consent means that as a patient, you are given all available information so you can understand what is involved in a specific clinical trial. The physicians and nurses conducting the study will explain the treatment to you, including its possible benefits and risks.''You will be given an informed consent form to read and consider carefully. Before signing, be sure you find out as much as possible about the clinical trial, including what risks you may face. Ask the physician or nurse to explain parts of the form or the trial that are not clear. (See the section, ""Important Questions to Ask"".)''You are free to decide whether or not you want to take part in the trial. If you decide to participate, you will sign the consent form. If you do not want to participate in the trial, you may refuse. If you choose not to participate in the trial, your care will not be affected in any way.''Your signature on the informed consent form does not bind you to the study. Even if you sign the form, you are free to leave the trial at any time to receive other available treatments.''The informed consent process is ongoing. After you agree to participate in a breast ''cancer'' clinical trial, you will continue to receive any new information about your treatment that may affect your willingness to stay in the trial.' "
Who Can Participate In a Breast Cancer Clinical Trial?,"'Every clinical trial is designed to meet a specific set of research criteria. Each study enrolls patients with certain conditions and symptoms. If you fit the guidelines for a trial, you may be able to participate. In some instances, you may be required to undergo certain tests to confirm your acceptance.' "
What Is it Like To Participate in a Breast Cancer Clinical Trial?,"'All patients face a new world of medical terms and procedures. Fears and myths of ""experimentation"" or ""being a guinea pig"" are common concerns of patients who are thinking about participating in a clinical trial.'""Even though there are always going to be fears of the unknown, understanding what is involved in a clinical trial before agreeing to participate can relieve some of your anxieties. Here's some information that may help ease your concerns:"" The personal information gathered about you during the clinical trial will remain confidential and will not be reported with your name attached. If at any time during the study your physician feels it is in your best interest to quit, you will be free to do so. This will not in any way affect your future treatment. Clinical trial participants typically receive their care in the same places that the standard treatments are given - in clinics or physician's offices. Clinical trial participants will be watched closely, and data on their case will be carefully recorded and reviewed."

Grayson, MD, WebMD, February 2004.''Portions of this page copyright © The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2004' What is the purpose of the clinical trial? What kinds of tests and treatments does the clinical trial involve? How are these tests given? What is likely to happen in my case with, or without, this new research treatment? (Are there standard treatment options for my case, and how does the study compare with them?) How could the clinical trial affect my daily life? What side effects can I expect from the clinical trial? (Note: There can also be side effects from standard treatments and from the disease itself.) How long will the clinical trial last? Will the clinical trial require extra time on my part? Will I have to be hospitalized? If so, how often and for how long? If I agree to withdraw from the clinical trial, will my care be affected? Will I need to change physicians?"
Introduction,"'Breast cancer'' is the most common ''cancer'' in ''pregnant'' women and tends to affect women in their mid-30s. Although only about 1 in every 1,000 pregnant women get ''breast cancer'', the disease can be devastating to both the mother and her child -- so it is essential that pregnant women and their doctors continue to do routine breast exams and thoroughly investigate any suspicious lumps.'""A major problem is that a lot of changes take place in a woman's breasts during ""'pregnancy''. This makes it harder to identify suspicious lumps. In addition, ''breast cancer'' tumors in pregnant women are often larger and more advanced by the time they are detected than lumps in women of the same age who are not pregnant.' "
How is breast cancer diagnosed in pregnant women?,"'The best thing you can do while pregnant is to see your obstetrician regularly. These doctor visits, called ''prenatal'' (or ""before birth"") visits, are very important in keeping both you and your baby in the best possible health. During these visits, your obstetrician will perform a breast examination to check for suspicious breast changes.''It is also important to regularly perform breast exams on yourself. Your doctor or nurse can teach you how to do this properly.''If a suspicious lump is found, your doctor will likely ask you to get a ''mammogram'' or an ''ultrasound''. As in all procedures that expose you to ''radiation'' when you are pregnant, the technicians will take extra care to shield your baby from radiation during the mammogram.''If the lump is still suspicious after these tests, the doctor will usually perform a biopsy. In fact, your doctor will often recommend that you get a biopsy even if the initial tests come back negative. During the biopsy, a small sample of the suspicious tissue will be removed with a needle or by making a small cut. This sample is then thoroughly examined using a microscope and other methods to detect any ''cancer'' cells.' "
What if I do have cancer? Will I have to lose my baby?,"""First of all, abortion of the baby does not improve the mother's chances of surviving the ""'cancer''.''Second, there is no evidence that breast cancer can harm the baby. What can harm the baby are some of the treatments for breast cancer -- and these depend on how far advanced the cancer is. This is another reason why it is so important to detect these and other ''cancers'' early.''If the cancer is still in the early stages (Stage I or II), the doctor will most likely recommend that you have surgery to remove either the suspicious lump (''lumpectomy'') or the affected breast (''mastectomy''). During the operation, the surgeon will examine the ''lymph nodes'' to see whether any are affected and will (usually) remove the lymph nodes where the cancer is most likely to have spread. If is it necessary to give ''chemotherapy'', your doctor will usually wait until after the ''first trimester'' to reduce the chances that it will harm the baby.'""If the cancer is more advanced (Stage III or IV), the situation can become very complicated. If radiation is needed to treat the cancer, it can be very hard to protect the baby. Additionally, these cancers usually require both surgery and chemotherapy, so the risk of harming the baby is much higher. There have been instances where the cancer is advanced to the point where any treatment is not likely to add more than a year or two to the woman's life. In these cases, whether or not to undergo the treatment and risk harming the baby can be an agonizing decision for both the woman and her family."" "
Can I breastfeed my baby if I have breast cancer?,"'Breastfeeding'' while you have breast cancer will not harm your baby. Moreover, there is no evidence that stopping your flow of ''breast milk'' will improve your cancer.''However, if you are undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, you should not breastfeed because these powerful chemotherapy ''drugs'' can travel through your breast milk to the baby.' "
"I had breast cancer, but I have been successfully treated for it. Is it OK for me to get pregnant? Will this harm either me or my baby?","'Some doctors feel that postponing pregnancy for two years or so after being treated for breast cancer will make it less likely that your cancer will come back while you are pregnant, and lead to the problems discussed earlier in this section.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center.''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, WebMD, February 2004.''Portions of this page © The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2005' "
How Do I Know There Is A Recurrence?,"""If you've been treated for ""'breast cancer'', you should continue to practice breast self-examination, checking both the treated area and your other breast each month. You should report any changes to your doctor right away. Breast changes that might indicate a recurrence include:''In addition to performing monthly ''breast self-exams'', keep your scheduled follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider. During these appointments, your healthcare provider will perform a breast exam, order lab or imaging tests as needed, and ask you about any symptoms you might have. Initially, these follow-up appointments may be scheduled every three to four months. The longer you are ''cancer'""-free, the less often you will need to see your healthcare provider. Continue to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations on screening mammograms (usually recommended once a year)."" An area that is distinctly different from any other area on either breast 
 Lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm that persists through the menstrual cycle
 A change in the size, shape, or contour of the breast 
 A mass or lump, which may feel as small as a pea 
 A marble-like area under the skin 
 A change in the feel or appearance of the skin on the breast or nipple, including skin that is dimpled, puckered, scaly, or inflamed (red, warm or swollen) 
 Bloody or clear fluid discharge from the nipples 
 Redness of the skin on the breast or nipple "
What Factors Determine The Likelihood Of A Recurrence?,"'Prognostic indicators are characteristics of a patient and her ''tumor'' that may help a physician predict a ''cancer'' recurrence. These are some common indicators:' Lymph node involvement. Women who have lymph node involvement are more likely to have a recurrence. 
 Tumor size. In general, the larger the tumor, the greater the chance of recurrence. 
 Hormone receptors. About two-thirds of all breast cancers contain significant levels of estrogen receptors, which means the tumors are estrogen receptor positive (ER+). ER-positive tumors tend to grow less aggressively and may respond favorably to treatment with hormones. 
 Histologic grade. This term refers to how much the tumor cells resemble normal cells when viewed under the microscope; the grading scale is 1 to 4. Grade 4 tumors contain very abnormal and rapidly growing cancer cells. The higher the histologic grade, the greater chance of recurrence. 
 Nuclear grade. This is the rate at which cancer cells in the tumor divide to form more cells. Cancer cells with a high nuclear grade (also called proliferative capacity) are usually more aggressive (faster growing). 
 Oncogene expression. An oncogene is a gene that causes or promotes cancerous changes within the cell. Tumors that contain certain oncogenes may increase a patient's chance of recurrence. "
How Will My Prognosis Affect My Treatment?,"'Following surgery or ''radiation'', your treatment team will determine the likelihood that the cancer will recur outside the breast. This team usually includes a medical oncologist, a specialist trained in using medicines to treat breast cancer. The medical oncologist, who works with your surgeon, may advise the use of ''tamoxifen'' (tamoxifen citrate, ''Nolvadex'') or possibly ''chemotherapy''. These treatments are used in addition to, but not in place of, local breast cancer treatment with surgery and/or ''radiation therapy''.' "
How Would A Recurrence Be Treated?,"'The type of treatment for local breast cancer recurrences depends on your initial treatment. If you had a ''lumpectomy'', local recurrence is usually treated with mastectomy, since radiation therapy cannot be delivered twice to the same area. If the initial treatment was mastectomy, recurrence near the mastectomy site is treated by removing the tumor whenever possible, usually followed by radiation therapy.''In either case, ''hormone therapy'' and/or chemotherapy may be used after surgery and/or radiation therapy. If breast cancer is found in the other breast, it may be a new tumor unrelated to the first breast cancer. Treatment would include a lumpectomy or mastectomy and possibly systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy).''Women with distant recurrence involving organs such as the bones, lungs, brain, or other organs are treated with systemic therapy. Radiation therapy or surgery may also be recommended to relieve certain symptoms.''Immunotherapy with ''trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') alone or with chemotherapy may be recommended for women whose cancer cells have high levels of the HER2/neu protein. Immunotherapy is generally started after hormonal or chemotherapy are no longer effective.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic  Taussig Cancer Center.''Edited by  Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, February 2004.''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic''  2000-2004' "
Breast Cancer and Genetic Testing Introduction,"'Intensive ''genetic counseling'' is required before undergoing genetic tests for ''breast cancer''. During this educational counseling session, the health care provider can fully explain the benefits and risks of genetic testing and answer any questions you may have.''You will also be required to sign a consent form prior to participating in any genetic tests. The form is an agreement between you and your doctor, showing that you have discussed the test and how its results might affect your family.''Here are some questions to consider when thinking about genetic testing:' Am I prepared to cope with the result? Are my family members also prepared, including my children and my spouse? What are my goals for testing? How would I use my test results? What will I do differently if the results are positive, or if they are negative? Whom will I share my results with? Would a positive test result change relationships with my family?"
What Happens During Genetic Testing?,"""Most importantly, you'll need to obtain a family pedigree to determine if there is a ""'cancer'' development pattern within your family. A family pedigree is a chart that shows the genetic ''makeup'"" of a person's ancestors, and is used to analyze ""'inherited'' characteristics or diseases within a family.''After outlining the family pedigree, a blood test can be given to determine if you have a ''breast cancer gene''. Keep in mind that the vast majority of ''breast cancer'' cases are not associated with a ''breast cancer'' gene. In addition, scientists do not know all of the genes that can cause breast ''cancer'', so doctors can only test you for the known genes.''When someone with a ''cancer'' diagnosis and a family history of the disease has been tested and found to have an altered ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' gene, the family is said to have a ""known mutation."" If an association between the development of breast cancer and a breast cancer gene is made, then all family members willing to participate in genetic testing are asked to give a sample of blood. For many people, knowing their test results is important, because this information may help to guide future health care decisions for themselves and their families.' "
How Do I Interpret the Genetic Test Results?,"'A negative genetic test means that a breast cancer gene mutation was not identified. If genetic testing has previously identified a mutation in your family, then a negative test means you do not carry the specific mutation that was identified in your family. Therefore, you would have the same risk as the general population. If a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has not been previously found in your family, a negative result should be interpreted cautiously.''In such cases, there is still a chance you are at an increased risk to develop breast cancer due to potential mutations in genes other than those we currently can test for.''A positive test result means that a mutation known to increase the risk of breast and ''ovarian cancer'' was identified. Knowing your cancer risk may help guide important health care decisions for you and your family.' "
Should I Be Tested for Genetic Mutations?,"'You may want to discuss genetic testing with your doctor if any of the following scenarios apply to you:' You have two or more blood relatives -- mother, sister, aunt, cousin, or daughter -- with premenopausal breast cancer or ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age. You have been diagnosed with breast cancer, especially if it was diagnosed before you reached menopause, you have a blood relative with breast or ovarian cancer, or if you cancer in both breasts. You have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and you have blood relatives who have had ovarian or breast cancer.  You are related to someone (male or female) who has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. You are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and you have blood relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer, or you have had breast or ovarian cancer."
"What Are my Options if I Have a ""Cancer Gene?""","'Women in high-risk categories (first-degree relative with breast cancer, personal history of breast cancer, prior abnormal ''breast biopsy'' results with atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular ''carcinoma in situ'') and carriers of the genes associated with breast cancer may want to consider starting regular breast ''cancer screening'' at age 25 or 10 years earlier than the age of the youngest person with breast cancer at the time of their diagnosis.''Some women choose preventive (prophylactic) ''mastectomy'"" to decrease the chances of developing breast cancer, although this doesn't offer complete protection.""'Another approach includes using the anti-estrogen drug ''tamoxifen'' or ''raloxifene'' (also known as ''Evista''), a drug used to treat ''osteoporosis'', to help prevent development of breast cancer.' "
What Are the Potential Problems With Genetic Testing?,"'Genetic testing is not 100% accurate. If a test is negative, a person still has a chance of developing breast cancer. If the test is positive, there is still a 15% to 20% chance of not developing breast cancer.''Genetic testing is costly, ranging from about $200 to more than $2,000, depending on the type of test. Insurance policies vary in providing coverage for genetic testing.'""The results of genetic tests won't be available for several weeks. The length of time it takes to get results depends on the tests performed and under what circumstances they are done.""'Genetic testing is highly controversial in society today, and legislation has been enacted to protect individuals who may have a genetic risk of developing cancer from employment and insurance problems. The best course of action a person can take is to become involved with an established genetic registry that can counsel individuals with a genetic risk for cancer.' "
What Are the Benefits of Genetic Testing?,"'For some women, the benefits of genetic testing include the ability to make informed medical and lifestyle decisions while reducing the ''anxiety'' of not knowing their genetic background. Another benefit is the ability to make a proactive decision regarding prophylactic surgery. In addition, many women are able to participate in medical research that may in the long run decrease their risk of death from breast cancer.' "
What About My Privacy?,"'The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 prevents insurance companies from denying health insurance based on genetic information, and prevents them from using genetic information to demonstrate that a health condition existed before application was made for insurance. In addition, many states have passed laws or have legislation pending to address insurance concerns.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What are the initial signs and symptoms of breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer'' is a disease in which cells in the breast grow uncontrollably and destroy the normal cells. When ''breast cancer'' spreads to other parts of the body, it is called metastasized ''cancer''. The initial signs of breast ''cancer'' include:' A lump in the breast or underarms is often the first sign. It may also be associated with pain, itching and tenderness. Changes in the nipple area, nipple retraction and inverted nipple are common warning signs of breast cancer. Bleeding from the nipple may be limited and difficult to see, but if an individual notices bloodstains on bra and if the secretions are unusual, bloody or continuous, the individual may need urgent medical attention.  Change in color and/or thickening of the skin on the breast is a warning sign of breast cancer. If the breast skin changes color, typically to a pink or reddish hue that covers more than half of the breast, you need to show your doctor. A nonhealing sore anywhere on the breast, including the nipple with or without blood or fluid from the nipple, maybe a warning sign of breast cancer.  Increased warmth in the breast with change in size and appearance of the breast is a sign of breast cancer. "
How can we detect breast cancer in the early stage?,"'Regular mammograms can help an individual detect breast cancer in early stages. ''Mammogram'' is a screening test that usually detects breast cancer when it’s about one-quarter inch in size or smaller. Mammograms can also diagnose some early ''precancerous'' conditions and early-stage ''cancers'' that appear as tiny calcifications (microcalcifications) on ''mammography'' but are not detectable by physical examination. There are two types of mammogram:' Screening mammogram: It is usually performed annually in cases where there is no known problem. Diagnostic mammogram: It is performed when there is a known problem that requires careful evaluation. Diagnostic mammograms provide much more extensive images than screening mammograms, such as views from additional angles and compression or blow-up views. Often, an ultrasound will be performed in addition to the mammogram if there is a palpable lump.  Screening ultrasound and biopsy of the lump are performed when the lump is noticed and to confirm if the lump is cancer or aggressive. "
What are the different stages of breast cancer?,"'The stages of breast cancer are as follows:' Stage 0: Doctors consider breast cancer at this stage noninvasive, and it is only present in the ducts or the lobules. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a form of stage 0 breast cancer. Stage 1: Breast cancer at this stage is invasive, but it remains small and near the primary site. Stage 1A involves tumors that are 2 cm or smaller and have not reached the lymph nodes. At stage 1B, the cancer has reached the lymph nodes. Stage 2: Stage 2 breast cancers are invasive. Tumors may be larger than that in stage 1 and the cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 3: Stage 3 breast cancer is invasive, tumors may be larger and cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, possibly to several lymph nodes. Breast cancer at this stage has not spread to further organs. Stage 4: Breast cancer has developed in other areas of the body outside the breast and lymph nodes, often in the bones, lungs, brain or liver. Treatment at this stage focuses on controlling the cancer and preventing it from spreading any farther."
Introduction,"'Younger women generally do not consider themselves to be at risk for ''breast cancer''. Only 5 percent of all ''breast cancer'' cases occur in women under 40 years old. However, ''breast cancer'' can strike at any age, and all women should be aware of their personal risk factors for breast ''cancer''. (A risk factor is a condition or behavior that puts a person at risk for developing a disease.)''There are several factors that put a woman at high risk for developing breast ''cancer'', including:''Risk factors include:''An extended use of ''oral contraceptives'' (''the Pill'') later in life is also sometimes considered a factor for developing breast cancer. However, this is still subject to much debate in the medical community.' A personal history of breast cancer or non-cancerous breast disease A family history of breast cancer, particularly in a mother, daughter or sister History of radiation therapy Evidence of a specific genetic defect (BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation). Women who carry defects on either of these genes are at greater risk for developing breast cancer. A Gail Index score of at least 1.7% (The Gail Index uses risk factors such as age, family history of breast cancer, age of first menstrual period and first pregnancy, and number of breast biopsies to calculate a woman's risk of developing breast cancer within the next five years.)"
What Is Different About Breast Cancer in Younger Women?,"""Diagnosing breast cancer in younger women (under 40 years old) is more difficult because their breast tissue is generally more dense than the breast tissue in older women. By the time a lump in a younger woman's breast can be felt, the cancer often is advanced.""'In addition, breast cancer in younger women may be aggressive and less likely to respond to treatment . Women who are diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age are more likely to have a mutated (altered) BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.''Delays in diagnosing breast cancer also are a problem. Many younger women who have breast cancer ignore the warning signs -- such as a ''breast lump'' or unusual discharge -- because they believe they are too young to get breast cancer.''Many women assume they are too young to get breast cancer and tend to assume a lump is a harmless ''cyst'' or other growth. Some health care providers also dismiss ''breast lumps'' in young women as ''cysts'' and adopt a ""wait and see"" approach.' "
Can Breast Cancer in Younger Women Be Prevented?,"""Although breast cancer may not be prevented, early detection and prompt treatment can significantly improve a woman's chances of surviving breast cancer. More than 90% of women whose breast cancer is found in an early stage will survive.""'When women learn at a young age about the risks and benefits of detecting breast cancer early, they are more likely to following the recommendations regarding clinical exams and mammograms . Young women also need to understand their risk factors and be able to discuss breast health with their health care providers.' "
Should Women Under Age 40 Get Mammograms?,"'In general, regular mammograms are not recommended for women under 40 years old, in part, because breast tissue tends to be more dense in young women, making mammograms less effective as a screening tool. In addition, most experts believe the low risk of developing breast cancer at a young age does not justify the ''radiation'' exposure or the cost of ''mammography''. However, screening mammograms may be recommended for younger women with a family history of breast cancer and other risk factors.' "
What's the Best Way for Younger Women to Screen for Breast Cancer?,"'The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that all women 20 years of age or older should perform monthly breast self-examinations . The best time to perform BSE is the day after your monthly period ends. Becoming familiar with the look and feel of their breasts offers the best chance for a young woman to notice and change.''In addition to monthly BSE, annual clinical breast exams performed by your doctor are recommended for all women beginning at age 20. Annual screening mammograms also are recommended at age 40. Women younger than 40 who have a family history or other risk factors for breast cancer should discuss their risk and an appropriate screening schedule with their health care providers.' "
How Is Breast Cancer Treated in Younger Women?,"""The course of treatment for breast cancer at any age is based on the extent of the person's disease (whether or not it has spread beyond the breast), as well as the woman's general health and personal circumstances.""'Treatment options include surgery: either a ''lumpectomy'', which involves removing the lump and some surrounding tissue, or a ''mastectomy'', which is the removal of a breast.''Radiation therapy is generally used following a lumpectomy, and ''chemotherapy'' and/or ''hormone therapy'' often are recommended after surgery to help destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent recurrence.''Breast cancer poses other challenges for younger women, as well, such as sexuality, ''fertility'' and pregnancy after breast cancer treatment.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center.''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, WebMD, February 2004.''Portions of this page © The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2005' "
What are the biological causes of breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer cells, like all cancers, initially develop because of defects in the genetic material deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a single cell. The ''human body'' is composed of trillions of cells. Inside the inner core (nucleus) of each cell is our DNA, located on chromosomes. Every human cell has two sets of 23 chromosomes. Each set is inherited from one parent. DNA exists as long, spiraled strands on these chromosomes. Different segments along the DNA strands contain information for various genes. Genes are blueprints that provide genetic instructions for the growth, development, and behavior of every cell. Most genes carry instructions for the types and the amount of proteins, enzymes, and other substances produced by the cells. Genes also govern the sizes and the shapes of the organs by controlling the rate of division of the cells within these organs. (During cell division, a cell makes a duplicate copy of its chromosomes and then divides into two cells.) Some genes restrict cell division and limit tissue growth.''Defects on the DNA strands can lead to gene coding errors, which in turn can cause diseases. When genes that normally restrict cell growth and divisions are absent or defective, the affected cells can divide and multiply without restraint. The cells that divide and multiply without restraint enlarge (forming a ''tumor'') and can also invade adjacent tissues and organs. Sometimes these cells can further break away and migrate to distant parts of the body in a process called ''metastasis''. The ability to multiply without restraint, the tendency to invade other organs, and the ability to ''metastasize'' to other parts of the body are the key characteristics of ''cancers -- characteristics'' that are due to DNA defects.''The cancer-causing DNA defects can be acquired at birth (inherited) or may develop during adult life. The inherited DNA defects are present in every cell of the body. On the other hand, DNA defects that develop during adult life are confined to the descendants (products of cell divisions) of the single affected cell. Generally, inherited DNA defects have a greater tendency to cause cancers and cancers that occur earlier in life than DNA defects that develop during adult life.''Research has shown that 5%-10% of breast cancers are associated with mutations (defects) in two genes known as breast cancer-associated (BRCA) genes, ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2''. These genes function to prevent abnormal cell growth that could lead to cancer. Every cell in the body has two BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, one inherited from each parent. A woman who has received one defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene from one parent and a healthy gene from the other is called a carrier of the defective BRCA gene. Even though only one healthy BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene is needed to help prevent cancerous growth of cells, the one remaining healthy BRCA gene is vulnerable to damage during adult life by environmental factors such as toxins, ''radiation'', and other chemicals such as free radicals. Therefore, women bearing a defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are at an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. Women carrying defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes also tend to develop these cancers earlier in life.''Other rare genetic mutations are also associated with an increased risk for the development of breast cancer, including mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53, the PTEN gene, the PALB2 gene, and the ATM (''ataxia-telangiectasia'' mutation) gene.''Since inherited DNA defects account for only 5%-10% of breast cancers, the majority of breast cancers are due to DNA damage that develops during adult life. Environmental factors that can cause DNA damage include free radicals, chemicals, radiation, and certain toxins. But even among individuals without inherited cancer-causing DNA defects, their vulnerability to DNA damage, their ability to repair DNA damage, and their ability to destroy cells with DNA damage, are likely to be genetically inherited. This is probably why the risk of cancer is higher among first-degree relatives of breast cancer patients, even among families that do not carry the defective BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor-suppressing genes.''Some of the errors in the normal control mechanisms allow the accumulation of additional errors in other parts of the system. These errors may lead to gene silencing of critical control genes or the over activity of other growth-stimulating genes by activation of promoter sites adjacent to these otherwise normal genes.''Other substances such as estrogen (a female hormone) and certain fatty acids may also increase the risk of breast cancer by stimulating the growth and division of cells of the breast tissue.' "
"Gender, age, family history and previous breast cancer risk factors","'Age and gender ''are the most significant breast ''cancer risk factors'' are gender and age. Men can develop breast cancer, but women are 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer than men. The risk of breast cancer also increases with age. Breast cancer is 400 times more common in women who are 50 years old as compared to those who are 20 years old.''Family history:'' an important risk factor is having first-degree relatives (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer or male relatives with ''prostate cancer'"". The risk is especially higher if both the mother and sister have had breast cancers, if the cancers in first-degree relatives occurred early in life (before age 50), or if the cancers in these relatives were found in both breasts. Having a male relative with breast cancer and having both relatives with breast and ovarian cancers also increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. Families with multiple members with other cancers may have a genetic defect leading to a higher risk of breast ""'cancer.''Previous breast cancer:'' Women who have inherited defective BRCA1, BRCA2, p53, and other DNA repair genes have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, sometimes at early ages, as discussed previously. But even in the absence of one of the known predisposing genetic defects, a strong family history may signify an increased risk because of genetic or environmental factors that are specific to that particular family. For example, increased risk in families could be due to exposure to similar environmental toxins in some cases.''A woman with a history of breast cancer can develop a recurrence of the same breast cancer years later if the cancer cells had already spread to the ''lymph nodes'' or other parts of the body or if cancer cells were not all eliminated during treatment. A woman with previous breast cancer also has a three- to fourfold greater chance of developing another breast cancer in the opposite breast. In women who have been treated for breast cancer with breast conservation therapy (BCT), recurrence of cancer within the treated breast may also occur.' "
"Hormonal factors, alcohol, and hormonal risk factors","'Hormonal factors:''\xa0Women who started their menstrual periods before age 12, those who have late ''menopause'' (after age 55), and those who had their first ''pregnancy'' after age 30, or who have never had children have a mildly increased risk of developing breast cancer (less than two times the normal risk). Early onset of menses, late arrival of ''menopause'', and late or no ''pregnancies'"" are all factors that increase a woman's lifetime level of estrogen exposure. Some studies have suggested that ""'breastfeeding'"" may slightly lower a woman's breast cancer risk, especially if a woman breastfeeds for one and a half to two years.""'The use of ''hormone therapy'' (HT) after ''menopause'', particularly ''estrogens'' and ''progesterone'' combined, leads to an increase in risk for development of breast cancer in women who are taking HT or who have recently used HT. This risk appears to return to normal if a woman has not used hormone therapy for five years or more. Similarly, some studies show that ''oral contraceptives'' (''birth control pills'') cause a small increased risk of breast cancer, but this risk also returns to normal after 10 years of nonuse. The decision whether to use hormone therapy or ''birth control pills'' involves weighing the risks versus the benefits and should be individualized after consulting your doctor.''Alcohol'':'' The consumption of alcohol is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, and this risk increases with the amount of alcohol consumed. Compared with nondrinkers, women who consume one alcoholic drink a day have a very small increase in risk. However, those who have two to five ''drinks'' daily have about one and a half times the risk of women who drink no alcohol.''Lifestyle factors:'' Dietary factors such as high-fat diets and alcohol consumption have also been implicated as factors that increase the risk for breast cancer. Despite rumors to the contrary, ''caffeine'' intake, antiperspirant use, bras, ''breast implants'', miscarriages or abortions, and ''stress'' do not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer. It is important to remember that 75% of women who develop breast cancer have no risk factors other than age. Thus, screening and early detection are important to every woman regardless of the presence of risk factors.' "
"Other breast conditions, biopsies, fibroadenoma, and radiation therapy risk factors","'Other breast conditions:'' Even though most women with fibrocystic breasts and its related breast symptoms do not have increased risk of developing breast cancer, the lumpy texture and density of the breasts may hamper ''early cancer detection'' by breast examination or by ''mammography''. Sometimes, women with fibrocystic breast changes have to undergo breast biopsies (obtaining small tissue samples from the breast for examination under a microscope) to make certain that palpable lumps or suspicious areas on a ''mammogram'' are not cancerous.''Breast biopsies'' sometimes may reveal abnormal, though not yet cancerous, cell changes (called atypical hyperplasia). Women with atypical hyperplasia of the breast tissue have about a four- to five-fold enhanced likelihood of developing breast cancer. Some other benign cell changes in breast tissue are also associated with a slight increase (one and a half to two times normal) in risk. These are termed hyperplasia of breast tissue without atypia, sclerosing adenosis, fibroadenoma with complex features, and solitary papilloma.''Fibroadenoma: ''The common benign breast tumor known as a fibroadenoma, unless it has unusual features under the microscope, does not confer an increased cancer risk.''Breast cancer risks can be additive. ''For example, women who have first-degree relatives with breast cancer and who also have atypical hyperplasia of the breast tissue have a much higher risk of developing breast cancer than women without these risk factors.''Radiation therapy'':'"" Women with a history of radiation therapy to the chest area as treatment for another cancer (such as Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'') have a significantly increased risk for breast cancer, particularly if the radiation treatment was received at a young age.' "
What is the importance of early breast cancer detection?,"'The various types of cancers behave differently, with distinct rates of growth and patterns of spreading (metastasis) to other areas of the body. Some cancers are ""favorable"" and treatable, while others are highly aggressive.''Compared to other cancers, breast cancer is on the more treatable end of the spectrum if diagnosed early. It is considered a ""favorable"" cancer because it can be detected early by breast examination or by mammography. ''Pancreatic cancer'', for example, is on the lethal end of the spectrum of cancers. ''Pancreatic cancer'' is often difficult to detect until it is very far advanced.''Studies have clearly shown that the smaller the size of the breast cancer when detected, the better the chance of a surgical cure and long-term survival. The likelihood of a cure is also higher if the cancer is removed before it has spread to lymph nodes and other organs such as the ''lungs'', ''liver'', bones, and brain.''Currently, mammography and breast examinations serve as the foundation for screening for breast cancer. It is extremely important for a woman to have regular breast examinations as well as mammograms to detect early breast cancer.' "
What are the advantages and limitations of mammography?,"'Mammography is an X-ray examination of the breast that has the ability to detect a cancer in the breast when it is quite small, long before it may be felt by breast examination. Approximately 85%-90% of all breast cancers are detectable by mammography. Early detection by mammography has reduced the mortality rate from breast cancer by 20%-30% in women over 50 years of age.''However, some 10%-15% of breast cancers are not visible on mammography but can be felt on physical examination of the breast. Therefore, a normal mammogram does not exclude the possibility of breast cancer. Several studies have supported that a combination of mammography and routine breast examination is better than either modality alone. Breast examination by a health care professional by palpation and visual inspection is important. During a routine physical checkup, a doctor can conduct an examination of the breast.' "
How frequently should women undergo mammography and breast examinations?,"'The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that all women begin having yearly mammograms by age 45 and have mammograms every other year (or keep having them yearly) beginning at age 55. The ACS also recommends that women should have the choice to start having yearly mammograms as early as age 40 if they want to do so.''In women with ""''lumpy breasts''"" or breast symptoms, and also in women with a high risk of developing breast cancer, sometimes a baseline mammogram at an earlier age is recommended. This recommendation is somewhat controversial, and there are other viewpoints.''However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine mammography screening for women before 50 years of age and suggests that screening end at 74 years of age.''The USPSTF recommendations are in opposition to other existing breast cancer screening guidelines from organizations such as the American Cancer Society as described above. The USPSTF guidelines also recommend a screening interval of two years and suggest that women 40 to 49 years old who are at high risk for breast cancer consult with their doctor regarding the time to begin regular screening mammography.''It is important for women who are concerned about when to begin mammography to discuss the situation with their health care professional. He or she can help their patient make an informed decision about breast cancer screening that is appropriate for their individual situation.''Mammograms and young women''There is a special issue regarding mammograms in young women. Since young women have dense glandular breast tissue, routine mammograms have difficulty ""seeing through"" the dense breast tissue. Therefore mammograms may not be able to detect cancer in the breast because the dense breast tissue around the cancer obscures it. However, this problem can be partly offset by the use of special breast ''ultrasound'', which is now an extremely important additional imaging technique used to supplement mammography in difficult cases. Ultrasound can make visible a lump hidden within dense breast tissue. It may also detect lumps and early breast cancers when mammograms fail to identify a problem. Ultrasound can also help doctors locate specific areas in the breast for biopsy (obtain small samples of tissue to study under a microscope). Sometimes doctors also suggest the use of ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') screening (see below) in younger women with dense breast tissue.''Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning''Research has shown that MRI scanning may be a useful screening tool for breast cancer in certain high-risk populations. The routine use of MRI, however, has many limitations. While it enabled the detection of some tumors in high-risk women, it also detected more noncancerous lesions (false-positives), which lead to many more follow-up examinations and potentially unnecessary surgeries. In fact, MRI led to twice as many unnecessary examinations and three times as many unneeded surgical biopsies of the breast than screening by mammography alone. MRI is also approximately 10 times more costly (average cost $1,000 to $1,500) than mammography.''Because of these limitations, experts believe that screening with MRI is impractical for women who do not have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. However, its benefits appear to outweigh its limitations in certain high-risk populations.''The American Cancer Society recommends that women at high risk for breast cancer (greater than 20% lifetime risk) should get an MRI and a mammogram every year. Women at moderately increased risk (15%-20% lifetime risk) should talk with their doctors about the benefits and limitations of adding MRI screening.''Women at high risk for developing breast cancer include those who''Women with significant risk factors may want to discuss their screening program with their physician to better determine whether MRI may be useful in their own case.''It is important to note that MRI should not be considered a substitute for regular mammography, and mammography is the only screening tool for which a reduction in mortality (death rate) from breast cancer has been proven.''Breast self-examination and breast examinations by a doctor''Both the American Cancer Society and the USPSTF do not call for regular self-examination of the breasts in their guidelines. The ACS states that breast self-exam is optional, while the USPSTF states that doctors should not teach women to do breast self-examination. Studies have not shown a clear benefit of regular physical breast exams done by a health professional (clinical breast exams) or ''breast self-exams''. There is very little proof to suggest that these tests can help detect breast cancer early when women get screening mammograms. However, women should be familiar with how their breasts normally look and feel and report any changes they notice in their breasts to a health care provider.'   have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, indicative of a strong inherited risk of breast cancer; have a first-degree relative with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation but have not been tested for the mutation; received chest radiation -- to treat Hodgkin's disease or other cancers, for example -- between 10 and 30 years of age; or have Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, or have first-degree relatives with one of these syndromes."
What is the risk of radiation with repeated mammography screening over the years?,"'With modern mammography equipment, the amount of radiation exposure is extremely small. Although there is no level of radiation without some theoretical risk, there is no evidence of increased breast cancer risks from mammography performed in the recommended manner. Furthermore, the benefits of early detection far outweigh these theoretical concerns.' "
How helpful are BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic tests in identifying women at risk?,"'In special circumstances, genetic tests can be very helpful both in identifying exceptionally high-risk patients and reducing the level of concern for others. We also now know that the presence of one of these genetic defects does not cause cancer in every patient.'""Before genetic tests are conducted, individuals being tested must have thorough counseling. A clear understanding of the limitations of the tests and the problems they may pose must precede the testing. The patient must know the meaning of the possible results, whichever way they may turn out, before testing. They should also have settled on a plan for each possible outcome of the test results. Often, the best way to evaluate a potential genetic risk is to test a relative who has already been diagnosed with breast cancer. If the relative's genetic testing (which must cover a large number of possible mutations) proves negative, then there is no need to perform genetic testing on the concerned individual. But the concerned individual should still undergo close monitoring with breast examinations and mammograms. If the test is positive on the relative, then that specific mutation is the only one that needs to be checked in the concerned individual and the other family members.""  "
SERM and tamoxifen medications for breast cancer treatment,"'Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and its effect of estrogen on breast cell growth:'' A selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) is a chemical that is designed to act like estrogen in certain tissue such as the bones and not like estrogen in other tissue such as the breast. The use of SERMs takes advantage of the benefits of estrogen while trying to avoid the risks associated with estrogen. Two SERMs, ''tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex'') and ''raloxifene'' (''Evista''), have been used as preventive treatment. The advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed in more detail below.''Tamoxifen:'' Tamoxifen is the first SERM to receive approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of breast cancer. Some breast cancer cells are ""estrogen sensitive,"" meaning they possess so-called estrogen receptors and need estrogen to grow and divide. But estrogen has to bind to the receptors of these cancer cells in order to stimulate them. Binding of estrogen to the receptors is analogous to fitting a key into a lock. Tamoxifen blocks the action of estrogen on the cancer cells by occupying the receptors (the locks), thus preventing estrogen (the keys) from fitting into the receptors. Blocking estrogen from the estrogen-sensitive cancer cells stops the growth and multiplication of these cells. Tamoxifen (in higher than usual doses) may also possess other properties that cause the death of breast cancer cells that are not estrogen sensitive.''Tamoxifen has been used to treat both advanced and early stage breast cancers. This drug has also proven valuable to women who have had cancer in one breast in reducing the chances of developing cancer in the second breast.''Even though tamoxifen behaves like an anti-estrogen agent in breast tissue, it acts like a weak estrogen in the bones. Thus, tamoxifen may have some benefit in preventing ''osteoporosis'' ''fractures'' in ''postmenopausal'' women.''Tamoxifen also decreases ''cysts'' and lumps in the breasts, especially among younger women. Fewer cysts and lumps make early detection by breast examinations and mammograms easier. This use of the drug would only be in extreme situations and is not an approved use.''Primary ''prevention'' of breast cancer with tamoxifen''The term ""primary prevention"" means trying to reduce the risks of developing breast cancer in women without a prior history of breast cancer. Tamoxifen not only blocks the action of estrogen on estrogen-sensitive cancer cells, but it also blocks estrogen from acting on cells that are not cancerous. Therefore, by reducing the growth and division of normal breast cells, tamoxifen decreases the population of cells that can develop cancer-causing DNA damage.''In the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) P-1 clinical trial, more than 13,000 women considered at high risk for developing breast cancer were given either tamoxifen or a placebo for five years. The women receiving tamoxifen developed 49% fewer breast cancers than women receiving the placebo. A further study, the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS-I) in Europe, also confirmed a reduction in the rate of breast cancer development in high-risk women.''The United States FDA has approved the use of tamoxifen for primary prevention in women at high risk for developing breast cancer. There is no evidence to suggest that tamoxifen can reduce breast cancer incidence in women considered to have a normal risk for the development of breast cancer.' "
Aromatase inhibitors and surgery for breast cancer treatment," Aromatase inhibitors: Medications, known collectively as aromatase inhibitors, are also used to block the effects of estrogen. Examples of aromatase inhibitors include anastrozole (Arimidex), and exemestane (Aromasin). Their main activity is to inhibit (block) the action of a particular enzyme (aromatase) that creates estrogen from other normally circulating hormones. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, therefore, act differently and have different side effects. Aromatase inhibitor medications are an option for postmenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer. Surgical measures to prevent breast cancer Preventive or prophylactic mastectomy: is the surgical removal of one or both breasts in women who have moderate to high risk of developing breast cancer. Studies have shown that this technique reduces a woman's chance of developing breast cancer by up to 90%. Since small amounts of breast tissue can remain on the chest wall, in the underarm, or even in the abdomen following a mastectomy, it is impossible to completely prevent development of breast cancer by prophylactic mastectomy. Women often choose to have surgical reconstruction of the breasts at the time of surgery. It is very important for a woman considering preventive mastectomy to have a frank discussion with her physician concerning her cancer risk, other available treatments, and the potential complications and implications of the surgery before making a decision. Prophylactic or preventive oophorectomy, or removal of the ovaries, has also been performed in women receiving preventive mastectomies in order to reduce estrogen levels."
What are the risks and side effects of tamoxifen and raloxifene?,"'Risks and side effects of tamoxifen''The risk of tamoxifen is the development of ''uterine cancer''. Although the overall risk of developing uterine cancer is small (probably less than 1%), in the NSABP-P1 trial, more women on tamoxifen developed uterine cancer than women taking the placebo.''Additionally, women over 50 years of age on tamoxifen have a slightly heightened chance of developing ''blood clots'' in the veins of the lower extremities. These blood clots can occasionally break off and travel to cause blockage of blood vessels in the lungs (a process called ''pulmonary embolism''). Symptoms of ''pulmonary embolism'' include ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'', and sometimes ''shock''. Some studies have also reported an increased risk of ''stroke'' in patients taking tamoxifen.''The other side effects of tamoxifen include ''weight gain'', ''hot flashes'', irregular periods, ''vaginal dryness'' or discharge, and a slightly enhanced risk of ''cataracts''.''Many of these side effects also depend on the age group being studied.''Raloxifene''Raloxifene (Evista) is the second SERM to be approved by the FDA. It has been approved for treating and preventing ''osteoporosis'' in postmenopausal women. Data suggest that raloxifene, like tamoxifen, can reduce the chance of developing breat cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women. Unlike tamoxifen, raloxifene does not stimulate cells of the uterus and is not believed to increase the risk of uterine cancer.''Studies that examined the effects of both tamoxifen and raloxifene (including the STAR trial, which studied over 19,000 postmenopausal women at high risk for developing breast cancer) showed that both ''drugs'"" lowered the incidence of breast cancer in a similar manner. While both tamoxifen and raloxifene increased a woman's risk of blood clots, the observed increase was smaller with raloxifene. Raloxifene was also associated with a lower risk of uterine cancer and ""'hysterectomy'' for noncancerous reasons than tamoxifen. However, data suggest that raloxifene is as effective in preventing the development of early, noninvasive cancers as tamoxifen.''Data are not available on the effects of raloxifene in premenopausal women, and it is a potential teratogen, meaning that it may cause harm to the developing fetus. Therefore, raloxifene is limited to use by postmenopausal women and not used in women of childbearing age.' "
Are there other breast cancer prevention measures?,"'Antioxidants''Antioxidants are chemicals that prevent a type of chemical reaction called oxidation. Oxidation is a major source of free radical formation. Antioxidants are considered to be cancer-fighting agents because they mop up the free radicals that are formed. Free radicals are electrically charged chemicals that can attack and damage proteins and DNA, thereby altering genetic information. If enough damage occurs to the DNA segments of a cell that controls cell division and growth, cancer can develop from that single cell. Free radicals can be formed by the normal metabolic activity in the body. However, there is no evidence that dietary intake of antioxidants affects breast cancer risk.''Dietary ''fats''Early epidemiological studies suggested that high-fat diets might be associated with increased risks of breast cancer. But this relationship has not been confirmed, and results of studies have been mixed. Furthermore, it is clear that some fats may be protective rather than harmful. There are, however, some theoretical concerns about eating overcooked meats and fats.''Diet'' and lifestyle measures to reduce breast cancer risk''Theoretically, there are dietary and lifestyle measures that can decrease free-radical formation and reduce the risk of developing breast and other types of cancer. These measures include''Evidence that these measures reduce the chances of developing breast cancer is largely based on epidemiological data. Epidemiological evidence is derived from comparing two large populations with similar characteristics that have different diets or levels of exercise. Epidemiological evidence can only be suggestive, not conclusive. In fact, concrete proof that diet and exercise actually reduce the risk of developing breast cancer will be difficult to attain, and there is no evidence that any breast ''cancer prevention'' diet exists.''When firm scientific data is lacking and is unlikely to be available for the foreseeable future, the doctor has to weigh the risks of his/her recommendations against the potential benefits. Long-term risk and benefit considerations are especially important in advising young, healthy women about preventing a disease that they may or may not develop.''In the case of diets low in fat and overcooked meats, diets high in vegetables and fruits, avoiding ''smoking'', and regular exercise, there is enough known benefit and very little known risk, which makes it easy for doctors to recommend them to their patients.''Doctors are also comfortable with recommending one multivitamin a day. However, there is no clinical evidence that taking megadoses of ''vitamins'' are of any benefit. Megadoses of certain vitamins can have adverse side effects.''Exercise''There is epidemiological data which show that women who exercise regularly have a lower incidence of breast cancer than women who do not exercise. The reason for such a benefit is unknown, but it may be related to the fact that ''obese'' individuals have higher levels of estrogen in the body than people who are not obese. The higher levels of estrogen may increase the risk of breast cancer in obese women.'   diets rich in vegetables and fruits; diets low in fats, and red and overcooked meats; reasonable intake of antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C; and regular exercise and weight control."
What is the link between estrogen and breast cancer?,"""Estrogen is a female hormone that is produced by the ovaries. During the reproductive years, a woman's body is exposed to high levels of estrogen. After menopause, the production of estrogen by the ovaries decreases. Estrogen is sometimes prescribed to treat some of the problems often associated with menopause, such as ""'hot flashes'', ''night sweats'', ''sleeplessness'', and ''vaginal dryness''. Estrogen has the additional benefit of prevention of bone thinning (''osteoporosis''). However, results from a large clinical trial of postmenopausal women receiving hormone therapy (HT) released in 2002 showed that the overall risks of estrogen plus progestin therapy outweighed the benefits of hormone therapy. Combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin was shown to increase the risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and blood clots.''High levels of estrogen over long periods also increase the risk of developing breast and uterine cancer. Estrogen stimulates the cells of the breast and the uterine lining to grow and divide. Breast cells that are actively dividing are believed to have a greater chance of DNA damage as well as a higher number of cells that already have DNA damage. A higher number of cells with DNA damage elevate the risk of cancer development.''Women who have an early onset of their ''menstrual period'' (or menses) and late menopause are more likely to develop breast cancer than women with late menses onset and early menopause. This difference is believed to be attributable to the longer period of estrogen exposure in the first group.' "
Breast cancer prevention tips, There is no absolute or definitive way to prevent breast cancer. Routine screening and early detection remain the most effective ways to reduce breast cancer deaths. But screening does not prevent breast cancer from occurring. Medications are an option for decreasing the likelihood of breast cancer in some women at high risk for developing breast cancer. There is no evidence to suggest that these medications should be used in women with an average risk. Reduction of risk factors can help reduce the risk of developing breast cancer:Maintain a healthy weight.Consume alcohol only in moderation.Get regular physical activity. Maintain a healthy weight. Consume alcohol only in moderation. Get regular physical activity.
Conclusion,"'There are two important aspects in breast cancer prevention: early detection and risk reduction. Screening may identify early noninvasive cancers and allow treatment before they become invasive or identify invasive cancers at an early treatable stage. But screening does not, per se, prevent cancer. Breast cancer prevention really must be understood as risk reduction. In extremely high-risk patients, such as those who have BRCA mutations, risk reduction may involve prophylactic surgical removal of the breasts and ovaries. For the average patient, lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, ''weight loss'') may be easily recommended and have many other benefits. For patients who have an increased risk based on other factors, the use of hormone-blocking agents, in addition to the usual lifestyle recommendations, may also be considered.' "
I may have breast cancer. What questions should I ask my doctor?,"'If you have received a positive or possible diagnosis of ''breast cancer'', there are a number of questions that you can ask your doctor. The answers you receive to these questions should give you a better understanding of your specific diagnosis and the corresponding treatment. It is usually helpful to write your questions down before you meet with your health care provider. This gives you the opportunity to ask all your questions in an organized fashion.''There is much information available online about ''breast cancer''. The reader should make sure to look at reliable and nationally known resources and verify all information with their health care team.''Each question is followed by a brief explanation as to why that particular question is important. We will not attempt to answer these questions in detail here because each individual case is just that, individual. This outline is designed to provide a framework to help you and your family make certain that most of the important questions in ''breast cancer'' diagnosis and treatment have been addressed. As ''cancer'' treatments are constantly evolving, specific recommendations and treatments might change and you should always confer with your treatment team regarding any questions. You obviously should add your own questions and concerns to these when you have a discussion with your doctor.' "
Is the doctor sure I have breast cancer?,"'Certain types of ''cancer'' are relatively easy to identify by standard microscopic evaluation of the tissue. This is generally true for the most common types of breast ''cancer''. This obviously implies that you have had a biopsy (removal of some tissue at the possible cancer site) that was then reviewed by a pathologist.''However, as the search for earlier and rarer forms of breast cancer progresses, it can be difficult to be certain that a particular group of cells is ''malignant'' (cancerous). At the same time, benign conditions may have cells that are somewhat distorted in appearance or pattern of growth (known as atypical cells or atypical hyperplasia). For this reason, it is important that the pathologist reading the slides of your ''breast biopsy'' be experienced in breast pathology. Most pathology groups have multiple pathologists review questionable or troublesome slides. In more difficult cases, the slides will often be sent to recognized specialists with considerable expertise in breast pathology.' "
What difference does a precise breast cancer diagnosis make?,"'The importance of an accurate diagnosis cannot be overstated. It is the precise diagnosis that determines the recommended treatment. Treatment must be specifically tailored to the specific type of breast cancer as well as to the individual patient.'""A doctor should be able to give someone a clear description of the type of breast cancer along with the treatment options that are appropriate to one's case."" "
What has been done to exclude cancer in other areas of the same breast or in my other breast?,"'Unfortunately, there are some patients who may have more than one area of ''malignancy'' in the same breast or even an additional malignancy in the other breast. If this does occur, it can greatly change the recommendations for treatment.''Therefore, it is critically important that your doctors carefully investigate beyond the immediate site of the ''tumor'' to make certain there are no other areas with possible malignancy.''Sometimes discovering these ""secondary"" areas requires careful review of your mammograms. It may also require the addition of special views from different angles and specialized examination of your breasts by ''ultrasound'', ''MRI'', or other imaging techniques. Sometimes imaging techniques will be used to evaluate the rest of your body, as well.' "
What type of medical team do I need for the most accurate breast cancer diagnosis and treatment?,"'A well-coordinated team, which includes input from multiple specialists, is the best way to diagnose and treat breast cancer. Oncologists are physicians who specialize in ''cancer care'' and will be involved in your care and will often coordinate your care with your primary care provider. Pathologists (physicians who diagnose tissue obtained during biopsies), radiologists, and surgeons will often be involved in the care, as well. Advice from the entire team must be available during biopsies and any tumor-clearing surgery to ensure the best chance of a favorable outcome for the patient.''How important is the role of the pathologist reading my slides?'""The pathologist evaluating the slides made from fine-needle aspiration biopsies, core biopsies, and tissue slides of the breast must have a great deal of experience and special training. It is important that the pathologist reliably determine the presence or absence of cancer and distinguish cancer from other conditions such as hyperplasia with atypia (an overgrowth with unusual-looking but benign cells). The pathologist also orders and interprets special studies (see below) on your cancer tissue to determine the precise characteristics of the cancer cells, such as whether the cancer expresses hormone receptors. These results are used to further specify the type of breast cancer and optimize treatment decisions. The remainder of the treatment will be based on the pathologist's diagnosis.""'A review by more than one pathologist is optimal. There are many subtleties that can be overlooked when reviewing microscope slides. These can lead to both over-reading (making a false-positive diagnosis) and under-reading (making a false-negative diagnosis). When slides are read a second time by another pathologist followed by a discussion of the conclusions, most diagnostic problems are resolved. This is not a standard procedure at all hospitals.''There are almost always several pathologists available who can review the pathology of your slides (this is termed a ""double reading""). The added safeguard of double reading may not be necessary in most cases of breast ''cancers'' but can be a critical factor in some cases.''It should always be possible to send slides from your biopsy to a pathologist at another diagnostic center. First of all, there should not be a rush to treatment; breast cancer is almost never an emergency. Developing the best treatment plan depends on a good, thorough pathologic evaluation as well as a complete workup of both breasts, as noted above. You should discuss this with your treatment team or primary care giver as they can help you arrange for this.''Second, good pathologists are never offended by a request for an outside opinion. They also usually know the names of some of the finest breast pathologists in the country and should be willing to arrange a consultation with one of these doctors.''In most cases of breast cancer, it is not necessary to obtain this in-depth consultation. However, if there are any unusual aspects of your case, it can be important in your decision-making process. The matter of obtaining additional consults may take a week or more.' "
Is my family history relevant to my breast cancer diagnosis?,"'If you have a strong (positive) family history for breast cancer, ''ovarian cancer'', or even ''prostate cancer'', this information is relevant to your diagnosis. A strong family history in this case usually means that a mother, sibling, child, or father has had a related malignancy. Information about other family members (aunts, nieces, etc.) is also important. This is especially significant if the diagnosis of breast cancer was made at an early age or involved both breasts or a breast and an ovary in the same individual. A positive family history may necessitate a more comprehensive diagnostic workup, more involved treatment, and consideration of genetic testing, not only for you but for other family members.' "
What other studies should be done on my breast tissue biopsy?,"'Microscopic evaluation of the slides made from involved tissue provides critical information about the tumor. A reasonably accurate prediction of tumor behavior can be made based on the appearance of the cancer cells, their size and similarity to one another, and the presence or absence of these cells in the lymphatic and blood vessels immediately adjacent to the tumor. This type of evaluation is a standard part of the diagnostic process.''However, there are additional relevant data that the laboratory should obtain, and this analysis is directed by the pathologist at the time of diagnosis. This information includes, at a minimum, an assessment of the estrogen and ''progesterone'' receptors on the malignant cells and the status of at least one oncogene, called her-2-neu. An oncogene is a gene that plays a normal role in cell growth but, when altered, may contribute to abnormal cell division and tumor growth.''Currently, these tests (estrogen and progesterone receptors and her-2-neu) have an accurate enough predictive value that their status should be determined in all cases of breast cancer. Test results are available within a few days to a week after removal of the tumor tissue. The results of these tests should then be taken into account in the final decision-making about treatment. These tests are constantly evolving and changing, and your treatment team will be able to discuss the current standard and advanced testing available.''Genomic assays (tests that evaluate gene expression) in the tumor tissue are often performed on certain breast cancers to help determine the likelihood that a tumor will recur (come back) and to help determine whether ''chemotherapy'' will be beneficial.' "
How urgent is it that I make decisions and begin breast cancer treatment?,"'It is extremely rare that a patient must be rushed into treatment. The biology of breast tumors is established fairly early in their development, and by the time the tumors are detectable, most have been growing undetected for considerably more than a year. This means that if you take a few weeks to complete a thorough evaluation, obtain appropriate consultations, understand the situation, discuss the alternatives, and initiate a treatment plan, it is not likely to add any significant risk. This time frame, however, should allow the facts of your case to be carefully sorted out and errors to be minimized. Your treatment team should be able to help you in this process and specifically advise you on the urgency to start certain treatments.''Doctors may differ in their recommendations if they weigh the risks differently. There will always be uncertainties in any given case. These issues are rarely ""right versus wrong."" They can be compared with decisions such as, ""How do I balance my desire to have the largest and safest care with the need to have convenience and economy?"" There are tradeoffs. For example, certain breast cancer treatment options may favor cosmetic appearance but slightly increase the risk of recurrence in the affected breast. If you have concerns, a second opinion by a different treatment team can often be helpful. A good treatment team will help the patient make informed decisions.''There are often indirect consequences of treatment decisions. For example, breast-conservation therapy achieves, as its goal, treatment of the breast cancer along with preservation of the breast. This is clearly a highly desirable objective. However, in doing so, it leaves the possibility that cancer may recur in that breast. The risk is small but is definitely there. Most of the time, the recurrence will be recognized and the new tumor treated early but not always.''These risks mean that a patient choosing breast-conservation therapy must have the treated side (and the other breast as well) carefully monitored with regular examinations and imaging tests. Occasionally, tissue abnormalities develop that may suggest a new or recurrent cancer, thereby necessitating further evaluation with more tests or even another biopsy. The majority of these abnormalities turn out to be benign, perhaps caused by benign breast disease or changes from the surgery and ''radiation therapy''. But the psychological impact of having to repeat such an evaluation may be very upsetting to some patients. Breast conservation is not appropriate for every breast cancer patient or breast cancer type.''There are similar considerations in each treatment plan that have to be understood and carefully evaluated before committing to a particular method of therapy. You should discuss these issues thoroughly with your doctor.''The majority of breast cancers occur as unconnected (sporadic) cases and are not caused by an ''inherited'' genetic abnormality (mutation) passed from parent to child. However, if you have close family members, such as a mother or sister, who have had the disease, especially if it occurred at a young age, then the possibility of a genetic predisposition to develop cancer cells should be investigated. In these situations, genetic testing may provide valuable information. The test results may affect not only recommendations for your therapy but may also have major implications for other family members, as well. Gene testing should only be done after careful ''genetic counseling'' so that everyone has a thorough understanding of the potential value and also the limitations of these tests.' "
Should I stop taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after a breast cancer diagnosis?,"'Breast cells are programmed to respond to certain hormones as signals for growth and multiplication. The most prominent examples of these hormones are ''estrogens'' and progesterone. Many breast cancer cells retain hormone receptors (molecular configurations on the cell surface to which the hormones bind). The hormone receptors, therefore, make the cancer cells responsive to these particular hormones.''In general, taking hormones is not recommended if a diagnosis of breast cancer is under consideration. This does not necessarily mean that you can never resume ''postmenopausal'' ''hormone therapy''. This issue is generally reconsidered after the completion of your evaluation and treatment. You should consult with your physician before you stop or start any new medications.' "
"Even though my breast tumor does not have hormone receptors, should I take tamoxifen to reduce the risk of a new tumor?","'Following completion of your treatment for breast cancer, whether or not ''tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex'') is prescribed should at least be addressed. In many cases, the primary breast cancer for which the patient is being treated may not be hormone-receptor positive. In these cases, tamoxifen (which binds to the estrogen receptor in place of estrogen) is not generally part of the treatment protocol.''However, the ''Breast Cancer Prevention'' Trial (a study of the use of tamoxifen) demonstrated a significant reduction in the development of new cancers in the opposite breast in patients who were treated with tamoxifen. So, the possible use and benefits of tamoxifen should not be ignored. A thoughtful evaluation of all the factors in a particular case will lead to a recommendation which balances the benefits of tamoxifen against the potential risks. Your treatment team should address this issue with you.' "
"I have a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a type of localized cancer. Why have I been advised to have a mastectomy when other women with invasive breast cancer have lumpectomies?","'Ductal ''carcinoma in situ'' (DCIS) sometimes presents a difficult dilemma. Most patients with DCIS can undergo successful breast-conservation therapy but not all. The diagnosis implies that this is an ""early"" form of cancer in the sense that the cancer cells have not acquired the ability to penetrate normal tissue barriers or spread through the vascular or lymphatic channels to other sites of the body. It is important to realize that breast cancer is a wide spectrum of diseases, and no comparisons should be made just on the basis that someone you know has ""breast cancer"" and shares a different treatment approach with you.''However, the millions of cells forming the DCIS have accumulated a series of errors in their DNA programs that allow them to grow out of control. There are varying degrees of disturbance, called ""grades,"" of the normal cellular patterns. Low grades are usually more favorable, and high grades are less favorable.''The DCIS cells originate from the inside of the breast gland ducts (microscopic tubes). As they multiply, the cells fill and spread through the normal ducts of the breast glandular tissue. With many DNA errors already in place and millions of these cells exposed to the usual risks of additional DNA damage, a few cells will ultimately become invasive. This invasive change is the real risk of DCIS.''Treatment that does not physically remove all of the DCIS seems to leave some risk of recurrence and, therefore, invasive disease. In cases where the DCIS has spread extensively through the breast ducts, even though the disease is in a sense ""early"" because it is not yet invasive, it may still require a large surgical resection, at times even a ''mastectomy'' (removal of all or part of the breast).''Your treatment team should be able to discuss the pros and cons of the different approaches and actively include you in the decision process.' "
Should I start chemotherapy before surgery for breast cancer?,"'The classical concept of breast-cancer treatment has been a sequence of tumor-removing surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or ''radiation'' therapy. The goal of surgery and radiation therapy is to destroy or remove the primary cancer. Follow-up chemotherapy is designed to eliminate any cancer cells, as yet undetectable, at remote sites.''Recently, there have been new findings suggesting a potential benefit in some patients when chemotherapy is started before surgery. However, initial chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) should be considered primarily in patients with larger tumors and those with strong evidence of lymph-node involvement at the time of initial diagnosis.''If you are enrolled in a clinical trial, the advantages and disadvantages of all protocols should have been explained to you, giving you the opportunity to make an informed decision.' "
"If I am advised to have a mastectomy, what are the risks and benefits of immediate breast reconstruction?","'If a mastectomy is necessary, immediate reconstruction offers a great psychological benefit to most women. However, as is often the case in medicine, there are trade-off risks that must be considered. If the reconstruction is done during the same surgery as the mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), the final results of the pathology tests on the removed tumor and tissue is not yet known and will not be known for at least a day or two.''There are sometimes findings on the final pathology report that make chest wall radiation advisable in order to reduce the risk of local recurrence. If a prosthesis for the breast has been implanted, the radiation treatment will still work, but the radiation may significantly compromise the cosmetic appearance of the prosthesis. There may also be healing problems that delay chemotherapy, potentially increasing the risk of ''breast cancer recurrence''. These and other factors should be discussed and carefully considered before committing to immediate ''breast reconstruction''.' "
Should breast cancer patients have their lymph nodes removed?,"'Lymph nodes'' are small glandular structures that filter tissue fluids. They filter out and ultimately try to provide an immune response to particles and proteins that appear foreign to them. There are thousands of these nodes scattered in groups throughout the body. Each cluster is more or less responsible for the drainage of a particular region of the body.''The lymph nodes under the arm (axillary nodes) are the dominant drainage recipients from the breast. When cancer cells break free from a breast cancer, they may travel through the lymph tubes (vessels) to the lymph nodes. There, the cancer cells may establish a secondary growth site. The presence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes proves that cancer cells have traveled away from the primary breast tumor. Therefore, the presence or absence of cancer cells in these regional nodes is an important indicator of the future risk of recurrence. This information is often important in making decisions about whether to use chemotherapy and what type of chemotherapy should be employed.''Unfortunately, removal of the lymph nodes also carries a potential risk of ''lymphedema'', a condition that may cause the arm to swell. ''Lymphedema'' can occur early after surgery or many years later. It can be a difficult and disabling condition. Here again, there are tradeoffs in risk. When more lymph nodes are removed, more accurate information about tumor spread is obtained and the chance for tumor recurrence is less. But there is a greater incidence of lymphedema.''There are alternatives to standard ''lymph node'"" removal (called axillary node dissection). These alternatives should be considered in each patient's situation. They include""'Again, these alternatives must be selectively applied with the benefits and risks carefully evaluated.' replacing standard axillary-node removal with sentinel node biopsy (explained below); not doing lymph-node removal in patients who will receive chemotherapy anyway based on other information; and not doing lymph-node removal in patients with very small or ""favorable"" tumors."
"What is a sentinel lymph node biopsy, and what are its benefits and risks?","'A sentinel node biopsy takes advantage of a peculiar physiologic and anatomical finding. Although there may be many lymph nodes in a particular drainage region, it appears that only one or two are the first recipients of the regional fluids.''This means that if any nodes will be involved by tumor spread, the sentinel node will be the first. It also means in general that if the sentinel node is not involved, then no other nodes will be affected. Therefore, only the sentinel node needs to be removed. There are techniques for removing just the sentinel nodes. A sentinel node biopsy allows the pathologist to more intensively study this node and apply specialized techniques that are capable of detecting even a few cancer cells.' "
Introduction to Breast Cancer Recurrence,"'Breast cancer'' can recur at any time, but most recurrences occur in the first three to five years after initial treatment. ''Breast cancer'' can come back as a local recurrence (in the treated breast or near the ''mastectomy'' ''scar'') or as a distant recurrence somewhere else in the body. The most common sites of recurrence include the ''lymph nodes'', the bones, ''liver'', or ''lungs''.' "
How Do I Know There Is A Recurrence?,"""If you've been treated for ""'breast cancer'', you should continue to practice breast self-examination, checking both the treated area and your other breast each month. You should report any changes to your doctor right away. Breast changes that might indicate a recurrence include:''In addition to performing monthly ''breast self-exams'', keep your scheduled follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider. During these appointments, your healthcare provider will perform a breast exam, order lab or imaging tests as needed, and ask you about any symptoms you might have. Initially, these follow-up appointments may be scheduled every three to four months. The longer you are ''cancer'""-free, the less often you will need to see your healthcare provider. Continue to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations on screening mammograms (usually recommended once a year)."" An area that is distinctly different from any other area on either breast Lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm that persists through the menstrual cycle A change in the size, shape, or contour of the breast A mass or lump, which may feel as small as a pea A marble-like area under the skin A change in the feel or appearance of the skin on the breast or nipple, including skin that is dimpled, puckered, scaly, or inflamed (red, warm or swollen) Bloody or clear fluid discharge from the nipples Redness of the skin on the breast or nipple"
What Factors Determine The Likelihood Of A Recurrence?,"'Prognostic indicators are characteristics of a patient and her ''tumor'' that may help a physician predict a ''cancer'' recurrence. These are some common indicators:' Lymph node involvement. Women who have lymph node involvement are more likely to have a recurrence. Tumor size. In general, the larger the tumor, the greater the chance of recurrence. Hormone receptors. About two-thirds of all breast cancers contain significant levels of estrogen receptors, which means the tumors are estrogen receptor positive (ER+). ER-positive tumors tend to grow less aggressively and may respond favorably to treatment with hormones. Histologic grade. This term refers to how much the tumor cells resemble normal cells when viewed under the microscope; the grading scale is 1 to 4. Grade 4 tumors contain very abnormal and rapidly growing cancer cells. The higher the histologic grade, the greater chance of recurrence. Nuclear grade. This is the rate at which cancer cells in the tumor divide to form more cells. Cancer cells with a high nuclear grade (also called proliferative capacity) are usually more aggressive (faster growing). Oncogene expression. An oncogene is a gene that causes or promotes cancerous changes within the cell. Tumors that contain certain oncogenes may increase a patient's chance of recurrence."
How Will My Prognosis Affect My Treatment?,"'Following surgery or ''radiation'', your treatment team will determine the likelihood that the cancer will recur outside the breast. This team usually includes a medical oncologist, a specialist trained in using medicines to treat breast cancer. The medical oncologist, who works with your surgeon, may advise the use of ''tamoxifen'' (tamoxifen citrate, ''Nolvadex'') or possibly ''chemotherapy''. These treatments are used in addition to, but not in place of, local breast cancer treatment with surgery and/or ''radiation therapy''.' "
How Would A Recurrence Be Treated?,"'The type of treatment for local breast cancer recurrences depends on your initial treatment. If you had a ''lumpectomy'', local recurrence is usually treated with mastectomy, since radiation therapy cannot be delivered twice to the same area. If the initial treatment was mastectomy, recurrence near the mastectomy site is treated by removing the tumor whenever possible, usually followed by radiation therapy.''In either case, ''hormone therapy'' and/or chemotherapy may be used after surgery and/or radiation therapy. If breast cancer is found in the other breast, it may be a new tumor unrelated to the first breast cancer. Treatment would include a lumpectomy or mastectomy and possibly systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy).''Women with distant recurrence involving organs such as the bones, lungs, brain, or other organs are treated with systemic therapy. Radiation therapy or surgery may also be recommended to relieve certain symptoms.''Immunotherapy with ''trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') alone or with chemotherapy may be recommended for women whose cancer cells have high levels of the HER2/neu protein. Immunotherapy is generally started after hormonal or chemotherapy are no longer effective.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center.''Edited by Charlotte E.

1. Who develops breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer'' is the most frequently diagnosed non-''skin cancer'' in American women. An estimated 213,000 American women will be diagnosed with ''breast cancer'' in 2006. The risk of ''breast cancer'"" increases as women get older. Over the years, researchers have identified certain characteristics, usually called risk factors, which influence a woman's chance of getting the disease. Still, many women who develop breast ""'cancer'' have no known risk factors other than growing older, and many women with known risk factors do not develop breast ''cancer''. '  "
2. What is the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool?,"'The Breast ''Cancer'"" Risk Assessment Tool is a computer program that was developed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) to assist health care providers in discussing breast cancer risk with their female patients. The tool allows a health professional to project a woman's individual estimate of breast cancer risk over a 5-year period of time and over her lifetime and compares the woman's risk calculation with the average risk for a woman of the same age. The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool can be found at: ""'http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool''.' "
"3. What are the risk factors used to estimate breast cancer risk in the 
Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool?","'The risk factors included in the tool are: ''For women with 0 or 1 affected relative, risks increase with age at first live birth. For women with 2 or more first degree relatives, risks decrease with age at first live birth.'' Adapted from Table 1, Gail MH, Brinton LA, Byar DP, Corle DK, Green SB, Shairer C, Mulvihill JJ: Projecting individualized probabilities of developing breast cancer for white females who are being examined annually. J Natl Cancer Inst 81(24):1879-86, 1989. [PubMed Abstract]'   Personal history of breast abnormalities. Two breast tissue abnormalities -- ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) -- are associated with increased risk for developing invasive breast cancer. Age. The 
risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The majority of breast 
cancer cases occur in women older than age 50. Age at menarche (first menstrual 
period). Women who had their first menstrual period before age 12 have a 
slightly increased risk of breast cancer. Age at first live birth. Risk depends 
on age at first live birth and family history of breast cancer, as shown in the 
following table of relative risks. Breast cancer among first-degree relatives (sisters, mother, daughters). 
Having one or more first-degree blood relatives who have been diagnosed with 
breast cancer increases a woman's chances of developing the disease. Breast 
biopsies. Women who have had breast biopsies have an increased risk of breast 
cancer, especially if the biopsy showed a change in breast tissue, known as 
atypical hyperplasia. These women are at increased risk because of whatever 
prompted the biopsies, not because of the biopsies themselves. Race. White women 
have greater risk of developing breast cancer than Black women (although Black 
women diagnosed with breast cancer are more likely to die of the disease)."
4. Why are some other risk factors left out of the Tool?,"'Other risk factors for breast cancer have been identified or proposed but are not included in the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool for several reasons: because evidence that these factors contribute to breast cancer risk is not conclusive, because researchers cannot determine whether these factors add useful information to factors already in the model, or because data on other risk factors was not available in the research data used to develop the model. Such risk factors include: age at ''menopause'', use of ''birth control pills'', high body mass index, a high-fat ''diet'', ''alcohol'', ''radiation'' exposure, and environmental pollutants. Recently published research indicates that breast tissue density, measured from mammograms, can add useful information, but risk models with breast tissue density measurement still need to be validated with additional independent studies. Research also indicates that other risk factors, such as use of hormone therapy, might improve the tool. ' "
5. Is the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool useful for all women?,"'The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was developed for women in the United States population age 35 years or older. It should not be used for women with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer, women exposed to breast radiation for treatment of Hodgkin ''lymphoma'', or women who reside in, or recently migrated from, regions with low breast cancer risk, such as rural China or Japan. More accurate methods to project risk may be available for women with certain rare identified mutations, such as alterations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2''. The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was developed and has been validated in populations consisting mainly of non-Hispanic white women. More research is needed to validate or refine the model for other racial and ethnic groups. ' "
6. What are some of the latest research findings on breast cancer risk?,"'Two studies in the September 6, 2006, issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute identified breast density as an important risk factor.* In one, a study of 11,638 women diagnosed with breast cancer, researchers identified different sets of risk factors in pre- and post-menopausal women. For pre-menopausal women, the risk factors included age, breast density, family history of breast cancer, and prior cancer diagnosis. For post-menopausal women, the risk factors included ethnicity, body mass index, age at ''natural menopause'', use of ''hormone therapy'', and a prior false-positive ''mammogram'', in addition to all the risk factors for pre-menopausal women. The two separate models in this study for predicting breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women may be particularly helpful in identifying women at high risk for breast cancer. ''The other study adds breast density and weight to the Gail model, a model that is the basis for the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (see Question 2). As before, the new model can be used to project risk over 5, 10, 20 and 30 year intervals. The new model predicted higher risks than the previous model in women with high breast density, and previous analyses indicated that the new model had modestly higher accuracy. Independent validation studies are needed before this model should be used for counseling, and before making a permanent change to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool. ' "
7. Are there ways to decrease the chance of developing breast cancer?,"'Launched in April 1992, the ''Breast Cancer Prevention'' Trial (BCPT) was designed to see whether the drug ''tamoxifen'' could prevent breast cancer in women with an increased risk. Data reported in 1998 showed that both pre- and post-menopausal women taking tamoxifen had 49 percent fewer diagnosed cases of breast cancer. These results were also the first clear indication that a chemopreventive agent could be effective in preventing cancer in a high-risk population. For women over 50, tamoxifen was associated with serious side effects, such as ''endometrial cancer'' and ''blood clots''. (http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/''Prevention''/breast-cancer)''Starting in 1999, ''postmenopausal'' women ages 35 or older at increased risk for breast cancer participated in the Study of Tamoxifen and ''Raloxifene'' (STAR). The study compared tamoxifen with raloxifene, an ''osteoporosis'' drug. The initial results of the trial were announced on April 17, 2006 (see ''http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/STARresultsApr172006''), and showed that the drug raloxifene works as well as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women at increased risk of the disease. In STAR, both ''drugs'' reduced the risk of developing invasive breast cancer by about 50 percent. In addition, within the study, women who were prospectively and randomly assigned to take raloxifene daily, and who were followed for an average of about four years, had 36 percent fewer uterine ''cancers'"" and 29 percent fewer blood clots than the women who were assigned to take tamoxifen. Uterine cancers, especially endometrial cancers, are a rare but serious side effect of tamoxifen. Both tamoxifen and raloxifene are known to increase a woman's risk of blood clots. Data from STAR continues to be analyzed. (""'http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/STARresultsQandA'')' "
"8. How did BCPT and STAR use the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool to add 
to our knowledge of breast cancer risk?","'Both breast ''cancer prevention'"" studies, BCPT and STAR, explored ways of reducing the risk of developing breast cancer; their findings have increased our knowledge of risk. Both trials involved women who have not had breast cancer, but were at high risk of developing it. BCPT used the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool to determine eligible participants by projecting each woman's individualized estimate of breast cancer risk. The projections were accurate; thus the BCPT results validated the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool. STAR researchers used the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool for determining eligibility for enrollment. All STAR participants had to have an increased risk of breast cancer equivalent to or greater than that of an average 60- to 64-year-old woman. "" "
9. What else can a woman do about breast cancer?,"'NCI recommends that women in their 40s and older get screening mammograms every one to two years. Women who are at higher than average risk of breast cancer should talk with their health care providers about whether to have mammograms before age 40 and how often to have them. Women also can take an active part in the early detection of breast cancer by having regular clinical breast exams (breast exams performed by health professionals). ''Advances in screening have provided new tools for detection. In September of 2005, preliminary results from a large clinical trial of digital vs. film ''mammography'' found no difference in detecting breast cancer for the general populations of women in the trial. However, the Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST) found that women with dense breasts, who are pre- or perimenopausal (women who had a ''last menstrual period'' within 12 months of their mammograms), or who are younger than age 50, may benefit from having a digital rather than a regular film mammogram. More information about DMIST can be found at ''http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/DMISTQandA''. ''Source: U.S. National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, ''http://www.cancer.gov' "
What is the BRCA gene test?,"'BRCA genes (BRCA 1 and 2) are among the genetic mutations linked to ''breast cancer'', ''ovarian cancer'',\xa0and other ''cancers''.\xa0' Every woman with a BRCA mutation is at high risk for breast cancer, irrespective of whether she has a family history of breast cancer or not. By age 80, a woman with a BRCA mutation has about an 80% chance of developing breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations also increase the risk of ovarian cancer, by 54% and 23%, respectively. Inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations account for 5-10% of all breast cancers. "
What are the purposes of breast cancer BRCA gene test?," The BRCA gene test analyses DNA to look for harmful mutations in two breast cancer genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2). Medical professionals perform this test as a routine blood test. The test should only be performed on patients who have specific types of breast cancers or have a family history suggesting the possibility of having an inherited mutation. These mutations are uncommon, and inherited BRCA gene mutations are responsible for about 5%-10% of breast cancers."
Who is a candidate for BRCA gene testing?,"'Discuss this with your health care provider or treatment team as this information is frequently updated. Guidelines for testing may include the following:''There is only a very small chance your family carries a\xa0BRCA1/2\xa0mutation if you or a family member is the only person in your family with breast cancer and breast cancer occurred at an older age.''In most cases, genetic testing is not recommended when there is a low chance of finding a mutation.''Most breast cancers are not due to a\xa0BRCA1/2\xa0or other inherited gene mutation linked to breast cancer' A personal history of breast cancer diagnosis at a young age, bilateral breast cancer, breast and ovarian cancer diagnosis, or a personal history of ovarian cancer A personal history of bilateral breast cancer (cancer in both breasts) A personal history of triple negative breast cancer (breast cancer that is estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-negative) diagnosed at age 60 or younger Ashkenazi Jewish heritage and a personal history of breast cancer A family history of breast cancer at a young age (under 50) or ovarian cancer and a personal history of breast cancer A person or a family member with bilateral breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or both breast and ovarian cancer A relative with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation A personal or family history of male breast cancer"
What are the risks and benefits of BRCA gene test?,"'A health care provider or genetic counselor can talk with you about the risks, benefits, and issues you may face when you are considering genetic testing.''Testing for\xa0BRCA1\xa0and\xa0BRCA2\xa0gene mutations requires a blood or saliva sample.'""There can be physical, emotional and financial impacts of knowing your genetic status. That's why testing for a\xa0BRCA1/2\xa0mutation is only recommended\xa0for people who fall into one of\xa0the above guidelines.""'Even if it’s recommended, genetic testing is a personal decision. A genetic counselor can help you decide if\xa0BRCA1/2\xa0testing is right for you.\xa0\xa0' "
Testing for BRCA 1/2 mutations,"'In most cases, the person with cancer is tested first.''Just because one person in the family has a mutation doesn’t mean everyone in the family has the mutation. Only identical twins have the exact same genes. Other family members share some, but not all, of their genes.'""For example, if your mother has a\xa0BRCA1\xa0mutation, there's a 50 percent chance you will have a\xa0BRCA1\xa0mutation (you get half of your genes from your mother and a half from your father).""""If your family members with breast cancer or ovarian cancer are deceased or aren't willing to be tested (or if your family medical history is unknown), a genetic counselor can help you decide whether it would be useful to have\xa0BRCA1/2\xa0testing."" If no BRCA1/2 mutation is found, the cancer was not due to a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. If a BRCA1/2 mutation is found, other family members can be tested for the specific mutation."
What are breast cancer early warning signs and symptoms?,"'In most cases, there are no early warning signs of ''breast cancer''. ''Breast cancer'' may not produce any early symptoms, and in many cases, it is first discovered on screening ''mammography''.\xa0The most common sign of ''breast cancer'' is a new lump or mass in the breast.\xa0In addition, the following are possible signs of ''breast cancer'':' Thickening or lump in the breast that feels different from the surrounding area Inverting of the nipple (as a change from the previous appearance) Nipple discharge or redness (especially any bloody discharge) Breast or nipple pain Swelling in your armpit or collarbone could mean breast cancer has spread to lymph nodes in that area Swelling of part of the breast Redness Changes in the skin of the breast Skin dimpling (peau d'orange) Lymph node changes Dimpling or Puckering of the Breast Skin Recent Breast Asymmetry"
What are the different types of breast cancer? ,"'There are many types of breast ''cancer''. Some are more common than others, and there are also combinations of ''cancers''. Some of the most common types of ''cancer'' are as follows:''The following are other uncommon types of breast cancer:' Ductal carcinoma in situ: The most common type of non-invasive breast cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This early-stage breast cancer has not spread and therefore usually has a very high cure rate. Invasive ductal carcinoma: This cancer starts in the milk ducts of the breast and grows into other parts of the surrounding tissue. It is the most common form of breast cancer. About 80% of invasive breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma: This breast cancer starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast. Approximately 10% of invasive breast cancers are invasive lobular carcinoma.Most Invasive ductal and lobular cancers express hormone receptors such as the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). Some tumors express a growth protein known as HER2. Triple-negative breast cancers are a subtype of invasive cancer with cells that lack estrogen and progesterone receptors and have no excess of a specific protein (HER2) on their surface. It tends to appear more often in younger women and African-American women. Most Invasive ductal and lobular cancers express hormone receptors such as the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). Some tumors express a growth protein known as HER2. Triple-negative breast cancers are a subtype of invasive cancer with cells that lack estrogen and progesterone receptors and have no excess of a specific protein (HER2) on their surface. It tends to appear more often in younger women and African-American women. The remainder of breast cancers are much less common and include the following: Mucinous carcinoma are formed from mucus-producing cancer cells. Mixed tumors contain a variety of cell types. Medullary carcinoma is an infiltrating breast cancer that presents with well-defined boundaries between the cancerous and noncancerous tissue. Inflammatory breast cancer: This cancer makes the skin of the breast appear red and feel warm (giving it the appearance of an infection). These changes are due to the blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. Paget's disease of the nipple: This cancer starts in the ducts of the breast and spreads to the nipple and the area surrounding the nipple. It usually presents with crusting and redness around the nipple. Adenoid cystic carcinoma: These cancers have both glandular and cystic features. They tend not to spread aggressively and have a good prognosis. Lobular carcinoma in situ: This is not a cancer but an area of abnormal cell growth. This pre-cancer can increase the risk of invasive breast cancer later in life. Papillary carcinoma Phyllodes tumor Angiosarcoma Tubular carcinoma"
What causes breast cancer?,"""There are many risk factors that increase the chance of developing breast cancer. Although we know some of these risk factors, we don't know the cause of breast cancer or how these factors cause the development of a cancer cell."" We know that normal breast cells become cancerous because of mutations in the DNA, and although some of these are inherited, most DNA changes related to breast cells are acquired during one's life. Proto-oncogenes help cells grow. If these cells mutate, they can increase the growth of cells without any control. Such mutations are referred to as oncogenes. Such uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer."
What are symptoms of a male breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer is rare in men (approximately 2,400 new cases diagnosed per year in the U.S.) but typically has a significantly worse outcome. This is partially related to the often late diagnosis of ''male breast cancer'', when the cancer has already spread.' Symptoms are similar to the symptoms in women, with the most common symptom being a lump or change in skin of the breast tissue or nipple discharge. Although it can occur at any age, male breast cancer usually occurs in men over 60 years of age."
What are breast cancer risk factors?,"'Some of the breast ''cancer risk factors'' can be modified (such as ''alcohol'' consumption) while others cannot be influenced (such as age). It is important to discuss these risks with a health care provider when starting new therapies (for example, ''postmenopausal'' ''hormone therapy'').''Several risk factors are inconclusive (such as deodorants), while in other areas, the risk is being even more clearly defined (such as ''alcohol'' use).''The following are risk factors for breast cancer:' Age: The chances of breast cancer increase as one gets older. Family history: The risk of breast cancer is higher among women who have relatives with the disease. Having a close relative with the disease (sister, mother, daughter) doubles a woman's risk. Personal history: Having a breast cancer diagnosis in one breast increases the risk of cancer in the other breast or the chance of an additional cancer in the original breast. Women diagnosed with certain benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions have an increased risk of breast cancer. These include atypical hyperplasia, a condition in which there is abnormal proliferation of breast cells but no cancer has developed. Menstruation: Women who started their menstrual cycle at a younger age (before 12) or went through menopause later (after 55) have a slightly increased risk. Breast tissue: Women with dense breast tissue (as documented by mammogram) have a higher risk of breast cancer. Race: White women have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but African-American women tend to have more tumors that are aggressive when they do develop breast cancer. Exposure to previous chest radiation or use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) increases the risk of breast cancer. Having no children or the first child after age 30 increases the risk of breast cancer. Breastfeeding for 1½ to 2 years might slightly lower the risk of breast cancer. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of breast cancer both in pre- and postmenopausal women but at different rates. Use of oral contraceptives in the last 10 years increases the risk of breast cancer slightly. Using combined hormone therapy after menopause increases the risk of breast cancer. Alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer, and this seems to be proportional to the amount of alcohol used. A recent meta-analysis reviewing the research on alcohol use and breast cancer concluded that all levels of alcohol use are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. This includes even light drinking. Exercise seems to lower the risk of breast cancer. Genetic risk factors: The most common causes are mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (breast cancer and ovarian cancer genes). Inheriting a mutated gene from a parent means that one has a significantly higher risk of developing breast cancer."
Are there any other questions I should ask my doctor about breast cancer?,"'Yes. There are surely other questions you will wish to ask. Do not hesitate to be very open about your concerns with your doctor.''Although the information here cannot be all-inclusive, we hope it will help you work through this process.' There is constantly new information and new research available about breast cancer, whether BRCA-related new treatments or drugs (for example, olaparib [Lynparza]) or new treatment regiments and recommendations. The foregoing questions and comments should demonstrate that the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer may not be a simple process. Even when all the information is available, there may be difficulties in deciding a proper course of action. However, this decision-making process has a better chance of success when you and the doctor are well informed and communicating effectively."
What tests do physicians use to diagnose breast cancer?,"'Although the above signs and symptoms can diagnose breast cancer, the use of screening ''mammography'' has made it possible to detect many of the ''cancers'' early before they cause any symptoms.''The American Cancer Society (ACS) has the following recommendations for breast cancer screenings:''Mammograms are a very good tool for breast ''cancer screening''. As with any test, mammograms have limitations and will miss some cancers. Patients should discuss their family history and ''mammogram'' and breast exam results with their health care provider.''The ACS does not recommend clinical screening exams in women of any age.''Women at high risk (greater than 20% lifetime risk) should get an ''MRI'' and a mammogram every year. Women at moderate risk (15%-20%) should talk to their doctor about the benefits and limitations of adding ''MRI'' screening to their yearly mammogram.' Women should have the choice to begin annual screening between 40-44 years of age. Women age 45 and older should have a screening mammogram every year until age 54. Women 55 years of age and older should have biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually. Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer."
What should I know about breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer'' is the most common non-''skin cancer'' of American women, but it can also occur in men. Every year in the US, there are over 266,000 new diagnoses of ''breast cancer''. A woman has a risk of 1 in 8 for developing ''breast cancer'' at some point during her lifetime.''There usually are no symptoms or signs of early breast ''cancer'', but sometimes a mass or lump in the breast will be present. Many early breast ''cancers'' are first identified by screening ''mammography''. Breast ''cancer screening'' is important because the cancers can usually be identified at an early stage, when treatments are likely to be effective and outcomes are better.''The exact cause of breast ''cancer'' is not fully understood, but we know that the risk of breast ''cancer'' increases as we age. Other risk factors for breast cancer include a personal or family history of breast cancer and the presence of certain benign conditions in the breast. People who have ''inherited'' certain genetic mutations (''BRCA1'', ''BRCA2'') are also at increased risk of getting breast cancer and other cancers.' "
What is breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer is a ''malignant tumor'' (a collection of cancer cells) arising from the cells of the breast. Although breast cancer predominantly occurs in women, it can also affect men. This article deals with breast cancer in women. Breast cancer and its complications can affect nearly every part of the body.' "
What are the statistics on male breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer is rare in men (approximately 2,400 new cases diagnosed per year in the U.S.) but typically has a significantly worse outcome. This is partially related to the often late diagnosis of ''male breast cancer'', when the cancer has already spread.''Symptoms and signs of ''breast cancer in men'' are similar to the signs and symptoms in women, with the most common symptom being''Although it can occur at any age, ''male breast cancer'' usually occurs in men over 60 years of age.' a lump or change in skin of the breast tissue or nipple discharge."
What are the different types of breast cancer?,"'There are many types of breast cancer. Some are more common than others, and there are also combinations of cancers. Some of the most common types of cancer are as follows:''The remainder of breast cancers are much less common and include the following:''The following are other uncommon types of breast cancer:' Ductal carcinoma in situ: The most common type of noninvasive breast cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This early stage breast cancer has not spread and therefore usually has a very high cure rate. Invasive ductal carcinoma: This cancer starts in the milk ducts of the breast and grows into other parts of the surrounding tissue. It is the most common form of breast cancer. About 80% of invasive breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma: This breast cancer starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast. Approximately 10% of invasive breast cancers are invasive lobular carcinoma. Mucinous carcinoma are formed from mucus-producing cancer cells. Mixed tumors contain a variety of cell types. Medullary carcinoma is an infiltrating breast cancer that presents with well-defined boundaries between the cancerous and noncancerous tissue. Inflammatory breast cancer: This cancer makes the skin of the breast appear red and feel warm (giving it the appearance of an infection). These changes are due to the blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. Paget's disease of the nipple: This cancer starts in the ducts of the breast and spreads to the nipple and the area surrounding the nipple. It usually appears with crusting and redness around the nipple. Adenoid cystic carcinoma: These cancers have both glandular and cystic features. They tend not to spread aggressively and have a good prognosis. Lobular carcinoma in situ: This is not a cancer but an area of abnormal cell growth. This precancer can increase the risk of invasive breast cancer later in life. Adenoid cystic carcinoma: These cancers have both glandular and cystic features. They tend not to spread aggressively and have a good prognosis. Lobular carcinoma in situ: This is not a cancer but an area of abnormal cell growth. This precancer can increase the risk of invasive breast cancer later in life. Papillary carcinoma Phyllodes tumor Angiosarcoma Tubular carcinoma"
What causes breast cancer?,"""There are many risk factors that increase the chance of developing breast cancer. Although we know some of these risk factors, we don't know the cause of breast cancer or how these factors cause the development of a cancer cell.""""We know that normal breast cells become cancerous because of mutations in the DNA, and although some of these are inherited, most DNA changes related to breast cells are acquired during one's life.""'Proto-oncogenes help cells grow. If these cells mutate, they can increase growth of cells without any control. Such mutations are referred to as oncogenes. Such uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer.' "
What are breast cancer risk factors?,"'Some of the breast ''cancer risk factors'' can be modified (such as ''alcohol'' consumption) while others cannot be influenced (such as age). It is important to discuss these risks with a health care provider when starting new therapies (for example, ''postmenopausal'' ''hormone therapy'').''Several risk factors are inconclusive (such as deodorants), while in other areas, the risk is being even more clearly defined (such as alcohol use).''The following are risk factors for breast cancer:' Age: The chances of breast cancer increase as one gets older. Family history: The risk of breast cancer is higher among women who have relatives with the disease. Having a close relative with the disease (sister, mother, daughter) doubles a woman's risk. Personal history: Having a breast cancer diagnosis in one breast increases the risk of cancer in the other breast or the chance of an additional cancer in the original breast. Women diagnosed with certain benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions have an increased risk of breast cancer. These include atypical hyperplasia, a condition in which there is abnormal proliferation of breast cells but no cancer has developed. Menstruation: Women who started their menstrual cycle at a younger age (before 12) or went through menopause later (after 55) have a slightly increased risk. Breast tissue: Women with dense breast tissue (as documented by mammogram) have a higher risk of breast cancer. Race: White women have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but African-American women tend to have more tumors that are aggressive when they do develop breast cancer. Exposure to previous chest radiation or use of diethylstilbestrol increases the risk of breast cancer. Having no children or the first child after age 30 increases the risk of breast cancer. Breastfeeding for one and a half to two years might slightly lower the risk of breast cancer. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of breast cancer both in pre- and postmenopausal women but at different rates. Use of oral contraceptives in the last 10 years increases the risk of breast cancer slightly. Using combined hormone therapy after menopause increases the risk of breast cancer. Alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer, and this seems to be proportional to the amount of alcohol used. A recent meta-analysis reviewing the research on alcohol use and breast cancer concluded that all levels of alcohol use are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. This includes even light drinking. Exercise seems to lower the risk of breast cancer. Genetic risk factors: The most common causes are mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (breast cancer and ovarian cancer genes). Inheriting a mutated gene from a parent means that one has a significantly higher risk of developing breast cancer."
Do antiperspirants or deodorants cause breast cancer?,"'Research has shown that parabens (a preservative used in deodorants) can build up in breast tissues. However, this study did not show that parabens cause breast cancer or find a link between parabens (which many other products contain) and deodorant use.''A 2002 study did not show any increased risk for breast cancer in women using an underarm deodorant or antiperspirant. A 2003 study showed an earlier age for breast cancer diagnosis in women who shaved their underarms more frequently and used underarm deodorants.''We need more research to give us the answer about a relationship between breast cancer and underarm deodorants and blade shaving.' "
What is HER2-positive breast cancer?,"'HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor and is expressed by, and involved in the growth of, some ''cancer'' cells. For example, HER2 is overexpressed in 18% to 20% of invasive breast ''cancers'' and affects treatment as well as prognosis of breast cancers.''Doctors do not know what specifically causes some breast cancers to express this protein while others do not.' In about 10%-20% of breast cancers, the cancer cells test positive for HER2, sometimes referred to as the HER2/neu protein. HER2 is a growth-promoting protein located on the surface of some cancer cells. HER2-positive breast cancers tend to grow more rapidly and spread more aggressively than breast cancers that are HER2-negative."
What tests detect HER2?,"'All patients with invasive ''breast cancer'' should have their ''tumor'' cells tested for HER2. Medical professionals routinely perform this test in the pathology laboratory at the time of diagnosis, using the sample of your breast tissue removed for diagnosis. The testing for HER2 can involve one or more of the following tests.''Health care professionals may use either immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify the HER2 protein or in-situ hybridization (ISH) testing to look for the gene.' IHC test: This test shows if there is too much HER2 protein in the cancer cells and is graded 0 to 3. FISH test: This test evaluates if there are too many copies of the HER2 gene in the cancer cells. This test is either positive or negative. SPoT-Light HER2 CISH test: This test also evaluates if there are too many copies of the HER2 gene in the cancer cells and is reported as positive or negative. Inform HER2 Dual ISH test: This test also evaluates if there are too many copies of the HER2 gene in the cancer cells and is reported as positive or negative."
Do symptoms and signs of HER2-positive breast cancer differ from those of HER2-negative breast cancer?,"'The signs and symptoms for HER2-positive breast cancers are the same as for HER2-negative breast cancers, except for the fact that HER2-positive cancers are likely to grow faster and are more likely to spread. The following are possible signs of\xa0''breast cancer'':' Thickening or lump in the breast that feels different from the surrounding area Inverting of the nipple Nipple discharge or redness  Breast or nipple pain Swelling in your armpit or collarbone could mean breast cancer has spread to lymph nodes in that area Swelling of part of the breast Redness Changes in the skin of the breast Skin dimpling (peau d'orange) Lymph node changes"
What is the treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer?,"'Your health care team needs to evaluate all therapy and provide guidance in response to all test results available and the specific circumstances of your cancer. Treatment for HER2-positive ''breast cancer'' typically involves a combination of ''chemotherapy'' and specific ''drugs'' used for cancers expressing the HER2 protein:' Trastuzumab (Herceptin): This is a monoclonal antibody against HER2, as well as the first drug developed that targets the HER2 protein. Pertuzumab (Perjeta): This is another monoclonal antibody that targets HER2-positive cancers. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine or TDM-1 (Kadcyla): It's a monoclonal antibody that is attached to a chemotherapy drug, emtansine. Lapatinib (Tykerb): Medical professionals usually use this kinase inhibitor with chemotherapy or hormone therapy. Neratinib (Nerlynx) interferes with the cancer cells' ability to respond to growth signals."
What is the outlook (prognosis) for HER2-positive breast cancer?,"'As mentioned before, HER2-positive breast cancers are more likely to grow faster and to come back after treatment than cancers that are HER2-negative. However, the development of the ''drugs'' discussed above that specifically treat cancers expressing HER2 has led to significant improvements in the outlook for people with HER2-positive ''breast cancer''. While survival rate statistics for ''breast cancer'' are not broken down to show rates for HER2-positive cancers, the 5-year survival rate for all localized breast cancers is 99%. However, the 5-year survival rate for metastatic breast cancer is 27%, so it is important to treat HER2-positive breast cancer as early as possible to reduce or prevent spread.' "
What is breast cancer staging?,"'Breast cancer'' staging is the determination of the extent and spread of the ''cancer'"". An individual's health care team uses stages to summarize the extent of the ""'cancer'' in a standardized way that is recognized by all health care providers. They use this staging to determine the treatment most appropriate for the type of ''cancer''. ''Cancer'' staging helps to determine the prognosis, or outlook, of a ''cancer'', including rates of recurrence and survival rates.' "
What are the stages of breast cancer?,"'The most widely used system in the U.S. is the American Joint Committee on ''Cancer'' (AJCC) TNM system. Medical professionals developed a new eighth edition of this staging system for 2018 that includes results of testing for certain biomarkers, including the HER2 protein, estrogen receptor (ER) and ''progesterone'' (PR), and the results of gene expression assays, in addition to the factors (TNM) described below.''Besides the information gained from the imaging tests, this system also uses the results from surgical procedures. After surgery, a pathologist looks at the cells from the ''breast cancer'' as well as from the ''lymph nodes''. They incorporate this information into the staging, as it tends to be more accurate than the physical exam and X-ray findings alone.''The TNM system uses letters and numbers to describe certain ''tumor'' characteristics in a uniform manner. This allows health care providers to stage the cancer (which helps determine the most appropriate therapy) and aids communication among health care providers. The following is an abbreviated example of the TNM staging system.''T: This describes the size of the ''tumor''. A number from 0 to 4 follows. Higher numbers indicate a larger tumor or greater spread:''N: This describes the spread to ''lymph node'' near the breast. A number from 0 to 3 follows.''M: This letter is followed by a 0 or 1, indicating whether the cancer has spread to other organs.''Once physicians determine the T, N, and M categories, they combine them into staging groups. There are five major staging groups, stage 0 to stage IV, which are subdivided into A and B, or A and B and C, depending on the underlying cancer and the T, N, and M scale.''Cancers'' with similar stages often require similar treatments.' TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed T0: No evidence of primary tumor Tis: Carcinoma in situ T1: Tumor is 2 cm or less across T2: Tumor is 2 cm-5 cm T3: Tumor is more than 5 cm T4: Tumor of any size growing into the chest wall or skin NX: Nearby lymph nodes cannot be assessed (for example, if they have previously been removed) N0: There has been no spread to nearby lymph nodes. In addition to the numbers, this part of the staging is modified by the designation ""i+"" if the cancer cells are only seen by immunohistochemistry (a special stain) and ""mol+"" if the cancer could only be found using PCR (special detection technique to detect cancer at the molecular level). N1: Cancer spreads to one to three axillary lymph nodes (underarm lymph nodes) or medical professionals find tiny amounts of cancer in internal mammary lymph nodes (lymph nodes near breastbone). N2: Cancer has spread to four to nine axillary lymph nodes or the cancer has enlarged the internal mammary lymph nodes. N3: Any of the conditions below:Cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes with at least one cancer spread larger than 2 mm.Cancer has spread to lymph nodes under the clavicle with at least area of cancer spread greater than 2 mm. Cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes with at least one cancer spread larger than 2 mm. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes under the clavicle with at least area of cancer spread greater than 2 mm. MX: Medical professionals cannot assess metastasis. M0: Health care providers find no distant spread on imaging procedures or by physical exam. M1: Spread to other organs is present."
What are breast cancer survival rates by stage?,"'Survival rates are a way for health care professionals to discuss the prognosis and outlook of a cancer diagnosis with their patients. The number most frequently discussed is 5-year survival. It is the percentage of patients who live at least 5 years after a cancer diagnosis. Many of these patients live much longer, and some patients die earlier from causes other than ''breast cancer'"". With a constant change in therapies, these numbers also change. The current 5-year survival statistic is based on patients diagnosed at least 5 years ago and may have received different therapies than are available today. As with all statistics, although the numbers define outcomes for the group, any individual's outcome has the potential for a wide range of variation.""'All of this needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting these numbers for oneself.'""Below is the statistics chart from the National Cancer Institute's SEER database.""'These statistics are for all patients diagnosed and reported. Several recent studies have looked at different racial survival statistics and have found a higher mortality (death rate) in African-American women compared to white women in the same geographic area.' "
How to prevent breast cancer,"'There is no guaranteed way to prevent ''breast cancer''. Reviewing the risk factors and modifying the ones that can be altered (increase ''exercise'', keep a good body weight, etc.) can help in decreasing the risk.'""Following the American Cancer Society's guidelines for early detection can help early detection and treatment.""'There are some subgroups of women that should consider additional preventive measures.' Women with a strong family history of breast cancer need genetic testing such as HER2-Positive and BRCA Gene tests. Discuss this with a health care provider and meet with a genetic counselor who can explain what the testing can and cannot tell and then help interpret the results after testing. Chemoprevention is the use of medications to reduce the risk of cancer. The two currently approved drugs for chemoprevention of breast cancer are tamoxifen (a medication that blocks estrogen effects on the breast tissue) and raloxifene (Evista), which also blocks the effect of estrogen on breast tissues. Their side effects and whether these medications are right for an individual need to be discussed with a health care provider. Aromatase inhibitors are medications that block the production of small amounts of estrogen usually produced in postmenopausal women. They prevent reoccurrence of breast cancer but are not approved at this time for breast cancer chemoprevention. For a small group of patients who have a very high risk of breast cancer, surgery to remove the breasts may be an option. Although this reduces the risk significantly, a small chance of developing cancer remains."
What research is the latest research on breast cancer? Is it worthwhile to participate in a breast cancer clinical trial?,"'Without research and ''clinical trials'', there would be no progress in our treatment of ''cancers''.''Research can take many forms, including research in the laboratory directly on cancer cells or using animals. Research can also be performed using patient volunteers.''Research that a patient can be involved in is referred to as a clinical trial. In ''clinical trials'', different treatment regimens are compared for side effects and outcomes, including long-term survival. Clinical trials aim to find out whether new approaches are safe and effective.''Whether one should participate in a clinical trial is a personal decision and should be based upon a full understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the trial. One should discuss the trial with a health care team and ask how this trial might be different from the treatment one would usually receive.''Someone should never be forced to participate in a clinical trial or be involved in a trial without full understanding of the trial and a written and signed consent.' "
What are breast cancer treatment options?,"'Breast cancer'' treatments depend upon the type of ''breast cancer'' that is present as well as the stage (extent of spread) of the ''tumor''.''Overall, patients with ''breast cancer'' have many treatment options. These treatment options undergo frequent adjustments, and your health care provider will have the information on the current standard of care available. Discuss treatment options with a health care team. The following are the basic treatment modalities used in the treatment of ''breast cancer''.' Treatment for early breast cancer typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. After surgery, medical professionals may administer radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. Doctors then perform tests on the surgically removed tissue to determine what type (for example, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive, triple-negative) of cancer is present to help determine the optimum treatment. Treatment for metastatic breast cancer usually involves chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or advanced hormone therapies."
Surgery options,"'Many women with ''breast cancer'' will require surgery. Broadly, the surgical therapies for breast ''cancer'' include breast-conserving surgery and ''mastectomy''.''This surgery will only remove part of the breast (sometimes referred to as partial ''mastectomy''). The size and location of the tumor determine the extent of the surgery.''During a mastectomy (sometimes also referred to as a simple mastectomy), doctors remove all the breast tissue. If considering immediate reconstruction, surgeons sometimes perform a skin-sparing mastectomy.' In a lumpectomy, surgeons only remove the breast lump and some surrounding tissue. Medical professionals inspect the surrounding tissue (surgical margins) for cancer cells. If doctors find no cancer cells, this indicates ""negative"" or ""clear margins."" Frequently, patients receive radiation therapy after lumpectomies. In this surgery, surgeons remove all the breast tissue, as well, but preserve the overlying skin. A nipple-sparing mastectomy keeps the skin of the breast, as well as the areola and nipple."
Radical mastectomy options," During this surgery, the surgeon removes the axillary lymph nodes, as well as the chest wall muscle in addition to the breast. Physicians perform this procedure much less frequently than in the past, as in most cases, a modified radical mastectomy is as effective. This surgery removes the axillary lymph nodes in addition to the breast tissue. Depending on the stage of the cancer, a health care team might give someone a choice between a lumpectomy and a mastectomy. Lumpectomy allows sparing of the breast but usually requires radiation therapy afterward. If lumpectomy is indicated, long-term follow-up shows no advantage of a mastectomy over the lumpectomy."
Preventive surgery,"'For a small group of patients who have a very high risk of breast cancer, surgery to remove the breasts may be an option. Although this reduces the risk significantly, a small chance of developing cancer remains.''Double mastectomy is a surgical option to prevent breast cancer. This prophylactic (preventive) surgery can decrease the risk of breast cancer by about 90% for women at moderate to high risk for breast cancer.''Discuss such an approach with a health care team.''The discussion about whether to undergo any preventive surgery should include' genetic testing for BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations, full review of risk factors, family history of cancer and specifically breast cancer, and other preventive options such as medications."
Radiation therapy,"'Radiation'' therapy destroys cancer cells with high-energy rays. There are two ways to administer radiation therapy.''This is the usual way health care providers administer ''radiation therapy for breast cancer''. An external machine beam of radiation focuses onto the affected area. A health care team determines the extent of the treatment and is based on the surgical procedure performed and whether lymph nodes were affected or not.' The local area will usually be marked after the radiation team has determined the exact location for the treatments. Usually, the patient receives the treatment 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks."
Brachytherapy and chemotherapy,"'This form of delivering radiation uses radioactive seeds or pellets. Instead of a beam from the outside delivering the radiation, these seeds are implanted into the breast next to the cancer.''Chemotherapy is treatment of ''cancers'' with medications that travel through the bloodstream to the cancer cells. These medications are given either by intravenous injection or by mouth.''Chemotherapy can have different indications and may be performed in different settings as follows:''There are many different chemotherapeutic agents that are either given alone or in combination. Usually, these ''drugs'' are given in cycles with certain treatment intervals followed by a rest period. The cycle length and rest intervals differ from drug to drug.' Adjuvant chemotherapy: Though surgery can remove all of the visible cancer, there is still the possibility that cancer cells have broken off or stay behind. If health care providers administer chemotherapy to assure that these small amounts of cells are killed as well, it is called adjunct chemotherapy. Medical professionals don't administer chemotherapy in all cases, since some women have a very low risk of recurrence even without chemotherapy, depending upon the tumor type and characteristics. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: If health care professionals administer chemotherapy before surgery, it is referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although there seems to be no advantage to long-term survival whether the therapy is given before or after surgery, there are advantages to see if the cancer responds to the therapy and by shrinking the cancer before surgical removal. Chemotherapy for advanced cancer: If the cancer has metastasized to distant sites in the body, chemotherapy can be used for treatment. With cases of metastatic breast cancer, the health care team will need to determine the most appropriate length of treatment."
Hormone therapy,"'This therapy is often used to help reduce the risk of cancer reoccurrence after surgery, but it can also be an adjunct treatment. Estrogen (a hormone produced by the ovaries) promotes the growth of a few breast ''cancers'', specifically those containing receptors for estrogen (ER positive) or ''progesterone'' (PR positive). The following ''drugs'' are examples of those health care providers use in ''hormone therapy'':' Tamoxifen (Nolvadex): This drug prevents estrogen from binding to estrogen receptors on breast cells. Toremifene (Fareston) works similar to Tamoxifen and is only indicated in metastatic breast cancer. Fulvestrant (Faslodex): This drug eliminates the estrogen receptor and can be used even if tamoxifen is no longer useful. Aromatase inhibitors: They stop estrogen production in postmenopausal women. Examples include letrozole (Femara), anastrozole (Arimidex), and exemestane (Aromasin)."
BRCA-mutated breast cancer therapy,"'Early in 2018, the U.S. FDA approved olaparib (Lynparza) for treatment of metastatic breast cancer for patients who carry the BRCA mutation.' Olaparib has already been used in ovarian cancer. The drug acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme PARP (known as a PARP-inhibitor drug), which is involved in the repair of damaged DNA. Blocking this enzyme may make it less likely to repair cancerous cells, leading to a slowdown or even stoppage of tumor growth. Two other PARP inhibitors are approved for treating ovarian cancer but do not currently have approval in breast cancer (rucaparib [Rubraca], niraparib [Zejula])."
Targeted therapy,"'As we are learning more about gene changes and their involvement in causing cancer, medical researchers are developing drugs that specifically target the cancer cells.' As an example, researchers have developed drugs that attack cells carrying the HER2 protein for use in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Targeted therapy drugs tend to have fewer side effects than chemotherapy (as they target only the cancer cells) but usually are still used in adjunct with chemotherapy."
Alternative treatments,"'Whenever a disease has the potential for much harm and death, physicians search for alternative treatments.' As a patient or the loved one of a patient, there may be an inclination to try everything and leave no option unexplored. The danger in this approach is usually found in the fact that the patient might not avail themselves of existing, proven therapies. One should discuss any interest in alternative treatments with a qualified health care team and together explore the different options."
What should I know about breast augmentation (breast implants)?, Smooth implants have less chance of rippling (waviness of skin) than textured (roughened) implants. Smooth implants have a higher incidence of capsule contracture (hardening of the implant) than textured implants. Implants placed under the muscle result in more pain postoperatively but have a lower incidence of capsule contracture and rippling. Infection and bleeding are rare but must be treated promptly. A certain number of patients may need another surgery to correct a problem. The aesthetic results of breast implants are best appreciated by the patient who feels the need for larger breasts.
What is breast augmentation?,"'Augmentation of the breast consists of insertion of a silicone bag (prosthesis) under the breast (submammary) or under the breast and chest muscle (subpectoral) and then filling the bag with saline (salt water). This prosthesis expands the breast area to give a fuller breast (increased cup size), give a better contour, and give more cleavage.' "
How is the incision made for breast implants?,'The incision (cut) may be placed at various locations such as: under the breast at the breast fold; periareolar which is at the edge of the ''areola'' (brown area consisting of ''nipple'' and surrounding area); within the areola; in the armpit (axillary); or in the umbilical area.''The thinnest ''scar'' is usually in the areola. The umbilical incision approach is used with an endoscope (tube with a light for visualization and placement of the breast implant).' 
What are smooth and textured types of breast implants?,'There are two types of breast implants?''What are the choices of implant positions? '  The smooth surface implant requires a large pocket and is associated with a 10% incidence of capsule contracture (tightening of the scar around the implant causing firmness or hardness). The smooth implant has only an occasional occurrence of rippling or wrinkling which gives the overlying skin a wavy appearance. A textured (roughened surface) implant is associated with a 3% incidence of capsule contracture but has a 7-9% occurrence of rippling. The easiest surgical placement of the implant is under the breast tissue (submammary). A slightly more difficult surgical placement is under the chest muscle (submuscular or subpectoral) but this position is associated with a lower incidence of capsule contracture and slightly less occurrence of rippling. There is more pain postoperatively than with a submammary placement.
What are the options for breast implant size?,"'The ultimate size of the breast is mainly a personal decision by the patient. Cup size is an inexact estimate of the final size since cup sizes vary with the bra manufacturer and how tight or loose the patient wears her bra as well as how much breast tissue is already present. Describing the preferred cup size does aid the surgeon, but it also helps to look at pictures or photos to show the physician the desired final look.''The most accurate method of estimating the implant size (in ounces) is to fill a ''plastic'"" bag with measured amounts of water and place in a bra with the patient's estimated cup size. One can see with the bra on and covered by a sweater what the final result will approximate.""'Patients most often comment that, ""I wish I had gone larger,"" although there is a rare patient who feels she is too large.' "
What are risks and complications of breast augmentation?,"'Although infection is rare, it can be a very distressing problem. Signs of infection are ''fever'', redness, swelling, and discomfort. If the infection does not respond rapidly to antibiotic treatment, the implant must be removed and the implant can be replaced three (3) months after the ''wound'' is completely healed.''If bleeding occurs into the implant pocket after surgery, the implant must be surgically removed, the bleeding controlled, the wound washed out, and the implant replaced. Signs of bleeding include marked swelling, increasing pain, and ''bruising''.''Hardening of the breast with distortion and sometime pain may require surgical incision of the fibrous scar capsule around the implant (capsulotomy) or partial or total removal of the scar capsule (capsulectomy). The implant can be immediately placed back in the new packet. About 30-35% of patients have recurrent capsule contracture.''Other means of treating the contracture is replacement of a smooth implant with a textured one or placing the implant in a new pocket either under the breast or under the muscle.''If capsule contracture occurs multiple times, the patient may decide to remove the implants permanently.''Sometimes the implant will slip out of the position in which it was initially placed and appear too high, too low, or to one side. Most of the time, this requires surgical repair.''The implant will block some areas of the breast from being visualized on ''mammography''. This is usually less if the implant is placed under the muscle.''Because breast implants might affect the clarity of the ''mammogram'', patients who have multiple close family members with ''breast cancer'' probably should not have breast implants.''With all the ''confusion'' in the newspaper, magazines and on the T.V. or radio, there has been a fear that silicone implants may cause autoimmune disease. At this time there is no scientific evidence that silicone causes autoimmune disease.''According to the FDA, breast implants can cause anaplastic large cell ''lymphoma'', in rare cases.''Implants that have been in a patient for many years may cause calcifications in the scar capsule around the implant. These calcifications can almost always be distinguished from the calcifications which may indicate ''breast cancer''.''An implant may leak from ''weakness'' in the patch or valve area, a hole from incomplete inflation, or other factors. The more modern saline implants have been estimated to leak in 1-5% of cases.'  "
How long do breast implants last?,"'It is not known how long implants will last. In the body, the wall of the implant may weaken and become disrupted. This is more likely when there is an impact injury, such as from the steering wheel of a car or fall. The implant may or may not last a lifetime and depends upon the manufacturing process and other, as yet, unknown factors.''Most patients are extremely happy with breast augmentation. There is a certain amount of increased self esteem and self confidence which may result.''The patient who desires augmentation should not be influenced by family or friends as to whether or not the surgery should be performed and what size is most desirable. This is a very personal matter to most patients and satisfaction is best when the patient makes the decisions.' "
Facts you should know about breast lumps in women," Breast lumps can be caused by infections, injuries, non-cancerous growths, and cancer. Breast cancer usually causes no pain in the breast. The symptoms of breast cancer include painless breast lumps, nipple discharge, and inflammation of the skin of the breast. The chances that a particular breast lump could be cancerous depends on many factors, including past medical history, physical examination, as well as genetic and other risk factors. The only way to be certain that a lump is not cancerous is to have a tissue sampling (biopsy). There are several ways to do the biopsy. The treatment of a breast lump depends on its cause."
What are the types and causes of breast lumps? What do they look like?,"'There are many causes of breast lumps. Some of these causes are harmless, while others can be painful and/or dangerous. Causes of breast lumps include infections, injuries, non-cancerous growths, and ''cancer''.''Breast cancer'' is the second leading cause of ''cancer''-related deaths in women in the United States. Currently, death rates from ''breast cancer'' are declining. The decline in death rates may be due to a combination of earlier detection and better screening as well as improved treatments. While most breast lumps are harmless (benign), every breast lump should be evaluated by a doctor to exclude or establish a diagnosis of cancer.'  "
Infections,"'Inflammation of the breast tissue is known as ''mastitis''. Mastitis may occur in women who are ''breastfeeding'' a baby (lactating). When the skin of the ''nipple'' (''areola'') is injured or cracked, which may occur with ''nursing'', bacteria can enter the damaged area and cause infections. In a breastfeeding woman, a hard area commonly thought of as a ""clogged milk duct"" can form. Sometimes, certain treatments (see below) can prevent the painful, hard area from developing into an actual ''breast infection''. Infections can either be a deep pocket of pus, in which the infection looks like it is growing down into the breast (an ''abscess''), or a wider area of skin redness that spreads out (''cellulitis''). Body piercing in the nipple area increases the risk of breast infections, and these may be particularly difficult to treat.' "
Injuries to the breast,"'If a breast is injured by ''trauma'', tiny blood vessels can rupture to cause an area of localized bleeding (''hematoma'') that can be felt as a lump. Trauma to the breast can damage the fat cells in the breast tissue, a condition called fat necrosis. The injury can also form a lump in the breast. These types of lumps that follow a significant trauma are not cancerous. Fat necrosis can also occur at the site of a previous ''breast biopsy''.'  "
Non-cancerous growths,"   Fibroadenomas are benign (not cancerous) growths and are very common. These growths most commonly occur in women 30 to 35 years old, but can also occur in women under 30 years of age. Fibroadenomas are solid, firm tumors that are usually painless or only slightly tender. They sometimes grow quickly in teenagers or during pregnancy. Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs within the breast tissue and are benign. They are very common, especially over the age of 35. These cysts often vary in size during the menstrual cycle and may be tender. Fibrocystic changes are characterized by breasts that are lumpy with many irregularities in the breast tissue itself. Fibrocystic breasts seem to occur when a woman's breasts are overly sensitive to fluctuating hormone levels. Women with fibrocystic changes may have pain and/or lumps."
What do cancerous lumps in the breast feel like? Are they painful?,"'Sometimes breast ''cancer causes'' no symptoms or signs; but when they do occur, they include:''Breast cancer frequently causes no pain in the breast. Although women often worry about ''breast pain'', most women with ''breast pain'' do not have breast cancer.'   Nipple discharge that occurs without the nipple being touched can be caused by benign (non-cancerous) growths. Examples of these growths are intraductal papillomas (non-cancerous growths that protrude into the milk ducts) and dilated areas of milk ducts (ductal ectasia). Nipple discharge also can be caused by cancer of the breast tissue. Because nipple discharge can be a sign of cancer, it needs to be evaluated by a doctor. Skin changes on the breast, including redness and warmth, can sometimes be a sign of breast cancer. Inflammation: A form of breast cancer that commonly causes symptons and signs of inflammation is Paget's disease of the breast. However, most inflammation or rashes on the breast are not due to cancer. They may be caused by benign problems such as nipple eczema or a fungal infection. Still, a doctor should be evaluate any rashes. Areas that are especially scaly and red, particularly if they are persistent, or if there is also nipple discharge, are often sampled (biopsied) to rule out cancer."
How do doctors diagnose the types and causes of breast lumps?,"'A manual examination of the breast is an important screening method for detecting cancer, and it is the first step in the evaluation of a breast lump. Unfortunately, the manual examination of the breast is not precise. However, if a mass can be felt manually, it is important to estimate the location of the mass so that the ''mammogram'' and/or other diagnostic examinations can focus on that particular area. A doctor also inspects any suspicious skin changes that may be a sign of breast cancer. Since the manual examination can miss breast cancer, ''mammography'' is also an important screening tool.''Women with a breast lump need to have a mammogram of both breasts. A mammogram is estimated to be able to detect about 90% of breast ''cancers''. This means that about 10% of breast cancers are missed by mammography. Therefore, if a woman or her physician feels a lump and the mammogram is normal, further studies or biopsies are carried out to rule out cancer. Sometimes, a certain pattern of calcium deposits appears on the mammogram that makes the doctor suspicious of cancer. In these cases, it is often recommended that a biopsy be taken that is guided by mammogram images to be sure the correct area is sampled.''Ultrasound'' is useful in the evaluation of breast lumps. It can distinguish between a ''cyst'', which is filled with fluid and a solid lump (which may or may not be cancerous). The first step in the evaluation of a breast lump is to determine whether it is a ''cyst'' or solid mass. This is best accomplished by performing an ultrasound examination. In a young woman, where a benign cyst is anticipated and, the ultrasound is confirmatory, she may not require any procedures or biopsies. If it is unclear on the ultrasound whether the lump is entirely cystic in nature, a further evaluation is usually recommended.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') is becoming more widely used in the evaluation of breast lumps because it is particularly sensitive to small abnormalities in breast tissue. MRI is a special radiology technique designed to image internal structures of the body using magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce the images of body structures. Cancers generally have a greater blood supply than non-cancerous growths. The images obtained from an MRI may help determine whether a particular area is cancerous as the MRI exhibits greater contrast in those areas with an increased blood supply. In most cases, MRI is performed if results of mammography and ultrasound evaluations are not conclusive.''MRI also has limitations. For example, MRI cannot detect the presence of calcium deposits, which can be identified by mammography and may be a sign of cancer.'  "
6 treatments for breast lumps,"'If the area actually looks red or fails to get better with heat, massage, and nursing, a doctor should be consulted for consideration of antibiotics. If untreated, mastitis can quickly progress and develop into a severe infection. Whether a woman is ''pregnant'' or not, she needs to see a doctor if the area does not return completely to normal with treatment in order to rule out more unusual types of infections. Cellulitis needs to be treated with antibiotics and frequent follow-ups with the doctor.' Breast pain (mastodynia) is a common problem. As long as the doctor or patient can feel no mass, and no breast lump is seen on a mammogram or ultrasound, breast pain is often concluded to be a normal condition. It is often thought that this pain is caused by natural hormonal fluctuations. If the discomfort is particularly acute and interferes excessively with a woman's life, oral contraceptives or other medications can be helpful, especially if the pain is worse around the time of the menstrual cycles. Fibrocystic changes do not require medication or surgery. Often, a baseline mammogram is done. Then, no further treatment is needed unless a new lump arises, in which case an evaluation with a mammogram and possibly ultrasound is necessary. Fibroadenomas are usually removed because they may otherwise be difficult to distinguish from cancer. Breast cancer requires urgent treatment. Treatment depends on the type of cancer detected, its size, and its location. An abscess of the breast often needs to be drained by a doctor because antibiotics alone cannot adequately treat an abscess. A breast infection (mastitis) in a woman who is breast-feeding is treated with warm compresses and antibiotics. Heat treatment is a convenient and effective way of applying heat treatment is to wet some washcloths and put them in the microwave briefly to warm them. Hot showers Massage during heat treatment of the infected area. Beast swelling pain: Heat treatment helps open up the milk ducts. Nursing your baby or using a breast pump can help relieve the swelling and pain. Contrary to common myth, nursing the baby or using a breast pump is a critical part of the treatment because it helps decrease the chance of the infection progressing."
What determines one's breast cancer risk?,"""The chances that a particular breast lump could be cancerous depends on many factors, including a woman's past medical history, her physical examination, and results of radiological tests (e.g. mammograms and ultrasounds). Some of the most important risk factors are outlined below.""'Age is the biggest risk factor for breast cancer. In other words, most cases of breast cancer occur due to the fact that the risk of breast cancer increases with age. Most women with breast cancer do not have a history of breast cancer. A woman who has had a prior breast cancer or who has a family history of breast cancer is certainly at risk herself, especially if multiple family members are involved, the cases occurred at a young age, or if the cancer involved both breasts of a single family member.''Women who have received ''radiation therapy'' to the chest area as treatment for another cancer have a significantly increased risk for breast cancer.''About 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases have been shown to be related to ''inherited'' gene changes (mutations). The most common mutations are those of the ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' genes, although other genetic mutations may also lead to breast cancers.''The finding of certain conditions on previous breast biopsies can also increase the risk for developing breast cancer. Pre-cancerous growths and growths noted on a breast biopsy that represent an increased risk for the development of breast cancer include the following:''Women with DCIS, LCIS, atypical hyperplasia, or proliferative disease are at even higher risk of developing breast cancer if they have a history of breast cancer in the family.' Ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) is an uncontrolled growth of cells that has not spread beyond the milk duct where it is located. DCIS consists of cancer cells that have not invaded other tissues. Therefore, DCIS often is considered to be an early stage of breast cancer and is the most common type of noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS is not life threatening, but must be treated. Women with DCIS have an increased risk for developing a recurrence of the cancer or for development of a new cancer in either breast. Lobular carcinoma-in-situ (LCIS) is considered a condition in which abnormal cells are confined to the lobules in the breast (the glands that produce milk). Unlike DCIS, LCIS is not considered to have a high probability of becoming a cancer, but it is a sign of risk for that breast or the opposite breast for developing a cancer. Therefore, women with LCIS have a greater chance of developing breast cancer in either breast. Proliferative disease of the breast is a benign condition, but it can be a signal that breast cancer may develop in the future. Ductal hyperplasia (the overgrowth of normal cells within the breast ducts) and atypical hyperplasia (overgrowth of abnormal cells in the ducts or lobules that is not serious or extensive enough to qualify as DCIS or LCIS) are examples of conditions that increase the overall risk for developing breast cancer. Not surprisingly, women with atypical hyperplasia have a higher risk than do those with simple ductal hyperplasia (without atypia)."
How can a woman be certain that a lump is not cancer?,"'The only one way to be certain that a lump is not cancerous is to have a tissue sampling (biopsy). There are several ways to perform the biopsy.''Types of biopsy studies include:''To determine the correct location to sample by either method, the lump may be felt by hand (palpitated) if cannot be located. The FNA or core biopsy may be done during an ultrasound examination or mammogram. FNA of a benign cyst may remove the fluid contents of the cyst and cause the mass to disappear or markedly decrease in size.' Fine needle aspiration: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is similar to a blood test in that a needle is inserted into the mass and fluid is withdrawn. The fluid and cells are examined by a pathologist for signs suggesting malignancy. Core needle biopsy: For some women, may be indicated. In this procedure, a hollow needle is inserted into the suspicious area, and a core of tissue is removed through the needle. Excisional biopsy: If no fluid can be aspirated, and the mass is solid, then a direct tissue sampling must be performed. Tissue sampling using either a core needle biopsy or an excisional biopsy (removal of all or a portion of the abnormal area in a surgical procedure). The excisional biopsy is the best method of making an accurate diagnosis. Typically it is done in the operating room using either local or general anesthesia."
What is breast reconstruction?,"""Breast reconstruction is a surgical procedure used to restore a woman's breast to a normal shape and size after ""'mastectomy'' (entire breast removed) or after ''lumpectomy'"" (part of the breast is removed). This can be achieved by either using the patient's own tissue or using implants (prosthetics). If the ""'nipple'' and ''areola'' (darker area around the nipple) are also removed during the mastectomy, then both can be reconstructed following completion of breast “mound” reconstruction.''Although breast reconstruction is considered to be an integral part of the healing and recovery process, it is not appropriate for everyone. Reconstructive efforts should not interfere or complicate the treatment of ''breast cancer''. The primary goal of the initial surgery is to treat ''breast cancer'' and at the same time plan for a reconstruction if the patient is a good candidate.' "
Who is a candidate for breast reconstruction?,"'First and foremost, everyone should be aware of the of the '""Women's Health""' and ''Cancer'' Rights Act of 1998 which mandates insurance carriers to cover the cost of restorative procedures following mastectomy. Restoration after ''cancer'"" treatment does not necessarily include surgery. For some women it may be as simple as just wearing an external prosthesis or a form-fitted bra. Reconstructive surgery is another option for restoring one's femininity and womanhood, but it is clearly more involved.""'The decision to have breast reconstruction is one that is highly personal and one that should be made by the patient without any outside influence from others. Sometimes reconstruction becomes secondary as one is learning how to cope with the diagnosis and treatment. Reconstruction is considered if the patient does not have any medical conditions that would significantly complicate the healing process (such as ''diabetes'', ''obesity'', ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', and history of chest wall ''radiation'""). Although breast reconstruction can improve a woman's self-image following a mastectomy or lumpectomy, it is likely that there will be some emotional adjustments in order to accept the results of breast reconstruction. Although breast reconstruction procedures can result in a natural looking breast, a candidate should be prepared to accept that a reconstructed breast may never look like or have the sensation of their natural breast.""""When considering restorative options, a woman's first decision is whether or not she is interested in a reconstructive procedure. If so, then one has to consider the next question of whether reconstruction should be done at the time of the mastectomy or be delayed until the ""'breast cancer'' treatment is completed. At times, even if a patient desires to have immediate (at time of mastectomy) reconstruction, their surgical team may recommend that a delayed procedure, which may carry less of a risk and less interference with the ''cancer'' treatment.' "
What are the potential risks associated with breast reconstruction?,"""Risks associated with any surgical procedure vary and are dependent on patients' existing medical problems. Some patients are at much higher risk for complications from anesthesia, especially patients who have ""'diabetes'', obesity, and/or ''high blood pressure''. Patients who actively smoke are likely to have major complications post-surgery, particularly ''wound'' complications after reconstruction. Patients who have had prior lumpectomy and ''radiation therapy'' to the chest are also at a higher risk for wound complications. Being at risk for higher rates of complications does not mean that the patient will never have reconstructive surgery, but it may be that the surgical team may elect to delay reconstructive surgery. Some lifestyle modifications may also be recommended while preparing for the delayed reconstructive surgery. The goal is to set the patient up for success with this process, as reconstructive surgery is a major undertaking and may require multiple procedures.''As with other surgical treatments, there are always risks from anesthesia. Breast reconstruction complications may include bleeding, infection, and complications in the healing of the incision site. The risks of infection and ''seroma'' formation (fluid collection in the breast pocket) are higher with patients undergoing immediate reconstruction compared to those who are delayed, but the psychological benefits may outweigh the risks for some patients.''In a patient who requires flap surgery, there is a risk of loss of sensation in the flap and the donor site. The use of implants carries the risk of firmness in the breast, known as capsular contracture, and risk of implant rupture. Fortunately, past concerns in the 1990s that silicone implants led to certain systemic diseases have been dismissed. Research conducted by the Institute of Medicine has shown that the use of silicone implants does not pose additional health risks, such as autoimmune or other systemic diseases, or complicate breast health or healing.'""No matter which technique is used to reconstruct a breast, a woman's chest skin will change over time with age, weight, and hormonal changes. Therefore, the shape of the breast will also change over the years and revision procedures may be needed if the patient desires them."" "
When is breast reconstruction performed?,"'If the patient is a good candidate for immediate reconstruction, optimally, it should be performed concurrently with a skin-sparing or even a nipple-sparing mastectomy. Nipple-sparing mastectomy should be considered if the patient is a good oncological and reconstructive candidate. The breast and ''plastic surgeon'' team will determine the safety of a nipple-sparing mastectomy. Immediate reconstruction allows the surgeon to replace the breast tissue with an implant while the skin is still pliable and makes it possible to recreate the original natural shape of the breast.' "
What are the different types of breast reconstruction procedures that are available?,"""The two types of breast reconstruction are implant of a prosthetic device and the use of one's own tissue to reconstruct the breast (autologous reconstruction). According to The American Society of ""'Plastic'' Surgeons statistics, 75% of women in the U.S. have prosthetic reconstruction and 25% have autologous reconstruction.''Implant reconstruction:'"" This procedure replaces the patient's tissue with a saline or silicone implant. Depending on the patient's chest wall characteristics, the implant may be placed immediately at the time of the mastectomy. However, in a majority of patients, a temporary implant known as an “expander” will be placed into the pocket of empty space of the mastectomy breast. The expander's role is to keep the future pocket for the implant open as the skin heals from the mastectomy. Expansions will be performed to create a breast mound that is generally smaller than the final implant. Patients often find this process helpful as they can progressively decide what size of implant they may want to have. Some surgeons also utilize ""'Botox'' to paralyze the chest muscle, in order for the expanders to be more comfortable for the patient and overall have less ''pain'"". (Patients are responsible for the cost of the Botox as insurance carriers do not reimburse for the procedure since it is considered an off-label use of the product.) Once the patient's breast is fully expanded, then the choice between three types of implants can be made. One choice includes saline implants which have a silicone shell on the surface with saline inside. The second choice includes round silicone implants which have the same external shell except for they are filled with “cohesive silicone” on the inside. The third choice includes the next generation of silicone implants (5th generation), known as the “highly cohesive silicone” implants or as the “gummy bear” implants. The highly cohesive nature of the gel makes the implant more stable giving it a more anatomical look.""'Autologous reconstruction:'"" This group of procedures includes procedures where one's own tissue is used. The options of tissue that can be used include tissue from the following areas: abdomen, back, upper or lower buttock, and inside of the thighs. Another type of reconstruction that has been recently utilized is a series of procedures that utilize the patient's own processed fat to create a breast. This procedure is termed “fat injection” and is sometimes used in a combination with implant-based or autologous reconstruction."" "
Is breast reconstruction surgery possible after radiation?,"'Radiation therapy can change the breast reconstruction options that are available for a woman. Some may decide not to have the surgery if there is concern about monitoring the chest wall for recurrence. If the plan for chest radiation is known prior to the mastectomy, the surgical team may recommend a delayed reconstruction. On the other hand, some surgeons now also place a temporary implant, the expander, into the pocket prior to the radiation therapy. All of these efforts are to minimize complications after the final reconstructive procedure since the risk of complications is now higher after the breast is radiated. Radiation therapy changes the skin often causing the skin to “shrink wrap” and be very difficult to stretch.' "
What is the recovery like after breast reconstruction surgery?,"""Like any surgery, recovery varies after breast reconstruction surgery. Healing will continue for several weeks and one should follow the surgeon's instructions during this period. It is important not to lift, strain, or exert excessive force around the surgical area during the recovery period. The plastic surgeon will give the instructions that will include how to care for the surgical site, possible warning signs to watch for, and which medications to take to increase healing and reduce the risk of infection. It is generally recommended to take sufficient time off work to allow for the healing to take place. In addition, good ""'nutrition'' is important as the body is working overtime to heal the surgical areas. Physical therapy is a crucial component of healing phase and it is recommended for all the types of procedures that are performed. Knowing the limitations of physical activity is important and continuous support of the new chest with a supportive bra for 2 to 3 months following the reconstruction is essential. The body heals over a period of time. Unusual breast sensations, twitching, and some discomfort are part of the entire healing process that can take a couple of years.' "
What type of screening for breast cancer should be done after reconstructive surgery?,"""Whether reconstructive surgery is performed or the patient has chosen to wear an external prosthesis, self breast exams continue to be very important in monitoring the reconstructed breast or chest. Monthly self-breast exams should be performed on both chest/breasts and the armpits. If there is a concern or anything appears abnormal, an immediate consultation with breast or plastic surgeon is warranted. Monthly self-breast exams must continue for the rest of one's life as mastectomy does not eliminate the risk of ""'breast cancer recurrence''. Moreover, self-breast exams can detect a recurrence early when it is more treatable. Additional screening may be ordered if there is a suspicious mass or nodule that is felt. The screening may include an ''ultrasound'' or even an ''MRI''.' "
Where Does the Tissue Come From?,"'While tissue from the back or buttocks may be used, the most common flap procedure uses muscle and skin taken from the abdomen. Using either the tunneling or free-flap technique, muscle, skin and fat are transplanted from the abdomen to the chest area. After the flap of tissue has been transferred, the surgeon shapes it into the contour of a breast.''When the abdominal flap is not an option, the surgeon may use tissue from the back -- and, less often, the buttocks -- in making the new breast.' "
What Are the Benefits of a Getting a Breast Reconstruction Without Implants?,"""Using one's own tissue and muscle results in a more natural looking breast that is not vulnerable to the problems that sometimes occur with implants. The shape, feel and contour of a breast reconstructed from a woman's own tissue more closely resemble the characteristics of a natural breast.""'Transferring tissue from the abdomen also results in tightening of the stomach resembling a ''tummy tuck''.' "
What Are the Challenges of These Procedures?,"'Flap surgery is more involved than implant surgery. And, like all major surgical procedures, it carries the risk of complications, such as bleeding, infection or poor healing. However, these complications, should they occur, can be treated at the hospital.''Flap procedures also leave additional ''scars'' on the abdomen, back or buttocks and require a longer hospital stay than implant surgery; on average five to six days versus one or two days for implant recipients. Generally, the additional scars resulting from the flap procedure are well concealed. ' "
Follow-up Care,"'Most women return to normal activities within six weeks after surgery. It may be several weeks before you can do strenuous ''exercise''. After you go home, you can expect some soreness, swelling and ''bruising'' for two to three weeks. You may be asked to apply medications to the suture area or change bandages at home. Your ''plastic surgeon'' will advise you about showering, bathing and ''wound care''.''Mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery will leave areas of numbness where the surgery was performed. Instead of feeling ''pain'' where the tissue was taken, a patient may feel numbness and tightness. The same is true of the reconstruction site. In time, some feeling may return in your breasts. Most scars will fade over time.''The shape of your reconstructed breast will gradually improve over the months following the reconstruction.'""You'll be asked to return for regular checkups at first. If you have a temporary expander implanted, it will be expanded with saline on average once a week until the desired size is obtained (usually within six to ten office visits).""'After breast reconstruction, you should continue to examine your breasts every month. You should continue to have regular screening examinations, such as an annual ''mammogram''.''Breast reconstruction has no bearing on ''cancer'' recurrence or surveillance, and generally does not interfere with ''chemotherapy'' or ''radiation'' treatment. A recurrence can still be treated by any of the standard treatment methods, which include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. In addition, reconstruction rarely, if at all, hides or obscures a local recurrence.' "
What Side Effects Can I Expect?," Infection at surgery site. As with any surgery, infection is a risk. Typically, an antibiotic will get rid of the infection. Pain and discomfort. Your doctor will advise you on a pain relief medication. The level of pain and discomfort will vary from person to person. Itching. As the wound heals, you will experience itching. No matter how much the area may itch, you should avoid scratching it. Your doctor can recommend an ointment or cream to use at the site to reduce this effect. Numbness or tingling sensations. You may experience these sensations because the nerves have been affected. This side effect can last up to 12 months after surgery. Fluid collection under the wound. Sometimes, one of two types of fluid may collect under the wound: seroma (fluid under flap) or hematoma (blood). This may happen even after your drainage tubes are removed several days after your operation. If the fluid collection is small, it may go away by itself. However, if the fluid collection is large, your surgeon may have to drain the site using a needle and syringe."
"After Your Surgery, Contact Your Doctor Immediately Should You Experience Any of the Following:", A fever above 100 degrees Fluid leaking from incision sites Any change in color in the breast or scar area
Does Insurance Cover Breast Reconstruction Without Implants?,"""Reconstructing the breast is not considered a cosmetic procedure. Rather, it's part of the treatment for a disease and the """"Women's Health""' and ''Cancer'' Rights Act mandates that insurers provide coverage for breast reconstruction.'""However, each carrier will vary in its coverage, so it's important that you familiarize yourself with the details of your plan.""'WebMD Medical Reference' "
Introduction,"""If you've got disproportionately large breasts that are causing ""'neck pain'', ''back pain'' or other physical symptoms, you may want to consider a breast reduction.''According to the American Society of ''Plastic'' Surgeons, there are more than 90,000 breast redction procedures a year. The procedure carries tremendous psychological effects and most women who undergo breast reduction are very satisfied with the results. '""It is also important to note that this surgery isn't just for women, either. Men who have conditions such as ""'gynecomastia'' (where ''male breasts'' are enlarged abnormally) also may seek a breast reduction. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, there are more than 20,000 breast reduction procedures in men.' "
Your consultation for breast reduction surgery,"""Before getting breast reduction surgery, you will go in for a pre-operative consultation, during which time your surgeon will take a detailed medical history, including whether or not you've ever had a lump removed from your breast or any other medical conditions affecting your breasts. He or she also will take a detailed family history. You should be in good physical and mental shape in order to undergo this surgery.""""It's important that you are completely honest during this consultation. That includes being completely open with your medical history. It also means being very open as to  why you're seeking a breast reduction . You should expect to discuss the emotional issues you've dealt with; that is, how have you felt dealing with your breast size? How has it made you feel, physically? What types of physical conditions have you experienced?""'Your surgeon may take photos of your breasts and measure them. During this time, the surgeon also will discuss how much breast tissue should be removed to achieve the desired results. You also will learn about how to prepare for the surgery and how to plan for your recovery. Your surgeon may prepare you for this procedure by performing a ''mammography'' and breast exam.' "
How is breast reduction done?,"'Depending on your personal situation, the procedure can be performed in an outpatient facility or you may have to stay at least one night in the hospital. In either case, you will be given general anesthesia, which means you will ''sleep'"" through for the procedure. It's important to have someone with you who can drive you home and stay with you at least the first night if you're not staying in the hospital.""'The surgery itself will take about three to five hours. Your surgeon will make an incision around your ''nipple'', then downward on the breast, in a keyhole form. The excess skin, tissue and fat are removed and your nipple is relocated for cosmetic purposes. Your surgeon may use drainage tubes and the incision site is then sutured. Your breasts will be wrapped in special gauze. If required, you may also wear a surgical bra.' "
How to prepare for the breast reduction,"""You need to be in good physical shape to ensure proper healing, so follow your surgeon's instructions on ""'vitamins'"" you can take before and after the surgery. Likewise, it's very important to eat well-balanced meals. This is no time for a ""'diet''!''During your preoperative consultation, your surgeon will ask about your habits, including whether you smoke or what medications you take. You may have to ''quit smoking'' for a period before and after surgery to ensure proper healing. You may also be asked to ''lose weight'' because being ''overweight'' can increase your risk for complications after breast reduction.''Likewise, you also may have to cease taking certain medications, such as ''aspirin'' or certain anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' such as ''Motrin'' or ''Aleve''. Your surgeon will instruct you on this.'""Before you undergo surgery, you'll need to get your home ready for your recovery. This should include:""   Plenty of ice Gauze and clean washcloths and towels Loose, comfortable t-shirts and blouses Soft bras. Your surgeon can recommend where to buy these Special ointments or creams as recommended by your surgeon for incision site Telephone within reaching distance of your primary rest area Magazines, movies, or other quiet forms of relaxation."
Recovery and follow-up care for breast reduction,"'You will need to take at least one week off from work or school. Some patients require two weeks, but each situation varies. Your surgeon will instruct you on follow up appointments to remove bandages and ''sutures''.''If you are a physically active person, you will not be able to resume your activity for at least one month after surgery. It is very important that you realize the emotional impact of surgery. A lot of people experience ''depression'', but this is normal! Make sure you communicate with your doctor about all your concerns.' "
Complications and side effects of breast reduction,"'You should expect to feel tired and you will have ''breast pain''. This is normal!''Your surgeon will give you a prescription antibiotic ointment and oral painkiller to ease you through the first few days after surgery. You should avoid heavy lifting at all costs, as this can promote scarring.'""It's important to note that a breast reduction will cause ""'scars'' as a normal side effect. However, the scars can be made worse if you lift heavy objects prematurely. Though they are rare, some people may experience certain complications such as inadequate healing of the nipple area, which may require a skin graft.' "
When should I call my doctor after breast reduction surgery?," At the first sign of infection, including fever If you have any unusual discharge from the incision site (including pus) If any of the sutures come out before you are due to have them removed"
Does insurance cover breast reduction?,"""The good news is yes, in most cases. Breast reduction is considered reconstructive, your chances of getting insurance coverage are good. however, you must be sure to follow all the procedures set forth by your carrier's policy.""'Your surgeon can take photos of your breasts, detailing your physical symptoms caused by enlarged breasts in a letter. Begin communicating early with your insurance carrier and make sure you understand exactly what the carrier will cover, such as lab costs, anesthesiologist, and other expenses. This will save you a ''headache'' in the long run, when you have more important things to do, like focus on your recovery.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic, Department of ''Plastic Surgery''.

What is a breast reduction?,"'Breast reduction is also called reduction mammoplasty. It is performed by a ''plastic surgeon''\xa0to reduce the size of large breasts. People who undergo reduction mammoplasty tend to be the most satisfied patients treated by\xa0''plastic'' surgeons. It can be performed at any age following ''puberty''. Patients, including older ones, tend to experience immediate relief from their neck, shoulder, and ''back pain''. ''Scars'' that result from this procedure usually heal very well. Occasionally, some redundancy may be present that may require ''liposuction'' additionally.' "
Why is breast reduction done?,"'This procedure may prove useful for women with' Large breasts, disproportionate to the body frame. Large, heavy breasts causing significant neck, back, and shoulder pain. Grooves in the shoulders from the weight of bra straps. Difficulty wearing and fitting in clothes. Breasts that interfere with sports and exercise. Skin irritation beneath their breasts. Asymmetrical breasts. Self-consciousness or aesthetic concerns."
Who should not undergo breast reduction?,"'Some people are medically unable to undergo the surgery when other systemic diseases are present. ''Smokers'' should ''quit smoking'' prior to the procedure because it increases the risk of complications.''Breast reduction and age:' Patients may seek reduction mammoplasty starting at puberty. If reduction mammoplasty is performed at an early age, such as 14 years, patients may require an additional procedure. If breasts are significantly large, surgery can be performed in the teenage years. Patients should undergo a preoperative mammogram if they are older than 35 years."
How is breast reduction performed?,"'In breast reduction, the most important goal is re-establishing a functional breast with normal sensitivity and saving the ''nipple''-''areola'"" complex (NAC), with the ability to breastfeed, which is proportionate in size to the woman's body.\xa0""'There are several techniques to perform a breast reduction. One of the preferred techniques is the inferior pedicle technique. “Pedicle method” means the surgeon leaves an attached tissue graft (pedicle) with the nerves and blood vessels that supply the breast.''A pedicle can be superior, lateral, medial, inferior, or central. With the\xa0inferior pedicle technique, the blood supply to the nipple\xa0and areola remains generous. As a result, the inferior pedicle has proven sufficient to sustain NAC with good circulation, good sensation, and\xa0''breastfeeding'' ability. In patients with extremely large breasts, the surgeon may consider a free nipple graft to avoid the loss of NAC.\xa0' The surgery is performed under general anesthesia. Breast reduction reduces the skin envelope and volume of the breast tissue, and the nipple is repositioned. The breasts are not reduced to a standard size but to one that is compatible with the patient's body. The breast tissue is carefully preserved, marked, and protected so that each specimen from each breast can be evaluated by a pathologist to detect malignancy of the breasts. The incision is closed in layers, which heals with minimal scarring in most people. Some surgeons opt for surgical drain placement to drain excess blood or fluid accumulation."
How long does it take to recover from breast reduction?,"'The recovery process following breast reduction is as follows:' Painkillers and antibiotics may be administered after surgery. Patients may be advised to wear a surgical bra to provide support and help to heal. They should rest upright with their back elevated. They can be discharged 24-48 hours after surgery. Swelling and bruising resolve in one or two weeks. Assistance with routine activities such as bathing and dressing may be required in the first week. The surgeon may advise certain exercises and self-massage techniques for the first two to three weeks. Light activities can be resumed after two weeks. Avoid rigorous exercises, sports, and lifting heavy objects for the first 8-12 weeks. After four to six weeks, patients can switch from surgical bras to bras of their choice. Patients can resume work depending on the nature and requirement of the job, their own comfort level, and the surgeon’s approval. The scars generally heal well and are barely visible with time. Regular follow-up with the surgeon is required to monitor healing."
What are the complications of breast reduction?,'Some possible complications following breast reduction include:''The most devastating potential complication is the total loss of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC). This is extremely rare.' Hematoma (blood clot) formation  Bleeding Infection Possible asymmetry Loss of sensation around the incision Problems with breastfeeding Keloid formation (scarring) Lack of fullness and poor projection Poor reaction to anesthesia
What is a breast self-exam?,"""A breast self-exam is a woman's examination of her own breasts. Breast self-exams were formerly encouraged to help women detect ""'breast cancer'', but experts and medical organizations do not agree about whether this is necessary or helps save lives. Many women feel comfortable doing breast self-exams as a way to monitor their own health.'  "
Is a breast self-exam necessary?,"'As mentioned, agencies that issue health practice guidelines do not agree on whether doing breast self-exams are helpful in terms of ''cancer'' detection or saving lives from ''cancer''. The best way to detect ''breast cancer'' is by having regular mammograms combined with a breast examination by a health care professional.''According to the American ''Cancer'' Society, breast self exam is an option for women starting in their 20s, but women should be informed about the limitations as well as the benefits of this practice. According to the ACS, ""Research has shown that BSE plays a small role in finding breast cancer compared with finding a ''breast lump'' by chance or simply being aware of what is normal for each woman.""' "
How should one do a breast self-exam?,"'If you choose to do breast self-exams, your doctor can help show you the best technique. Many women find it convenient to do the exam while bathing or showering. The best time to do the exam is 3 to 5 days after the start of the ''menstrual period'', since the breasts are not as tender or lumpy at this time of the cycle. Women who no longer have menstrual periods should do the exam about the same time each month.''Part of a breast self-exam involves examination of the appearance of the breasts in a mirror. For this step, it is best to stand in front of a mirror and examine your breasts in different positions: with your arms relaxed by your side, with your hands pressed down on your hips, leaning forward with chest muscles tightened, and with hands behind the head and chest muscles tightened. Turning from side to side may be helpful to view all angles. Look for any changes like sores on the skin, dimpling or puckering of the skin, or changes in skin color. Look for discharge or changes in the skin of the ''nipple'"" areas, as well. Don't forget to examine the skin underneath the breasts.""""Next, use the flat part of the fingers to feel your breasts, following an up and down or circular motion until you have examined all breast tissue from collarbone to the lower border of the breasts. Examine the armpit areas too since these may contain breast tissue. Look for lumps or irregularities in density or any changes since your last exam. Feel beneath the nipple for any changes. It's best to do this both standing (with your hand on your hip; use the opposite hand to do the exam) and while lying down."" "
What if I find a lump or abnormality on my breast self-exam?,"'See your doctor if you find any abnormality or unexplained change in your breasts. Most breast lumps are benign (non-cancerous), but it is important to have your doctor evaluate any changes you observe during the breast self-exam.' "
When should I decide about breastfeeding?,"""Generally, it is a good idea for the new mom to meet with the baby's doctor prior to the birth in order for all to get to know each other in a controlled, non-rushed, quiet environment. This is a perfect opportunity to discuss your concerns and wishes about feeding your baby. One important reason to have the decision to breastfeed made before the delivery is that it can be very difficult or even impossible to start using formula and then later try to switch to breast milk. This is because the ability of the breasts to produce milk diminishes soon after ""'childbirth'' without the stimulation of breastfeeding.'  "
Why is the choice so important?,"""During your baby's first year of life, he/she will more than triple his/her total body weight, and the vast majority of this ""'weight gain'' will come from the milk that he/she ''drinks''. According to the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'', human milk is the preferred feeding for all infants. This includes premature and sick newborns, with rare exceptions. Of course, breast milk would appear to be the most ideal food for your ''newborn''. Breast milk is the food least likely to cause ''allergic'' reactions, it is inexpensive, it is readily available at any hour of the day or night; ''babies'' accept the taste readily; and the immunity factors in breast milk can help the baby fight off some infections.''Although breast milk is the ideal food for human infants, because of medical or other reasons, some women opt for formula feeding. ''Infant formulas'' have been developed to artificially duplicate human milk, although no formulas have been developed that are an exact replacement for human milk.' "
What are the disadvantages and benefits of breastfeeding?,"'The nutritional advantages of breast milk are certainly numerous. The amino acids in breast milk, the building blocks of proteins, are well balanced for the human baby, as are the sugars (primarily lactose) and ''fats'"". The baby's intestinal tract is best aided in its digestion by the ""'vitamins'', enzymes, and minerals found in breast milk. Breast milk also contains infection-fighting antibodies from the mother, and breastfed babies are believed to be at a reduced risk for many acute and chronic infections early in life. The ''cholesterol'' content is also high in human milk and very low in formulas. Cholesterol promotes brain growth and provides the building blocks of hormones, ''vitamin D'', and intestinal bile.''Breast milk is also the least expensive way to feed an infant. However, the mother must maintain good ''nutrition'' and continue taking any vitamin/mineral ''supplements'' her doctor recommended during the pregnancy.''Formula-fed babies may also have the risk of developing an ''allergy'' to a particular formula. When a baby develops an ''allergy'' to formula, he or she may have symptoms that include irritability, crying after feedings, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', or a skin ''rash''. Concerns that your baby is having a formula ''allergy'"" should be discussed with your baby's doctor.""'Nursing helps most women ''lose weight'' (though not fluid) after delivery, as 500 calories or more are used by breastfeeding each day. Women who breastfeed also have a reduced risk for postpartum bleeding and a reduced risk for ovarian and ''breast cancer'' in the future.''Breastfeeding facilitates bonding between mother and baby. There is a well-accepted extra closeness that breastfeeding mothers experience that is both hormonal and emotional in nature.''The only disadvantages for the baby in breastfeeding occur when things are not going well, for example, if there\'s an inadequate supply of breast milk or an inefficient suck reflex in the baby. However, it is unusual for a mother not to produce enough milk for her baby unless she is not breastfeeding correctly or frequently enough. The disadvantages that most commonly arise involve the rest of the family. Siblings and dad sometimes feel ""left out"" of baby care since mom is the only one who can do the nursing. However, other family members can be involved in helping with different aspects of the baby\'s care, and this gives them a valuable feeling of importance and allows mom a chance to rest.''Breastfed babies eat more often than formula-fed babies since breast milk is more quickly digested and leaves the stomach empty more frequently. This puts a little more ''stress'"" on the mother because of the potential necessity for more frequent feedings. If the mother develops certain medical conditions, whether or not to continue breastfeeding may need to be reassessed. These conditions should always be discussed with the doctor. However, it is rare that breastfeeding would need to be discontinued completely. In any interaction, the mother's doctor and/or pharmacist should be informed that she is breastfeeding. Some medicines should be avoided during breastfeeding. Numerous other medications have not yet been adequately studied in the context of breastfeeding and the possible effects on the baby. If a breastfeeding mother is required to take a medication which has not been fully studied, she may want to consider discussing this matter with her doctor."" "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of formula feeding?,"""For some parents, or when the baby has certain medical conditions, it is very important to know exactly how much their baby is receiving at each feeding, and formula/bottle-feeding allows exact measurement. Foods, medications, or physical conditions in the mother are no longer a concern for the baby who is receiving formula. The entire family can immediately become intimately involved in all aspects of the baby's care, including feedings, allowing the mother to get more rest. Formula-fed babies actually need to eat somewhat less often since formula is less readily digested by the baby than human milk. The disadvantages of formulas are primarily their expense, the lack of maternal infection-fighting antibodies that are in breast milk, and the fact that no formula can exactly duplicate the ideal composition of breast milk."" "
"Can 
I use both forms of feedings for my baby?","""According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, exclusive breastfeeding is ideal nutrition and sufficient to support optimal growth and development for approximately the first 6 months after birth. Furthermore, it is recommended that breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mutually desired. Infants weaned before 12 months of age should not receive cow's milk feedings but should receive iron-fortified ""'infant formula''.''Supplementing breastfeeding with formula is usually discouraged, although it may be helpful in cases where the mother is not producing an adequate supply of milk or the baby is not able to breastfeed well.''Lactation aids are also available as an option to avoid using a bottle when supplementation is necessary.' "
Is there any special preparation required for breastfeeding?,"'Education about the benefits and practice of breastfeeding are keys to optimal preparation. Your local hospital may offer breastfeeding classes as part of the ''childbirth'' class, or you can join your local La Leche League or other breastfeeding support group. These classes can put you in touch with a lactation specialist who may later be your personal lactation consultant. These classes can also help you to learn proper positioning and latch-on techniques.''Contrary to some popular beliefs, it is not necessary to stimulate or prepare the nipples in advance for breastfeeding. Moreover, some techniques of stimulating the nipples may actually be harmful.''No specific physical preparation is necessary for optimal breastfeeding, although some doctors may want to know about things like inverted nipples or previous breast surgery even before the baby is born. General good health measures and adequate hydration are helpful measures. Most doctors recommend continuing basic ''prenatal vitamins'' while breastfeeding.' "
When can breastfeeding begin?,"'Breastfeeding can begin within minutes after birth for most babies. Most babies take a few licks or sucks and then pause at the beginning. Frequent bursts of sucking interrupted by pauses is the usual pattern for the first few hours and sometimes even the first few days.''The first milk the mother produces, called colostrum, is the best food for a newborn. The ''nipple'' stimulation that occurs during breastfeeding also helps the uterus contract and can help stop uterine bleeding.''When a baby begins to open its eyes, look around, and put his or her fist into his or her mouth, then it is time to offer your breast. Breastfeeding experts recommend that the baby not be given ''sugar'' water or other types of bottle feedings in the hospital unless specifically prescribed by the doctor. Some experts recommend not starting a pacifier until good breastfeeding is established.' "
What is the proper technique for breastfeeding?,"'Observing other breastfeeding mothers and talking with breastfeeding support organizations can help new breastfeeding mothers learn techniques for optimal breastfeeding that can help reduce the likelihood of any discomfort or complications. These techniques are briefly outlined below.'""After the mother has assumed a position comfortable for her, she can nestle the baby in a cradle hold (cradling the baby with the mother's arm on the same side as the breast being presented). The baby's body should be on its side, so that the baby does not have to turn his or her head to reach the nipple."" First, manually express a few drops of milk to moisten the nipple. Cup the breast with your hand and using the milk-moistened nipple, gently massage baby's lips, encouraging the baby to open its mouth. When the baby's mouth is opened, the nipple is inserted into the center of the baby's mouth while pulling the baby in very close. The baby's gums should take in at least a 1-inch radius of the areola. The mother may have to make adjustments for the baby's breathing by changing the angle of baby's position slightly or using the thumb to press gently on the breast to uncover the baby's nose. Hold the breast throughout the feeding so the weight of your breast does not tire your newborn's mouth. When feeding is over, to avoid trauma to your nipples, do not pull your nipple from baby's mouth without first breaking the suction by inserting your finger into the corner of baby's mouth."
When should I use a breast pump?,"'Many women find the convenience of a breast pump to be an invaluable aid in breastfeeding. Basically, breast pumps allow the nursing mother to expel (and store, if desired) breast milk at times when she is not available to nurse the breastfed baby.''There are different types of breast pumps. Large, dual-action pumps are typically used in the hospital setting and may be rented for home use. The options for personal use and purchase include automatic models that are comparable to hospital-grade pumps, small electric or battery-operated units that double- or single-pump, and one-handed manual pumps.''Breast pumps may be useful for working mothers who wish to provide a supply of breast milk for their newborn and keep up their own milk production. Sometimes, women must stop breastfeeding on a temporary basis due to an infection or need to take certain medications. In these cases, use of a breast pump can keep milk production active during the breastfeeding hiatus.' "
Should I eliminate certain foods from my diet while breastfeeding?,"""Some babies appear to be sensitive to certain foods in the mother's ""'diet'', while other babies never appear to have negative reactions to foods. A baby may become fussy, may have trouble sleeping, or may develop ''gas'' after the mother eats certain types of foods with strong flavors. Some of the most common triggers of fussiness in babies include ''chocolate'', spices, citrus fruits, and gas-causing vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, and broccoli. However, not all babies will have a reaction to particular foods.''Most experts recommend limiting consumption of ''caffeine'' while breastfeeding, since high levels of ''caffeine'"" can make the baby fussy or disturb the baby's ""'sleep'' patterns. Having more than one alcoholic beverage is also not recommended, since two or more alcoholic ''beverages'' at one time can increase blood ''alcohol'' levels to a point where the alcohol enters the breast milk. If a nursing mother consumes more than two drinks, she should wait at least 2 hours until nursing the baby to allow for elimination of alcohol from the body. If the breasts become engorged, it is fine to pump and discard breast milk while waiting. Studies have also shown that alcohol can interfere with the body\'s ability to ""let down"" (enable the free flow of breast milk) during breastfeeding.''Symptoms of allergy'' in a nursing baby may or may not be due to something eaten by the mother. If an ''allergic reaction'"" to mother's food is present in the baby, it usually develops 2-6 hours after the mother consumed the offending food.""'Because of concerns about ''mercury poisoning'', the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that nursing mothers limit their exposure to mercury in fish. The FDA and EPA advise eating no more than 6 oz. (about 1 serving) of canned albacore or ""white"" tuna a week and limiting intake of canned ""light"" tuna and other cooked fish to about 12 oz. (about 2 servings) per week. Nursing mothers should completely avoid eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (also called golden or white snapper) because of potentially high levels of mercury.' "
Clogged milk ducts,"'Clogged milk ducts may appear as small, red, tender lumps within the breast. Milk ducts may become clogged with dried milk or other material. The goal of treatment is opening these blocked ducts. This can be aided by increasing the breastfeeding frequency and offering the affected breast first, as well as pumping the breast after breastfeeding if the baby is not emptying the breast.''Moist heat packs can be applied to the affected area to increase blood flow and healing. A warm shower and massaging of the area may also enhance resolution of this problem.''Sometimes, the baby will refuse the affected breast because the milk develops a sour taste. Pump the breast and empty it as well as possible. Continue to offer that breast to the baby until he/she accepts the affected breast again.' "
Sore nipples,"'Sore nipples can be relieved by exposing the nipples to the air as much as possible. Using a hair dryer on a low setting to dry nipples after breastfeeding may also provide relief. Nipples should be washed only with water, never with soap, alcohol, benzoin, or premoistened towelettes. Petroleum-based ointments and other cosmetic preparations should not be used, but unmedicated lanolin may help alleviate nipple cracking.' "
When should one seek medical care for problems with breastfeeding?,"'It is important to call your health care provider if the above techniques do not alleviate the problem or if you develop serious symptoms such as ''fever'' or signs of ''mastitis'' (a breast inflammation that may be caused by an infection). Symptoms of mastitis include increasing ''pain'' in the breast, ''fever'', ''chills'', sweats, ''breast swelling'' and/or hardness, and redness of the skin over the affected area. A delay in treating mastitis could lead to a more severe infection and possible breast ''abscess''.' "
Can supplements or medications increase a low milk supply?,"'Most experts agree that increasing the number of feedings and receiving coaching and assistance on proper breastfeeding technique can help increase what is perceived to be a low milk supply. Some women find that using breast pumps after each feeding stimulates milk production because of the increased degrees of emptying of the breast.''Medications that are reported to increase milk production are known as galactogogues. The most common examples are ''dopamine'' receptor antagonists (such as ''metoclopramide'' [''Reglan'', Reglan ODT, ''Metozol ODT'', Octamide] and ''domperidone''). However, there have been no data to demonstrate that these ''drugs'' are more effective than interventions that focus on improving breastfeeding technique and increasing breastfeeding frequency. Most doctors do not support the use of these medications to augment milk supply.''Although a number of ''dietary supplements'' and/or herbal preparations have been claimed to stimulate milk production, including alfalfa, ''fenugreek'', or blessed thistle, there is little scientific data to support the claims that any herbal or dietary supplement can significantly increase milk production, and safety data on the use of these ''supplements'' in nursing mothers is incomplete.' "
Is it possible to breastfeed while pregnant?,"'While breastfeeding typically is associated with a decrease in ''fertility'', it is possible to become ''pregnant'' while breastfeeding, and breastfeeding does not provide 100% effective ''birth control''. For most women, it is safe to continue breastfeeding if they desire, provided they ensure that they are receiving adequate nutrition and fluid intake. While breast milk from a pregnant mother is still nutritionally strong, the hormonal changes of pregnancy will result in some changes in the content of the breast milk and the way the breast milk tastes.''Some women who have had premature ''labor'' in previous ''pregnancies'' may be advised to stop breastfeeding if they become pregnant. This is because the stimulation of the nipples that occurs during breastfeeding may trigger contractions of the uterus. In a woman prone to preterm ''labor'', these weak uterine contractions might increase her risk of developing preterm ''labor''. Both pregnancy and breastfeeding place high demands on the body in terms of nutritional support and rest. Other women may be advised to stop breastfeeding during pregnancy if their nutritional status is poor or if they are suffering from extreme ''fatigue'"" due to the pregnancy. These decisions should be made with advice from the mother's doctor."" "
Is smoking harmful when breastfeeding?,"'Tobacco smoking'' is always harmful, and all mothers should be encouraged to ''quit smoking'' prior to pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, ''smoking'' cigarettes is not considered to be a reason for not breastfeeding, since breastfeeding is the optimal nutrition for newborns. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics\' policy statement on breastfeeding, ""tobacco ''smoking'' by mothers is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, but health care professionals should advise all tobacco-using mothers to avoid ''smoking'' within the home and to make every effort to wean themselves from tobacco as rapidly as possible.""''Nursing mothers should understand that ''nicotine'' is passed to the baby in breast milk, and they should never nurse their baby immediately after smoking or while smoking. Babies exposed to ''secondhand smoke'' also are at risk for a number of health issues, so if a woman smokes, she should nurse her baby after smoking, in a room away from ''cigarette'' smoke. Of course, the safest policy for both mother and baby is to abstain from tobacco use while breastfeeding and forever thereafter.' "
"Do breast implants, surgeries, or reductions affect breastfeeding?","'Strictly speaking, neither ''breast augmentation'' surgery nor ''breast reduction'"" surgery are indications that a woman should not breastfeed. However, all types of breast surgery can interfere with milk production. In women who have received implants, the location of the implant and the type of incision used in the procedure will determine the extent, if any, to which the implant may affect breast milk production or nursing ability. In some cases, operations on a woman's breast may have involved incisions in the nipple area (such as surgeries for biopsies), and in these cases, the milk ducts may have been disrupted. Surgical disruption of milk ducts and ""'scar tissue'' may also predispose women to plugged ducts, mastitis, or milk retention ''cysts'' during breastfeeding.''Concerns have been expressed in the past that the content of ''breast implants'' (particularly with silicone implants) could leak out and be absorbed into breast milk, but studies have failed to show that this is a risk. Ideally, a woman who is planning breast surgery should discuss in advance with her surgeon the risks that the procedure may pose to future breastfeeding.' "
How should one wean a baby from breastfeeding?,"'Weaning is the process of transitioning from breastfeeding to other sources of nourishment. There are no established standards on when to wean a baby, although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies receive only breast milk for the first 6 months of life and a combination of solid foods and breast milk until the baby is at least 1 year old.''Sometimes babies will signal their mothers that it is time to begin weaning; they may nurse for shorter periods of time or appear indifferent, fussy, or distractible when nursing. Other babies may even be resistant to weaning even when the mother is ready. As babies begin to eat more solid foods, their consumption of breast milk may decrease, making breast engorgement less of a problem for the mother.''Weaning does not have to take place all at once. For example, a woman may choose to continue breastfeeding only in the evening, and to wean during the day. Weaning is also easier when the baby has been exposed to another source of milk, such as taking breast milk from a bottle.''No matter when weaning occurs, experts suggest that the process take place gradually. Many women wean by dropping one breastfeeding session a week. Slowing down the process can also help milk production gradually decrease, making engorgement less of a problem. Some mothers prefer to leave the weaning process up to the child; when a child is eating solid foods at every meal, there is often a decreased interest in breastfeeding.' "
Common breastfeeding challenges overview,"""Breastfeeding can be challenging at times, especially in the early days. But it is important to remember that you are not alone. Lactation consultants are trained to help you find ways to make breastfeeding work for you. And while many women are faced with one or more of the challenges listed here, many women do not struggle at all! Also, many women may have certain problems with one baby that they don't have with their second or third babies. Read on for ways to troubleshoot problems. "" "
Sore nipples,"'Many moms report that nipples can be tender at first. Breastfeeding should be comfortable once you have found some positions that work and a good latch is established. Yet it is possible to still have ''pain'' from an ''abrasion'' you already have. You may also have pain if your baby is sucking on only the ''nipple''. '""Ask a lactation consultant for help to improve your baby's latch. Talk to your doctor if your pain does not go away or if you suddenly get sore nipples after several weeks of pain-free breastfeeding. Sore nipples may lead to a ""'breast infection'', which needs to be treated by a doctor. ' A good latch is key, so visit the Bringing your baby to the breast to latch 
section for detailed instructions. If your baby is sucking only on the nipple, 
gently break your baby's suction to your breast by placing a clean finger in the 
corner of your baby's mouth and try again. (Your nipple should not look flat or 
compressed when it comes out of your baby's mouth. It should look round and 
long, or the same shape as it was before the feeding.)  If you find yourself 
wanting to delay feedings because of pain, get help from a lactation consultant. 
Delaying feedings can cause more pain and harm your supply.  Try changing 
positions each time you breastfeed. This puts the pressure on a different part 
of the breast.  After breastfeeding, express a few drops of milk and gently rub 
it on your nipples with clean hands. Human milk has natural healing properties 
and emollients that soothe. Also try letting your nipples air-dry after feeding, 
or wear a soft cotton shirt.  If you are thinking about using creams, hydrogel 
pads, or a nipple shield, get help from a health care provider first.  Avoid 
wearing bras or clothes that are too tight and put pressure on your nipples. 
	 Change nursing pads often to avoid trapping in moisture.  Avoid using soap or 
ointments that contain astringents or other chemicals on your nipples. Make sure 
to avoid products that must be removed before breastfeeding. Washing with clean 
water is all that is needed to keep your nipples and breasts clean.  If you have 
very sore nipples, you can ask your doctor about using non-aspirin pain 
relievers. "
Low milk supply,"'Most mothers can make plenty of milk for their babies. But many mothers are concerned about having enough. '""Checking your baby's weight and growth is the best way to make sure he or she is getting enough milk. Let the doctor know if you are concerned. For more ways to tell if your baby is getting enough milk, visit the How to know your baby is getting enough milk section. ""'There may be times when you think your supply is low, but it is actually just fine: '' ''When your baby is around 6 weeks to 2 months old, your breasts may no longer feel full. This is normal. At the same time, your baby may nurse for only five minutes at a time. This can mean that you and baby are just adjusting to the breastfeeding process -\xa0 and getting good at it! '""Growth spurts can cause your baby to want to nurse longer and more often. These growth spurts can happen around 2 to 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months of age. They can also happen at any time. Don't be alarmed that your supply is too low to satisfy your baby. Follow your baby's lead - nursing more and more often will help build up your milk supply. Once your supply increases, you will likely be back to your usual routine. """"Ask for help! Let your baby's doctor know if you think the baby is not getting enough milk."" Make sure your baby is latched on and positioned well.  Breastfeed often and 
let your baby decide when to end the feeding.  Offer both breasts at each 
feeding. Have your baby stay at the first breast as long as he or she is still 
sucking and swallowing. Offer the second breast when the baby slows down or 
stops.  Try to avoid giving your baby formula or cereal as it may lead to less 
interest in breast milk. This will decrease your milk supply. Your baby doesn't 
need solid foods until he or she is at least 6 months old. If you need to 
supplement the baby's feedings, try using a spoon, cup, or a dropper.  Limit or 
stop pacifier use while trying the above tips at the same time."
Oversupply of milk,"'Some mothers are concerned about having an oversupply of milk. Having an overfull breast can make feedings stressful and uncomfortable for both mother and baby. ''Some women have a strong milk ejection reflex or let-down. This can happen along with an oversupply of milk. If you have a rush of milk, try the following:''Ask for help! Ask a lactation consultant for help if you are unable to manage an oversupply of milk on your own. ' Breastfeed on one side for each feeding. Continue to offer that same side for 
at least two hours until the next full feeding, gradually increasing the length 
of time per feeding.  If the other breast feels unbearably full before you are 
ready to breastfeed on it, hand express for a few moments to relieve some of the 
pressure. You can also use a cold compress or washcloth to reduce discomfort and 
swelling.  Feed your baby before he or she becomes overly hungry to prevent 
aggressive sucking. (Learn about hunger signs in the Tips for making it work 
section.)  Try positions that don't allow the force of gravity to help as much with 
	milk ejection, such as the side-lying position or the football hold.  Burp your 
baby frequently if he or she is gassy.  Hold your nipple between your forefinger and middle finger or with the side 
of your hand to lightly compress milk ducts to reduce the force of the milk 
ejection.  If baby chokes or sputters, unlatch him or her and let the excess milk 
spray into a towel or cloth.  Allow your baby to come on and off the breast at 
will. "
Engorgement,"'It is normal for your breasts to become larger, heavier, and a little tender when they begin making more milk. Sometimes this fullness may turn into engorgement, when your breasts feel very hard and painful. You also may have breast swelling, tenderness, warmth, redness, throbbing, and flattening of the nipple. Engorgement sometimes also causes a low-grade ''fever'' and can be confused with a breast infection. Engorgement is the result of the milk building up. It usually happens during the third to fifth day after birth, but it can happen at any time. ''Engorgement can lead to plugged ducts or a breast infection, so it is important to try to prevent it before this happens. If treated properly, engorgement should resolve. ''Ask for help! Ask your lactation consultant or doctor for help if the engorgement lasts for two days or more. ' Breastfeed often after birth, allowing the baby to feed as long as he or she 
likes, as long as he or she is latched on well and sucking effectively. In the 
early weeks after birth, you should wake your baby to feed if four hours have 
passed since the beginning of the last feeding.  Work with a lactation consultant 
to improve the baby's latch.  Breastfeed often on the affected side to remove the 
milk, keep it moving freely, and prevent the breast from becoming overly full. 
	 Avoid overusing pacifiers and using bottles to supplement feedings.  Hand express 
or pump a little milk to first soften the breast, areola, and nipple before 
breastfeeding.  Massage the breast.  Use cold compresses in between feedings to 
help ease pain.  If you are returning to work, try to pump your milk on the same 
schedule that the baby breastfed at home. Or, you can pump at least every four 
hours.  Get enough rest, proper nutrition, and fluids.  Wear a well-fitting, 
supportive bra that is not too tight. "
Plugged ducts,"'It is common for many women to have a plugged duct at some point breastfeeding. A plugged milk duct feels like a tender and sore lump in the breast. It is not accompanied by a fever or other symptoms. It happens when a milk duct does not properly drain and becomes inflamed. Then, pressure builds up behind the plug, and surrounding tissue becomes inflamed. A plugged duct usually only occurs in one breast at a time. '""Ask for help! If your plugged duct doesn't loosen up, ask for help from a lactation consultant. Plugged ducts can lead to a breast infection. "" Breastfeed often on the affected side, as often as every two hours.

Breast infection (mastitis),"'Even if you are taking medicine, continue to breastfeed during treatment. This is best for both you and your baby. Ask a lactation consultant for help if needed. ''Mastitis (mast-EYE-tiss) is soreness or a lump in the breast that can be accompanied by a fever and/or ''flu''-like symptoms, such as feeling run down or very achy. Some women with a breast infection also have ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. You also may have yellowish discharge from the nipple that looks like colostrum. Or, the breasts may feel warm or hot to the touch and appear pink or red. A breast infection can occur when other family members have a cold or the flu. It usually only occurs in one breast. It is not always easy to tell the difference between a breast infection and a plugged duct because both have similar symptoms and can improve within 24 to 48 hours. Most breast infections that do not improve on their own within this time period need to be treated with medicine given by a doctor. ''Ask for help! Ask your doctor for help if you do not feel better within 24 hours of trying these tips, if you have a fever, or if your symptoms worsen. You might need medicine. See your doctor right away if: ' Breastfeed often on the affected side, as often as every two hours. This

Fungal infections,"'A fungal infection, also called a ''yeast infection'' or ''thrush'', can form on your nipples or in your breast because it thrives on milk. The infection forms from an overgrowth of the Candida organism. Candida exists in our bodies and is kept at healthy levels by the natural bacteria in our bodies. When the natural balance of bacteria is upset, Candida can overgrow, causing an infection. ''A key sign of a fungal infection is if you develop sore nipples that last more than a few days, even after you make sure your baby has a good latch. Or, you may suddenly get sore nipples after several weeks of pain-free breastfeeding. Some other signs of a fungal infection include pink, flaky, shiny, itchy or cracked nipples, or deep pink and blistered nipples. You also could have achy breasts or shooting pains deep in the breast during or after feedings. ''Causes of thrush include: '' '""Thrush in a baby's mouth appears as little white spots on the inside of the cheeks, gums, or tongue. Many babies with thrush refuse to nurse, or are gassy or cranky. A baby's fungal infection can also appear as a ""'diaper rash'' that looks like small red dots around a main ''rash''. This ''rash'' will not go away by using regular ''diaper rash'' creams. ''Fungal infections'' may take several weeks to cure, so it is important to follow these tips to avoid spreading the infection: ''Ask for help! '""If you or your baby has symptoms of a fungal infection, call both your doctor and your baby's doctor so you can be correctly diagnosed and treated at the same time. This will help prevent passing the infection to each other. "" Thrush in your baby's mouth, which can pass to you  An overly moist 
environment on your skin or nipples that are sore or cracked  Antibiotics or 
steroids A chronic illness like HIV, diabetes, or anemia  Change disposable nursing pads often.  Wash any towels or clothing that comes 
in contact with the yeast in very hot water (above 122°F). Wear a clean bra 
every day.  Wash your hands often, and wash your baby's hands often - especially 
if he or she sucks on his or her fingers.  Put pacifiers, bottle nipples, or toys 
your baby puts in his or her mouth in a pot of water and bring it to a roaring 
boil daily. After one week of treatment, discard pacifiers and nipples and buy 
new ones.  Boil daily all breast pump parts that touch the milk.  Make sure other 
family members are free of thrush or other fungal infections. If they have 
symptoms, make sure they get treated. "
Nursing strike,"'A nursing ""strike"" is when your baby has been breastfeeding well for months, and then suddenly begins to refuse the breast. A nursing strike can mean that your baby is trying to let you know that something is wrong. This does not usually mean that the baby is ready to wean. Not all babies will react the same to the different situations that can cause a nursing strike. Some babies will continue to breastfeed without a problem. Others may just become fussy at the breast, and others will refuse the breast entirely. Some of the major causes of a nursing strike include: ''If your baby is on a nursing strike, it is normal to feel frustrated and upset, especially if your baby is unhappy. It is important not to feel guilty or think that you have done something wrong. Keep in mind that your breasts may become uncomfortable as the milk builds up. '""Ask for help if your baby is having a nursing strike to ensure that your baby gets enough milk. The doctor can check your baby's ""'weight gain''.

	or she is getting enough milk.  Keep offering your breast 
to the baby. If the baby is frustrated, stop and try again later. You can also 
try when the baby is sleeping or very sleepy.  Try various breastfeeding 
positions, with your bare skin next to your baby's bare skin.  Focus on the baby 
with all of your attention and comfort him or her with extra touching and 
cuddling.  Try breastfeeding while rocking and in a quiet room free of 
distractions. "
"Inverted, flat, or very large nipples","'Some women have nipples that turn inward instead of protruding, or that are flat and do not protrude. Nipples can also sometimes be flattened temporarily due to engorgement or swelling while breastfeeding. Inverted or flat nipples can sometimes make it harder to breastfeed. But remember that for breastfeeding to work, your baby has to latch on to both the nipple and the breast, so even inverted nipples can work just fine. Often, flat and inverted nipples will protrude more over time, as the baby sucks more. ''Very large nipples can make it hard for the baby to get enough of the areola into his or her mouth to compress the milk ducts and get enough milk. ''Ask for help if you have questions about your nipple shape or type, especially if your baby is having trouble latching well. ' Talk to your doctor or a lactation consultant if you are concerned about your 
nipples.  You can use your fingers to try and pull your nipples out. There are 
also special devices designed to pull out inverted or temporarily flattened 
nipples.  The latch for babies of mothers with very large nipples will improve 
with time as the baby grows. In some cases, it might take several weeks to get 
the baby to latch well. But if a mother has a good milk supply, her baby will 
get enough milk even with a poor latch. "
Breastfeeding a baby with health problems,"""There are some health problems in babies that can make it harder to breastfeed. Yet breast milk and early breastfeeding are still best for the health of both you and your baby - even more so if your baby is premature or sick. Even if your baby cannot breastfeed directly from you, it's best to express or pump your milk and give it to your baby with a cup or dropper. ""'Some common health problems in babies are listed below. ''Jaundice'' is caused by an excess of bilirubin, a substance that is in the blood usually in very small amounts. In the ''newborn'' period, bilirubin can build up faster than it can be removed from the intestinal track. ''Jaundice'' can appear as a yellowing of the skin and eyes. It affects most newborns to some degree, appearing between the second and third day of life. The jaundice usually clears up by two weeks of age and is not harmful. ''Two types of jaundice can affect breastfed infants - breastfeeding jaundice and breast milk jaundice. '""Your baby's doctor may monitor your baby's bilirubin level with blood tests. Jaundice is best treated by breastfeeding more frequently or for longer periods of time. It is crucial to have a health care provider help you make sure the baby is latching on and removing milk well. This is usually all that is needed for the infant's body to rid itself of excess bilirubin. ""'Some babies will also need phototherapy - treatment with a special light. This light helps break down bilirubin into a form that can be removed from the body easily. If you are having trouble latching your baby to the breast, it is important that you pump or hand express to ensure a good milk supply. The same is true if the baby needs formula for a short time - pumping or hand expressing will make sure the baby has enough milk when you return to breastfeeding. ''It is important to keep in mind that breastfeeding is best for your baby. Even if your baby experiences jaundice, this is not something that you caused. Your health care providers can help you make sure that your baby is eating well and that the jaundice goes away. '""Ask for help! If your baby develops jaundice once at home, let your baby's doctor know. Discuss treatment options and let the doctor know that you do not want to interrupt breastfeeding if at all possible.""'Some babies have a condition called gastroesophageal (GASS-troh-uh-SOF-uh-JEE-uhl) reflux disease (''GERD''), which occurs when the muscle at the opening of the stomach opens at the wrong times. This allows milk and food to come back up into the ''esophagus'', the tube in the throat. Some ''symptoms of GERD'' can include: ''Many healthy babies might have some of these symptoms and not have ''GERD''. But there are babies who might only have a few of these symptoms and have a severe case of GERD. Not all babies with GERD spit up or vomit. More severe cases of GERD may need to be treated with medication if the baby refuses to nurse, gains weight poorly or is losing weight, or has periods of gagging or choking. '""Ask for help! See your baby's doctor if he or she spits up after every feeding and has any of the other symptoms mentioned here. If your baby has GERD, it is important to continue breastfeeding. Breast milk is more easily digested than ""'infant formula''. ''Cleft palate'' and ''cleft lip'' are some of the most common ''birth defects'' that happen as a baby is developing in the womb. A cleft, or opening, in either the palate or lip can happen together or separately and both can be corrected through surgery. Both conditions can prevent babies from forming a good seal around the nipple and areola with his or her mouth, or effectively remove milk from the breast. A mother can try different breastfeeding positions and use her thumb or breast to help fill in the opening left by the lip to form a seal around the breast. '""Right after birth, a mother whose baby has a cleft palate can try to breastfeed her baby. She can also start expressing her milk right away to keep up her supply. Even if her baby can't latch on well to her breast, the baby can be fed breast milk by cup. In some hospitals, babies with cleft palate are fitted with a mouthpiece called an obturator that fits into the cleft and seals it for easier feeding. The baby should be able to exclusively breastfeed after his or her surgery. """"Ask for help! If your baby is born with a cleft palate or cleft lip, talk with a lactation consultant in the hospital. Breast milk is still best for your baby's health. ""'Premature birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks gestation. Prematurity often will mean that the baby is born at a low birth weight, defined as less than five and a half pounds. Low birth weight can also be caused by malnourishment in the mother. Arriving early or being small can make for a tough adjustment, especially if the baby has to stay in the hospital for extra care. But keep in mind that breast milk has been shown to help premature babies grow and ward off illness. ''Most babies who are low birth weight but born after 37 weeks (full term) can begin breastfeeding right away. They will need more skin-to-skin contact with mom and dad to help keep them warm. These smaller babies may also need more frequent feedings, and they may get sleepier during those feedings. ''Many babies born prematurely are often not able to breastfeed at first, but they do benefit from expressed milk. You can express colostrum by hand or pump as soon as you can in the hospital. You can talk to the hospital staff about renting a hospital grade electric pump. Call your insurance company or local WIC Office to find out if you can get reimbursed for this type of pump. You will need to express milk as often as you would have breastfed, so around 8 times per a 24-hour period. ''Once your baby is ready to breastfeed directly, skin-to-skin contact can be very calming and a great start to your first feeding. Be sure to work with a lactation consultant on proper latch and positioning. Many mothers of premature babies find the cross cradle hold helpful.\xa0 It may take some time for you and the baby to get into a good routine. ''Did you know? If you leave the hospital before your baby, you can express milk for the hospital staff to give the baby by feeding tube.' Breastfeeding jaundice can occur when a breastfeeding baby is not getting 
enough breast milk. This can happen either because of breastfeeding challenges 
or because the mother's milk hasn't yet come in. This is not caused by a problem 
with the breast milk itself.  Breast milk jaundice may be caused by substances in 
the mother's milk that prevents bilirubin from being excreted from the body. 
Such jaundice appears in some healthy, breastfed babies after about one week of 
age. It may last for a month or more and it is usually not harmful.  Severe spitting up, or spitting up after every feeding or hours after eating

Breastfeeding and special situations,"'Did you know? Many twin and multiple babies are smaller or born premature. Please see the Premature and/or low birth weight section for other tips for caring for these babies. Also, talk with a lactation consultant about more ways you can successfully breastfeed. ''The benefits of human milk to mothers of multiples and their babies are the same as for all mothers and babies - possibly greater, since many multiples are born early. But the idea may seem overwhelming! Yet many of these moms find breastfeeding easier than other feeding methods because there is nothing to prepare. Many mothers have overcome challenges to successfully breastfeed twins and more even after going back to work. ''It will help to learn as much as you can about breastfeeding during your  ''pregnancy''. You can: ''Many breastfeeding basics are the same for twins or multiples as they are for one baby. Learn more about these important topics: ''Most mothers are able to make plenty of milk for twins. Many mothers fully breastfeed or provide milk for triplets or quadruplets. Keep these tips in mind:''Breastfeeding twins and more may take practice, but you and your babies can find your ideal positions and routine. Keep trying different positions until you find ones that work for you. For some mothers and babies, breastfeeding twins at the same time works well. Others find individual feedings to work better. Still others find that it depends on the time - you may feed one baby at a time at night and feed two babies at the same time during the day. Lastly, as your babies grow, you may find that you need to change your feeding routine. ''Below are some positions that may work for you: '""Even though full, direct breastfeeding is ideal, many mothers of multiples feed their babies breast milk or some formula by bottles at times. It is important to work with your doctor, your baby's doctor, and a lactation consultant to figure out what works best for your family. ""'Breastfeeding during your next pregnancy is not a risk to either the breastfeeding toddler or to the new developing baby. If you are having some problems in your pregnancy such as uterine pain or bleeding, a history of preterm labor or problems gaining weight during pregnancy, your doctor may advise you to wean. Some women also choose to wean at this time because they have nipple soreness caused by pregnancy hormones, are nauseous, or find that their growing bellies make breastfeeding uncomfortable. Your toddler also may decide to wean on his own because of changes in the amount and flavor of your milk. He or she will need additional food and drink because you will likely make less milk during pregnancy. '""If you keep nursing your toddler after your baby is born, you can feed your newborn first to ensure he or she gets the colostrum. Once your milk production increases a few days after birth you can decide how to best meet everyone's needs, especially the new baby's needs for you and your milk. You may want to ask your partner to help you by taking care of one child while you are breastfeeding. Also, you will have a need for more fluids, healthy foods, and rest because you are taking care of yourself and two small children. ""'How much milk you can produce depends on how your surgery was done and where your incisions are, and the reasons for your surgery. Women who have had incisions in the fold under the breasts are less likely to have problems making milk than women who have had incisions around or across the areola, which can cut into milk ducts and nerves. Women who have had ''breast implants'' usually breastfeed successfully. If you ever had surgery on your breasts for any reason, talk with a lactation consultant. If you are planning breast surgery, talk with your surgeon about ways he or she can preserve as much of the breast tissue and milk ducts as possible.  ''Many mothers who adopt want to breastfeed their babies and can do it successfully with some help. Many will need to supplement their breast milk with donated breast milk from a milk bank or infant formula, but some adoptive mothers can breastfeed exclusively, especially if they have been ''pregnant'"" before. Lactation is a hormonal response to a physical action, and so the stimulation of the baby nursing causes the body to see a need for and produce milk. The more the baby nurses, the more a woman's body will produce milk. ""'If you are adopting and want to breastfeed, talk with both your doctor and a lactation consultant. They can help you decide the best way to try to establish a milk supply for your new baby. You might be able to prepare by pumping every three hours around the clock for two to three weeks before your baby arrives, or you can wait until the baby arrives and start to breastfeed then. Devices such as a supplemental nursing system (SNS) or a lactation aid can help ensure that your baby gets enough ''nutrition'' and that your breasts are stimulated to produce milk at the same time.  '""If you can't breastfeed and still want to give your baby human milk, the best and only safe place to go is to a human milk bank. You should never feed your baby breast milk that you get directly from another woman or through the Internet. A human milk bank can dispense donor human milk to you if you have a prescription from your doctor. Many steps are taken to ensure the milk is safe. Donor human milk provides the same precious nutrition and disease fighting properties as your own breast milk. ""'If your baby was born premature or has other health problems, he or she may need donated milk not only for health, but also for survival. Your baby may also need donated milk if she or he: ''You can find a human milk bank through the Human Milk Banking Association of North America External Website Policy (HMBANA). HMBANA is a multidisciplinary group of health care providers that promotes, protects, and supports donor milk banking. HMBANA is the only professional membership association for milk banks in Canada, Mexico and the United States and as such sets the standards and guidelines for donor milk banking for those areas. You can also contact HMBANA if you would like to donate breast milk. ''To find out if your insurance will cover the cost of the milk, call your insurance company or ask your doctor. If your insurance company does not cover the cost of the milk, talk with the milk bank to find out how payment can be made later on, or how to get help with the payments. A milk bank will never deny donor milk to a baby in need if they have the supply.' Take a breastfeeding class.  Find Internet and print resources for parents of 
multiples.  Join a support group for parents of multiples through your health 
care provider, hospital, local breastfeeding center, or La Leche League 
International.  Let your health care provider and family members know that you 
plan to breastfeed.  Keep in mind that even if your babies need to spend time in 
the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), breastfeeding is still possible, with 
some adjustments.  Find a lactation consultant with multiples experience before 
the babies are born so that you know where to turn for help. Ask her where you 
can rent a breast pump if the babies are born early.  How to know your babies are getting enough milk  How to troubleshoot common 
breastfeeding challenges  Ways to keep milk supply up  Breastfeeding soon after birth and often is helpful for multiples the same 
way it is for one baby. The more milk that is effectively removed, the more milk 
a mother's body will make.  If the babies are born early, double pumping often 
will help the mother make more milk.  The doctor's weight checks can tell you if 
your babies are getting enough breast milk. For other signs that your babies are 
getting enough breast milk, see the How to know your baby is getting enough milk 
section.  It helps to have each baby feed from both breasts. You can ""assign"" a 
breast to each baby for a feeding and switch at the next feeding. Or, you can 
assign a breast to each baby for a day and switch the next day. Switching 
breasts helps keep milk production up if one baby isn't eating as well for a 
bit. It also gives babies a different view to stimulate their eyes.  Double clutch (""football"") - Place both babies in the clutch hold. You will 
need pillows at your side (and maybe one on your lap) and you will place the 
babies on the pillows with their legs going toward the back of the chair or 
couch. If you are placing the babies in front of you, try to keep their whole 
bodies turned toward you, their chests against your chest. Their bodies must not 
be facing up. This is very important to help prevent nipple pain and to make 
sure that the babies are getting enough milk.  Cradle-clutch combination - Place 
one baby (usually the easiest to latch or stay latched) in the cradle position 
and then position the second baby in the clutch position.  Double cradle - Place 
the babies in front of you with their legs overlapping, making an X across your 
lap.  Can't tolerate formula  Has severe allergies  Isn't thriving on formula "

Classes to prepare you for ''childbirth'', ''breastfeeding'', infant care, and ''parenting'' are great ways to lessen ''anxiety'' and build confidence. In some cities, classes might be offered in different languages. ' "
Birthing Classes,"'Birthing classes often are offered through local hospitals and birthing centers. Some classes follow a specific method, such as ''Lamaze'' or the Bradley method. Others review ''labor'' techniques from a variety of methods. You might want to read about the different methods beforehand to see if one appeals more to you than others. That way, you will know what to sign up for if more than one type of birthing class if offered. Try to sign up for a class several months before your due date. Classes sometimes fill up quickly. Also, make sure the instructor is qualified.''You should discuss with your healthcare professional in advance of delivery about yor preferred birth method and plan.''Most women attend the class with the person who will provide support during ''labor'', such as a spouse, family member, or good friend. This person is sometimes called the ''labor'' coach. During class, the instructor will go over the signs of labor and review the stages of labor. She will talk about positioning for labor and birth, and ways to control ''pain''. She also will give you strategies to work through labor pains and to help you stay relaxed and in control. You will practice many of these strategies in class, so you are ready when the big day arrives. Many classes also provide a tour of the birthing facility.' "
Breastfeeding classes,"'Like any new skill, breastfeeding takes knowledge and practice to be successful.

Can you breastfeed with rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Women with ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') and other rheumatic conditions who want to breastfeed their newborns are generally able to so.\xa0''The benefits of breastfeeding include the following:' You must always consult your doctor before you start the process. RA is not an infectious disease. It cannot be transmitted from a mother to her baby during delivery or through breast milk. RA does not affect the quality of your breast milk. However, certain medications taken for RA may be secreted in your breast milk. These medicines may cause ill-effects in the newborn. Hence, you need to discuss with your doctor.  Breastfeeding offers numerous benefits for the mother and her baby. Hence, women with RA are encouraged to breastfeed their newborns wherever possible. Reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer in women Provides an ideal source of nutrients for the baby Develops a bond between the woman and her baby (due to the physical closeness, skin-to-skin touching, and eye contact with the baby) Helps mother deal with postpartum blues."
Does breastfeeding help prevent rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Recent studies have found that longer the history of breastfeeding, less is the risk of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA) in the baby. Breastfeeding may protect the baby against RA in later life. Earlier studies suggested that breastfeeding increases the risk of RA in the mother but that might be due to the genetic ''makeup'' making the women more likely to get flare after the ''pregnancy''.''For women already affected with RA before their delivery/pregnancy, the first three months after delivery can cause a flare in ''RA symptoms''. However, scientists are still unsure if breastfeeding further increases this risk. Some women report relief in their symptoms after delivery.''A study found that women who ''breastfed'' their ''babies'' for one to two years exhibited a 20% reduced risk of RA compared with those who did not breastfeed at all. Breastfeeding for at least two years reduced the risk of RA by almost half.' "
Does breastfeeding make your joints hurt?,"'Soreness in your joints commonly results from joint tension, muscle tension and ''fatigue'', which are not strangers to breastfeeding mothers. Women with RA slightly more affected with the following issues:''Women can avoid joint aches by adopting certain positions that put less pressure on their joints. These can be as follows:' Flares in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after delivery are common due to hormonal changes.  Sitting in an uncomfortable position can make women’s joints hurt more if they have RA and vice versa (RA can make breastfeeding difficult for women due to the painful joints).  Reclining positions or side-lying on a bed Making use of cushions, pillows, or blankets to support a mother’s arms and/or baby Taking the support of a footstool or other forms of support Consulting an occupational therapist will help new mothers to choose the best positions for breastfeeding."
Which drugs are safe for breastfeeding women with rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Some of the medicines are found to be excreted in the breast milk, but their quantities differ. Women should pump their milk just before they take medicines so that the amount of medicine in the milk is negligible There are several medications prescribed for ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA) that are considered safe for breastfeeding women. These include the following:''Certain drugs used for RA are generally avoided during breastfeeding. Some of these include the following:''Reports suggest that certain drugs such as ''Rituxan'' (''rituximab''), ''Kineret'' (''anakinra''), and ''Orencia'' (''abatacept'') have shown no adverse effects on the baby during breastfeeding. However, there is a lack of long-term safety data, and doctors prescribe these drugs with caution. Hence, only the doctor can decide the most appropriate drug for a breastfeeding woman with RA.'

Common breastfeeding challenges overview,"""Breastfeeding can be challenging at times, especially in the early days. But it is important to remember that you are not alone. Lactation consultants are trained to help you find ways to make breastfeeding work for you. And while many women are faced with one or more of the challenges listed here, many women do not struggle at all! Also, many women may have certain problems with one baby that they don't have with their second or third babies. Read on for ways to troubleshoot problems. "" "
Sore nipples,"'Many moms report that nipples can be tender at first. Breastfeeding should be comfortable once you have found some positions that work and a good latch is established. Yet it is possible to still have ''pain'' from an ''abrasion'' you already have. You may also have pain if your baby is sucking on only the ''nipple''. '""Ask a lactation consultant for help to improve your baby's latch. Talk to your doctor if your pain does not go away or if you suddenly get sore nipples after several weeks of pain-free breastfeeding. Sore nipples may lead to a ""'breast infection'', which needs to be treated by a doctor. ' A good latch is key, so visit the Bringing your baby to the breast to latch 
section for detailed instructions. If your baby is sucking only on the nipple, 
gently break your baby's suction to your breast by placing a clean finger in the 
corner of your baby's mouth and try again. (Your nipple should not look flat or 
compressed when it comes out of your baby's mouth. It should look round and 
long, or the same shape as it was before the feeding.)  If you find yourself 
wanting to delay feedings because of pain, get help from a lactation consultant. 
Delaying feedings can cause more pain and harm your supply.  Try changing 
positions each time you breastfeed. This puts the pressure on a different part 
of the breast.  After breastfeeding, express a few drops of milk and gently rub 
it on your nipples with clean hands. Human milk has natural healing properties 
and emollients that soothe. Also try letting your nipples air-dry after feeding, 
or wear a soft cotton shirt.  If you are thinking about using creams, hydrogel 
pads, or a nipple shield, get help from a health care provider first.  Avoid 
wearing bras or clothes that are too tight and put pressure on your nipples. 
	 Change nursing pads often to avoid trapping in moisture.  Avoid using soap or 
ointments that contain astringents or other chemicals on your nipples. Make sure 
to avoid products that must be removed before breastfeeding. Washing with clean 
water is all that is needed to keep your nipples and breasts clean.  If you have 
very sore nipples, you can ask your doctor about using non-aspirin pain 
relievers. "
Low milk supply,"'Most mothers can make plenty of milk for their babies. But many mothers are concerned about having enough. '""Checking your baby's weight and growth is the best way to make sure he or she is getting enough milk. Let the doctor know if you are concerned. For more ways to tell if your baby is getting enough milk, visit the How to know your baby is getting enough milk section. ""'There may be times when you think your supply is low, but it is actually just fine: '' ''When your baby is around 6 weeks to 2 months old, your breasts may no longer feel full. This is normal. At the same time, your baby may nurse for only five minutes at a time. This can mean that you and baby are just adjusting to the breastfeeding process -\xa0 and getting good at it! '""Growth spurts can cause your baby to want to nurse longer and more often. These growth spurts can happen around 2 to 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months of age. They can also happen at any time. Don't be alarmed that your supply is too low to satisfy your baby. Follow your baby's lead - nursing more and more often will help build up your milk supply. Once your supply increases, you will likely be back to your usual routine. """"Ask for help! Let your baby's doctor know if you think the baby is not getting enough milk."" Make sure your baby is latched on and positioned well.  Breastfeed often and 
let your baby decide when to end the feeding.  Offer both breasts at each 
feeding. Have your baby stay at the first breast as long as he or she is still 
sucking and swallowing. Offer the second breast when the baby slows down or 
stops.  Try to avoid giving your baby formula or cereal as it may lead to less 
interest in breast milk. This will decrease your milk supply. Your baby doesn't 
need solid foods until he or she is at least 6 months old. If you need to 
supplement the baby's feedings, try using a spoon, cup, or a dropper.  Limit or 
stop pacifier use while trying the above tips at the same time."
Oversupply of milk,"'Some mothers are concerned about having an oversupply of milk. Having an overfull breast can make feedings stressful and uncomfortable for both mother and baby. ''Some women have a strong milk ejection reflex or let-down. This can happen along with an oversupply of milk. If you have a rush of milk, try the following:''Ask for help! Ask a lactation consultant for help if you are unable to manage an oversupply of milk on your own. ' Breastfeed on one side for each feeding. Continue to offer that same side for 
at least two hours until the next full feeding, gradually increasing the length 
of time per feeding.  If the other breast feels unbearably full before you are 
ready to breastfeed on it, hand express for a few moments to relieve some of the 
pressure. You can also use a cold compress or washcloth to reduce discomfort and 
swelling.  Feed your baby before he or she becomes overly hungry to prevent 
aggressive sucking. (Learn about hunger signs in the Tips for making it work 
section.)  Try positions that don't allow the force of gravity to help as much with 
	milk ejection, such as the side-lying position or the football hold.  Burp your 
baby frequently if he or she is gassy.  Hold your nipple between your forefinger and middle finger or with the side 
of your hand to lightly compress milk ducts to reduce the force of the milk 
ejection.  If baby chokes or sputters, unlatch him or her and let the excess milk 
spray into a towel or cloth.  Allow your baby to come on and off the breast at 
will. "
Engorgement,"'It is normal for your breasts to become larger, heavier, and a little tender when they begin making more milk. Sometimes this fullness may turn into engorgement, when your breasts feel very hard and painful. You also may have breast swelling, tenderness, warmth, redness, throbbing, and flattening of the nipple. Engorgement sometimes also causes a low-grade ''fever'' and can be confused with a breast infection. Engorgement is the result of the milk building up. It usually happens during the third to fifth day after birth, but it can happen at any time. ''Engorgement can lead to plugged ducts or a breast infection, so it is important to try to prevent it before this happens. If treated properly, engorgement should resolve. ''Ask for help! Ask your lactation consultant or doctor for help if the engorgement lasts for two days or more. ' Breastfeed often after birth, allowing the baby to feed as long as he or she 
likes, as long as he or she is latched on well and sucking effectively. In the 
early weeks after birth, you should wake your baby to feed if four hours have 
passed since the beginning of the last feeding.  Work with a lactation consultant 
to improve the baby's latch.  Breastfeed often on the affected side to remove the 
milk, keep it moving freely, and prevent the breast from becoming overly full. 
	 Avoid overusing pacifiers and using bottles to supplement feedings.  Hand express 
or pump a little milk to first soften the breast, areola, and nipple before 
breastfeeding.  Massage the breast.  Use cold compresses in between feedings to 
help ease pain.  If you are returning to work, try to pump your milk on the same 
schedule that the baby breastfed at home. Or, you can pump at least every four 
hours.  Get enough rest, proper nutrition, and fluids.  Wear a well-fitting, 
supportive bra that is not too tight. "
Plugged ducts,"'It is common for many women to have a plugged duct at some point breastfeeding. A plugged milk duct feels like a tender and sore lump in the breast. It is not accompanied by a fever or other symptoms. It happens when a milk duct does not properly drain and becomes inflamed. Then, pressure builds up behind the plug, and surrounding tissue becomes inflamed. A plugged duct usually only occurs in one breast at a time. '""Ask for help! If your plugged duct doesn't loosen up, ask for help from a lactation consultant. Plugged ducts can lead to a breast infection. "" Breastfeed often on the affected side, as often as every two hours. This 
helps loosen the plug, and keeps the milk moving freely.  Massage the area, 
starting behind the sore spot.  Use your fingers in a circular motion and massage 
toward the nipple. Use a warm compress on the sore area.  Get extra 
	sleep or 
relax with your feet up to help speed healing. Often a plugged duct is the first 
sign that a mother is doing too much.  Wear a well-fitting supportive bra that is 
not too tight, since this can constrict milk ducts. Consider trying a bra 
without underwire. "
Breast infection (mastitis),"'Even if you are taking medicine, continue to breastfeed during treatment. This is best for both you and your baby. Ask a lactation consultant for help if needed. ''Mastitis (mast-EYE-tiss) is soreness or a lump in the breast that can be accompanied by a fever and/or ''flu''-like symptoms, such as feeling run down or very achy. Some women with a breast infection also have ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. You also may have yellowish discharge from the nipple that looks like colostrum. Or, the breasts may feel warm or hot to the touch and appear pink or red. A breast infection can occur when other family members have a cold or the flu. It usually only occurs in one breast. It is not always easy to tell the difference between a breast infection and a plugged duct because both have similar symptoms and can improve within 24 to 48 hours. Most breast infections that do not improve on their own within this time period need to be treated with medicine given by a doctor. ''Ask for help! Ask your doctor for help if you do not feel better within 24 hours of trying these tips, if you have a fever, or if your symptoms worsen. You might need medicine. See your doctor right away if: ' Breastfeed often on the affected side, as often as every two hours. This 
keeps the milk moving freely, and keeps the breast from becoming overly full. 
	 Massage the area, starting behind the sore spot. Use your fingers in a circular 
motion and massage toward the nipple.  Apply heat to the sore area with a warm 
compress.  Get extra sleep or relax with your feet up to help speed healing.

or blood in the milk  You have red streaks near the area  Your symptoms came on 
severely and suddenly "
Fungal infections,"'A fungal infection, also called a ''yeast infection'' or ''thrush'', can form on your nipples or in your breast because it thrives on milk. The infection forms from an overgrowth of the Candida organism. Candida exists in our bodies and is kept at healthy levels by the natural bacteria in our bodies. When the natural balance of bacteria is upset, Candida can overgrow, causing an infection. ''A key sign of a fungal infection is if you develop sore nipples that last more than a few days, even after you make sure your baby has a good latch. Or, you may suddenly get sore nipples after several weeks of pain-free breastfeeding. Some other signs of a fungal infection include pink, flaky, shiny, itchy or cracked nipples, or deep pink and blistered nipples. You also could have achy breasts or shooting pains deep in the breast during or after feedings. ''Causes of thrush include: '' '""Thrush in a baby's mouth appears as little white spots on the inside of the cheeks, gums, or tongue. Many babies with thrush refuse to nurse, or are gassy or cranky. A baby's fungal infection can also appear as a ""'diaper rash'' that looks like small red dots around a main ''rash''. This ''rash'' will not go away by using regular ''diaper rash'' creams. ''Fungal infections'' may take several weeks to cure, so it is important to follow these tips to avoid spreading the infection: ''Ask for help! '""If you or your baby has symptoms of a fungal infection, call both your doctor and your baby's doctor so you can be correctly diagnosed and treated at the same time. This will help prevent passing the infection to each other. "" Thrush in your baby's mouth, which can pass to you  An overly moist 
environment on your skin or nipples that are sore or cracked  Antibiotics or 
steroids A chronic illness like HIV, diabetes, or anemia  Change disposable nursing pads often.  Wash any towels or clothing that comes 
in contact with the yeast in very hot water (above 122°F). Wear a clean bra 
every day.  Wash your hands often, and wash your baby's hands often - especially 
if he or she sucks on his or her fingers.  Put pacifiers, bottle nipples, or toys 
your baby puts in his or her mouth in a pot of water and bring it to a roaring 
boil daily. After one week of treatment, discard pacifiers and nipples and buy 
new ones.  Boil daily all breast pump parts that touch the milk.  Make sure other 
family members are free of thrush or other fungal infections. If they have 
symptoms, make sure they get treated. "
Nursing strike,"'A nursing ""strike"" is when your baby has been breastfeeding well for months, and then suddenly begins to refuse the breast. A nursing strike can mean that your baby is trying to let you know that something is wrong. This does not usually mean that the baby is ready to wean. Not all babies will react the same to the different situations that can cause a nursing strike. Some babies will continue to breastfeed without a problem. Others may just become fussy at the breast, and others will refuse the breast entirely. Some of the major causes of a nursing strike include: ''If your baby is on a nursing strike, it is normal to feel frustrated and upset, especially if your baby is unhappy. It is important not to feel guilty or think that you have done something wrong. Keep in mind that your breasts may become uncomfortable as the milk builds up. '""Ask for help if your baby is having a nursing strike to ensure that your baby gets enough milk. The doctor can check your baby's ""'weight gain''. ' Mouth pain from teething, a fungal infection like thrush, or a cold sore

to avoid engorgement and plugged ducts.  Try another feeding method temporarily 
to give your baby your milk, such as a cup, dropper, or spoon.  Keep track of your baby's wet diapers and dirty diapers to make sure he 
	or she is getting enough milk.  Keep offering your breast 
to the baby. If the baby is frustrated, stop and try again later. You can also 
try when the baby is sleeping or very sleepy.  Try various breastfeeding 
positions, with your bare skin next to your baby's bare skin.  Focus on the baby 
with all of your attention and comfort him or her with extra touching and 
cuddling.  Try breastfeeding while rocking and in a quiet room free of 
distractions. "
"Inverted, flat, or very large nipples","'Some women have nipples that turn inward instead of protruding, or that are flat and do not protrude. Nipples can also sometimes be flattened temporarily due to engorgement or swelling while breastfeeding. Inverted or flat nipples can sometimes make it harder to breastfeed. But remember that for breastfeeding to work, your baby has to latch on to both the nipple and the breast, so even inverted nipples can work just fine. Often, flat and inverted nipples will protrude more over time, as the baby sucks more. ''Very large nipples can make it hard for the baby to get enough of the areola into his or her mouth to compress the milk ducts and get enough milk. ''Ask for help if you have questions about your nipple shape or type, especially if your baby is having trouble latching well. ' Talk to your doctor or a lactation consultant if you are concerned about your 
nipples.  You can use your fingers to try and pull your nipples out. There are 
also special devices designed to pull out inverted or temporarily flattened 
nipples.  The latch for babies of mothers with very large nipples will improve 
with time as the baby grows. In some cases, it might take several weeks to get 
the baby to latch well. But if a mother has a good milk supply, her baby will 
get enough milk even with a poor latch. "
Breastfeeding a baby with health problems,"""There are some health problems in babies that can make it harder to breastfeed. Yet breast milk and early breastfeeding are still best for the health of both you and your baby - even more so if your baby is premature or sick. Even if your baby cannot breastfeed directly from you, it's best to express or pump your milk and give it to your baby with a cup or dropper. ""'Some common health problems in babies are listed below. ''Jaundice'' is caused by an excess of bilirubin, a substance that is in the blood usually in very small amounts. In the ''newborn'' period, bilirubin can build up faster than it can be removed from the intestinal track. ''Jaundice'' can appear as a yellowing of the skin and eyes. It affects most newborns to some degree, appearing between the second and third day of life. The jaundice usually clears up by two weeks of age and is not harmful. ''Two types of jaundice can affect breastfed infants - breastfeeding jaundice and breast milk jaundice. '""Your baby's doctor may monitor your baby's bilirubin level with blood tests. Jaundice is best treated by breastfeeding more frequently or for longer periods of time. It is crucial to have a health care provider help you make sure the baby is latching on and removing milk well. This is usually all that is needed for the infant's body to rid itself of excess bilirubin. ""'Some babies will also need phototherapy - treatment with a special light. This light helps break down bilirubin into a form that can be removed from the body easily. If you are having trouble latching your baby to the breast, it is important that you pump or hand express to ensure a good milk supply. The same is true if the baby needs formula for a short time - pumping or hand expressing will make sure the baby has enough milk when you return to breastfeeding. ''It is important to keep in mind that breastfeeding is best for your baby. Even if your baby experiences jaundice, this is not something that you caused. Your health care providers can help you make sure that your baby is eating well and that the jaundice goes away. '""Ask for help! If your baby develops jaundice once at home, let your baby's doctor know. Discuss treatment options and let the doctor know that you do not want to interrupt breastfeeding if at all possible.""'Some babies have a condition called gastroesophageal (GASS-troh-uh-SOF-uh-JEE-uhl) reflux disease (''GERD''), which occurs when the muscle at the opening of the stomach opens at the wrong times. This allows milk and food to come back up into the ''esophagus'', the tube in the throat. Some ''symptoms of GERD'' can include: ''Many healthy babies might have some of these symptoms and not have ''GERD''. But there are babies who might only have a few of these symptoms and have a severe case of GERD. Not all babies with GERD spit up or vomit. More severe cases of GERD may need to be treated with medication if the baby refuses to nurse, gains weight poorly or is losing weight, or has periods of gagging or choking. '""Ask for help! See your baby's doctor if he or she spits up after every feeding and has any of the other symptoms mentioned here. If your baby has GERD, it is important to continue breastfeeding. Breast milk is more easily digested than ""'infant formula''. ''Cleft palate'' and ''cleft lip'' are some of the most common ''birth defects'' that happen as a baby is developing in the womb. A cleft, or opening, in either the palate or lip can happen together or separately and both can be corrected through surgery. Both conditions can prevent babies from forming a good seal around the nipple and areola with his or her mouth, or effectively remove milk from the breast. A mother can try different breastfeeding positions and use her thumb or breast to help fill in the opening left by the lip to form a seal around the breast. '""Right after birth, a mother whose baby has a cleft palate can try to breastfeed her baby. She can also start expressing her milk right away to keep up her supply. Even if her baby can't latch on well to her breast, the baby can be fed breast milk by cup. In some hospitals, babies with cleft palate are fitted with a mouthpiece called an obturator that fits into the cleft and seals it for easier feeding. The baby should be able to exclusively breastfeed after his or her surgery. """"Ask for help! If your baby is born with a cleft palate or cleft lip, talk with a lactation consultant in the hospital. Breast milk is still best for your baby's health. ""'Premature birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks gestation. Prematurity often will mean that the baby is born at a low birth weight, defined as less than five and a half pounds. Low birth weight can also be caused by malnourishment in the mother. Arriving early or being small can make for a tough adjustment, especially if the baby has to stay in the hospital for extra care. But keep in mind that breast milk has been shown to help premature babies grow and ward off illness. ''Most babies who are low birth weight but born after 37 weeks (full term) can begin breastfeeding right away. They will need more skin-to-skin contact with mom and dad to help keep them warm. These smaller babies may also need more frequent feedings, and they may get sleepier during those feedings. ''Many babies born prematurely are often not able to breastfeed at first, but they do benefit from expressed milk. You can express colostrum by hand or pump as soon as you can in the hospital. You can talk to the hospital staff about renting a hospital grade electric pump. Call your insurance company or local WIC Office to find out if you can get reimbursed for this type of pump. You will need to express milk as often as you would have breastfed, so around 8 times per a 24-hour period. ''Once your baby is ready to breastfeed directly, skin-to-skin contact can be very calming and a great start to your first feeding. Be sure to work with a lactation consultant on proper latch and positioning. Many mothers of premature babies find the cross cradle hold helpful.\xa0 It may take some time for you and the baby to get into a good routine. ''Did you know? If you leave the hospital before your baby, you can express milk for the hospital staff to give the baby by feeding tube.' Breastfeeding jaundice can occur when a breastfeeding baby is not getting 
enough breast milk. This can happen either because of breastfeeding challenges 
or because the mother's milk hasn't yet come in. This is not caused by a problem 
with the breast milk itself.  Breast milk jaundice may be caused by substances in 
the mother's milk that prevents bilirubin from being excreted from the body. 
Such jaundice appears in some healthy, breastfed babies after about one week of 
age. It may last for a month or more and it is usually not harmful.  Severe spitting up, or spitting up after every feeding or hours after eating

Breastfeeding and special situations,"'Did you know? Many twin and multiple babies are smaller or born premature. Please see the Premature and/or low birth weight section for other tips for caring for these babies. Also, talk with a lactation consultant about more ways you can successfully breastfeed. ''The benefits of human milk to mothers of multiples and their babies are the same as for all mothers and babies - possibly greater, since many multiples are born early. But the idea may seem overwhelming! Yet many of these moms find breastfeeding easier than other feeding methods because there is nothing to prepare. Many mothers have overcome challenges to successfully breastfeed twins and more even after going back to work. ''It will help to learn as much as you can about breastfeeding during your  ''pregnancy''. You can: ''Many breastfeeding basics are the same for twins or multiples as they are for one baby. Learn more about these important topics: ''Most mothers are able to make plenty of milk for twins. Many mothers fully breastfeed or provide milk for triplets or quadruplets. Keep these tips in mind:''Breastfeeding twins and more may take practice, but you and your babies can find your ideal positions and routine. Keep trying different positions until you find ones that work for you. For some mothers and babies, breastfeeding twins at the same time works well. Others find individual feedings to work better. Still others find that it depends on the time - you may feed one baby at a time at night and feed two babies at the same time during the day. Lastly, as your babies grow, you may find that you need to change your feeding routine. ''Below are some positions that may work for you: '""Even though full, direct breastfeeding is ideal, many mothers of multiples feed their babies breast milk or some formula by bottles at times. It is important to work with your doctor, your baby's doctor, and a lactation consultant to figure out what works best for your family. ""'Breastfeeding during your next pregnancy is not a risk to either the breastfeeding toddler or to the new developing baby. If you are having some problems in your pregnancy such as uterine pain or bleeding, a history of preterm labor or problems gaining weight during pregnancy, your doctor may advise you to wean. Some women also choose to wean at this time because they have nipple soreness caused by pregnancy hormones, are nauseous, or find that their growing bellies make breastfeeding uncomfortable. Your toddler also may decide to wean on his own because of changes in the amount and flavor of your milk. He or she will need additional food and drink because you will likely make less milk during pregnancy. '""If you keep nursing your toddler after your baby is born, you can feed your newborn first to ensure he or she gets the colostrum. Once your milk production increases a few days after birth you can decide how to best meet everyone's needs, especially the new baby's needs for you and your milk. You may want to ask your partner to help you by taking care of one child while you are breastfeeding. Also, you will have a need for more fluids, healthy foods, and rest because you are taking care of yourself and two small children. ""'How much milk you can produce depends on how your surgery was done and where your incisions are, and the reasons for your surgery. Women who have had incisions in the fold under the breasts are less likely to have problems making milk than women who have had incisions around or across the areola, which can cut into milk ducts and nerves. Women who have had ''breast implants'' usually breastfeed successfully. If you ever had surgery on your breasts for any reason, talk with a lactation consultant. If you are planning breast surgery, talk with your surgeon about ways he or she can preserve as much of the breast tissue and milk ducts as possible.  ''Many mothers who adopt want to breastfeed their babies and can do it successfully with some help. Many will need to supplement their breast milk with donated breast milk from a milk bank or infant formula, but some adoptive mothers can breastfeed exclusively, especially if they have been ''pregnant'"" before. Lactation is a hormonal response to a physical action, and so the stimulation of the baby nursing causes the body to see a need for and produce milk. The more the baby nurses, the more a woman's body will produce milk. ""'If you are adopting and want to breastfeed, talk with both your doctor and a lactation consultant. They can help you decide the best way to try to establish a milk supply for your new baby. You might be able to prepare by pumping every three hours around the clock for two to three weeks before your baby arrives, or you can wait until the baby arrives and start to breastfeed then. Devices such as a supplemental nursing system (SNS) or a lactation aid can help ensure that your baby gets enough ''nutrition'' and that your breasts are stimulated to produce milk at the same time.  '""If you can't breastfeed and still want to give your baby human milk, the best and only safe place to go is to a human milk bank. You should never feed your baby breast milk that you get directly from another woman or through the Internet. A human milk bank can dispense donor human milk to you if you have a prescription from your doctor. Many steps are taken to ensure the milk is safe. Donor human milk provides the same precious nutrition and disease fighting properties as your own breast milk. ""'If your baby was born premature or has other health problems, he or she may need donated milk not only for health, but also for survival. Your baby may also need donated milk if she or he: ''You can find a human milk bank through the Human Milk Banking Association of North America External Website Policy (HMBANA). HMBANA is a multidisciplinary group of health care providers that promotes, protects, and supports donor milk banking. HMBANA is the only professional membership association for milk banks in Canada, Mexico and the United States and as such sets the standards and guidelines for donor milk banking for those areas. You can also contact HMBANA if you would like to donate breast milk. ''To find out if your insurance will cover the cost of the milk, call your insurance company or ask your doctor. If your insurance company does not cover the cost of the milk, talk with the milk bank to find out how payment can be made later on, or how to get help with the payments. A milk bank will never deny donor milk to a baby in need if they have the supply.' Take a breastfeeding class.  Find Internet and print resources for parents of 
multiples.  Join a support group for parents of multiples through your health 
care provider, hospital, local breastfeeding center, or La Leche League 
International.  Let your health care provider and family members know that you 
plan to breastfeed.  Keep in mind that even if your babies need to spend time in 
the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), breastfeeding is still possible, with 
some adjustments.  Find a lactation consultant with multiples experience before 
the babies are born so that you know where to turn for help. Ask her where you 
can rent a breast pump if the babies are born early.  How to know your babies are getting enough milk  How to troubleshoot common 
breastfeeding challenges  Ways to keep milk supply up  Breastfeeding soon after birth and often is helpful for multiples the same 
way it is for one baby. The more milk that is effectively removed, the more milk 
a mother's body will make.  If the babies are born early, double pumping often 
will help the mother make more milk.  The doctor's weight checks can tell you if 
your babies are getting enough breast milk. For other signs that your babies are 
getting enough breast milk, see the How to know your baby is getting enough milk 
section.  It helps to have each baby feed from both breasts. You can ""assign"" a 
breast to each baby for a feeding and switch at the next feeding. Or, you can 
assign a breast to each baby for a day and switch the next day. Switching 
breasts helps keep milk production up if one baby isn't eating as well for a 
bit. It also gives babies a different view to stimulate their eyes.  Double clutch (""football"") - Place both babies in the clutch hold. You will 
need pillows at your side (and maybe one on your lap) and you will place the 
babies on the pillows with their legs going toward the back of the chair or 
couch. If you are placing the babies in front of you, try to keep their whole 
bodies turned toward you, their chests against your chest. Their bodies must not 
be facing up. This is very important to help prevent nipple pain and to make 
sure that the babies are getting enough milk.  Cradle-clutch combination - Place 
one baby (usually the easiest to latch or stay latched) in the cradle position 
and then position the second baby in the clutch position.  Double cradle - Place 
the babies in front of you with their legs overlapping, making an X across your 
lap.  Can't tolerate formula  Has severe allergies  Isn't thriving on formula "
What is breast augmentation?,"'Breast augmentation'' and breast implant surgery'' are two different names used interchangeably for the same procedure. It is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of an inert or non-reactive implant below the breast tissue or muscle of the chest (pectoralis major). ''Plastic'' surgeons perform the procedure to cosmetically enhance the size, shape, and volume of the breasts.''\xa0' "
Why is breast augmentation done?,"'Breast augmentation is done to increase the size of your breasts. It may also be done to change the shape of your breasts or to correct a defect you are born with (congenital deformity). Other reasons include:' Reconstruction of the breast after cancer surgery or trauma For men, who want to increase their breast size For men/transsexuals, who are undergoing gender reassignment surgery"
What are breast implants made of?,"'The selection of implants is a joint decision made by the patient and surgeon based on the physical assessment, indication for surgery, and aesthetic goals.\xa0' The most commonly used implants are filled with silicone or saline to enhance and enlarge the size of the breast. Autogenous tissue (using tissue from one’s own body) injections like fat, muscle, etc. can be used, but the results are unpredictable. There are risks of scarring, calcium deposition, and visible uneven texture. A suction pump device has been used to enhance the shape of the breast, but the overall aesthetic results were not satisfactory."
What is a breast lift?,"'A breast lift surgery is performed to enhance existing breast tissue by lifting and tightening them, giving the breasts a natural contour, correcting asymmetry, and reducing the sagging. It restores the natural youthfulness of the breasts. Breast lift is a good option for women who have a sufficient volume of natural breast tissue. It does not involve inserting implants.' "
Can I get breast implants and a breast lift?,"'It has become increasingly popular for women to combine breast augmentation with a breast lift procedure. The combined procedure has the benefit of performing two surgeries at the same time, which is more cost-effective as the anesthesia cost and hospital expenses would be a one-time cost. The patient would also not have to undergo the recovery process twice.''Women who have gone through ''pregnancy'', ''childbirth'', and ''breastfeeding'' may benefit from a combined surgery, since the breasts undergo significant changes, such as loss of shape, firmness, and volume.' "
Which procedure is right for me?,"'Both surgeries have their own advantages and disadvantages. They are both commonly performed surgeries, with relatively low mortality and morbidity. They both provide good aesthetic results, but it is important to have realistic cosmetic goals. Consulting with a professional, board-certified ''plastic surgeon'' can help you decide.' "
What does the surgery involve?,"'The surgery involved multiple periods:''Preoperative period:''Intraoperative period:''Postoperative and recovery period:' Physical assessment by the surgeon Routine blood and radiological investigations Advised to stop smoking, drinking alcohol, and blood thinning medication before the surgery Surgery is performed under general or intravenous sedation. There will be no pain during surgery. The type of incision used is based on the surgeon’s discretion, type of implant, breast shape and size, and the scar appearance. Pain killers and antibiotics may be administered The patient may be advised to wear a surgical bra to provide support and help the healing The patient is advised to rest upright with back elevated The patient can be discharged within 24 to 48 hours after the surgery Swelling and bruising resolves in 1-2 weeks Assistance with routine activities like bathing and dressing may be required in the first week. The surgeon may advise certain exercises and massage techniques to be done in the first 2- 3 weeks. Light activities can be resumed after 2 weeks. Avoid rigorous exercises, sports, and lifting heavy objects for the first 8-12 weeks. After 4-6 weeks, patients can switch from surgical bras to bras of their choice. Patients can resume work based on the nature and requirement of the job and own comfort level after the surgeon’s approval. The scars generally heal very well and barely visible with time. A regular follow-up would be required to monitor healing."
What are the complications of surgery?,"'The surgeries are relatively safe, but like any surgery, there is a risk of complications, which usually resolve on their own or with treatment. Some possible complications are:' Hematoma (collection of blood/blood clot) Edema (swelling) Infection Temporary loss of sensation around the surgical site Thickening of scar, keloid formation, or hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin) Asymmetrical breasts Contour irregularity Capsular contracture (response of the body’s immune system to foreign material): It is characterized by a change in the shape of the breast appearing round, increasing firmness, feeling of tightness, and pain. Malposition of the implant Rupture of implants A long-term complication of the Implant: As it is a foreign body, there is a risk of hardening of the implant over time due to calcium deposits."
What is the definition of bad breath?,"'The definition of bad breath, or halitosis, is an unpleasant smell coming from the mouth. Halitosis can occur on occasion, or it can be a chronic condition. It may be caused by foods a person eats, poor oral hygiene, diseases, or other factors.' "
What are the causes and health risk factors of bad breath?,"'There are many risk factors and causes for halitosis, and even healthy people have bad breath on occasion. Some common causes of halitosis include the following:'   Food: Food is a primary source of bad odors that come from the mouth. Some foods, such as garlic, onions, spicy foods, exotic spices (such as curry), some cheeses, fish, and acidic beverages such as coffee can leave a lingering smell. Most of the time the odor is short lived. Other foods may get stuck in the teeth, promoting the growth of bacteria and dental plaques, which causes bad breath odor. Low carbohydrate diets may also cause ""ketone breath."" These diets cause the body to burn fat as its energy source. The end-product of making this energy is ketones, which cause a fruity acetone-like odor on the breath when exhaled. This fruity odor in a diabetic might indicate uncontrolled blood sugars. Tobacco products: Smoking and chewing tobacco can leave chemicals that remain in the mouth. Smoking can also precipitate other bad-breath causes such as gum disease or oral cancers. Poor oral health: When a person does not brush or floss his/her teeth regularly, food particles remaining in the mouth can rot and cause bad odors. Poor dental care can lead to a buildup of plaque in the mouth, which causes an odor of its own. Plaque buildup on the teeth can also lead to an unhealthy condition called periodontal (gum) disease. When plaque hardens, it is referred to as tartar (calculus). Tartar holds bacteria that can irritate the gums and lead to gum disease. The mild form of gum disease is called gingivitis; if gingivitis is not treated, it can advance to periodontitis. Health problems: Sinus infections, pneumonia, sore throat (pharyngitis) and other throat infections, the common cold, influenza (flu), tonsil stones (tonsilloliths), thrush, bronchitis, postnasal drip, diabetes, acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD), lactose intolerance, other stomach or digestion problems, and some liver diseases or kidney diseases may be associated with bad breath. Dry mouth: Also called xerostomia, dry mouth can also cause bad breath. Saliva helps moisten and cleanse the mouth, and when the body does not product enough saliva, bad breath may result. Dry mouth may be caused by salivary gland problems, connective tissue disorders (Sjögren's syndrome), medications, or breathing through the mouth. Allergies: Many medications used to treat allergies can cause dry mouth, another cause of halitosis. In addition, post-nasal drip is a common allergy symptom that can result in bad breath. Sinus congestion due to allergies can also cause people to breathe from their mouths, causing dry mouth. Mouth infections: Cavities, gum disease, or impacted teeth may cause bad breath. Dentures or braces: Food particles not properly cleaned from appliances such as braces can rot or cause bacteria and odor. Loose-fitting dentures may cause sores or infections in the mouth, which can cause bad breath. Medications: Many medications, including antihistamines to treat allergies and diuretics, can cause dry mouth (see above), which can cause bad breath. Other medications that may lead to bad breath may include triamterene (Dyrenium) and paraldehyde. ""Morning breath"": Bad breath in the morning is very common. Saliva production nearly stops during sleep, allowing odor-causing bacteria to grow, causing bad breath. Pregnancy: Being pregnant in itself does not cause bad breath, but the nausea and morning sickness common during pregnancy may cause bad breath. In addition, hormonal changes, dehydration, and eating different foods due to cravings may also contribute to bad breath during pregnancy. Other causes of bad breath: Objects stuck in the nose (usually in children), alcoholism, and large doses of vitamin supplements may also cause bad breath."
What signs and symptoms may be associated with bad breath?,"'It is generally simple how to tell if you have bad breath. Others may notice someone has halitosis before the person does, so another person may tell him or her about their bad breath or give them a larger than normal personal space. The most obvious sign or symptom of bad breath is noticing an unpleasant smell coming from the mouth.''Other signs and symptoms of bad breath include' unpleasant or sour taste or changes in taste, dry mouth, and a coating on the tongue."
What health care specialists treat halitosis?,"'The first stop when you have halitosis is usually your dentist. If your dentist determines you have a healthy mouth, you will likely be referred to a physician to look for an underlying health problem.''If you have periodontal disease, you may see a periodontist, a dentist who specializes in gum disease and ''dental implants''.'""If you have braces, it's like that your bad breath is caused by food getting stuck in them. You may see your orthodontist for an adjustment.""'Bad breath in ''babies'"" or young children may be a sign of infection or undiagnosed medical problems. Consult a child's pediatrician or dentist if an infant or young child has bad breath."" "
When should someone see a health care professional about bad breath?,"'If proper oral hygiene does not get rid of bad breath, see a dentist or doctor for a diagnosis if bad breath is accompanied by''Also see a doctor or dentist if bad breath develops after taking a new medication, after recent ''dental surgery'', or any other symptoms develop that are of concern.' persistent dry mouth, sores in the mouth, pain or difficulty with chewing or swallowing, broken teeth or dental pain, white spots on the tonsils, and/or fever or fatigue."
How do health care professionals diagnose halitosis?,"'You have halitosis if you have bad breath, and a doctor is not needed to diagnose the condition. However, if your bad breath is chronic, if it does not go away with proper oral hygiene, or you have other symptoms, you will need to see a doctor or dentist to diagnose the underlying cause.''A doctor or dentist will examine your mouth to look for signs of gum disease, dry mouth, or infections that may be the cause of your bad breath.' "
What are treatment options and home remedies for bad breath? What can be done to prevent bad breath?,"'Treatment of bad breath depends on the cause.''The American Dental Association recommends the following:''Keep the mouth moist by drinking water and chewing sugarless gum or sugar-free hard candy to stimulate the production of saliva. Mouthwash may temporarily mask bad breath odors, but it may not treat the underlying cause.''Natural remedies used in the treatment of bad breath include chewing on mint or parsley.''If bad breath is due to a health problem such as a ''sinus infection'', ''diabetes'', acid reflux (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'', or ''GERD''), etc., then the underlying medical issue needs to be treated.''If bad breath is a side effect of taking a medication, discuss with a health care professional whether there are other options for medication that can be taken. Never stop taking a medication without first consulting your health care professional.''For patients who suffer from dry mouth (xerostomia), artificial saliva may be prescribed by a dentist.'   Brush and floss teeth regularly. Remember to brush the tongue, too, to remove bacteria from its surface. Brushing the tongue can help with bad breath caused by foods a person has eaten. See a dentist regularly for checkups and to ensure dentures or braces are properly fitted and cleaned (and clean dentures thoroughly each night). Quit smoking or using chewing tobacco. Sugarless gum and sugar-free candy can also keep the mouth from drying out. Keep the mouth moist by drinking water and chewing sugarless gum or sugar-free hard candy to stimulate the production of saliva. Eat a diet of foods that need to be thoroughly chewed to keep saliva flowing. Foods that require a lot of chewing, such as apples or carrots, are good options. Over-the-counter mouthwash can help kill bad breath-causing bacteria and may temporarily mask bad breath odors, but it may not treat the underlying cause."
What products can be used to eliminate or mask bad breath?,"'Bad breath that is due to simple causes such as foods may be more easily masked or eliminated than bad breath due to medical conditions, infections, or medication side effects.''There are some things a person can do to eliminate or at least temporarily mask bad breath.'   Good oral hygiene: Brushing the teeth and tongue, and flossing, keeps the mouth healthy and can often get rid of bad breath, at least in the short term. Mouthwash may temporarily mask bad breath and can help with oral hygiene. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugar-free mints may temporarily mask bad breath odor. For more serious cases of bad breath, dentists can prescribe special toothpaste and mouthwash that can improve the symptoms of bad breath."
What is the prognosis for people with halitosis?,"'Most of the time, bad breath can be cured and prevented with proper oral hygiene. It is rarely life-threatening, and the prognosis is good. However, bad breath may be a complication of a medical disorder that needs to be treated.' "
What is the hydrogen breath test?,"'The hydrogen breath test is a test that uses the measurement of hydrogen in the breath to diagnose several conditions that cause gastrointestinal symptoms. In humans, only bacteria - specifically, anaerobic bacteria in the colon - are capable of producing hydrogen. The bacteria produce hydrogen when they are exposed to unabsorbed food, particularly sugars and carbohydrates, but not proteins or ''fats''. Although limited hydrogen is produced from the small amounts of unabsorbed food that normally reach the colon, large amounts of hydrogen may be produced when there is a problem with the ''digestion'' or absorption of food in the small intestine, that allows more unabsorbed food to reach the colon.''Large amounts of hydrogen also may be produced when the colon bacteria move back into the small intestine, a condition called bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel. In this latter instance, the bacteria are exposed to unabsorbed food that has not yet had a chance to completely traverse the small intestine to be fully digested and absorbed. Some of the hydrogen produced by the bacteria, whether in the small intestine or the colon, is absorbed into the blood flowing through the wall of the small intestine and colon. The hydrogen-containing blood travels to the ''lungs'' where the hydrogen is released and exhaled in the breath where it can be measured.' "
When is hydrogen breath testing used?,"'Hydrogen breath testing is used in the diagnosis of three conditions. '   The first is a condition in which dietary sugars are not digested normally. The most common sugar that is poorly digested is lactose, the sugar in milk. Individuals who are unable to properly digest lactose are referred to as lactose intolerant. Testing also may be used to diagnose problems with the digestion of other sugars such as sucrose, fructose and sorbitol.  The second condition for which hydrogen breath testing is used is for diagnosing bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel, a condition in which larger-than-normal numbers of colonic bacteria are present in the small intestine.  The third condition for which hydrogen breath testing is used is for diagnosing rapid passage of food through the small intestine. All three of these conditions may cause abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and distention, flatulence (passing gas in large amounts), and diarrhea."
How does hydrogen breath testing work?,"'The bacteria in the colon, including the anaerobic bacteria, are able to digest and use sugars and carbohydrates as food. When the anaerobic bacteria digest sugars and carbohydrates, they convert some of the sugars and carbohydrates into gases, most commonly hydrogen. They also may produce and release into the colon other substances, for example, chemicals that cause the colon to secrete water and cause ''diarrhea''.''As previously discussed, some of the hydrogen gas is absorbed by the colon into the blood and is eliminated in the breath where it can be measured. As long as little sugar or carbohydrate reaches the colon, the small amounts of gas and other substances that are produced do not cause a problem. When larger amounts of sugar or carbohydrate reach the colon because they are not digested and absorbed in the small intestine, larger amounts of gas and substances are formed in the colon.''For example, if an individual digests and absorbs the sugar in milk (lactose) normally, then none of the lactose that is given for the lactose hydrogen breath test reaches the colon, and no increase in the concentration of hydrogen in the breath is seen during the breath test. On the other hand, if the individual does not digest and absorb the lactose completely, that is, he or she is lactose intolerant, the lactose travels through the small intestine and enters the colon where the bacteria digest it and produce hydrogen. An increase in hydrogen in the breath then is seen. Other sugars for which poor digestion can be diagnosed by breath testing include sucrose and fructose (found in ''corn'' syrup), and sorbitol (a sugar that is used as a low-calorie sweetener).''There are ways other than abnormal digestion of dietary sugars by which the bacteria can cause problems. Unlike in the colon, the number of hydrogen-producing, anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine is small. If, however, large numbers of hydrogen-producing bacteria move into the small intestine from the colon, a condition called bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel, the bacteria may digest the sugars and carbohydrates before the small bowel has had a chance to digest and absorb them and produce large amounts of hydrogen.''Finally, if individuals have abnormally rapid passage of food through the small intestine, there may not be enough time for the small intestine to digest and absorb sugars and carbohydrates. This results in the entry of larger amounts of sugar and carbohydrate into the colon where the bacteria can digest and convert them to gas.''To diagnose bacterial overgrowth and rapid transit through the small intestine, a sugar that is not digested and absorbed by man, such as ''lactulose'', usually is used for the test. In the case of rapid passage through the small intestine, the sugar passes quickly through the small intestine and into the colon so that hydrogen is found in the breath very soon after ingestion of the sugar. In the case of bacterial overgrowth, production of hydrogen occurs twice during the test. Once as the sugar passes the bacteria in the small intestine and again when the sugar enters the colon.' "
How is hydrogen breath testing performed?,"'Prior to hydrogen breath testing, the patient fasts for at least 12 hours. At the start of the test, the patient blows into and fills a balloon with a breath of air. The concentration of hydrogen is measured in a sample of breath removed from the balloon. The patient then ingests a small amount of the test sugar (lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, fructose, lactulose, etc. depending on the purpose of the test). Additional samples of breath are collected and analyzed for hydrogen every 15 minutes for up to five hours.' "
How are the results of hydrogen breath testing interpreted?,"'The interpretation of the results of hydrogen breath testing depends on the sugar that is used for testing, and the pattern of hydrogen production after the sugar is ingested.''After ingestion of test doses of the dietary sugars lactose, sucrose, fructose or sorbitol, any production of hydrogen means that there has been a problem with digestion or absorption of the test sugar and that some of the sugar has reached the colon. ''When rapid intestinal transit is present, the test dose of non-digestible lactulose reaches the colon more quickly than normally, and, therefore, hydrogen is produced by the colonic bacteria soon after the sugar is ingested. ''When bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel is present, ingestion of lactulose results in two separate periods during the test in which hydrogen is produced, an earlier period caused by the bacteria in the small intestine and a later one caused by the bacteria in the colon.'  "
What are the limitations of hydrogen breath testing?,"'There are several limitations to hydrogen breath testing. For unclear reasons, testing for bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel with lactulose can diagnose only 60% of cases. (This insensitivity of the test may be due in part to the strict criteria that are used for interpreting a test as abnormal. Less strict criteria may diagnose overgrowth more often.) In addition, with bacterial overgrowth there may be an overlap of the early and later periods of hydrogen production that can be misinterpreted as a single period characteristic of rapid intestinal transit. Finally, some normal individuals may have slow transit through the small intestine making prolonged testing - up to 5 hours - necessary, and many individuals are unwilling to undergo such prolonged testing.''Some individuals do not have bacteria that produce hydrogen, and in these individuals hydrogen breath testing is not possible. Most of these individuals have bacteria that produce a different gas, methane. (There also are individuals who produce both hydrogen and methane.) Methane can be measured in the breath just like hydrogen, and the production of methane can be used for diagnosis in the same way as hydrogen. There is much less experience with methane, however, and the production of methane is more complex than the production of hydrogen. Therefore, it is not clear if the pattern of methane production after ingestion of sugars can be interpreted in the same way as hydrogen production, particularly for the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth.'""A pattern of hydrogen production that is typical for bacterial overgrowth does not necessarily mean that an individual's symptoms are caused by the overgrowth. For example, there may be anatomic abnormalities of the small intestine such as narrowing or functional abnormalities in the way the muscle of the small intestine works. These abnormalities can cause symptoms of bloating, distention, ""'pain'', and ''diarrhea'' themselves, but they also can lead to bacterial overgrowth with its similar symptoms. Therefore, it may be an underlying abnormality that is responsible for the symptoms and not the bacterial overgrowth. The only way to differentiate between the two causes of symptoms-an underlying problem or bacterial overgrowth - is to treat and eradicate the bacteria. If the symptoms disappear, then it is more likely that it is the overgrowth rather than the underlying abnormality that is responsible for the symptoms.''Any condition that results in the delivery of undigested or unabsorbed food to the colon may result in abnormal breath tests when dietary sugars are used for testing. Both pancreatic insufficiency and the condition called ''celiac sprue'' can cause abnormal breath tests, in the former instance because pancreatic enzymes that are necessary for the digestion of carbohydrates are missing, and in the latter instance because the lining of the small intestine is destroyed, and digested food cannot be absorbed. It may be necessary to exclude these causes of abnormal breath tests by additional tests-pancreatic function tests and small intestinal biopsy.' "
Are there other ways in which hydrogen breath testing can be used?,"'Antibiotics are used for treating bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel; however, any one antibiotic may be effective at eliminating the overgrowing bacteria only 50%-60% of the time. Therefore, if symptoms do not disappear in an individual following treatment with antibiotics, it may be useful to repeat the breath test to determine if the antibiotics have eliminated the bacteria. If not, a different antibiotic or non-antibiotic treatment can be tried.' "
What are the side effects of hydrogen breath testing?,"'The side effects of hydrogen breath testing are exactly what one would expect to see in individuals who poorly digest and absorb sugars and carbohydrates, for example, bloating, distention, ''pain'', and diarrhea. When lactulose is used these symptoms are unlikely to occur or are mild because the dose of lactulose used for testing is small.'  "
What are the alternatives to hydrogen breath testing?,"'For diagnosing ''lactose intolerance'', an alternative procedure to breath testing requires blood samples to be taken after the ingestion of lactose. If the digestion and absorption of lactose is normal, the levels of glucose in the blood should rise. The elevation of blood glucose occurs because the lactose is broken down into its two component sugars, galactose and glucose, as it is absorbed into the blood. A second alternative is to give a dose of lactose (or other dietary sugar) and observe an individual for symptoms. If the individual is intolerant, bloating, distention, pain, ''flatulence'', and diarrhea are likely to occur. A third alternative is a trial of a ''diet'' in which the potentially-offending sugar is strictly eliminated. All of these alternatives, however, have limitations and problems.''Bacterial overgrowth can be diagnosed by culturing (growing) the bacteria from a sample of fluid from the small intestine and counting the numbers of colonic bacteria that are present. This procedure requires a tube to be passed through the nose, throat, ''esophagus'' and stomach under X-ray guidance so that fluid can be obtained from the small intestine. It is an uncomfortable and expensive procedure, and most laboratories are not able to accurately culture the samples. Hence, this test is not performed routinely.' "
What is the urea breath test?,"'The urea breath test (UBT) is a test for diagnosing the presence of a bacterium, '' ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori'') infection in the stomach. ''H. pylori'' causes inflammation, ulcers, and atrophy of the stomach. The test also may be used to demonstrate that ''H. pylori'' has been eliminated by treatment with antibiotics.'  "
What is the preparation for the urea breath test? How is it performed?,"'Your\xa0doctor or other health care professional will provide you with instructions to prepare for the urea breath test.''During the test you will swallow a capsule containing urea, which is made from an isotope of carbon. (Isotopes of carbon occur in minuscule amounts in nature, and can be measured with special testing machines.) If ''H. pylori'' is present in the stomach, the urea is broken up and turned into carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is absorbed across the lining of the stomach and into the blood. It then travels in the blood to the ''lungs'' where it is excreted in the breath. Samples of exhaled breath are collected, and the isotopic carbon in the exhaled carbon dioxide is measured.' "
How does the urea breath test diagnose H. pylori infection?,"'The urea breath test is based on the ability of ''H. pylori'' to break down urea, a chemical made up of nitrogen and carbon into carbon dioxide. which then is absorbed from the stomach and eliminated in the breath. (Urea normally is produced by the body from excess or ""waste"" nitrogen-containing chemicals and then eliminated in the urine.)' "
How are the results of the urea breath test interpreted?,"'If the urea breath test is positive and the isotope is detected in the breath, it means that ''H. pylori'' is present in the stomach. If the isotope is not found in the breath, the test results are negative for the infection.''When the ''H. pylori'' is effectively treated (eradicated) by antibiotics, the test changes from positive (isotope present) to negative (isotope absent).' "
"Are there any side effects, risks, or complications of the urea breath test?","'There are no side effects, risks, or complications of the urea breath test. You do not need to stop taking medications, including ''proton pump inhibitors'' (''PPIs''), prior to having the procedure performed by a doctor.'  "
What are sleep related breathing disorders?,"'Sleep'' related ''breathing'' disorders are a group of disorders that affect our breathing while we are asleep, and are characterized by disruptions of normal breathing patterns that only occur during ''sleep''. Therefore, the person with the disorder may be the last to know he or she has a problem. Sleep related breathing disorders constitute a subset of the broad group of ''sleep disorders'' that include many other disorders such as ''insomnia'' (difficulty sleeping), hypersomnias (inappropriately falling asleep, for example, ''narcolepsy''), parasomnias (activities during sleep, for example, ''sleepwalking'' and sleep terrors), and sleep related movement disorders (for example, ''restless leg syndrome''). The most common sleep related breathing disorders are ''snoring'' and ''sleep apnea''.'  "
Why do we sleep?,"'This is a complex topic that we only partially understand. Mammals, reptiles, birds, and even fruit flies have been observed sleeping. A manatee can sleep with one side of its brain while the other side is awake and alert. Sleeping in this way avoids a long period of unconsciousness, during which it would be very vulnerable. Humans typically need 7-8 hours of sleep every night, but individuals vary in their need for sleep. Sleep should be restorative and is necessary to maintain health. During sleep, we rest and repair our muscles and organize our thoughts and memories. Therefore, if we become sleep deprived, we feel both physically fatigued and mentally exhausted. Many studies show that sleep deprivation causes a decrease in problem solving ability, attention, and manual reflex times.' "
What are the stages of sleep?,"'Sleep stages can be measured by monitoring the electrical impulses within the brain, often termed brain waves. These electrical impulses, or brain waves can be monitored with an ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG''). Sleep can be broken up into three stages and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Stage 1 sleep is the most superficial and stage 4 is the deepest. Stage 1 and 2 sleep are both considered to be light sleep, while stage 3 sleep is deeper, more restorative sleep. This stage is important for the body to feel well. ''REM sleep'' is the sleep stage in which we typically dream. During REM, the brain sends signals to the muscles to relax, so we do not ""act out"" our dreams. The relaxation of muscles in REM sleep can sometimes worsen sleep related breathing disorders like ''snoring'' and ''sleep apnea''. We typically spend about 50% of our sleep in stages 1 and 2, 25% in stages 3, and 25% in REM sleep.''For additional information please visit the Sleep Center.' "
What is endotracheal intubation?,"'Endotracheal intubation is a procedure by which a tube is inserted through the mouth down into the trachea (the large ''airway'' from the mouth to the ''lungs''). Before surgery, this is often done under deep sedation. In emergency situations, the patient is often unconscious at the time of this procedure.' "
What kind of tube is used?,'The tube that is used today is usually a flexible ''plastic'' tube. It is called an endotracheal tube because it is slipped within the trachea.' 
How do they put the tube down into the trachea?,"""The doctor often inserts the tube with the help of a laryngoscope, an instrument that permits the doctor to see the upper portion of the trachea, just below the vocal cords. During the procedure the laryngoscope is used to hold the tongue aside while inserting the tube into the trachea. It is important that the head be positioned in the appropriate manner to allow for proper visualization. Pressure is often applied to the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) to help with visualization and prevent possible aspiration of stomach contents."" "
What is the purpose of endotracheal intubation?,"'The endotracheal tube serves as an open passage through the upper airway. The purpose of endotracheal intubation is to permit air to pass freely to and from the lungs in order to ventilate the lungs. Endotracheal tubes can be connected to ventilator machines to provide artificial ''respiration''. This can help when a patient is unconscious and by maintaining a patent airway, especially during surgery. It is often used when patients are critically ill and cannot maintain adequate respiratory function to meet their needs. The endotracheal tube facilitates the use of a mechanical ventilator in these critical situations.'  "
Is endotracheal intubation used for COVID-19 coronavirus patients?,"'Endotracheal intubation is the approved way of providing ''breathing'' support to ''COVID-19'"" coronavirus disease patients as of this article's update in early April, 2020.\xa0""'Non-invasive mechanical ventilation\xa0like ''CPAP'' (continuous positive airway pressure) machines used for ''sleep apnea'' are not good for ''COVID-19'"" patients, according to clinical guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists. In some cases, CPAP\xa0masks or\xa0nasal pillows\xa0may provide adequate oxygen, but current devices aerosolize\xa0virus particles in the patient's breath and spread them around wherever\xa0the patient is housed, potentially infecting\xa0more people in the area.""'Endotracheal intubation and ventilation supports a ''COVID-19'"" patient's breathing so the body can survive as\xa0the immune system fights the virus. This means a better chance of\xa0fighting off the virus, but ventilators can't cure COVID-19."" "
What are the complications of endotracheal intubation?,"'If the tube is inadvertently placed in the ''esophagus'' (right behind the trachea), adequate respirations will not occur. ''Brain damage'', ''cardiac arrest'', and death can occur. Aspiration of stomach contents can result in ''pneumonia'' and ''ARDS''. Placement of the tube too deep can result in only one lung being ventilated and can result in a ''pneumothorax'' as well as inadequate ventilation. During endotracheal tube placement, damage can also occur to the ''teeth'', the soft tissues in the back of the throat, as well as the vocal cords.''This procedure should be performed by a physician with experience in intubation. In the vast majority of cases of intubation, no significant complications occur.'  "
What Are the Benefits of Dental Bridges?,'Bridges:' Restore your smile Restore your ability to properly chew and speak Maintain the shape of your face Distribute the forces in your bite properly by replacing missing teeth Prevent remaining teeth from drifting out of position
What Types of Dental Bridges Are Available?,"'There are three main types of bridges:' Traditional bridges involve creating a crown for the tooth or implant on either side of the missing tooth, with a pontic in between. Traditional bridges are the most common type of bridge and are made of either porcelain fused to metal or ceramics. Cantilever bridges are used when there are adjacent teeth on only one side of the missing tooth or teeth. 
Cantilever bridges are usually used to replace only one tooth. Maryland bonded bridges (also called a resin-bonded bridge or a Maryland bridge) are made of plastic teeth and gums supported by a metal framework. Metal wings on each side of the bridge are bonded to your existing teeth."
What Is the Process for Obtaining a Dental Bridge?,"'During the first visit, the abutment teeth are prepared for the crown. Preparation involves recontouring these teeth by removing a portion of enamel to allow room for a crown to be placed over them. Next, impressions of your teeth are made, which serve as a model from which the bridge, pontic, and crowns will be made by a dental laboratory. Your dentist will make a temporary bridge for you to wear to protect the exposed teeth and gums while your bridge is being made.'""During the second visit, your temporary bridge will be removed and the new permanent bridge will be checked and adjusted, as necessary, to achieve a proper fit. Multiple visits may be required to check the fit of the metal framework and bite. This is dependent on each individual's case. If the ""'dental bridge'' is a fixed (permanent) bridge, your dentist may temporarily cement it in place for a couple of weeks to make sure it is fitting properly. After a couple weeks, the bridge is permanently cemented into place.'  "
How Much Do Dental Bridges Cost?,'The cost of dental bridges varies depending on the type of bridge selected and the area of the country in which the procedure is performed. Dental insurance will typically pay a percentage of the fee depending on the individual dental plan.' 
How Long Do Dental Bridges Last?,"'Dental bridges can last 5 to 15 years and even longer. With good oral hygiene and regular prophylaxis, it is not unusual for the life span of a fixed bridge to be over 10 years.' "
Will It Be Difficult to Eat with a Dental Bridge?,"'Replacing missing teeth should actually make eating easier. Until you become accustomed to the bridge, eat soft foods that have been cut into small pieces.' "
Will the Dental Bridge Change How I Speak?,'It can be difficult to speak clearly when teeth are missing in the front or anterior areas. Wearing a dental bridge with the anterior teeth in their proper relationship will help you speak properly.' 
How Do I Care for My Bridges?,"'It is important to keep your remaining teeth healthy and strong as the success of the bridge (depending on the type selected) depends on the solid foundation offered by the surrounding teeth. Brushing twice a day and flossing daily helps prevent ''tooth decay'' and ''gum disease'' that can lead to tooth loss. Your dentist or dental hygienist can demonstrate how to properly brush and floss your teeth. Keeping a regular cleaning schedule will help diagnose problems at an early stage when treatment has a better prognosis. Selecting a balanced ''diet'' for proper ''nutrition'' is also important.''Reviewed by the doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Reviewed by Jay H.

What is a brief psychotic disorder?,"'Brief psychotic disorder is one of a number of mental illnesses that are referred to as ''schizophrenia'' spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Characteristics of this disorder may include hallucinations or delusions that last no more than one month. Studies show that a true brief psychotic episode that does not progress to another mental illness occurs in anywhere from one to four per 100,000 people, more commonly in women than in men. This illness usually develops in people 30-50 years of age, and an episode tends to last an average of 17 days. This differs somewhat from people who suffer from any first-time psychotic episode, which occurs in about 100,000 ''teens'' and young adults in the United States every year, has a peak onset between the ages of 15-25 years, and more commonly affects males versus females.''In addition to the more commonly known mental disorders like ''schizophrenia'', other mental disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders group includes ''schizotypal personality disorder'', delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, ''schizoaffective disorder'', ''catatonia'', substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, psychosis due to a medical condition, other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, as well as unspecified schizophrenia spectrum, and other psychotic disorders. Besides catatonia, other catatonia-related disorders include catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, as well as unspecified catatonia.' "
What are causes and risk factors for brief psychotic disorder?,"'Except for those psychotic disorders that result from the use of a substance or a medical condition, specific causes for most psychotic disorders are not known. However, the interplay of genetic (familial), biological, environmental, and psychological factors is thought to be involved. We do not yet understand all of the causes and other issues involved, but current research is making steady progress toward elucidating and defining causes of brief psychotic disorder and other psychotic disorders.''In biological models of psychotic disorders, genetic predisposition, infectious agents, toxins, ''allergies'', differences in brain structure, and disturbances in metabolism have all been researched. Psychotic disorders like brief psychotic disorder are known to run in families. For example, people who have a close family member who has suffered from an episode of brief psychosis are more likely to develop the disorder than people with no such family history. Toxins like ''marijuana'' increase the risk of developing psychosis. Some medications are thought to be associated with developing, while not directly triggering, this illness in some people. Studies have not seemed to find ethnic differences in developing brief psychotic disorder.''The current concept is that multiple genes are involved in the development of psychosis and that risk factors such as ''prenatal'' (intrauterine), perinatal (around the time of birth), and nonspecific stressors are involved in creating a disposition or vulnerability to develop the illness. Neurotransmitters (chemicals allowing the communication among nerve cells) have also been implicated in the development of psychotic disorders like brief psychotic disorder. The list of neurotransmitters under scrutiny is long, but special attention has been given to ''dopamine'', serotonin, and glutamate.''One form of brief psychotic disorder referred to as brief reactive psychosis has been found to be triggered by very stressful experiences, like placement in solitary confinement. People who have a low income, are unemployed, or are living alone are at higher risk for developing brief psychotic disorder than those who do not have these experiences.' "
What are brief psychotic disorder symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of brief psychotic disorder can include the following:'   Delusions (beliefs that have no basis in reality) Hallucinations (for example, hearing voices or other noises not based in reality; seeing or otherwise perceiving things not actually present in any way) Disorganized speech (frequently off topic or nonsensical) Severely disorganized or catatonic behavior"
How do physicians diagnose brief psychotic disorder?,"'Since there is no specific test, like an X-ray, that can accurately diagnose a person with brief psychotic disorder, people who are concerned that they may suffer from this illness might consider taking a self-test, either an online or printable, like the Yale PRIME Screen, the Youth Psychosis at-Risk Test, the Schizophrenia Test, or the Early Psychosis Indicator.''To determine if a person suffers from brief psychotic disorder, health care professionals will conduct a mental health interview that looks for any history and the presence of symptoms, also called diagnostic criteria, that were previously described. As with any mental health evaluation, the practitioner will usually seek to rule out other mental health conditions, including mood problems like ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' disorders, ''panic attacks'' or generalized ''anxiety'', psychotic disorders other than brief psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia, schizotypal personality disorder, delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, ''schizoaffective disorder'', or catatonia. In addition to guarding against having brief psychotic disorder misdiagnosed as another psychotic disorder or ''delirium'' (sudden ''confusion'' due to a medical or mental illness), the mental health examiner may assess that while some symptoms (traits) of the disorder are present, the person does not fully qualify for the diagnosis. Since brief psychotic disorder can co-occur with a life-threatening condition like delirium, the presence of those disorders will also likely be explored.'""The process of determining the presence of brief psychotic disorder will also likely include the professional trying to ensure that the person does not have a medical problem that may cause emotional symptoms that are similar to those of brief psychotic disorder. The mental health professional will therefore often ask when the person has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood testing, and any other tests that may be necessary to ensure that the individual is not suffering from a medical illness instead of or along with their emotional symptoms. Since the mental health interview is used in making the diagnosis and the significant impact that having brief psychotic disorder or a related diagnosis can have on the person's life, it is of great importance that the practitioner conducts a comprehensive assessment.""""In assessing for brief psychotic disorder, the evaluator will likely inquire if the individual's symptoms occur for the required one-day to one-month time period and are not better explained by a mood disorder (like ""'major depression'' or ''bipolar disorder'"" with psychotic features), another psychotic disorder, or occurs during the postpartum period (four weeks after a woman gives birth) is the result of the physical effects of a substance or other medical illness. The diagnosis should not be assigned if the person's symptoms are part of and sanctioned by the person's culture. Formerly, the term ""'brief reactive psychosis'' was used to describe the situation in which brief psychotic disorder occurs in reaction to events that most people would feel are very stressful (for example, ''trauma'').' "
What is the treatment for brief psychotic disorder?,"'Given the brief duration of brief psychotic disorder, medications tend to be an important part of addressing many of its symptoms. The first line of treatment includes atypical antipsychotics, for example:''The latter is rarely indicated specifically for the treatment of the brief psychotic disorder. This group of medications might cause ''weight gain'', drowsiness, and changes ion blood ''sugar'' and ''cholesterol''.''The first generation, or typical, antipsychotic medication also used for the treatment of schizophrenia, and includes medications like:''These are now known as ""neuroleptics"" because, while they tend to be effective in treating positive symptoms of psychosis (for example, ''paranoia'' or other delusions, hallucinations), many of the side effects they can cause affect the neurologic (nervous) system. Examples of such side effects are muscle ''stiffness'' or rigidity, jitteriness, ''tremors'', and muscle twitches. These older medications are thought to be not as effective against so-called negative symptoms like catatonia.''Since people with brief psychotic disorder are at increased risk of also having ''depression'', medications that address that symptom can be an important part of treatment. These include serotonergic medications like:''They are often prescribed because of their effectiveness and infrequent occurrence of side effects. Other ''antidepressant'' medications used to treat the ''depression'' that can be associated with brief psychotic disorder include:''Cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (''CBT'') has been found to be helpful in helping the brief psychotic disorder sufferer manage some of the symptoms of this illness. CBT is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on helping the person understand and ultimately better manage how their thoughts and behaviors affect each other.'  risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), lurasidone (Latuda), and clozapine (Clozaril). chlorpromazine (Thorazine), haloperidol (Haldol), fluphenazine (Prolixin), thiothixene (Navane), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), perphenazine (Trilafon), and thioridazine (Mellaril). fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro) venlafaxine (Effexor), duloxetine (Cymbalta), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), and bupropion (Wellbutrin)."
What are complications of brief psychotic disorder?,"'While most people who have an episode of brief psychotic disorder tend to never experience another one, some will go on to develop a more chronic psychotic mental illness like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Some may evolve into having psychosis as part of a mood or personality disorder. As such, individuals who have brief psychotic disorder can be susceptible to the unemployment, fractured relationships, medical illnesses, and even early mortality of these other psychotic disorders .' "
What is the prognosis of brief psychotic disorder?,"'The prognosis of brief psychotic disorder tends to be better than that of other psychotic disorders and comparable to the prognosis of mood disorders that have psychotic features. Women, as well as anyone who has a history of having a healthy level of functioning before developing the illness, tend to recover best after suffering from brief psychotic disorder. Overall, women tend to recover and have no further recurrence of psychotic symptoms compared to men. People who receive treatment for this illness are less likely to suffer a recurrence compared to people who do not get treatment.' "
Is it possible to prevent brief psychotic disorder?,"""Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the person who has multiple risk factors for developing psychosis but has yet to have such symptoms, or who has had an episode of brief psychotic disorder, has been found to be effective at helping prevent such symptoms. In individuals who have had brief psychotic disorder, also providing his or her family with support and education about their loved one's condition has been found to be quite effective in the ""'prevention'' of recurrent psychotic symptoms in the individual with the illness. For women who have developed brief psychotic disorder in the form of ''postpartum psychosis'' in the past, preterm delivery of subsequent ''pregnancy'', and prevention of future ''pregnancies'' for extreme episodes has been found to help prevent further episodes of the disorder.'

What is brittle bone disease (osteogenesis imperfecta)?,"'Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) refers to a group of bone diseases that have in common a defect in bone formation. There are at least 8 known types of osteogenesis imperfecta that range in severity, but people with all types of the condition have bones that tend to break easily, also referred to as brittle bones. Brittle bone disease is estimated to affect 6 or 7 out of every 100,000 people worldwide.''Other names for osteogenesis imperfecta include:' Brittle bone disease Glass bone disease Fragile bone disease Ekman-Lobstein Disease Lobstein Disease (Type I) Vrolik Disease (Type II)"
What is temporary brittle bone disease?,"'Temporary brittle bone disease is not the same thing as osteogenesis imperfecta. It is a term that has been used to describe frequent fractures occurring during the first year of life, although a definite cause of the condition has not been identified.''The term ""temporary brittle bone disease"" is controversial because many fractures that cannot otherwise be accounted for have been suggested as forms of deliberate injury, and some experts have argued that temporary brittle bone disease does not exist. Other experts argue that nutritional deficiencies, metabolic conditions, or other temporary conditions can render bones susceptible to ''fracture'' in the first year, since these fractures often occur in the absence of other signs of deliberate injury such as ''bruising''.' "
Is the cause of brittle bone disease genetic (inherited)?,"'Brittle bone disease is caused by genetic defects, or mutations. These mutations can either be ''inherited'' from the parents or may arise on their own as new mutations.''Most cases of brittle bone disease are inherited from the parents (congenital) in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the defective gene is necessary (from one parent) for the condition to be present. However, some forms of the condition may be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that two copies of a defective gene are required (one from each parent). Mutations in the COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP and P3H1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta. These genes code for proteins that are important for collagen formation. Collagen is an important component of bones and other body structures.' "
What are the 8 types of brittle bone disease?,'Osteogenesis imperfecta is divided into eight types designated by the Roman numerals I through VIII. The type of disease of the bone is determined by the particular genetic mutation and pattern of inheritance.' Type I is the mildest and most common form of the disease and makes up about half of all cases. Type II is the most severe form. Infants with Type II brittle bone disease develop fractures even inutero and have severe abnormalities at birth. Death usually occurs within a few weeks of birth. Type III is the most severe form among infants who survive the neonatal period. These infants develop multiple fractures and have short stature and other abnormalities. Type IV and V brittle bone disease can vary in severity from mild to more severe. Type VI is very rare and is similar to types IV and V. Types VII and VIII are usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern (meaning that a defective gene must be received from each parent).
Does brittle bone disease cause pain?,"'The defective brittle bones themselves are not painful, but ''chronic pain'' may develop in some people with osteogenesis imperfecta due to repeated fractures and skeletal changes. ''Pain'' may also result from acute injuries such as fractures.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of brittle bone disease?,'Symptoms and signs of brittle bone disease vary according to the type. These can include:' Frequent fractures that lead to skeletal deformity Short stature. Bluish coloration to the whites of the eyes (sclerae). Hearing loss. Low birth weight and birth defects in certain forms. Problems with tooth and jaw development. Lung defects in some new borns.
Are brittle bone disease (osteogenesis imperfecta) and osteoporosis the same disease?,"'No, ''osteoporosis'' is the loss of ''bone density'' in normal bones. In brittle bone disease, there is a genetic defect that causes bones to be formed abnormally. However, in both conditions, there is a greater likelihood of bone ''fracture''.' "
At what age does brittle bone disease manifest?,"'Brittle bone disease manifests in childhood. In the most severe forms, changes can even be identified in the fetus in utero.' "
What tests diagnose brittle bone disease?,'The characteristic symptoms of brittle bone disease typically suggest the diagnosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by blood and urine tests to rule out other conditions and by family history and genetic testing.' 
How is brittle bone disease treated?,"'Osteogenesis imperfecta cannot be cured, and treatment is directed at managing symptoms and quality of life. Treatment goals include minimizing fractures and promoting general health and function. The treatment team may include primary care physicians, geneticists, rehabilitation specialists, endocrinologists, neurologists, orthopedic specialists, and pulmonologists.''Treatments can include surgical procedures to repair fractures or correct deformities. Medications such as bisphosphonates (approved for ''osteoporosis'') are sometimes used to improve bone density. Mobility aids including walkers, crutches, and wheelchairs, may be used when needed.' "
What is the life expectancy of brittle bone disease? Can brittle bone disease be cured?,"'Brittle bone disease has no cure.''The prognosis for infants with the most severe form of osteogenesis imperfecta is poor, and most children may not live beyond a few weeks. The prognosis for those with milder forms of the condition who receive good medical management is much better, and many people may have average lifespans.' "
What is a broken bone (fracture)?,"'Bones make up the skeleton of the body. They allow us the ability to interact with our environment and lift out body up against gravity. Bones are attachment points for muscles which allows us to run, jump, sit, kneel, grasp, and lift. Bones also protect organs from potential damage, and the bone marrow (tissue inside of bones) is responsible for blood cell production.'""Bones are the body's storage area for calcium. On a cellular level, calcium is always entering and exiting bone under the influence of the body's hormones. Parathyroid hormone increases calcium levels in the bloodstream, meaning, that it regulates it's release by bone and decreasing ""'bone density''. ''Calcitonin'' decreases blood calcium levels and helps restore calcium to bone. Calcium is needed in the blood stream to help muscle cells including the ''heart'' to function. Hormone levels will sacrifice calcium in bone to maintain blood calcium levels in a normal range. For that reason, calcium and ''Vitamin D'' are important to maintain calcium stores in the body.'  "
What causes a broken bone?,"'When a bone has an outside force exerted upon it, like a blow or a fall, there is potential that it cannot withstand the amount of force and it breaks. That loss of integrity results in a fracture. It is important to remember that a fracture, break, or ''crack'' all describe the same situation, an injury to the bone where it has been damaged. One term is not more serious than another. Fracture, break, and crack all mean the same thing.''Depending upon the situation, the amount of force required may not be very great. People with ''osteoporosis'', the bones lack calcium and are brittle, a minor injury or even gravity may create enough of a force to cause a vertebral compression fracture of the back or a ''hip fracture''.'

What are the most 	common types of broken bones?,"'Fractures are usually described by their location, how the bones are aligned, whether there are associated complications with blood and nerve function, and whether the skin is intact at the injury site.''The terms and definitions used in medicine to describe fractures allow health care professionals to describe exactly where in the bone the fracture is located. For a reference point, the heart is considered the center of the body and the anatomic descriptions are based on their location in reference to the heart. When describing a location on or in the body, imagine standing straight up, looking forward with the arms slightly away from your side, and the palms turned forward.''Common anatomic terms used to describe fractures include the following:''By thinking of the body in the anatomic position, fractures can be described by their location in the bone and how the parts are aligned and related to each other. Fractures are either displaced or non-displaced, meaning that they are adequately aligned or not. Some physicians suggest that all fractures have some displacement and prefer the term ""minimally displaced.""''The description of the fracture also includes the direction it takes within the bones.''Special terms:''Fractures are classified as open (if the skin is damaged) or closed (if the skin is intact). An open fracture may require an orthopedic surgeon to wash out the fracture site to prevent ''osteomyelitis'' (bone infection). Depending upon circumstances, the type of fracture, the amount of contamination to the skin and ''wound'"", and the person's condition, this procedure may take place in the operating room."" Proximal (closer to the center of the body) and Distal (further from the center): the elbow is proximal to the wrist and the wrist is distal to the elbow. Anterior (toward the front of the body) and Posterior (toward the back): The chest is anterior to the back and the back is posterior to the chest. Medial (toward the middle of the body) and Lateral (to the outer edge of the body): The ears are lateral to the nose and the nose is medial to the ears. Transverse: the fracture travels across the bone Oblique: the fracture occurs at an angle Spiral: –the fracture spirals or extends down the length of the bone Comminuted: the fracture has more than two parts, multiple fragments are present. Greenstick: In young children, the bones are not yet solid and when force is applied, it tends to bow and not break completely through. The term comes from a similar situation when trying to break a young branch off a tree. Torus: In children, when only one part of a bone buckles it is called a torus or incomplete fracture. Open fracture: An open fracture describes the situation where the bone penetrates through the skin. The skin is very important in protecting the inside of the body from infection. If the skin overlying a broken bone is damaged, whether it is cut, torn or scraped, there is potential for bacteria from the outside world to invade the broken bone and cause an infection."
Compression fracture,"'The spine is comprised of 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 ''lumbar vertebrae''. The spine holds the body erect against gravity and to protect the spinal cord. Compression fractures can be caused by ''osteoporosis'', injury, or ''trauma''.' People with osteoporosis lose calcium from the 
bones, and the vertebrae may become weak and unable to hold up against the forces of 
gravity, so they gradually compress over time. A compression fracture due to an injury may or may not 
					have spinal cord or nerve root irritation because of the 
					fracture. A compression fracture due to trauma most likely occurs 
					from a motor vehicle crash or fall from height."
Skull fracture,"'The purpose of the skull is to protect the brain. It is a flat bone and it takes a significant direct blow to cause a fracture. Because the main concern is an injury to the brain and not the skull injury , plain ''X-rays'' are not routinely performed to look for a skull fracture. Instead ''CT scan'' of the brain is recommended if there is concern about a ''brain injury''. Skull fractures are often associated with localized swelling and bleeding at the site of injury.''Basilar skull fractures'' describe damage to bone at the base of the brain. Physical findings may include bloody drainage from the ear or nose, ''bruising'"" behind the ear (Battle's sign), and ""'bruising'' around the eyes (Raccoon eyes).''With a ''depressed'' skull fracture,'' the bone is broken and fragments are pushed inward. Depending upon depth of the bony ''depression'' and whether there is brain tissue involvement, surgery may be required.''With an ''open skull fracture,'' the ''scalp'' is lacerated and the wound may connect with the fibrous coverings of the brain (meninges). Surgery is often performed to help prevent infection.' "
Stress fracture,"'Stress'' fractures are the result of multiple microtraumas where the bone cannot tolerate and absorb repeated stresses placed upon it. It is an overuse injury and is often seen in the lower leg especially with runners and other athletes. If untreated, and if the person continues to participate in offending activity, the ''stress'' fracture may progress to a completed fracture. These are most often seen in athletes who participate in ''running'', tennis, basketball, and other sports that involve running and jumping on hard surfaces.''March fracture is the name given to a ''stress fracture'' of the ''metatarsal'' bone of the foot. They are described in soldiers who are forced to walk or ""march"" for prolonged distances.' "
"What are the most 
	common bones that are broken?","'The most common fractures involve the clavicle (collarbone), the forearm (radius and ulna), the wrist, the ankle and the hip. Closed fractures are more common than open fractures (the skin overlying the injury is intact and not damaged).''In children, a fracture of the distal radius is most common. The break occurs in the radius near the wrist but usually does not involve the joint itself. ''1' "
Broken hand or fingers,"'Injuries to the hands and fingers are very common because they are exposed in daily activities. In addition to the bones, the health care professional will be interested in making certain there are no tendon or nerve injuries associated with any broken bone(s). Because the anatomy of the hand is so complex, complicated fractures may be referred to an orthopedic or ''plastic'' hand specialist. Many of them will only require splinting or casting, but occasionally surgery will be necessary.' "
Broken wrist,"'Falling on an outstretched hand is the most common reason for a wrist fracture. It is often the distal radius (see illustration) that is damaged, and the fracture may involve more than one bone. Aside from the radius, wrist fractures may also include fractures of the carpal bones of the wrist (carpus), those that connect the radius to the long bones of the hand (''metacarpals''). Doctors often look for fractures of the scaphoid bone (the bone between the bottom of the thumb and the top of the radius), and dislocations of the lunate (the bone next to the scaphoid bone) that may be difficult to see on plain X-ray.''In some cases, the wrist is splinted even if X-rays are normal because upon physical examination the doctor may be concerned about a potential occult or hidden fracture (the fracture is so small that it does not show up on an X-ray). '""Depending upon the bone that is injured and it's alignment, surgery may or may not be required. Regardless of the treatment, the goal is to have a normally aligned wrist, especially if the fracture involves the joint surface. Poor alignment may lead to ""'arthritis'' in the future.' "
Broken hip,"'Hip fractures are perhaps the most common fracture seen in people 75 years of age or older. While falls and trauma may be the obvious cause, many times, people are more susceptible to hip fracture because of ''osteoporosis'' and sometimes the hip will break spontaneously.''The hip joint is made up of the interconnection of two bones in a ball and socket: 1) the socket in the pelvis (acetabulum), and 2) the ball (femoral head). Hip fractures refer to the femur fracture.''Almost all hip fractures require surgery and the type of surgery depends upon where in the femur that the fracture is located.' "
Broken leg,"'Each of the many bones of the lower extremity is at risk for fracture. Leg fractures also may involve the ''knee joint'', and treatment depends upon the type of fracture. Similarly, fractures of the lower leg (tibia and fibula) and talus (the most proximal bone in the foot) may involve the ankle joint. ''Fractures and dislocations of the foot may be as complex as the hand. Because of the anatomy, they may also be more difficult to diagnosis on plain X-rays. ' "
Broken toe,'Broken toes are a common fracture and may be diagnosed by history and physical examination. X-rays may or may not be needed depending upon the clinical situation.' 
Broken shoulder,"'The clavicle (collarbone) fracture is one of the most commonly seen broken bones, fracture of the humeral head (the ball) is quite common an older person who falls. ''Depending upon the amount of comminution (into how many pieces the humeral head breaks) surgery may or may not be required. Initial treatment usually begins with a sling.''The scapula or shoulder blade is a flat bone and very difficult to break. The mechanism is usually a direct blow. Any scapula fracture needs to be evaluated for related injuries.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a broken bone?,"'Broken bones hurt. The lining of the bone (periosteum) is rich with nerve endings that can cause ''pain'' when inflamed; and the muscles surrounding the fracture go into spasm to prevent movement of the fracture site, and this spasm may intensify the ''pain''.''Bones have a rich blood supply and will bleed when injured. This will cause swelling and the blood that seeps into the surrounding tissue will also cause further pain. The discoloration due to the blood can show up as dark red or purple bruise in the area of the fracture site.'""Because muscles and tendons may not be damaged, the person may be able to move the injured extremity. For that reason, just because you can move the injured area, doesn't mean it's not broken.""'If there is damage to a nearby artery, the injury may be cool and pale (distal to the injury), and if there is nerve damage, there may be numbness (distally).'  "
When should I call a doctor if I think I have broken a bone?,'Most broken bones require medical care but the urgency of that care depends upon the type of fracture and the circumstances. ' 
How is a broken bone diagnosed?,"'Fractures may be difficult to diagnose in children because bones have not completely formed. Many parts of developing bone are comprised mostly of cartilage and have yet to have calcium deposited in them. Growing bone also has growth plates that may mimic or hide fractures. On occasion, the diagnosis of a fracture is made clinically based upon physical exam, even if the X-rays do not show an injury.' The doctor will take a 
history of the patient's injury, examine the injury, and look for potential 
					other injuries that may have occurred. The skin surrounding the injured area is inspected to look for a 
					laceration, scrape, or skin tear. The area of tenderness and swelling will be evaluated to identify the 
injured bone.  The type of X-ray that is ordered depends on the 
					specific injury. Sometimes plain X-rays do not identify the injury. If the 
					doctor is still concerned, CT scan or
					MRI might be 
					ordered."
What is the treatment for a broken bone?,"'The initial treatment of a fracture begins with stabilization and immobilization. In the field RICE (rest, ice, compression and elevation) may help make the patient more comfortable and prevent the fractured bones from moving. Often the pain associated with a fracture is due to spasm of the muscles surrounding the fracture site trying to prevent movement. Splinting may help relieve some of that pain. Depending upon the injury, EMS providers may consider traction to help with stabilization and pain control.''For non-open fractures, or other fractures that can be treated without emergency surgery, the goal is to immobilize the injury to maintain anatomic alignment to allow the bone to heal. ''Bone heals in three stages. '""In the emergency department, walk in clinic, or doctor's office, the extremity is usually splinted using a combination of soft padding, casting material (plaster, fiberglass), and ace wraps. This splint is not circumferential like a cast, because a fracture has the potential for swelling of the surrounding tissues, and if a tight cast were in place, that swelling could cause complications including significant pain and potential blood supply issues.""'Once the patient is discharged, their instructions are to elevate the injury and ice the area, even with the splint, to help decrease swelling and inflammation.''After a few days, once the initial swelling has resolved, a circumferential cast may replace the splint and will be worn until the fracture is healed. The time frame for healing depends upon the type of fracture and its location. X-rays may be used to help determine when it is time for the cast to be removed.''Finger and hand fractures may be more complicated. The hand is a complex web of tendons, blood vessels, and nerves that allow fine motor function. What might be acceptable healing and alignment in an arm or leg may not be appropriate in a hand. Some finger injuries need nothing more than a metal splint or buddy taping one finger to another for support, while others will need surgery. The type of treatment will depend upon the type of injury.''Most toe injuries heal very well own and need nothing more than buddy taping one toe to another for support.''The treatment for rib fractures involves pain control so that the patient can take deep breaths and allow the lung to expand beneath the injury site to prevent ''pneumonia''. Rib injuries are not wrapped or bandaged to help with pain control because this will limit their movement, and prevent lung expansion. Because of this, rib fractures generally take 4 to 6 weeks to heal and may cause pain throughout the healing process.'  Reactive stage: The blood clot that 
forms at the fracture site begins to organize and the body's building blocks 
start to bridge the gap between the two ends of the broken bone. Repair stage: Specialized cells 
located in the outer lining of the bone (periosteum), begin to form a lattice 
work or grids of cartilage and bone, called a callus, which spans the fracture. 
More bone is laid down to provide strength to the area. Remodeling phase: Over the next few 
years, the body will attempt to resculpt this mass of bone into it's original 
size and shape."
What about surgery for a broken bone?,"'The decision to operate on a fracture depends upon the type of fracture, whether it can heal in good alignment on its own, and whether other potential complications exist. ''Sometimes patients are taken to the operating room for a closed reduction (resetting of the bone) and splinting of the fracture. When a fracture is markedly displaced and misaligned, it may be too painful to move or manipulated the bone without an anesthetic.''If it appears that the fracture is unstable and cannot be held in place and in good alignment with just a splint or cast, an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) may be needed. An incision is made so that the bony pieces can be identified and aligned. Metal plates and screws, wires or rods may be used to stabilize the fracture. The hardware may be left in place forever or it may be there only temporarily until the fracture heals. Hip fractures almost always require ORIF to allow the patient to heal and regain the ability to walk.''Surgery may be required in situations where there is associated injury to arteries and nerves and they need to be repaired or decompressed.''Open fractures often have to go to the operating room to be washed out to prevent infection of the bone (osteomyelitis).'  "
How can fractures be prevented?,"'Many broken bones occur because of accidents in the home, at work or at play, and not all may be preventable. Using proper safety equipment and precautions may minimize the risk of injury, but it cannot be completely eliminated.''As we age, there is an increased risk for falls at homes and some preventive steps may help reduce fall risks. These include:''Bones also get old as we age and the management of osteoporosis is a life-long commitment. Increasing calcium content in bone will decrease the risk of spontaneous fracture, and also may make bone strong enough to potentially withstand an injury that otherwise would result in a fracture. Ways to prevent osteoporosis include: ' Make certain that lighting is adequate Shoes should not be slippery Loose rugs or uneven floors should be 
repaired High traffic areas like from the bed to 
the bath or from the kitchen to the living area need to be clear from hazards 
like excess furniture, extension cords, or boxes Bathrooms should have nonslip mats on 
the floor and in the bathtub or shower Install handrails for stairs and grab bars 
in the bathroom Increase weight bearing exercise  Make sure you are getting the right amount of calcium and Vitamin D in 
the diet. Take supplements if necessary. 
	
	Do not smoke   Avoid excess alcohol intake"
What is the prognosis for a broken bone?,"'Fractures are a common injury, but the prognosis depends upon the bone that is broken, the location of the break, whether any complications exist and the underlying medical condition of the individual. Most arm and leg fractures heal well, and the goal is for the person to return to their baseline level of activity.' "
What are the symptoms of a broken finger? How will I know if it's broken?,"'The main symptoms of a broken finger are pain immediately after the trauma, and sometimes a deformed finger.'   A true fracture usually will be painful, but a broken finger may still have some range of motion and dull pain, and the individual may still be able to move it. Depending on the fracture stability, some fractures may be more painful than others may. Usually within 5-10 minutes, swelling and bruising of the finger will occur and the finger will stiffen. Swelling may affect the adjacent fingers as well. Numbness of the finger may occur either from the trauma of the injury itself, or because swelling compresses the nerves in the fingers. Fractures to the finger tip (distal phalanx) are common from smashing injuries to the fingernail. The symptoms of this type of injury may be swelling and bruising to the finger pad and purple-colored blood underneath the fingernail (subungual hematoma). If the trauma is severe, broken bones may be exposed (called a compound fracture)."
How common are broken fingers?,"'Fingers are easily injured, and broken fingers are some of the most common traumatic injuries seen in an emergency room. Fractures of the finger bones (phalanxes) and the bones in the palm of the hand (metacarpal bones) are the most common fractures, accounting for 10% of all fractures. Because fingers are used for many everyday activities, they are at higher risk than other parts of the body for traumatic injury, including sports injuries, workplace injuries, and other accidents.''Understanding the basic anatomy of the hand and fingers is useful in understanding different types of finger injuries, broken fingers, and how some treatments differ from others.''The hand is divided into three sections: 1) wrist, 2) palm, and 3) fingers.'   The wrist has eight bones, which move together to allow the vast ranges of motion of the wrist. The palm or mid-hand is comprised of the metacarpal bones. The metacarpal bones have muscular attachments and bridge the wrist to the individual fingers. These bones frequently are injured with direct trauma such as a crush injury, or most commonly, a punching injury. The fingers are the most frequently injured part of the hand. Fingers are constructed of ligaments (strong supportive tissue connecting bone to bone), tendons (attachment tissue from muscle to bone), and three phalanxes (bones). There are no muscles in the fingers; and fingers move by the pull of forearm muscles on the tendons. The three bones in each finger are named according to their relationship to the palm of the hand. The first bone, closest to the palm, is the  proximal phalanx; the second bone is the middle phalanx; and the smallest and farthest from the hand is the  distal phalanx. The thumb does not have a middle phalanx. The knuckles are joints formed by the bones of the fingers and are commonly injured or dislocated with trauma to the hand.The first and largest knuckle is the junction between the hand and the fingers - the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP). This joint commonly is injured in closed-fist activities and is commonly known as a boxer's fracture.The next knuckle out toward the fingernail is the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP). This joint may be dislocated in sporting events when a ball or object directly strikes the finger.The farthest joint of the finger is the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). Injuries to this joint usually involve a fracture or torn tendon (avulsion) injury. The first and largest knuckle is the junction between the hand and the fingers - the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP). This joint commonly is injured in closed-fist activities and is commonly known as a boxer's fracture. The next knuckle out toward the fingernail is the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP). This joint may be dislocated in sporting events when a ball or object directly strikes the finger. The farthest joint of the finger is the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). Injuries to this joint usually involve a fracture or torn tendon (avulsion) injury."
What causes broken fingers?,"'Traumatic injury is the main cause of broken fingers. Most commonly, traumatic injury to the finger occurs from playing sports, workplace injuries, falls, or other accidents.' "
When should I see a doctor for a broken finger?," After injury, if pain or swelling limits the motion or use of the fingers, or if the finger becomes numb, seek medical care. If the injury to the finger includes a laceration, crushed tissue, or exposure of bone, the individual should go to an emergency department for immediate medical care. Some fractures of the fingers may be subtle and the pain may be tolerable, so if a person suspects that they may have a finger fracture, seek medical attention."
How do doctors diagnose a broken finger?,"'X-ray is the primary tool used to diagnose a broken finger. The doctor will need an X-ray to evaluate the position of the broken finger bones.''With more complex injuries, the doctor may seek the advice of an orthopedic (bone and joint specialist) or hand surgeon (an orthopedic surgeon or ''plastic surgeon'' with post-residency, fellowship level training in ''hand surgery'').'  "
What is the treatment for a broken finger?,"'Broken fingers should be treated by medical professionals; however, a person can minimize some pain and stabilize the injury on the way to seek medical treatment.''The doctor will assess the stability of the broken finger. The treatment for a broken finger depends on the type of fracture, and the particular bone in the finger that is injured.''If the fracture is stable (not likely to worsen or cause complications with the movement of the finger), treatment may be as simple as buddy taping (splinting one finger to another by taping them together) for about four weeks, followed by an additional two weeks of limiting use of the finger.''If the fracture is unstable, the injured finger will need to be immobilized. A splint may be applied after reduction (re-aligning of the fractured fragments). If this does not maintain enough stability, a surgical procedure may be needed.''A surgeon has many different techniques for surgical immobilization, ranging from pinning the fracture with small wires to procedures with plates and screws.''The patient will most likely leave the hospital in some type of immobilizing splint or dressing. Keep the dressing clean, dry, and elevated. It is best not to use the involved hand until a hand specialist is consulted (about one week after the injury) for another X-ray to evaluate the position of the fracture fragments. If the finger is not aligned correctly, it may affect the healing of the finger and leave a permanent disability.'   To reduce swelling and bruising, apply ice to the injured finger on the way to an emergency department. Do not apply ice directly to the skin; put a towel between the ice and the finger. Make a splint to immobilize the finger. A Popsicle stick or pen may be placed next to the broken finger, and then wrap something around the stick and the finger to hold it in place. Wrap loosely - if the finger is wrapped too tightly it can cause additional swelling and may cut off circulation to the injured digit. Keep the injured finger elevated. Remove all rings or jewelry from the affected hand before swelling occurs."
What are the complications of a broken finger?,"'After reduction, immobilization, and four to six weeks of healing, the prognosis for healing is excellent for a broken finger.'   Joint stiffness is the most common problem encountered after treatment of fractures in the fingers due to scar tissue formation and the long immobilization period. Physical therapy may be prescribed (preferably by a hand therapist) to regain range of motion. Rotation can occur when one of the bones in the finger rotates abnormally during the healing process. This can cause deformity and decreased ability to use the injured finger when grasping. Nonunion is a complication of some fractures when the two ends of the bone do not heal together properly, leaving the fractured area unstable. If the skin is injured or if surgery is necessary to fix the fractured bone, infection may result."
How can a broken finger be prevented?,"'The best medicine for ''prevention'' of finger fractures is safety. Most fingers are broken from machines, self-inflicted trauma (punching something), or sporting injuries. Always use safety equipment when doing activities that may injure the hands. Injuries should be evaluated as soon possible.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a broken foot?,"'Broken bones are painful, especially when they are weight bearing. Common signs and symptoms of a ''broken bone'' in the foot include:''Other signs and symptoms of a broken foot include:'   Pain Limping Swelling Bruising Tenderness Walking may be too painful Joint dislocation: If the bones are significantly displaced (the bone alignment has been lost or there is an associated joint dislocation) a deformity of the foot may be apparent. People with existing diseases or conditions: with altered pain sensation due to peripheral neuropathy (persons with diabetes are a classic example), pain may not be present, and the fracture may be missed initially. This also may occur in persons with spinal cord injuries. Bruising, swelling, and deformity may be the only clues to a potential fracture."
What are the signs and symptoms of a broken foot in an infant or toddler?, Infants and toddlers may ignore the pain of their injured foot when they see a health-care professional. They may refuse to bear weight on their leg. The child may sit comfortably on the parent's lap without complaint until asked or made to stand.
How many bones are in the foot (pictures)?,"'The foot is designed to withstand the considerable forces placed on it by walking, ''running'', and jumping. There are 26 bones of the foot, connected by joints and supported by thickened ligaments to absorb the impact of movement. As well, the joints of the foot are acted upon by muscles and tendons that allow flexing and extending to permit walking and running to occur.''The bony anatomy can be described as:' The hindfoot consists of the talus that forms the base of the ankle joint where it meets the tibia (shin bone) and the calcaneous or heel bone. Ligaments from both the talus and the heel bone span the ankle joint and attach to the tibia and fibula (the other shin bone) to provide stability. The midfoot consists of the navicular, the cuboid, and the three cuneiform bones. The midfoot is where inversion and supination of the foot occurs. These motions allow the sole of the foot to turn inwards and upwards. In the forefoot, the five metatarsal bones are connected to each toe. The toe bones are called phalanges (single = phalanx) with the big toe having two and the other four toes having three each. These bones are named based upon their relationship to the body: proximal, middle and distal. Proximal means closest to the center of the body while distal is furthest from the center. The toenails are located over the digital phalanges. The arch of the foot is maintained by the plantar fascia, a thick fibrous band of tissue that runs from the calcaneus to the metatarsal bones, preventing the bones of the foot from flattening. There are places in the foot where two bones meet to form a joint. Each joint has its own set of structures that help maintain stability. Injuries to the foot include fractures of the bone, sprains of the ligaments that stabilize the joints, and strains of the muscles and tendons that move the foot. Joints can also become inflamed (arthritis). Arthritis can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term)."
What are the causes of a broken foot?,"'A fracture, break, and ''crack'' all mean the same thing when it comes to a bone injury: the integrity of the bone has been damaged. The cause of injury may be obvious, such as jumping from a height or a heavy object falling and landing on the foot, or it may develop gradually over time, such as the result of the constant ''stress'' of walking or running.'   Foot fractures account for 10% of all the broken bones in the body, and the mechanism of injury usually can give a clue as to what bone might be injured. Fractures of the calcaneus (heel bone) usually occur when a person jumps or falls from a height, landing directly on their feet. The force of the landing may also be transmitted up the body to cause fractures of the ankle, knee, hip, and lumbar spine. Injuries to the midfoot, the metatarsals, and phalanges often are caused by a direct blow sustained when a kick goes awry or from a crush injury when a heavy object is dropped on the foot. Twisting injuries can cause bones to break. For example, fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal occur when the ankle rolls inward and a fragment of the bone is pulled off (avulsed) by the peroneus tendon. The most common causes of an injured foot include falls; crush injuries (including impacts from a heavy object or an automobile accident) missed steps, and stress/overuse injuries."
What is the healing time for a broken foot?,'Recovery and healing time for a broken foot depends upon the type of fracture and the bones broken.' 
How can I tell if I have a broken bone in my foot?,"'A broken foot is diagnosed by the health-care practitioner taking a history of how the injury occurred. The mechanism of injury will give clues as to what type of injury may exist and importantly, what other associated injuries may also be potentially present. It is helpful to know how much time has passed from when the injury occurred to when the patient presents for care. Past medical history is important; those with ''diabetes'' or other conditions that suppress the immune system are at greater risk for infection with foot injuries.'   Inspection of the foot for swelling, bruising, deformities and open wounds. Palpation allows the health care professional to feel where the pain is located. This is very helpful if X-rays are taken, since it allows the health care professional to correlate areas of tenderness with the anatomy seen on the X-Ray. (This is particularly important in children whose bones may not have yet calcified. Fractures may be easily missed since they occur through cartilage instead of bone.) An exam of the circulatory system, feeling for pulses, and assessing how quickly blood returns to the tip of a toe after it is pressed and the toe turns white (capillary refill). A neurologic exam, assessing sensation such as light touch and pin prick sensations Motor function, asking the patient to move the injured area. This assists in assessing muscle and tendon function. The ability to move the foot means only that the muscles and tendons work, and does not guarantee bone integrity or stability. The concept that ""it can't be broken because I can move it"" is not correct. A range of motion exam of the foot may be helpful in assessing ligament stability. However, if the fracture is obvious, the health care practitioner may choose to keep the foot immobilized to prevent further pain. X-rays are often taken to evaluate the status of the bones in the foot and to check for fracture. Usually three views are taken to help the health care professional and radiologist adequately view the bones. Special views may be taken if there is concern for a fracture of the calcaneus. X-rays may not be taken for simple toe injuries, since the result may not affect the treatment plan. For some foot fractures, X-rays may not be adequate to visualize the injury. This is often true for metatarsal stress fractures, where bone scans may be used if the history and physical examination suggest a potential stress fracture, but the plain X-rays are normal. Computerized tomography (CT) may be used to assess fractures of the calcaneus and talus, since it may better be able to illustrate the anatomy of the ankle and midfoot joint and potential associated injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in some cases of foot fractures. The Lisfranc joint describes the connection between the first, second, and third metatarsals and the three cuneiform bones. A Lisfranc fracture dislocation often requires a CT scan to evaluate this region of the foot. While X-rays may hint at the damage in this type of injury, the CT can delineate the numerous bones and joints that may be damaged."
What can you do for a broken foot (treatment)?,"   First aid at home may include RICE (rest, ice, elevation, and compression). Rest may include the use of crutches to limit weight bearing as tolerated. If the decision is made to seek medical care, this regimen may be continued once the patient is discharged from the hospital to go home. The treatment of a foot fracture depends upon what bone is broken, the mechanism of injury, the underlying medical condition of the patient, and whether the fracture is open (the skin is broken) or closed (the skin is intact). Broken toes are often treated symptomatically, with the injured toe ""buddy taped"" to an adjacent normal toe. It may be helpful to place cotton balls or other absorbent material between the toes to prevent dampness and skin injury. A stiff-soled shoe and crutches may be needed to help with walking. Healing should occur within 4 to 6 weeks. Fractures of the great toe that are displaced may require surgery to allow better healing. An orthopedic surgeon or podiatrist (foot specialist) may choose this option, but often that decision is made electively a few days after the injury. Open fractures of the toe usually require good wound cleansing to prevent infection. At the same time the health care practitioner will often explore the wound, looking for foreign objects and evaluate the condition of deep structures like tendons, looking for lacerations. Metatarsal fractures often heal nicely with conservative care, meaning no operation is needed. The foot is wrapped for comfort to decrease swelling and placed in an orthopedic post-op or Reese shoe. Cast boots also may be considered.First metatarsal fractures that are aligned nicely may be treated with a post-op shoe with no weight bearing. If the fracture is displaced, meaning the bone fragments do not align, an operation to pin or plate the fracture may be considered.Second, third, and fourth metatarsal fractures tend to heal nicely with an ace wrap for support and weight bearing as tolerated.Stress fractures usually involve the second and third metatarsals, and are called ""March fractures."" March fractures were initially recognized in military recruits who were required to quickly increase the amount they walked. Splints , casts, or walking boots may be considered for pain control.Fifth metatarsal fractures are of two types. Avulsion fracture at the very base of the bone are treated in the same way as the other metatarsal fractures.Jones fractures of the fifth metatarsal shaft have a non-healing (non-union) rate of up to 50% and often require surgery to fix the fracture. First metatarsal fractures that are aligned nicely may be treated with a post-op shoe with no weight bearing. If the fracture is displaced, meaning the bone fragments do not align, an operation to pin or plate the fracture may be considered. Second, third, and fourth metatarsal fractures tend to heal nicely with an ace wrap for support and weight bearing as tolerated. Stress fractures usually involve the second and third metatarsals, and are called ""March fractures.""

Fifth metatarsal fractures are of two types. Avulsion fracture at the very base of the bone are treated in the same way as the other metatarsal fractures. Jones fractures of the fifth metatarsal shaft have a non-healing (non-union) rate of up to 50% and often require surgery to fix the fracture. Lisfranc fracture dislocation injuries require surgery for repair. The treatment of talus fractures depends upon where in the bone the fracture occurs. The top of the talus is dome-shaped and is part of the ankle joint, fitting into the base of the tibia or shin bone. This fracture may not be easily identified and sometimes can be mistaken for a non-healing ankle sprain. The treatment is rest and avoidance of weight bearing. Talar neck fractures often have difficulty healing because of poor blood supply. Surgery may be required if the bone is displaced, otherwise no weight bearing in a cast for 2-3 months may be required. A Shepherd fracture involves the posterior, or back part, of the talus and is seen in athletes who dance or kick. The treatment is immobilization in a cast. Lateral process fractures of the talus are becoming more common with increasing numbers of snowboarding injuries. Treatment includes no weight bearing in a cast. Calcaneus fractures require significant force to occur and are associated with a marked amount of swelling and pain. An orthopedic surgeon or podiatrist is often consulted emergently to decide whether surgery is needed to stabilize the fracture. CT scan may be needed to assess the extent of the fracture, and whether the fracture line enters the joint. The health-care professional also may look for associated injuries of the ankle, knee, hip, and lumbar spine. Immobilization of the fractured foot will help with pain control. Anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can be helpful with over-the-counter pain control by decreasing inflammation in the area. Narcotic pain medication may also be prescribed if needed. Rest, ice, and elevation will help limit swelling and decrease pain."
What are the complications of a broken foot?,"'As with any injury, complications may occur.'   Broken bones may fail to heal, causing a non-union that may require surgery to repair. If the fracture line enters a joint surface, arthritis may develop, even if the joint surface has been aligned by surgery. Open fractures may be complicated by infection and damage to underlying structures like tendons, arteries, and nerves. Though it is uncommon, crush injuries to the foot may cause significant swelling in the tight spaces of the foot, leading to compartment syndrome. Should the pressure in one of these compartments rise above the patient's blood pressure, decreasing blood flow to the area of foot beyond the injury. This is a surgical emergency and fasciotomies, incisions into the foot compartments, are performed to allow space for the swelling to occur, relieve the pressure, and restore blood supply to the foot."
Is it possible to prevent a broken foot?," The foot is placed under considerable stress on a daily basis, absorbing the pounding of walking, running, and jumping. Poorly-constructed and -cushioned shoes and obesity help contribute to stress fractures and general instability of the foot. High-impact sports that include twisting and direct blows to the feet increase the risk of fracture. Appropriate protective equipment will help decrease the risk of injury. Certain occupations increase the risk of foot injury. These include the construction trades in which weights may be dropped on a foot, or falls from height may occur. People with osteoporosis or peripheral neuropathy may have increased risk of foot injury. For these people, it is important to decrease the clutter around the house to prevent injury from falling. It is also helpful to limit the number of throw rugs in a home that can cause a person to trip and fall."
When should I call the doctor for foot pain?," Most of the bones in the foot will eventually heal with rest, but some fractures may need surgery to repair. Often, it is the mechanism of injury associated with the intensity of pain that makes the patient seek care. It is appropriate to seek medical care if the patient cannot walk normally without a limp. Medical care should be accessed immediately if an injury to the foot also includes a laceration. The term ""open fracture"", previously named ""compound fracture,"" describes a broken bone that is associated with a break in the skin. Open fractures pose a significant risk for major infection of the bone. Other reasons to seek care include:Numbness or tingling in the toes, which may be an indication of nerve damageA cool and white toot, which may signal artery damage and decreased blood supply to the foot Numbness or tingling in the toes, which may be an indication of nerve damage A cool and white toot, which may signal artery damage and decreased blood supply to the foot"
What is a broken toe?,'A commonly injured area of the foot is the small bones of the toes (phalanges). There are 26 bones in the foot; 19 are bones in the forefoot (five ''metatarsals'' and 14 phalanges). Trauma and the injury to the foot often causes one or more of the toe bones to break (fracture).' 
What are the symptoms of a broken toe?,"   Pain, swelling, or stiffness will occur in a broken toe following injury. It may be difficult to walk due to the pain, especially with a broken big toe. This is because the big toe bears much of the weight of the body during walking or pivoting. A broken little toe (pinky toe) may be painful, but usually does not limit the ability to walk. Other symptoms includea bruised toe,bruising of the skin aroundthe toe, anda bent or deformed appear-ance of the toe if the brokenbone is out of place. a bruised toe, bruising of the skin aroundthe toe, and a bent or deformed appear-ance of the toe if the brokenbone is out of place. Other problems may develop as a result of the fractured toe. Complications can occur immediately after the injury (minutes to days), or can develop much later (weeks to years). People with weakened bones"
What are the causes of a broken toe?,"'Trauma or injury such as stubbing the toe (jammed toe) or dropping a heavy object on the toe may cause a broken toe. The location of the toes (at the front part of the ''feet'') makes them the most likely part of the foot to be injured.''Prolonged repetitive movements, as in certain sports activities, can cause a type of broken type of broken toe called a ''stress fracture'' or hairline fracture. People with weakened bones (''osteoporosis'' or other disorders) may develop ''stress'' fractures simply from wearing improper shoes.' "
When to call a doctor if I think you have a broken toe,"'Many people think that if they can walk on an injured toe, it is not broken. This may not be the case. It is common to break a toe bone and still be able to walk on it.'""Go to a hospital's emergency department if you have following signs or symptoms.""'Call a doctor if any of the following occur:'   Any symptoms of a possible open (compound) fracture which include open wounds, bleeding, or drainage from near the broken toe Cold, numb, tingling, or unusual sensation in the toes Blue or gray colored skin near the injury If the injured toe appears deformed or is pointing in the wrong direction (angulated) If the broken toe pain worsens or new pain is not relieved by pain medication Sores, redness, or open wounds near the injured toe Bruising or bleeding under the toenail that causes significant pain A cast or splint is damaged or broken"
How can you tell if you have a broken toe?,"'Seek medical evaluation soon after the injury to ensure proper treatment and healing.''You initially may see a primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner or a child’s pediatrician when you first injure your toe. You likely will be referred to an orthopedist or orthopedic surgeon, who specializes in disorders of the musculoskelteal system, or a podiatrist, a specialist in conditions of the foot, for treatment.'""You also may be diagnosed with a broken toe in a hospital's emergency department by an ""'emergency medicine'' specialist. Radiologists will read an X-ray or MRI, though they will usually report back to your primary care physician or emergency medicine specialist and you will not directly consult with them.'   A doctor will ask questions to determine how the toe was injured and will examine the injured toe and possibly check for other injuries (for example, sprains). A doctor may take an X-ray to evaluate if the toe is broken or fractured. X-rays are not always necessary to diagnose a broken toe, especially if the break is in one of the smaller toes. Stress fractures, due to overuse or repetitive movement, may need an MRI to be diagnosed."
Can anything be done at home for a broken toe?,"'Most minor toe injuries can be treated at home. If a you are unsure or suspect a fracture, seek medical attention. The following self-care tips may help decrease pain and swelling from a broken toe, and to help the fracture heal properly.''In certain situations, a broken toe may need medical care such as maneuvering the toe back into place (reduction), casting, or splinting the toe.'   Rest: Avoid strenuous exercise, prolonged standing, or walking. Crutches may be needed, or a special shoe or boot to wear when walking to avoid putting weight on the fracture while it heals. Ice: Put ice in a plastic bag and apply it to the injury for 15-20 minutes every one to two hours for the first few days. Place a towel between the skin and the ice to protect the skin. Frozen peas or corn can also be used to ice the broken toe - they may conform to the fractured area better than ice. Elevation: To decrease swelling and pain, keep the foot raised above the level of the heart as much and as often as possible. Prop the foot up as much as possible (for example use several pillows), especially when sleeping. Reclining in a lounge chair is also helpful."
How to buddy tape a broken toe,"'If there is a minor or small fracture in a bone of one of the small toes, a doctor may only need to tape the injured toe to the one next to it for support. This treatment is called buddy taping.'""If the toe is buddy taped, it is usually safe to bathe, and then replace the tape afterward, however, check with the doctor prior to removing the tape to bathe. Always follow your doctor's instructions on how to tape your broken toe."" Put a small piece of cotton or gauze between the toes that are taped together. (This prevents the skin between the toes from developing sores or blisters.) Using as little tape as necessary, loosely tape the broken toe to the toe next to it. If the toes are taped too tightly it can cause additional swelling and may cut off circulation to the injured toe."
What is the medical treatment for a broken toe?,"'Depending on the location and severity of the toe fracture, the fracture may need to be put back into place (reduced) and splinted or casted. Because it has a significant weight bearing role, fractures of the big toe are often more serious and more likely to require reduction or surgical treatment. If there is an ''open wound'' near the injured toe, a ''tetanus'' shot and antibiotic medication may also be necessary.''If there is an open (compound) fracture of the toe, surgery may be necessary in some cases, and antibiotics will be given. This type of fracture should be seen by a doctor immediately.''Usually only anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' like ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'') are needed for pain. For severe injuries, the doctor may prescribe a stronger pain medicine.' "
Casting a broken toe," A cast usually is not required for a simple toe fracture. A hard-soled, sturdy, and supportive shoe or boot should be worn. A doctor may give the patient a special shoe to wear if the foot or toes are very swollen. A cast (or surgery) may be needed if the big toe is broken, a fracture involves a joint, several small toe fractures occur at once, or if a bone in the foot or leg is broken in addition to the toe."
Reduction for a broken toe," If the toe fracture is displaced (the two ends of the broken toe bone are out of place) or rotated (the toe is pointing in the wrong direction), or the toe is dislocated, the doctor may need to reduce it, or set the broken toe back into place. Sometimes local anesthesia may be needed to numb the toe before it is put back into place. After a reduction, a splint will be applied to the broken toe to hold it in place while it heals."
How long does it take for a broken toe to heal?,"'Talk to the doctor to have the broken toe evaluated to be certain it is healing properly. Call a doctor or go to an emergency department if any problems or complications develop before the scheduled appointment.''The healing time for broken toes usually is take about six weeks to heal. If problems last longer than six weeks, another X-ray may be needed, or the injury should be rechecked by the doctor to evaluate how the bone is healing. Simple toe fractures usually heal well with no problems. However, a severe fracture or a fracture that goes into a joint is at risk for developing arthritis, pain, stiffness, and possibly even a deformity.' "
What are the possible complications of a broken toe?,"'Other problems may develop as a result of the broken toe. Complications can occur immediately after the injury (minutes to days), or can develop much later (weeks to years). Inadequate treatment of a broken toe may lead to complications including foot deformities and ''chronic pain''. Even when a broken toe is treated promptly, complications may arise including:' Nail injury: A collection of blood may develop underneath the toenail called a subungual hematoma. If it is large, it may need to be drained. To drain a subungual hematoma a doctor will make a small hole in the toenail to drain the blood. If the hematoma is very large or painful, the entire toenail may need to be removed. The injury may also result in a broken toenail that may need to be trimmed or removed. Compound fracture: Rarely, the broken bone in a toe fracture may stick out through the skin. This is called an open or compound fracture. Emergency medical treatment and surgery may be necessary. Arthritis: After the toe fracture heals, the person may still be left with arthritis, pain, stiffness, or even deformity. Nonunion/malunion: Sometimes, the fractured bone will not heal completely (called a nonunion) or will heal improperly (called a malunion). Rarely, surgery may be necessary to fix this problem."
Asthma vs. COPD: What are the differences?," Asthma is characterized by reversible airway narrowing, whereas COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) typically has fixed airway narrowing. Some symptoms of COPD are similar to asthma, including wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough. The cough in COPD can be more productive of mucus than asthma, and patients with severe COPD may need oxygen supplementation. COPD is very often a result of cigarette smoke exposure, either direct or secondhand, although severe asthma can evolve to COPD over time in the absence of smoke exposure. Medications used to treat COPD include inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroid/bronchodilator combinations, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and oral steroids. There is a newly described syndrome called asthma/COPD overlap syndrome that displays characteristics of both asthma and COPD. This is an area of medicine that needs further study."
What are risk factors and causes of asthma?,"""Asthma results from complex interactions between an individual's ""'inherited'' genetic ''makeup'' and interactions with the environment. The factors that cause a genetically predisposed individual to become ''asthmatic'' are poorly understood. The following are risk factors for asthma:'  Family history of allergic conditions Personal history of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) Viral respiratory illness, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), during childhood Exposure to cigarette smoke Obesity Lower socioeconomic status Exposure to air pollution or burning biomass"
What are the different types of asthma?,"""Asthma may not be the same in different affected individuals. Asthma specialists currently use a variety of clinical data to categorize a patient's asthma. This data includes the age of asthma onset, the presence or absence of environmental ""'allergies'', the presence or absence of elevated blood or sputum levels of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), lung function testing (''spirometry'' and fractional excretion of nitric oxide), obesity, and cigarette smoke exposure.''Your doctor may refer to asthma as being ""allergic"" or ""eosinophilic."" One or both of these characteristics make up a ""T2 high"" phenotype of asthma, which is the term for the type of immune inflammation associated with asthma. The allergic type typically develops in childhood and is associated with environmental ''allergies'', which approximately 70%-80% of children with asthma have. Typically, there is a family history of ''allergies''. Additionally, other allergic conditions, such as ''food allergies'' or ''eczema'', are often also present. Allergic asthma often goes into remission in early adulthood. However, in many cases, the asthma reappears later. Sometimes allergic asthma can appear with elevated blood or sputum eosinophils. Asthma that develops in adulthood may be associated with sputum or blood eosinophils but without environmental allergies. Sometimes patients in this category also have ''nasal polyps'', which are eosinophil-rich growths in the nasal lining.''Non T2 asthma, or T2 low asthma, comprises a smaller yet difficult to treat proportion of asthma that is not associated with allergies or eosinophils. This type of asthma is sometimes called ""neutrophilic asthma"" and may be associated with obesity.'  "
What are asthma symptoms and signs?,"'The classic signs and ''symptoms of asthma'' are shortness of breath, cough (often worse at night), and wheezing (high-pitched whistling sound produced by turbulent airflow through narrow airways, typically with ''exhalation''). Many patients also report ''chest tightness''. It is important to note that these symptoms are episodic, and individuals with asthma can go long periods without any symptoms.''Common triggers for asthmatic symptoms include exposure to allergens (pets, dust mites, cockroach, molds, and pollens), ''exercise'', and viral infections. Other triggers include strong emotion, odor exposure, and temperature extremes. Tobacco use or exposure to ''secondhand smoke'' complicates asthma management.''Many of the symptoms and signs of asthma are nonspecific and can be seen in other conditions as well. Symptoms that might suggest conditions other than asthma include new symptom onset in older age, the presence of associated symptoms (such as chest discomfort, ''lightheadedness'', ''palpitations'', and ''fatigue''), and lack of response to appropriate ''medications for asthma''.''The physical exam in asthma is often completely normal. Occasionally, wheezing is present. In an asthma exacerbation, the respiratory rate increases, the ''heart'' rate increases, and the work of ''respiration'' increases. Individuals often require accessory muscles to breathe, and breath sounds can be diminished. It is important to note that the blood oxygen level typically remains fairly normal even in the midst of a significant asthma exacerbation. Low blood oxygen level is therefore concerning for impending respiratory failure.'  "
How do doctors diagnose asthma?,"'The diagnosis of asthma begins with a detailed history and physical examination. Primary-care providers are familiar with the diagnosis of asthma, but specialists such as allergists or pulmonologists may be involved. A typical history is an individual with a family history of allergic conditions or a personal history of allergic rhinitis who experiences ''coughing'', wheezing, and difficulty ''breathing'', especially with ''exercise'', viral infections, or during the night. In addition to a typical history, improvement with a trial of appropriate medications is very suggestive of asthma.''In addition to the history and exam, the following are diagnostic procedures that can be used to help with the diagnosis of asthma:' Lung function testing with spirometry: This test measures lung function as the patient breathes into a tube. If lung function improves significantly following the administration of a bronchodilator, such as albuterol, this essentially confirms the diagnosis of asthma. It is important to note, however, that normal lung function testing does not rule out the possibility of asthma. Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO): This can be performed by a quick and relatively simple breathing maneuver, similar to spirometry. Elevated levels of exhaled nitric oxide are suggestive of T2 inflammation seen in some types of asthma. Skin testing for common aeroallergens: The presence of sensitivities to environmental allergies increases the likelihood of asthma. Of note, skin testing is more accurate than blood work (in vitro testing) for environmental allergies. Testing for food allergies is not indicated in the diagnosis of asthma. Doctors often perform blood tests for the allergic antibody (IgE) and eosinophils to establish the present of T2 high asthma. Other potential but less commonly used tests include provocation testing such as a methacholine challenge, which tests for airway hyperresponsiveness. Hyperresponsiveness is the tendency of the breathing tubes to constrict or narrow in response to irritants. A negative methacholine challenge makes asthma unlikely. Specialists sometimes also measure sputum eosinophils, another marker for ""allergic"" inflammation seen in asthma. Chest X-rays or CT-scans may show hyperinflation, but are often normal in asthma. Tests to rule out other conditions, such as cardiac testing, may also be indicated in certain cases."
What are asthma treatment options? Are there home remedies for asthma?,"'The treatment goals for asthma are to:''Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents available for the chronic treatment of asthma and are first-line therapy per most asthma guidelines. It is well recognized that ICS are effective in decreasing the risk of asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, the combination of a long-acting bronchodilator (LABA) and an ICS has a significant additional beneficial effect on improving asthma control. Short-acting rescue inhalers are the standard of care for break through symptoms.''The most commonly used ''asthma medications'' include the following:''There is often concern about potential long-term side effects of inhaled corticosteroids. Numerous studies have repeatedly shown that even long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids has very few if any sustained, clinically significant side effects, including changes in bone health, growth, or weight. However, the goal always remains to treat all individuals with the least amount of medication that is effective. Patients with asthma should be routinely reassessed for any appropriate changes to their medical regimen.''Asthma medications can be administered via inhalers either with or without a spacer or nebulized solution. It is important to note that if an individual has proper technique with an inhaler, the amount of medication deposited in the ''lungs'' is no different than that when using a nebulized solution. When prescribing asthma medications, it is essential to provide the appropriate teaching on proper delivery technique.''Smoking cessation'' and/or minimizing exposure to ''secondhand smoke'' are critical when treating asthma. Treating concurrent conditions such as allergic rhinitis and ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') may also improve asthma control. ''Vaccinations'' such as the annual ''influenza'' vaccination and ''pneumonia'' vaccination are also indicated.''Although the vast majority of individuals with asthma are treated as outpatients, treatment of severe exacerbations can require management in the emergency department or hospital. These individuals typically require use of supplemental oxygen, early administration of systemic steroids, and frequent or even continuous administration of bronchodilators via a nebulized solution. Individuals at high risk for poor asthma outcomes are referred to a specialist (''pulmonologist'' or allergist). The following factors should prompt consideration or referral:'   adequately control symptoms, minimize the risk of future exacerbations, maintain normal lung function, maintain normal activity levels, and take the least amount of medication possible with the least amount of potential side effects. Short-acting bronchodilators (albuterol [Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir, ProAir RespiClick, Maxair, Xopenex]) provide quick relief for symptoms occurring despite controller medications. These may also be used alone in patients with occasional symptoms or patients experiencing symptoms with exercise only. Inhaled steroids (budesonide [Pulmicort Turbuhaler, Pulmicort Respules], fluticasone [Flovent, Arnuity Ellipta, Armon Air RespiClick], beclomethasone [Qvar], mometasone [Asmanex], ciclesonide [Alvesco], flunisolide [Aerobid, Aerospan]) are first-line anti-inflammatory therapies. Long-acting bronchodilators (salmeterol [Serevent], formoterol [Foradil], vilanterol) can be added to ICS as additive therapy. LABAs should never be used alone for the treatment of asthma. ICS/LABA combination agents combine corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators. Fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair, AirDuo, Wixela), budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort), fluticasone/vilanterol (Breo), mometasone/formoterol (Dulera). Leukotriene modifiers (montelukast [Singulair], zafirlukast [Accolate], zileuton [Zyflo]) can also serve as anti-inflammatory agents. Anticholinergic agents or antimuscarinic agents (ipratropium [Atrovent, Atrovent HFA], tiotropium [Spiriva], umeclidinium [Incruse Ellipta]) can help decrease sputum production. There is one triple combination agent of an inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting bronchodilator, and anti-muscarinic agent: fluticasone/vilanterol/umeclidium (Trelegy) that is most often used for asthma/COPD overlap. Anti-IgE treatment (omalizumab [Xolair]) can be used in allergic asthma. Anti-IL5 treatment (mepolizumab [Nucala], reslizumab [Cinqair], and benralizumab [Fasenra]) can be used in eosinophilic asthma. Anti IL-4 receptor antagonist (dupilumab, Dupixent) is approved for moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma. It is also approved for atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. Chromones (cromolyn [Intal, Opticrom, Gastrocrom], nedocromil [Alocril]) stabilize mast cells (allergic cells) but are rarely used in clinical practice. Theophylline (Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24) also helps with bronchodilation (opening the airways) but is rarely used in clinical practice due to an unfavorable side-effect profile. Systemic steroids (prednisone [Deltasone, Liquid Pred], prednisolone [Flo-Pred, Pediapred, Orapred, Orapred ODT], methylprednisolone [Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol], dexamethasone [DexPak]) are potent anti-inflammatory agents that are routinely used to treat asthma exacerbations but pose numerous unwanted side effects if used repeatedly or chronically. Numerous additional monoclonal antibodies are also currently being studied and will likely be available within the next couple of years. Immunotherapy or allergy shots have been shown to decrease medication reliance in allergic asthma. There are no home remedies that have proven benefit for asthma. History of ICU admission or multiple hospitalizations for asthma History of multiple visits to the emergency department for asthma History of frequent or daily use of systemic steroids for asthma Ongoing symptoms despite the use of appropriate medications Significant allergies contributing to poorly controlled asthma"
What should someone do when experiencing an asthma attack?,"'Patients experiencing acute ''asthma symptoms'' should first use their rescue inhaler (albuterol). If asthma symptoms are worsening and use of albuterol is increasing, then asthma patients should have a medical evaluation. A course of oral steroids may be indicated and an adjustment in asthma maintenance therapy may be needed. If symptoms are rapidly progressive, asthma patients should seek emergency medical care.' "
What is an asthma action plan?,'Patient education is a critical component in the successful management of asthma. An asthma action plan provides an individual with specific directions for daily asthma management and for adjusting medications in response to increasing symptoms or decreasing lung function.'  
What is the prognosis for asthma?,"'The prognosis for asthma is generally favorable. Children experience complete remission more often than adults. Although adults with asthma experience a greater rate of loss in their lung function as compared to age-controlled counterparts, this decline is usually not as severe as seen in other conditions, such as ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD) or ''emphysema''. Asthma in the absence of other comorbidities does not appear to shorten life expectancy. Risk factors for poor prognosis from asthma include''The airway narrowing in asthma may become fixed over time and can resemble COPD or ''emphysema''. The other main complication of asthma is due to side effects from oral steroid use, which can include bone loss (''osteoporosis''), ''weight gain'', and glucose intolerance.' a history of hospitalizations, especially ICU admissions or intubation, frequent reliance on systemic steroids, significant medical comorbidities."
Is it possible to prevent asthma?,"'With the increasing prevalence of asthma, numerous studies have looked for risk factors and ways to potentially prevent asthma. It has been shown that individuals living on farms are protected against wheezing, asthma, and even environmental allergies. The role of air pollution has been questioned in both the increased incidence of asthma and in regards to asthma exacerbations.''Climate change is also being studied as a factor in the increased incidence of asthma. Maternal ''smoking during pregnancy'' is a risk factor for asthma and poor outcomes. Tobacco smoke is also a significant risk factor for the development and progression of asthma. Treatment of environmental allergies with ''allergen'' immunotherapy, or ''allergy'"" shots, has been shown to decrease a child's risk of developing asthma. The development of asthma is ultimately a complex process influenced by many environmental and genetic factors, and currently there is no proven way to decrease an individual's risk of developing asthma."" "
What is the definition of bronchiectasis?,"""Bronchiectasis (pronounced as brong-ke-EK-tah-sis and derived from the Greek bronkhia meaning branches of the lung's main bronchi plus the Greek word ektasis meaning dilation) is the abnormal widening of the bronchi or their branches that usually causes an increased risk for infection."" "
What is bronchiectasis?,"'Bronchiectasis is a condition in which the bronchial tubes in the lung become damaged from inflammation or other causes and the smooth muscles of the bronchial tubes are destroyed. In addition, elasticity of the bronchi is often lost. Bronchiectasis may be acquired or have a genetic origin. Many clinicians consider bronchiectasis to be a form of ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''); it includes ''chronic bronchitis'' and ''emphysema''.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of bronchiectasis?,"'The signs and symptoms of bronchiectasis develop and change over time. The first common symptoms include a recurrent ''cough'' and sputum production; usually the sputum/mucous is clear but eventually may become bloody if injuries to the bronchial wall occur. In addition, mucous may change to a green or yellow color when infection is present. As the disease progresses, chronic ''coughing'' with mucous production increases and the person usually becomes more fatigued and short of breath as lung function decreases. Some people may develop ''wheezing''; some may ''lose weight'' due to the increased effort needed to breathe. Occasionally, symptoms of a primary disease like ''pneumonia'' may mask some of the symptoms of bronchiectasis so it may be more difficult to diagnose bronchiectasis if an underlying disease is present.'  "
What causes bronchiectasis?,"'Bronchiectasis is caused by damage to the walls of the bronchi; this damage consists of destroying the smooth muscles and the elastic tissue that allow the bronchial tubes to contract. Consequently, if the bronchi are damaged, secretions that are normally produced in the lung are not well removed and cause an increased likelihood that infections (''pneumonia'', ''bronchitis'') can develop. Unfortunately these infections can cause further damage to the bronchial walls producing a cycle of increased damaged and then increased infection. As the cycle continues, lung functionality decreases.''As stated previously, the causes can be acquired (infection, environmental exposure, drug and/or ''alcohol abuse'', for example) and/or congenital (''alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency'', immotile cilia syndrome, for example). One common ''inherited'' cause of bronchiectasis is ''cystic fibrosis''. The other causes of bronchiectasis are sometimes referred to collectively as non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.'  "
What are the types of bronchiectasis?,"'Some researchers have described three primary types of bronchiectasis. These types are defined by their anatomical/microscopic appearance.'   Cylindrical bronchiectasis, the mildest form of bronchiectasis that shows the loss of normal airway tapering. Saccular or varicose bronchiectasis shows further distortion of the airway wall along with more mucous and sputum production by the individual; some of the bronchi may appear to be in a beaded form. The most severe form of bronchiectasis and the least common form is cystic bronchiectasis. This form has large air spaces and a honeycombed appearance in CT scan studies and usually has thicker walls than the blebs seen with emphysema. Some people have more than one type in their lungs."
Who is at risk for bronchiectasis?,"  People at risk for bronchiectasis include: Individuals with alpha-1 antiproteinase (alpha-1 antitrypsin) deficiency or an embryological defect termed immotile cilia syndrome. People with cystic fibrosis Children that develop lung infections with lung tissue destruction are risk for bronchiectasis to develop later in life. People that have recurrent lung infections, aspirate foreign bodies, have had a history of tuberculosis or inflammatory bowel disease. People that abuse drugs and alcohol. Individuals that are exposed to toxic gases or any substances that damage lung tissue."
When should I contact my doctor for bronchiectasis?,"'You should contact your doctor for medical care if you have a ''chronic cough'' (lasting about three weeks or more), a new onset of ''shortness of breath'' and/or any ''coughing up blood'' (hemoptysis). Individuals who have repeated bouts of ''pneumonia'' and increased sputum production should also seek medical care.' "
How is the diagnosis of bronchiectasis made?,"'The diagnosis of bronchiectasis usually involves a history and physical exam, with a history being a chronic daily ''cough'' and sputum production. Sputum analysis, ''chest X-ray'' and high-resolution CT of the chest (lungs) are tests usually ordered. In most cases, the definitive diagnosis is made with the CT of the chest although occasionally a chest X-ray is sufficient. These exams usually show the changes in the ''bronchioles'' that are consistent with bronchiectasis.''For some patients, other tests may be ordered to determine if underlined diseases are contributing to bronchiectasis. Such tests include alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, autoimmune screening tests, and measures of ''vitamin D deficiency'' as this is commonly found in bronchiectasis and correlates with disease severity. Patients may need to be tested for cystic fibrosis. Chronic infections like ''fungal infections'' (''Aspergillus'') may need to be ruled out.'""Pulmonary function tests also may be ordered to determine the patient's baseline lung function to help determine the extent of lung tissue compromise."" "
Can bronchiectasis be prevented?,"'Bronchiectasis due to genetic defects is currently not preventable. However, the incidence in the rate of progression of bronchiectasis can be reduced by avoiding those environmental factors that increase bronchiectasis risk such as alcohol, drugs, environmental toxins and ''smoking'' cigarettes. In addition, avoiding those situations that can lead to pulmonary infections can reduce the risk of developing bronchiectasis. ''Pertussis'' (''whooping cough'') in children can lead to bronchiectasis later in life. Immunization can prevent this cause.' "
What is the prognosis of bronchiectasis?,"'In general, congenital causes of bronchiectasis (cystic fibrosis, for example) usually have a worse prognosis than bronchiectasis developed from acquired diseases. Those with acquired bronchiectasis can have a fair to good prognosis if bronchiectasis is recognized early and appropriate treatment is done. However, bronchiectasis is often slowly progressive. Those patients that pay attention to getting early and appropriate treatment along with avoiding situations that may exacerbate the disease will likely have a fair to good prognosis.' "
What is the treatment for bronchiectasis?,"'Unfortunately, bronchiectasis is not a curable disease, but a slowly progressive disease. Treatment for bronchiectasis is based on control of symptoms and preventing additional infections. Treatment protocols frequently include keeping immunizations up-to-date, eliminating aggravating factors such as ''cigarette'' smoke, alcohol and drugs, and encouraging good ''nutrition''. Increasing fluid intake to keep mucous less sticky is another treatment. Sometimes an expectorant (to loosen the mucous) and mucous thinning medication can help decrease symptoms.''Chest physical therapy, which usually involves rhythmic clapping on the back of your chest, can help with loosening sputum so it can be coughed up.''If patients acquire an infection, antibiotics effective against the pathogen (virus, bacteria, or fungus) and chest physiotherapy are utilized as primary treatments. In addition, ''bronchodilators'', ''corticosteroid'' therapy and, if needed, oxygen therapy is utilized in many patients. Patients with severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis usually need hospitalization and IV medications.''Patients with bronchiectasis that is poorly controlled with antibiotics may require surgical therapy. Surgical therapy (or in some individuals, ''bronchoscopy'') can remove mucus plugging, foreign bodies or tumors that exacerbate bronchiectasis. Excessive hemoptysis may need to be treated surgically or by bronchial artery embolization. Some patients may benefit from surgical removal of nonfunctional lung tissue.'  "
Facts you should know about bronchiolitis," 

Read Doctor's View
  Bronchiolitis is a viral illness seen most commonly during the winter season. Bronchiolitis is caused by many viruses. The most common viral trigger is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Symptoms of bronchiolitis include nasal congestion and moderate non-purulent (doesn't contain pus) nasal discharge associated with pulmonary distress that may range from mild to severe. Bronchiolitis is diagnosed based on the person's signs and symptoms, age, season of the year, findings on physical exam, assessment of the patient's blood oxygenation, and a nasal swab to determine the specific viral cause. Bronchiolitis is generally a self-limited disease and can be treated at home. Most children do not require medications; however, high-risk infants and toddlers may need to be hospitalized due to respiratory distress and/or to maintain hydration. Bronchiolitis prevention strategies range from thorough hand washing by caregivers to rare administration of palivizumab (Synagis) to infants of selected high-risk. The prognosis for a person with bronchiolitis is excellent."
What is bronchiolitis?,"'Bronchiolitis is a viral infection affecting both the upper respiratory region (nose, mouth and throat) and lower respiratory tract (''lungs''). It is an illness in which effects are most severe in children under two years of age. Bronchiolitis is most commonly seen during the winter season (November thru March in the northern hemisphere). ' "
What is the difference between bronchiolitis and bronchitis?,"'Since the terms ""bronchiolitis"" and ""''bronchitis''"" are very similar, there may be ''confusion'' regarding each diagnosis. The difference between the two terms depends upon the anatomical area of the ''lungs'' that is infected. ' The
	bronchioles 
are very small and delicate airways that lead directly to the alveoli.  Alveoli 
are the microscopic ""cul de sacs"" of the lung tree. 
 The alveoli are where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs.
	 Bronchi are much larger ""pipes"" which make up the first two to three branches of 
the lungs immediately after the trachea (windpipe).  Bronchiolitis is an 
infant to early childhood illness.  Most pediatric pulmonary specialists 
believe that
	bronchitis is never seen in this age range, but is more likely seen 
in teens and adults. 
	 
Cigarette smoke exposure is a predisposing 
factor for both diseases.  Both bronchiolitis and bronchitis are viral infections and do 
not require antibiotics."
What are bronchiolitis symptoms and signs?,"'The signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis may be broken down into those affecting the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth and throat), and lower respiratory tract (lungs).''Upper respiratory tract symptoms of bronchiolitis include:''Following 2 to 3 days of these upper respiratory symptoms, lower respiratory tract symptoms develop with symptoms of''Young children, especially those younger than 6 months of age, are most likely to develop more severe symptoms that include:'  Profuse watery nasal drainage Nasal congestion Possibly mild sore throat Middle ear pain may be caused by a viral infection. Fever is uncommon. cough, rapid and shallow breathing, and increased work of breathing and wheezing. Bluish/grey skin discoloration (emergency treatment is required) Incessant cough compromising the infant's ability to guarantee adequate fluid and calorie intake Progressive fatigue Fever above 101F (38.3C) and worsening of respiratory distress (for example, retraction of muscles between the ribs or above the sternum (breast bone) Nasal flaring with inspiration Respiratory rate greater than 70 inspirations per minute and grunting with respiration Rarely, young infants may have episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) associated with exhaustion due to respiratory fatigue."
Is bronchiolitis contagious?,"'Bronchiolitis caused by RVS is highly ''contagious''. Other viral causes of bronchiolitis also are very likely to cause disease following exposure. Spread of these respiratory ''viruses'' is via ''sneezing'' and ''coughing'' causing a direct person-to-person transmission. Many of the viruses that cause RSV can survive many hours on surfaces and a person may inadvertently inoculate themselves by touching one of these areas (for example, table top, shopping cart, etc.) and then bringing their hands to the nose or mouth areas.' "
What causes bronchiolitis?,"'Many viruses have been shown to cause the characteristic symptoms associated with bronchiolitis. The most common viral trigger is the ''respiratory syncytial virus'' (RSV). Studies have shown that RSV has infected most children by two years of age, and many of these children will have moderate to severe symptoms during their illness. Unfortunately, infection with RSV does not provoke long-term immunity and thus a child may redevelop symptoms several times from infancy through adulthood. RSV is generally credited with causing about 75% of all bronchiolitis. Other viral causes of bronchiolitis include:' rhinovirus influenza virus, and a scattering of other viruses individually causing."
Are there children more at risk for bronchiolitis?,'Risk factors for bronchiolitis include:' Prematurity (< 29 weeks' gestation before birth) Age < 12 weeks Chronic pulmonary diseases or anatomical defects of the airways Selected forms of congenital heart disease Immunodeficiency Certain neurologic disease Exposure to secondhand smoke Crowded living conditions (including daycare) Not being breastfed.
When should I contact my child's pediatrician about bronchiolitis?,"""You should contact your child's pediatrician or be evaluated in the emergency room if your child:"" Has a bluish or grey color to their face, nails or lips (if severe: call 911 immediately) Is breathing very quickly (> 70 times per minute - this will generally appear twice as fast as normal) Is having respiratory distress - quick/shallow breathing, struggling to inhale or exhale Has flaring of the nostrils or retractions of the muscles between the ribs or above the breast bone Demonstrating progressive fatigue Development of a fever > 101F (38.3C) Inability to take in adequate fluids or is showing signs of dehydration"
How do doctors diagnose bronchiolitis?,"""Bronchiolitis is generally diagnosed history and physical examination. The most common laboratory tests for children with bronchiolitis would include assessment of the child's blood oxygenation via a finger/toe sensor and a nasal swab to determine the specific viral cause (for example, RSV vs. ""'influenza'' virus). This is most commonly indicated if a child is to be admitted to the hospital. A ''chest X-ray'' may be ordered if a concern for ''pneumonia'' exists.' "
What are home remedies or therapies for bronchiolitis?,"'In most instances home management of a child with bronchiolitis by parents should be all that is necessary. The foundation for care of infants and children with bronchiolitis includes'  maintaining hydration and (in toddlers) nutrition; ensuring appropriate pulmonary function (i.e. adequate oxygenation; and close monitoring for worsening of disease progression or the development of complications (for example, pneumonia, sleep apnea, etc.)."
What is the medical treatment bronchiolitis?,"'Until 2014 a mainstay of management of bronchiolitis involved the administration of inhaled ''bronchodilators''. Evaluation of several agents demonstrated a potential slight improvement of respiratory distress symptoms but no long-term benefits (for example, duration of symptoms, shortening of the need for supplemental oxygen, etc.). Because there are children who have ''asthma'' exacerbations during the bronchiolitis season, some centers will provide a single ''inhalation'' ''bronchodilator'' therapy treatment. Should a substantial improvement be demonstrated, a consideration of further similar therapy can be considered. Children who do not demonstrate such an improvement need no further inhaled bronchodilators. Chest physiotherapy has not been demonstrated to be of benefit for pulmonary symptoms and is thus not recommended.''Oral bronchodilators and oral/IV/intramuscular administration of steroids provide no benefit for routine bronchiolitis therapy and should not be administered.''In very young infants (< 6 months old) or those with underlying health issues, observation and management in a hospital setting may be needed. These patients will commonly receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, monitoring of blood oxygen saturation, and in selected circumstances monitoring of blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, maintaining appropriate hydration status.'""Respiratory rates > 70 per minute may require either nasal gastric tube utilization or IV fluid administration due to changes of choking and pulmonary aspiration due to the child's rapid respiratory rate or work of breathing.""'In order for a patient to be discharged from the hospital they must meet the following criteria.''Because bronchiolitis is caused by a virus no antibiotics are necessary to treat it.'  Have an appropriate respiratory rate An improvement in respiratory distress and normal oxygenation without supplementation Adequate oral intake and maintaining good hydration Parents who are confident in their ability to monitor their infant once provided with written guidelines prior to hospital discharge."
Is it possible to prevent bronchiolitis?," While bronchiolitis is highly contagious, frequent hand washing will help lessen the exposure frequency. Breastfeeding and avoiding secondhand smoke also will benefit in the prevention of bronchiolitis and as other respiratory and intestinal illnesses. A medication called palivizumab (Synagis) acts by boosting a patient's immune system against RSV. Palivizumab is injected into the infant's leg muscle on a monthly basis during the RSV season. It has a restricted use profile that includes: moderate prematurity (< 29 weeks gestational age), chronic lung disease and/or pulmonary anatomical defects, certain types of congenital heart disease, and immune compromised children. Annual influenza vaccination for all infants 6 months of age and older will lessen this other major cause of bronchiolitis. Those who provide babysitting and daycare should also be immunized against influenza."
What should you know about acute bronchitis?,"'The medical definition of acute ''bronchitis'' is a ''cough'' lasting five or more days suggests acute ''bronchitis'' as a cause. Sometimes people with recurrent acute bronchitis (flare-ups) develop ''chronic bronchitis'' and/or a ''respiratory infection''. Bronchitis is an inflammation of your bronchial tubes (the tubes that carry air to your ''lungs'' and ''makeup'' the bronchial tree).''Acute bronchitis can be ''contagious'', however, acute bronchitis caused by exposure to pollutants, tobacco smoke and other chemicals is not contagious''The primary symptom of acute bronchitis is a ''cough''. Other symptoms include sputum production, ''sore throat'', ''nasal congestion'', ''headache'', and cough up sputum or vomit ''mucus''.''The most common way people become infected with or “get” acute bronchitis is by a viral or bacterial infection; however, other causes may include irritants like tobacco smoke, air pollution, or chemicals. Some home remedies may relieve and soothe ''bronchitis symptoms''.''There are two types of bronchitis 1) acute bronchitis, and 2) chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a cough that occurs every day with sputum production that lasts for at least 3 months, 2 years in a row.''Some medications may relieve bronchitis symptoms, for example, cough suppressants, ''NSAIDs'', ''acetaminophen'', and antibiotics (for ''bacterial infections'' only). In children under age 2, a pediatrician should be consulted before OCT medicines are used. In children under age 2, consult a pediatrician before using over the counter (OCT) medicine.''How do you get acute bronchitis?''Acute bronchitis is contagious if the causes is viral or bacterial, and will last until the the symptoms go away. Bronchitis usually lasts about 10 to 20 days, if it lasts longer than that you probably have chronic bronchitis, which is defined as a cough that occurs every day with sputum production for the last three months 2 years in a row.' "
What is acute bronchitis?,"'Acute bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchial tubes (the airways that allow air to pass from the mouth to the lungs) that usually is caused by ''viruses'' or bacteria. Although other irritants for example, smoke or pollution, also may cause the disease, they are far less frequent causes.'  "
Is acute bronchitis contagious? ,"'The majority of people with acute bronchitis are contagious if the cause is an infectious agent such as a virus or bacterium. The contagious period for both bacteria and viruses is usually as long as the patient has symptoms although for a few viruses, then maybe contagious a few days before symptoms appear. Contagious viruses that may cause acute bronchitis are listed in the causes section. Tracheobronchitis (inflammation of both the bronchiole(s) and the trachea) may lead to lung infections (respiratory infections like ''pneumonia'').''People usually are less likely to be contagious as the symptoms wane. However, acute bronchitis caused by the immune system, exposure to pollutants, tobacco smoke (including ''second-hand smoke''), or other environmental chemicals or toxins that are bronchiole and/or lung irritants are not contagious.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis?,"'Coughing'' is the most common symptom of acute bronchitis. The coughing begins early in the disease and usually lasts about 10 to 20 days as it gradually subsides. About 50% of individuals have a productive cough with either clear, yellow, greenish, or occasionally blood tinged sputum. Consequently, signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis may include:''Children may also have:''If a person develops fever, shortness of breath, ''cyanosis'' or ''chest pain'', they likely have another problem but not acute bronchitis.'   Coughing Productive cough Mild shortness of breath Sore throat Nasal congestion Headache Mild fever and chills Chest discomfort Muscle aches Fatigue Wheezing Runny nose Mild fever May gag or vomit mucus"
What causes acute bronchitis?,"'The most common cause of acute bronchitis are viral (short-term viral). There is no ""bronchitis virus” as many different types of viruses can cause bronchitis. The main genera of viruses that cause acute bronchitis include:''Many people develop mild symptoms of acute bronchitis so often that the exact virus that caused the infection is never determined. In addition, the ''common cold'' may mimic an acute bronchitis flair-up.''Bacteria are less common causes of acute bronchitis. Bacterial causes of the disease (bacterial bronchitis) include:''Other irritants (for example, tobacco smoke, chemicals, etc.) may irritate the bronchi and cause acute bronchitis. Consequently, bronchial or bronchitis infections are not the only cause of acute bronchitis.' Influenza (the same virus that causes colds) Parainfluenza RSV Rhinovirus Adenovirus Corona viruses Mycoplasma Streptococcus Bordetella Moraxella Haemophilus Chlamydia pneumoniae"
Who gets acute bronchitis?,"'Risk factors for acute bronchitis are the same as those for getting viral and bacterial infections and two include:''Being in close contact with people that are coughing, ''sneezing'', and touching items that infected persons recently handled.''People that are exposed to air pollution, tobacco smoke, and to chemicals that are aerosolized are at higher risk for acute bronchitis. Unfortunately, many people worldwide are at risk of getting this type of bronchitis. About 4.6 out of 100 individuals may develop acute bronchitis each year (or about 12.5 million in the US). The highest risks for the disease are the winter months.'  "
How can I tell if I have acute bronchitis?,"'Because acute bronchitis has many causes is often self-limiting within 10 to 20 days and its main symptom is coughing, most doctors consider the diagnosis after a history and physical without additional tests. If the diagnosis is not clear or the specific cause needs to be identified , such tests as sputum cytology, throat cultures, influenza tests, chest ''X-rays'', blood ''gas'', procalcitonin levels and even ''bronchoscopy'' have been used to identify specific viral, bacterial and other sources or causes or rule out more severe illnesses (such as a ''pneumonia''). Usually, the symptoms of acute bronchitis are mild to moderate and symptoms like cough are treated for a few days before a more extensive workup is begun.' "
How long does acute bronchitis last?,"'Chronic bronchitis is defined as a cough that occurs every day with sputum production that lasts for at least 3 months, 2 years in a row. However, acute bronchitis may develop into chronic bronchitis in some individuals and even lead to ''COPD'' (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'').' A cough lasting five or more days suggests acute bronchitis as a cause. Acute bronchitis usually lasts about 10 to 20 days. People with recurrent acute bronchitis may develop chronic bronchitis."
What natural or home remedies treat and cure acute bronchitis?,"'Home remedies may help reduce acute bronchitis symptoms. For example:''If symptoms worsen, see your doctor. For children under age 2 (and some doctors recommend under age 6), the doctor should be consulted before OTC medicines are used.'   Stay well hydrated by drinking fluids Use a humidifier to moisten the air. Avoid dairy products because they thicken mucous secretions Avoid alcohol and caffeine because of potential drug interactions Avoid exposure to environmental smoke and other air pollutants Over-the-counter (OTC) cough suppressants and cough drops can help reduce coughing symptoms."
What is the treatment for acute bronchitis?,"'Bed rest and supportive care such as reducing coughing are the main treatments for acute bronchitis. Usually, antibiotics are not needed, especially if bronchitis has viral or environmental causes.''For some people who have wheezing with their cough, ''bronchodilators'' (beta2 agonists) may be helpful.''The most useful treatments are directed at reducing cough symptoms with over the counter preparations containing ''guaifenesin'' (an expectorant) and a mucolytic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (NSAIDs) often are added to reduce inflammation and help relieve discomfort. However, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' does not recommend giving OTC cough and ''cold'' medications to children under two years of age. These medicines may cause harmful side effects that can be life-threatening to young children. Side effects include organ toxicity (kidneys, for example) and death.'  "
What medications treat and cure acute bronchitis?,"'The following medication(s) may be helpful for people with acute bronchitis.''Do not give drugs like NSAIDs and ''aspirin'"" to young children and young adults due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. Check with a pediatrician before giving over-the-counter medicine to your child.""'Primary care physicians and pediatricians often treat acute bronchitis. If acute bronchitis reoccurs (recurring bronchitis), other specialties such as allergists, infectious disease or ENT specialists may be consulted. If you are ''pregnant'', consult your OB/GYN or ''Midwife''.' Robitussin and Delsym: Use this medicine sparingly because coughing helps remove irritants from the air passages, and you want to cough these irritants out of these passges in the lungs. Mucolytics (Mucinex, Mucomyst): These medicines help remove sticky mucus from the airways. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) may reduce inflammation and/or discomfort. Inhaler bronchodilators: This medicine opens airways, which makes it easier to breathe. Antibiotics: Acute bronchitis is treated with antibiotics only if the cause is bacterial (suspected or diagnosed). Reports indicate that about 65%-80% of people with acute bronchitis receive an antibiotic despite evidence that antibiotics are not effective in treating acute bronchitis (with a few exceptions). Antibiotics are not recommended for routine acute bronchitis treatment."
When should I contact my doctor about acute bronchitis?,"'Most people do not need to contact their doctor since acute bronchitis is usually limited to about 10 to 20 days and then resolves. However, call your doctor or other healthcare professional if your symptoms become severe or if you develop a fever that does not go down. Moreover, if other symptoms develop (short of breath, ''night sweats''), if the symptoms persist past about 20 day, or if you have repeated bouts of acute bronchitis during the year, you should contact your doctor.''If you think your child has acute bronchitis (especially those aged two and under), call your pediatrician to have your child seen. Some doctors recommend that pediatricians treat children under 6 years old.' "
What are the possible complications of acute bronchitis?,"'Complications of acute bronchitis are infrequent but include a ''respiratory infection'' like ''pneumonia'' (viral and/or bacterial), chronic bronchitis, ''asthma'', and ''sinusitis''. In addition, depending on the pathogen, complications include ''tuberculosis'', ''whooping cough'' (''pertussis''), and other infectious lung diseases. It may eventually lead to development of ''COPD''.'  "
What is bronchitis?,"'Bronchitis is a term that describes inflammation of the bronchial tubes (bronchi and the smaller branches termed ''bronchioles'') that results in excessive secretions of mucus into the tubes, leading to tissue swelling that can narrow or close off bronchial tubes. Bronchial tubes extend from the trachea and terminate at the alveoli in the ''lungs''. The bronchial system resembles an inverted tree and is sometimes termed the ""bronchial tree."" A few authors include the trachea and upper ''airway'' in the definition of bronchitis.''There are two major types of bronchitis, acute and chronic. Chronic bronchitis differs from ''acute bronchitis'' in several ways, for example, pathology, progression of disease, major causes, treatments, and prognosis. Recurrent incidences of ''acute bronchitis'' are the first steps that can lead to developing chronic bronchitis, according to some doctors and researchers.' "
What is acute bronchitis? What are the  symptoms of acute bronchitis?,"'Acute bronchitis is bronchitis that is short-lived. Acute bronchitis lasts about two weeks, and usually people recover with no permanent damage to the bronchial tree. ''Viruses'' such as ''influenza'', ''respiratory syncytial virus'' (RSV), and rhinoviruses cause the majority of cases of acute bronchitis, while the remainder are caused by bacteria (for example, ''Mycoplasma, Pneumococcus'') or short-term exposure to chemical irritants (for example, tobacco smoke, ''acid reflux'', inhaled solvents).''Symptoms of acute bronchitis may include:''Some people may ''cough'' up ''phlegm''.'   cough, wheezing, fever, chills and malaise, and shortness of breath especially with exertion."
What is chronic bronchitis?,"'Chronic bronchitis is defined as a ''cough'' that occurs every day with sputum production that lasts for at least 3 months, two years in a row. This definition was developed to help select uniform patient populations for research purposes, for example, to study medication therapies for the treatment of chronic bronchitis.''Many of the bronchi develop chronic inflammation with swelling and excess mucus production. The inflammation causes a change in the lining cells of the airways to varying degrees. Many cells that line the ''airway'' lose the function of their cilia (hair-like appendages that are capable of beating rapidly), and eventually, the ciliated cells are lost. Cilia perform the function of moving particles and fluid (usually mucus) over the lining surface in such structures as the trachea, bronchial tubes, and nasal ''cavities'"" to keep these hollow structures clear of particles and fluids. These ciliated cells that help in the clearance of secretions are often replaced by so-called goblet cells. This group of cells secretes mucus into the airway. The warm moist environment of the airway along with the nutrients in the mucus is an excellent medium for growing bacteria. The mucus often becomes infected and discolored from the bacterial overgrowth and the body's inflammatory response to it. The inflammation, swelling, and mucus frequently and significantly inhibit the airflow to and from the lung alveoli by narrowing and partially obstructing the bronchi and bronchioles.""'The muscles that surround some of the airways can be stimulated by this airway irritation. This muscular spasm also known as bronchospasm can result in further airway narrowing. With long-standing inflammation, as can be seen in chronic bronchitis, this muscular spasm and inflammation result in a fixed, nonreversible narrowing of the airway, and the condition is termed ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''). Chronic ''coughing'' develops as the body attempts to open and clear the bronchial airways of particles and mucus or as an overreaction to ongoing inflammation. Chronic bronchitis can be a progressive disease; symptoms (listed below) increase over time. Some NIH investigators consider chronic bronchitis a type of ''COPD''.''COPD'' also includes the entities of ''emphysema'', chronic bronchitis, and chronic ''asthma''. These conditions are not always separable and patients often have components of each. In the case of chronic bronchitis, the fixed airway obstruction, airway inflammation, and retained secretions can result in a mismatch of blood flow and airflow in the ''lungs''. This can impair oxygenation of the blood as well as the removal of the waste product, carbon dioxide.''Although people of any age can develop chronic bronchitis, the majority of people diagnosed with the disease are 45 years of age or older.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis?,"'The major signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis are:''Other signs and symptoms that may accompany chronic bronchitis include''Exacerbation of chronic bronchitis occurs when symptoms worsen or become more frequent. These exacerbations often require antibiotics, and may need steroid medication and an increase in respiratory inhaled medications. Signs and symptoms of exacerbation of chronic bronchitis include:'   Cough and sputum production are the most common symptoms. They usually last for at least 3 months and occur daily. The intensity of coughing and the amount and frequency of sputum production vary from patient to patient. Sputum may be clear, yellowish, greenish, or occasionally, blood-tinged. Since cigarette smoke is the most common cause for chronic bronchitis, it should not be surprising that the most common presentation is so called smoker's cough. This is characterized by a cough that tends to be worse upon arising and is often productive of discolored mucus in the early part of the day. As the day progresses, less mucus is produced. Shortness of breath (dyspnea) gradually increases with the severity of the disease. Usually, people with chronic bronchitis get short of breath with activity and begin coughing; dyspnea at rest usually signals that COPD or emphysema has developed. Wheezing (a coarse whistling sound produced when airways are partially obstructed) often occurs. fatigue, sore throat, muscle aches, nasal congestion, and headaches. Severe coughing that causes chest discomfort or chest pain. Cyanosis (bluish/grayish skin coloration) may develop in people with advanced COPD. Fever may indicate a secondary viral or bacterial lung infection."
What are the causes of chronic bronchitis?,"'There are many causes of chronic bronchitis, but the main cause is ''cigarette'' smoke. Statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that about 49% of ''smokers'' develop chronic bronchitis and 24% develop ''emphysema''/COPD.''The major risk factor for individuals to develop chronic bronchitis is ''tobacco smoking'' and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure. However, there are others, such as' Many other inhaled irritants (for example, smog, industrial pollutants, and solvents) can also result in chronic bronchitis. Viral and bacterial infections that result in acute bronchitis may lead to chronic bronchitis if people have repeated bouts with infectious agents. Also, underlying disease processes (for example, asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, congestive heart failure, familial genetic predisposition to bronchitis, and congenital or acquired dilation of the bronchioles, known as bronchiectasis) may cause chronic bronchitis to develop, but these are infrequent causes compared to cigarette smoking. repeated exposure to pollutants (especially airborne materials such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, bromine, hydrogen sulfide), dust, repeated bouts of acute bronchitis or pneumonia, and gastric reflux (by inhalation of gastric contents)."
When should you see a doctor for chronic bronchitis?,"'If a person with diagnosed chronic bronchitis (or COPD or emphysema) develops severe problems with ''breathing'', cyanosis ,or fever, they should seek emergency medical care immediately.' Ideally, a person should seek medical care before chronic bronchitis develops. It is reasonable for people to seek care for tobacco addiction and the occasional chronic cough (occurring less than daily for 3 months) and to get medical help to potentially avoid developing chronic bronchitis. However, any daily cough that lasts for at least 3 months in a person should be investigated by a physician. If a person develops chronic (3 months or longer) cough, difficulty breathing, sputum production, and other symptoms, it may represent the first bout of chronic bronchitis. Thus, seeking medical care may help slow or prevent the usual progression of the disease."
How is chronic bronchitis diagnosed?,"""Health care professionals diagnose chronic bronchitis based on a person's medical history, physical exam, and diagnostic tests. A history of a daily productive (sputum production) cough that lasts at least 3 months, especially if has occurred two years in a row, fits the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. The physical examination often allows health-care professionals to hear wheezes and a prolongation of the ""'exhalation'' of breathing, which are signs of airflow obstruction.''A ''chest X-ray'' is often performed to help rule out other lung problems (for example, ''pneumonia'', bronchial obstructions). Additional tests such as a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), arterial blood ''gas'' measurements, ''CT scan'' of the chest, and pulmonary function tests are often done to characterize the structure and function of the lungs and to help exclude other conditions (for example, ''lung cancer'', ''tuberculosis'', lung infections). Often a ''pulmonologist'' (a physician with specialized training in the management of lung diseases) can help diagnose and treat chronic bronchitis.' "
What is the treatment for chronic bronchitis?,"'For the majority of cases, the initial treatment is simple to prescribe but frequently ignored or rejected by the patient – stop ''smoking'' cigarettes and avoid second-hand tobacco smoke. People should be encouraged in every way to cease ''smoking'', as continuation will only cause further lung damage. Similarly, blocking or removing other underlying causes of repeated bronchial irritation (for example, exposure to chemical fumes) is a treatment goal. Half of the patients with chronic bronchitis who smoke will no longer cough after 1 month of ''smoking cessation''.''Two major classes of medications are used to treat chronic bronchitis, ''bronchodilators'', and steroids.'   Bronchodilators (for example, albuterol [Vent Olin, Proventil, AccuNeb, Vospire, ProAir], metaproterenol [Alupent], formoterol [Foradil], salmeterol [Serevent]) work by relaxing the smooth muscles that encircle the bronchi, which allows the inner airways to expand. Anticholinergic drugs also can act as bronchodilators, including tiotropium (Spiriva) and ipratropium (Atrovent). Steroids (for example, prednisone, methylprednisolone [Medrol, Depo-Medrol]) reduce the inflammatory reaction and thus decrease the bronchial swelling and secretions that in turn allows better airflow because of reduced airway obstruction. Often inhaled steroids are administered since they have fewer side effects than systemic (oral) steroids. Examples include budesonide (Pulmicort), fluticasone (Flovent), beclomethasone (Qvar), and mometasone (Asmanex). Combination therapy with both steroids and bronchodilators is often utilized. These include fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair), budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort), and mometasone/formoterol (Dulera)."
What medications treat chronic bronchitis? What are other medical treatments?,"'PDE4 inhibitors'' are a class of anti-inflammatory agents for certain exacerbations of COPD. They are primarily for exacerbations that involve excessive bronchitis and mucus production. There is currently only one agent available called roflumilast (Daliresp), a pill taken once per day.''Antibiotics:'' Occasionally, antibiotics are used to treat chronic bronchitis exacerbations caused by ''bacterial infections''. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are often the choice. Examples include:''Of course, if a culture is obtained, directed therapy at the specific offending organism is always best.''Over-the-counter'' (OTC)'' cough suppressants such as dextromethorphan (for example, Pertussin, Vicks 44 or ''Benylin'') may be helpful in reducing cough symptoms. OTC preparations with ''guaifenesin'' (for example, ''Robitussin'' or ''Mucinex'') may make patients feel more comfortable but there is no scientific evidence that it helps mucus to become less viscous.' Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin [Levaquin]) Macrolides (clarithromycin [Biaxin], azithromycin [Zithromax, Zmax]) Sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim [Bactrim]) Tetracyclines (doxycycline [Vibramycin]) Pulmonary rehabilitation is another treatment method that combines education and graded physical exercise. The education portion often includes smoking cessation techniques and the relationship of tobacco use to symptoms. Breathing techniques can be very helpful in overcoming the anxiety and discomfort of exacerbations. When chronic bronchitis is severe, airflow and blood flow may not move appropriately through the lungs. It is crucial for lung function that airflow and blood flow to the lung are precisely matched. When they are not, drops in oxygen and increases in carbon dioxide can result with profound negative consequences. Supplemental oxygen therapy may be an integral part of treatment. Often it is required with activity and sleep. Patients with severe disease may benefit from purchasing a small finger oximeter for monitoring blood oxygen levels at rest and with activity."
What natural remedies treat chronic bronchitis symptoms?,"'Certain ""home remedies"" may ease the symptoms of chronic bronchitis.' One of the lessons of pulmonary rehabilitation is to instruct patients on the proper path for air to follow. This involves breathing in through the nose so that the air is moistened, cleansed, and warmed by the function of the upper airways (sinuses). Air is than expelled through the mouth and in some cases with pursed lips to help optimize the lung's function. Cold air often aggravates coughing and difficulty breathing, so avoiding cold air or wearing a cold-air mask (such as a ski mask or face scarf) may help when in cold environments. Dry air also aggravates coughing so warm, humidified air may help by reducing coughing and also may allow mucus to flow more freely, which may result in better clearing of the bronchial airways and less blockage by viscous mucus. Alternative treatments have been suggested by some researchers with little or no evidence of any benefit; and some may even be harmful (for example, herbal teas, high doses of vitamin C, South African geranium herb, eucalyptus oil inhalation therapy, and many others). Check with your doctor or other health-care professional before using any of these remedies or products."
What are the complications of chronic bronchitis?,"'The major complications of chronic bronchitis are:' difficulty breathing, sometimes severe, respiratory failure, pneumonia, Enlargement and weakness of right heart ventricle of the heart caused by lung disease, pneumothorax (collection of air or gas in lung causing lung collapse), polycythemia (abnormally high concentration of red blood cells needed to carry oxygen), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (some NIH researchers consider chronic bronchitis a type of COPD), emphysema, chronic advancement of the disease, and high mortality (death) rate (COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States)."
What is the prognosis for chronic bronchitis?,"'Although the disease is chronic and progressive, affected individuals that are diagnosed early before much bronchial damage occurs stop ''smoking'' (or avoid airborne dust, chemicals, or other situations that lead to bronchial irritation), they often have a good prognosis for many years.''Approximately half of the ''smokers'' with chronic bronchitis will stop coughing after 1 month of smoking cessation. Most patients will no longer cough with continued abstinence from smoking. If airflow obstruction has occurred, this can improve but the improvement level depends on the duration of injury and the compliance with therapy. Obviously, the more impaired patients will have a lesser recovery of lung function.''Conversely, those individuals that have continued bronchial irritation have only a fair to poor prognosis, since repeated bouts with the disease usually get worse, with affected individuals having more frequent incidents of coughing and dyspnea over time and further progression of lung function abnormalities.' "
Can chronic bronchitis be prevented?,"'The majority of instances of chronic bronchitis can be prevented by not smoking and avoiding ''second-hand smoke''. ''Flu'' and pneumococcal ''vaccines'' can help prevent repeated infections that may lead to the disease.'""Certain industries (for example, chemical, textile, and farm workers) are often associated with air-borne chemicals and dust; avoiding air-borne chemicals and dust with appropriate masks may prevent or reduce the individual's chance of developing chronic bronchitis.""'Good control of ''asthma'' may prevent chronic bronchitis from developing. The genetic predisposition to chronic bronchitis is not currently preventable.' "
What is bronchoscopy?,"""Bronchoscopy is a procedure during in which an examiner uses a viewing tube to evaluate a patient's lung and airways including the voice box and vocal cord, trachea, and many branches of bronchi. Bronchoscopy is usually performed by a ""'pulmonologist'' or a thoracic surgeon. Although a bronchoscope does not allow for direct viewing and inspection of the lung tissue itself, samples of the lung tissue can be biopsied through the bronchoscope for examination in the laboratory.  ''There are two types of bronchoscopes - a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and a rigid bronchoscope. Since the 1960s, the fiberoptic bronchoscope has progressively supplanted the rigid bronchoscope because of overall ease of use.  In some patients, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be performed without anesthesia, but in most cases, conscious sedation ""twilight ''sleep''"") is utilized. However, rigid bronchoscopy requires general anesthesia and the services of an anesthesiologist.  During the bronchoscopy, the examiner can see the tissues of the airways either directly by looking through the instrument or by viewing on a TV monitor.''Depending on the indication the examiner will choose between the flexible fiber optic bronchoscope and the rigid bronchoscope. For example, if a patient were ''coughing'' up large amounts of blood, a rigid bronchoscope is used since it has a large suction channel and allows for the use of instruments that can better control bleeding.  The  vast majority of bronchoscopies are performed using the flexible fiberoptic scope because of the improved patient comfort and reduced use of anesthesia.' "
What are the indications for bronchoscopy?,"'Bronchoscopy can be used for diagnosis or treatment. (The lists below are not meant to be all-inclusive, but are intended to provide a greater awareness and knowledge regarding the indications for bronchoscopy.)''Bronchoscopy is used to make a ''diagnosis'' most commonly for these conditions:''Bronchoscopy is used for ''treatment'':'  persistent or unexplained cough; blood in the sputum (coughed up mucus material from the lungs); abnormal chest x-ray such as a mass, nodule, or inflammation in the lung; or evaluation of a possible lung infection. to remove foreign bodies in the airway; to place a stent (a tiny tube) to open a collapsed airway due to pressure by a mass or tumor; or to remove a mass or growth that is blocking the airway."
What are the potential complications of bronchoscopy?,"'Complications of bronchoscopy are relatively rare and most often minor.  It is important to realize that all procedures may involve risk or complications from both known and unforeseen causes, because individual patients vary in their anatomy and response to medications. Therefore, there is no guarantee that a procedure can be free of complications.  The following is a list of potential complications:''(This list is not meant to be inclusive of all possible complications, but to provide information for your greater awareness concerning bronchoscopy.)' Nose bleeding (epistaxis) Vocal cord injury Irregular heart beats Lack of oxygen to the body's tissues Heart injury due to medications or lack of oxygen Bleeding from the site of biopsy Punctured lung (pneumothorax) Damage to teeth (from rigid bronchoscopy) Complications from pre-medications or general anesthesia"
How does a patient prepare for bronchoscopy?,"'Usually, patients undergoing bronchoscopy should take nothing by mouth after midnight prior to the procedure.  Routine medications should be taken with sips of water except for those ''drugs'' that can enhance the risk of bleeding.  These medications are ''aspirin'' products, blood thinners such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''™), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory products such as ''ibuprofen''. (These drugs must be discontinued at varying numbers of days before the procedure, depending on the medication. Patients must consult their doctors for the appropriate schedule in their particular situation.)  The doctor will also want to know of any drug ''allergies'' or major drug reactions that the patient may have experienced.' "
What should a patient expect during bronchoscopy?,"'As the patient arrives in the bronchoscopy suite (or if the patient is already in the hospital), an intravenous catheter (IV) will be started for administration of medication and fluid. The patient is then connected to a monitor for continuous monitoring of the heart rate, ''blood pressure'', and oxygen level in the blood. If needed, supplemental oxygen will be supplied either through a 1/4-inch tube inserted into the nostrils (cannula) or a facemask. Medication is then given through the IV to make the patient feel relaxed and sleepy for the flexible fiber optic bronchoscopy. If rigid bronchoscopy is to be performed, an anesthesiologist will be present to induce and monitor the general anesthesia.''Patients will be lying on their back with oxygen supplemented through the mouth or the nose. Prior to the insertion of the flexible bronchoscope, a local anesthesia with topical ''lidocaine'' is given in the nose and to the back of the throat. The flexible bronchoscope can be introduced either through the mouth or the nose. Some patients may require a special tube called an endotracheal tube to be inserted through the mouth, passing the vocal cord, and into the trachea to protect and secure the airway. Once the bronchoscope is in the airway, an additional topical anesthetic will be sprayed into the airway for local anesthesia to minimize discomfort and coughing spells. The rigid bronchoscope is inserted by mouth only. This is usually done after the patient is under general anesthesia.''Flexible bronchoscopy rarely causes any discomfort or ''pain''. Patients may feel the urge to ''cough'' because of the sensation of a foreign object in the ""windpipe."" Again, this feeling can be minimized by pre-procedural medication given for relaxation and local anesthesia with lidocaine. The procedure usually takes between 15 to 60 minutes. If a specific area needs to be more thoroughly evaluated or an abnormality is detected during the procedure, samples can be collected by several methods listed below:'   Washing - Squirts of salt water (saline) are injected through the bronchoscope into the area of interest and the fluid is then suctioned back. This process is repeated several times to obtain adequate samples, which are then submitted to the laboratory for analysis. Brushing - A soft brush is inserted through the bronchoscope to the area of interest. Cells around the airway are collected by brushing up and down the airway. The samples are also sent to the laboratory for analysis. Needle aspiration - A small needle is inserted into the airway and through the wall of the airway to obtain samples outside of the airway for analysis under a microscope. Forceps biopsy - Forceps may be used to biopsy either a visible lesion in the airway or a lung lesion. Abnormal tissue that is visible in the airway is usually easily biopsied. However, a mass that is in the lung tissue is deep within the lung and usually requires a biopsy using special x-ray guidance (fluoroscopy). Specimens obtained are sent to a pathologist for inspection under a microscope."
What can a patient expect after a bronchoscopy?,"'Patients are taken to an observation area for monitoring for one to two hours until any medication given adequately wears off and patients are able to swallow safely.  A family member or a friend must take the patient home after the outpatient procedure.  Patients are not allowed to drive or operate heavy machinery for the rest of the day because their reflexes and judgment may be impaired.  Some patients may cough up dark-brown blood for the next one to two days after the procedure.  This is expected and should not be alarming.  However, if there is persistent bright red blood in the sputum, the doctor must be consulted immediately.  A follow-up visit with the doctor is scheduled to review the laboratory results, which are typically available within one week.' "
What's new in bronchoscopy?,"'The bronchoscope is now being used with lasers to help remove and destroy tumor in the lungs.  Sometimes, probes can be passed through the scope to freeze bleeding sites or to shrink tumors.  Some newer technologies are on the horizon and may play a future role in the management of ''asthma'' and ''emphysema''.   There is data to suggest that warming the linings of the airways can reduce ''asthma'' attacks.   Studies are also now underway investigating one-way valves placed in the upper lobe airways in patients with ''emphysema''.   The hope is that this investigational therapy will simulate the benefits seen in emphysema patients that receive lung volume reduction surgery.' "
Introduction,"' Are you frustrated with sagging skin in your forehead region? Then the forehead lift and eyebrow lift, also  called ""the brow lift,"" may be just what you\'re seeking. This popular procedure is used to help reverse the ''aging''  process (think deep ''wrinkles'"" and creases across your forehead caused by years of facial expressions and environmental effects).  But don't be fooled. Younger people are also candidates if they have ""'inherited'' traits, such as lowbrow or other problems.' "
What Is a Brow Lift?,"' A forehead lift can be performed using one of three common procedures: an endobrow lift performed through an endoscope, an open brow lift, or a temporal lift. The procedure cosmetically corrects sagging in the forehead skin, upper eyelids, and eyebrows.'""Here's how:""' Your surgeon will maneuver tissues and remove segments of muscles and skin that are responsible for ''wrinkles'' or deep frown. Sometimes, this procedure is performed in conjunction with a \tface-lift or reshaping of the nose.'' Think about it. You want your facial features to have the same contoured appearance. If you only have the work  done on your forehead, other areas will appear more aged. If you are interested in learning about other procedures,  you can discuss the options with your surgeon.'' There are two methods to lift your forehead and eyebrow areas:'"" Here's how the endoscopic lift differs: Instead of making one continuous incision, your   surgeon will make a few shorter incisions in the scalp. He or she will insert a scope (small camera on the end of   a thin tube) into one of the incisions in order to view the tissues and muscles from a screen. At the same time,   he or she will use another device inserted in another incision to make the necessary alterations."""" In this procedure, small anchors are used to secure the offending tissue once it's altered appropriately.   Those anchors are tiny, but mighty. They'll keep your tissue under control for years. Because the incisions are   smaller, this procedure is less invasive. You will experience minimal scarring and shortened recovery time."" the classic lift endoscopic lift."
Does My Health Insurance Cover This Procedure?,"""  A forehead lift is a cosmetic procedure and is not covered under health insurance plans unless you have severe visual field loss. It's important that you receive price quotes in writing from your surgeon's office and that you understand charges for any follow-up care."" "
What can I expect during a brow lift consultation?,"""You've selected the surgeon, now it's time for the consultation about your \tbrow lift.""'You should prepare by having your medical history handy (for instance, have you previously undergone facial   surgeries to correct ''aging'' or wrinkling?), current medical conditions and any medications. This will all affect   how your surgeon analyzes your case and determines how to approach your surgery. Also, you should know exactly   what you want to correct about the current appearance of your forehead.'' Your surgeon will evaluate your   entire forehead region, including your upper eyelids, paying attention to the muscles. The surgeon may have   you make a variety of facial expressions so he or she can evaluate exactly how to help you.' "
How do I prepare for brow lift surgery?,"'There might be some lifestyle adjustments you have to make before you can undergo a brow lift. For instance, do you smoke? Then you may have to quit, or at least curtail your habit for a few days. But this is up to your surgeon, and he or she will provide you with specific pre-operative instructions.''You may also have to avoid ''alcohol'' and certain medications. If you regularly take an ''aspirin'' or other anti-inflammatory drug, your surgeon will ask you to stop taking these for a certain period of time before the surgery. These ''drugs'' can cause increased bleeding and should be avoided.'' Also, be advised: if your hair is long and will get in   the way of the procedure, you may have to trim it. If your hair is shorter, you may seek to grow it out to cover   any ''scars''. You will be able to discuss all this with your surgeon and how you should prepare.' "
What will I need at home after brow lift surgery,"""You should make sure your house is stocked with plenty   of gauze and clean towels once you've arrived home after your brow lift. Also make sure to have the following on hand:"" Plenty of ice Container to use for ice or cold water Plastic freezer bags to hold the ice OR you can also 
  keep bags of frozen corn or peas on hand Pillows (you'll have to keep your head elevated for a 
  period of time) Ointment for the incision area (which your surgeon can recommend or prescribe, if necessary)"
What can I expect the day of surgery?,"""Typically, you can undergo a brow lift at your surgeon's office, in a hospital, or outpatient surgery facility. Your surgery should be completed within two hours and you will not normally need to stay overnight. However, you will need to bring someone along who can drive you home and, if you live alone, stay with you the first night or two.""'Your surgeon will use local anesthesia. But, if it makes you more comfortable, you can request an   anesthesia that will put you to ''sleep'' during the operation (general anesthesia). Once the operation has   ended, your surgeon will close the incision areas with ''stitches'' or staples. Then he or she will cleanse   the area to remove blood and cover the ''wound'' area with a soft, sterilized bandage that will surround your face.'""It's very important to follow the instructions on how to care for the bandage and how frequently you should change it."" "
What should I expect after brow lift surgery?,"'Your recovery is going to vary depending upon which procedure you had: a classic or endoscopic \tbrow lift.'' In either case, you will have stitches or staples in the incisions which will need to be removed in about a week.

What should you know about spider bites?,"'Most spiders in the US are harmless. However, black widow and ''brown recluse spider'' bites are dangerous, and sometimes life-threatening. Black widow and brown recluse spider bites need immediate medical treatment.''Spider bites are actually rare occurrences, and most presumed people that have been bitten by spiders are likely due to another condition that mimics the symptoms or signs of a ''spider bite''. Bites from most (non-poisonous) spiders cause local redness, irritation, and ''pain'' that usually can be treated at home.''Black widow spider bite'' symptoms are immediate ''pain'', burning, redness, and swelling. Other signs and symptoms of a ''black widow spider bite'' are a feeling of a pinprick, and sometimes double fang marks on the person where the spider bit. Often, a person does not know that a ''black widow spider'' has bitten them.''Symptoms of a ''brown recluse spider bite'' are a mild sting followed by severe pain and local redness that usually develops within eight hours or more after the bite. Some brown recluse spider bites may include a purple or blue area around the bite, which is surrounded by a whitish ring and a large outer ring in a bull’s eye pattern. A fluid ''blister'' then forms at the spider bite site and then sloughs off revealing a deep ulcer that may turn black. Other signs and symptoms of a black widow or ''brown recluse spider bite'' may include abdominal or ''joint pain'', ''fever'', ''nausea'', and ''headache''.''If you think that, you or someone you know has been bitten by a black widow or brown recluse spider, call 911 or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department for treatment.' "
What are the first signs and symptoms of spider bites that aren't not poisonous?,"   Bites from most (non-poisonous) spiders cause local redness, irritation, and pain that usually can be treated at home using an over-the-counter pain reliever along with application of cooling packs or a wet cloth to relieve swelling. These local reactions usually resolve without treatment over a period of 7-10 days. Rarely, an individual can have an allergic reaction to a spider bite, even to a bite from a non-poisonous spider, but allergic reactions are more likely to be due to contact with a spider than from a spider bite."
What are the signs and symptoms of a black widow spider bites (pictures)?,"   A black widow spider bite is said to feel like a pinprick, although victims may not realize that they have been bitten. Sometimes double fang marks may be seen at the location of the bite. The most common localized symptoms of a black widow spider bite includeimmediate pain,burning,swelling, andredness around the bite. immediate pain, burning, swelling, and redness around the bite."
What are the signs and symptoms of a brown recluse spider bite (pictures)?,"'The bite of a brown recluse spider leads to a mild stinging, followed by local redness and severe pain that usually develops within eight hours but may occur later. Some reports of brown recluse bites describe a blue or purple area around the bite, surrounded by a whitish ring and large red outer ring in a ""bull\'s eye"" pattern. A fluid-filled ''blister forms'' at the site and then sloughs off to reveal a deep ulcer that may turn black.'  "
Can black widow or brown recluse spider bite symptoms be the same?,"'Generalized symptoms of bites from black widow and brown recluse spiders may include:''Rarely, black widow spider bites are fatal; however, a few individuals have died from brown recluse spider bites, which are more common in children than in adults.''If a spider was not observed inflicting the bite, it is difficult if not impossible to determine whether a spider bite occurred, since many conditions of the skin may produce the same symptoms as a spider bite. Streptococcal and Staphylococcal infections, early lesions of ''herpes'' simplex or zoster, ''burns'', stings or bites from other arthropods or insects (including fleas, ''bedbugs'', mosquitos, biting flies, ants, and ''ticks''), thorn injury, and early ''Lyme disease'' all may be characterized by skin findings similar to those from a spider bite.''Spiders rarely bite people, and only if threatened. People often thing they have spider bites when the irritation is from another cause.' Fever Nausea Vomiting Headache Abdominal pain Joint pain or stiffness Feelings of malaise Rash Muscle tension or cramping"
Are spider bites dangerous?,"'Most spiders do not have mouthparts strong enough to penetrate human skin, and the majority of spiders found in the U.S. and are actually harmless. There are two notable exceptions, the black widow spider and the brown recluse spider, which are both dangerous to humans. Spider bites are fortunately uncommon. In many cases, presumed spider bites are actually due to another skin condition or an ''insect sting''.''The black widow and brown recluse spiders are more common in the southern states of the U.S. They prefer warm, dry climates and undisturbed areas such as basements, closets, woodpiles, attics, or under sinks. The black widow spider is a small, black, shiny spider with a red hourglass marking on its belly. The brown recluse spider is sometimes termed a ""violin spider."" It is about an inch long and has a marking resembling a violin on the upper part of its back. Bites from both the black widow and brown recluse spiders are dangerous to humans and require prompt emergency medical care.'  "
What should you do if a spider bites you?," Wash the site of the spider bite well with soap and water. Apply a cool compress or ice pack over the spider bite location. Over-the-counter pain relievers may be used to relieve symptoms. (Remember, not to give aspirin to children; use acetaminophen or ibuprofen instead). Call the doctor or seek emergency treatment if the victim is a young child, if you think the bite may have been from a black widow or brown recluse spider, if any signs of an allergic reaction occur, if the bite area becomes infected, or if the victim develops a rash or severe illness. If possible, retrieve the spider and bring it with you to the health care practitioner so that it can be definitively identified. A tetanus booster shot may be necessary, depending upon the date of the patient's last immunization."
What should you do if a black widow or brown recluse spider bites you?,"   Wash the bite area with soap and water. Elevate the area to prevent spread of the venom. Tie a snug bandage above the area (if on an arm or leg) to further reduce spread of the venom, but do not make the bandage too tight that it impairs the blood circulation. Always seek immediate emergency medical care. An anti-venom medication is sometimes given for black widow spider bites. Doctors' use different types of medications to treat spider bites, including pain relievers, muscle relaxants, and/or corticosteroids. Sometimes hospitalization is required after black widow or brown recluse spider bites. If possible, retrieve the spider and bring it with you to the health care practitioner so that it can be definitively identified. A tetanus booster shot may be necessary, depending upon the date of the patient's last immunization. Calling the Poison Control Center (24-hour hotline at 1-800-222-1222 in the U.S.) allows you to reach toxicology experts who can work with a health care provider in establishing the proper diagnosis and management of a spider bite."
What is brucellosis?,"'Brucellosis is in infectious disease caused by bacteria in the genus ''Brucella''. ''Brucella'' are aerobic, gram-negative coccobacilli. Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection (meaning the disease occurs mainly in animals but is occasionally transferred to humans). Brucellosis has been known by various names such as Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, undulant ''fever'"", Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and gastric remittent fever. Brucellosis is found in North-American wild animals (elk, bison) and is occasionally found in domesticated animals (cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats). The major species of the genus ""'Brucella'' that cause the disease are ''B. melitensis'', ''B. suis'', ''B. abortus'', and ''B. canis''; these are associated with sheep, pigs, cattle, and ''dogs'' respectively. The most pathogenic (likely to cause disease) species are ''B. melitensis'' and ''B. suis''.' "
What is the history of brucellosis?,"'Brucellosis was thought to be first described by Hippocrates and the Romans more than 2,000 years ago. In 1887, Dr. David Bruce isolated the organisms from patients who were living on the island of Malta (hence the name Malta fever). The disease was eventually named after Dr. Bruce (brucellosis). The disease has been found worldwide, and high-risk areas include the Mediterranean countries, South and Central America, Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. Fortunately, there are only about 100-200 people infected per year in the United States. California and Texas have the highest infection rates.''Strains of highly pathogenic ''Brucella'' have been considered to be used as a biological weapon because the organisms can be aerosolized and then easily inhaled.' "
What are causes of brucellosis?,"'The cause of brucellosis is bacterial. ''Brucella'' bacteria can enter the ''human body'' through mucous membranes, breaks in the skin, the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and even the ''conjunctiva'"". Unfortunately, these organisms can survive reasonably well within the body's cells, including different types of cells. These bacteria can be transported within the human cells via the lymphatic system or in the bloodstream to other organs. Any organ system can be involved, and both localized and systemic (body-wide) infections may occur. The bacteria can also replicate inside host cells and then be released when the cell dies. These bacteria go on to spread the infection to other human cells."" "
What are risk factors for brucellosis?,"'Risk factors for brucellosis include consuming unpasteurized milk or cheese, eating poorly cooked or raw meats, or associating with wild animals that may harbor the organisms (hunters, for example). Veterinarians, sheepherders, hunters, and others associated with animal processing and farming are at increased risk.' "
Is brucellosis contagious? How long is brucellosis contagious?,"'According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), brucellosis is only weakly ''contagious'' because person-to-person spread of brucellosis is rare. Unfortunately, people can easily get the disease from eating or drinking unpasteurized or raw dairy products and can even become infected by inhaling aerosolized bacteria or become infected through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes.''Brucellosis is contagious as long as living bacteria are present in domestic and wild animals and/or their secretions, including milk products. In addition, the bacteria have been documented to survive in the environment for up to two years under favorable conditions (darkness, cold temperatures, and relatively high CO2 concentrations) and still cause disease.' "
What is the incubation period for brucellosis?,"'The incubation period (time between infection and the development of the disease) for brucellosis is considered to be highly variable, with a range of five days to five months, with a few patients reporting incubation periods as long as a year; the average incubation period is about two to four weeks.' "
How is brucellosis transmitted to humans?,"'The most common way individuals become infected with brucellosis is by eating or drinking unpasteurized or raw dairy products. If animals like sheep, goats, cows, or camels are infected with ''Brucella'', the milk they produce is contaminated with the bacteria. Another way that brucellosis spreads to humans is by inhalation of the bacteria. Although this risk is generally associated with people who work in laboratories studying ''Brucella'' organisms, it is possible that people working in meat-processing areas could be exposed to the bacteria by inhalation of droplets from contaminated meat (cattle, sheep). The bacteria can also infect humans through breaks in the skin or through the mucous membranes. Commonly infected animals that are hunted that may contain ''Brucella'' are caribou, moose, wild hogs (feral hogs), elk, and bison. Person-to-person transmission of brucellosis is rare but may occur during sex, blood transfusions, transplacental transfer, or even in contact with menstrual blood.' "
What are symptoms and signs of brucellosis?,"'Brucellosis can cause a wide range of symptoms. Some symptoms appear early while others may develop over a long time period. Initial or early symptoms may include''Over time, the fevers may become recurrent with ''night sweats'', ''joint pain'' may worsen, and organ swelling may occur in the heart, testicles, ''liver'', and/or spleen, resulting in decreased functioning of these organs. Some people will develop a skin ''rash'' and/or micro-abscesses (subcutaneous granulomas) in the skin. In addition, patients may have ''chronic fatigue'', ''depression'', and neurologic symptoms. It takes about two to four weeks (latent period) after initial exposure for most people to start showing symptoms.'   fever, fatigue, sweating, pain in the muscles, joints, and/or abdomen, pain in the back, loss of appetite, weight loss, cough, headache, and/or swollen lymph nodes."
What specialists treat brucellosis?,"""Although the patient's primary-care provider (including internists and family practitioners) can treat brucellosis, it is not unusual to consult infectious-disease specialists, neurologists, rheumatologists, and specialists in ""'travel medicine'' about treatment and/or prevention of this disease. In severe infections, other specialists may be consulted (for example, urologists, obstetrician-gynecologists [for infected ''pregnant'' patients]) depending on the organ system most altered.' "
How do physicians diagnose brucellosis?,"""Brucellosis is diagnosed preliminarily by the patient's history of exposure to likely sources of ""'Brucella'"" bacteria and the patient's clinical symptoms. Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by culturing ""'Brucella'"" bacteria from the patient. In addition, there are serological tests for the organisms done on the patient's blood specimens. These tests look for IgM or IgG antibodies directed against the bacteria. However, the CDC recommends that these tests be confirmed by a ""'Brucella''-specific agglutination test, a specific test that is usually run by a specialty laboratory. These tests help differentiate brucellosis from ''leptospirosis'', ''malaria'', ''tularemia'', and other diseases that may produce similar symptoms.' "
What are brucellosis treatments?,"""According to the CDC, doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox) and rifampin (Rifadin) are the recommended antibiotics, taken in combination, for a minimum of six to eight weeks to treat infected patients. This long treatment time is due to the organism's ability to survive inside human cells; consequently, the CDC recommends that a firm diagnosis be established before long-term antibiotic treatment is begun. Individuals who are immunosuppressed and pregnant patients, in most cases, should be treated in consultation with an infectious-disease specialist."" "
Are there home remedies for brucellosis?,"'There are many home remedies listed on the Internet for brucellosis. A few examples include colloidal silver, ''garlic'', a spice termed ''Origanum syriacum'', mixtures of essential oils, and many others. Scientific evidence is lacking about the effectiveness of these remedies. Patients should discuss with their doctors any remedies before using them.' "
What is the prognosis of brucellosis?,"'In general, the prognosis for patients infected with ''Brucella'"" is very good. If individuals are treated appropriately within the first few months of symptom onset, they are curable with antibiotics and usually don't develop chronic disease. The symptoms usually improve and are completely gone within about two to six months. However, the prognosis is poor in people who develop organ changes or complications such as heart damage, neurological, or genitourinary problems caused by chronic ""'Brucella'' infection. The mortality (death) rate is low for brucellosis (about 0.4%-2%).' "
Is it possible to prevent brucellosis? Is there a brucellosis vaccine?,"'It is possible to prevent or reduce the chances of developing brucellosis. Simple methods such as avoiding known infected animals, never drinking unpasteurized milk, and, if associating with potentially infected animals, wearing gloves and/or a mask reduces the chances of infection.''Because brucellosis is mainly a disease involving livestock, vaccines have been developed that are effective for cattle, sheep, and goats. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine available for use in humans.' "
Facts you should know about bumps and bruises, A bruise is medically referred to as a contusion. Bruises occur when tiny blood vessels are damaged or broken. The injury required to produce a bruise varies with age and certain medications. Individual bruises change in appearance over time. Spontaneous bruising can indicate a serious bleeding tendency.
What is a bruise?,"'You fall off your bike, bang your shin on the coffee table (that you swore you would move months ago), or run into a wall and wake up with a bruise. What is a bruise, and what can you do about it? A bruise is caused when tiny blood vessels are damaged or broken as the result of ''trauma'"" to the skin (be it bumping against something or hitting yourself with a hammer). The raised area of a bump or bruise results from blood leaking from these injured blood vessels into the tissues as well as from the body's response to the injury. A bruise is medically referred to as a contusion. A purplish, flat bruise that occurs when blood leaks out into the top layers of skin is referred to as an ecchymosis."" "
Why do bruises occur more frequently in some people than in others?,"'The injury required to produce a bruise varies with age. Bruising occurs more easily in the elderly because their capillaries are more fragile than those of young people. While it may take quite a bit of force to cause a bruise in a young child, even minor ''bumps'' and ''scrapes'' may cause extensive bruising in an elderly person. Blood vessels become more fragile as we age, and bruising may even occur without prior injury in the elderly.''The amount of bruising may also be affected by medications which interfere with blood clotting (and thus cause more bleeding into the skin or tissues). These ''drugs'' include many ''arthritis'' medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (for example, ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil'', ''Nuprin''] and ''naproxen'' [''Aleve'']) and ''over-the-counter'' medications, such as ''aspirin''. ''Warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') is often prescribed by doctors specifically to prevent clotting in patients who have had ''blood clots'' in their legs or ''heart''. Warfarin can cause severe bruising, especially if the level of the medication becomes too high. Cortisone medications, such as ''prednisone'', promote bruising by increasing the fragility of the tiny blood vessels in the skin.''Patients with ''inherited'' clotting problems (such as in ''hemophilia'') or acquired clotting problems (such as in patients with ''liver'' diseases like ''cirrhosis'') can develop extensive bruising, unexplained bruising, or even life-threatening bleeding. Sometimes spontaneous bruising is a sign of a bone marrow problem.'  "
"What are symptoms and signs of a bruise, and why does it change color?","'Bruises can be associated with tenderness of the involved discolored area. Bruises change in appearance over time, and it may be possible to tell by looking at a bruise how old it is. When it first appears, a bruise will be reddish looking, reflecting the color of the blood in the skin. By 1-2 days, the reddish iron from the blood undergoes a change and the bruise will appear blue or purple. By day 6, the color changes to green and by day 8-9, the bruise will appear yellowish-brown. In general, the bruised area will be repaired by the body in two to three weeks after which the skin will return to normal.' "
What if the bruise doesn't get better or the area stays swollen?,"'On occasion, instead of going away, the area of a bruise will become firm and may actually start increasing in size. It may also continue to be painful. There are two major causes for this. First, if a large collection of blood is formed under the skin or in the muscle, instead of trying to clean up the area, the body may wall the blood off causing what is called a ''hematoma''. A hematoma is nothing more than a small pool of blood that is walled off. This may need to be drained by your doctor.''A second and much less common problem occurs when the body deposits calcium, the material that makes up the majority of bone, in the area of injury. The area becomes tender and firm. This process is called heterotopic ossification or ''myositis'' ossificans.''This condition is diagnosed by X-ray and requires a trip to your doctor.'  "
"What are some less common causes of bruising, and what do they indicate?","'The terminology describing different types of bruising often refers to not only their appearance but also to their cause. ''Petechiae'' are 1- to 3-millimeter accumulations of blood beneath the skin. These can appear like multiple tiny red dots on any part of the body (most commonly the legs). Most often these are multiple, and they can suggest that there is a serious health problem present. Examples of these are an infection of the valves of the heart (''endocarditis'') or abnormal function of the blood-clotting elements (platelets). Bruising around the navel (''belly button'"") can be a result of bleeding within the abdomen. Bruising behind the ear (Battle's sign) can indicate that there is a skull ""'fracture''. Also, bruises that are raised, firm, multiple, and occur without any injury can be a sign of various types of ""autoimmune"" diseases (diseases in which the body attacks its own blood vessels). Each of these should be evaluated by a doctor.' "
What is the treatment for bruising?,"'There are a couple of things that you can do to prevent or minimize bruising after an injury. First, try a ''cold'' compress. Put ice in a ''plastic'' bag, wrap the bag in a towel (applying the ice directly to the skin can cause ''frostbite'""), and place it on the injured area. Commercial ice packs are also available, but a bag of frozen peas makes an excellent substitute. It molds to the shape of the injured area and can then be re-frozen and used again (but don't eat them!). The cold reduces the blood flow to the area and therefore limits bleeding into the skin and reduces the size of the bruise. The cold also decreases the inflammation in the area of the injury and limits swelling in this way as well. If possible, elevate the area above the level of the heart. The lower an extremity is below the heart, the more blood will flow to the area and increase the bleeding and swelling.""'Avoid taking the medications listed above that can contribute to bruising. If you have any questions about whether or not your medication can contribute to bruising, ask your doctor or pharmacist. '' Do not stop any prescription medications without first contacting your doctor''.''Finally, pressure applied to the area (by hand, not with tourniquets) can reduce bleeding.''People who take medicines that reduce clotting (""blood thinners"") or have clotting abnormalities should seek the advice of a physician immediately, as should the elderly or those who have experienced significantly severe trauma.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for bruising?,'The outlook for bruising depends on whether or not there are underlying associated medical illnesses or conditions. Bruising can otherwise be prevented by avoiding trauma to the body.' 
What is teeth grinding?,'Teeth grinding'' is a condition whereby one excessively grinds or clenches their ''teeth''. Typically grinding and clenching occurs mostly when sleeping but some individuals may grind and clench during the day also. ''Teeth'' grinding is also referred to as ''bruxism''.' 
What are the dangers of teeth grinding?,"'Teeth grinding can create numerous problems such as''Children that grind due to a ''breathing'' ''airway'' problem can have developmental issues.' local muscular pain, headaches, loss of tooth structure, gum recession, loose teeth, shortening of teeth, tooth sensitivity, cracked and broken teeth, damage to the bone structure of the jaw joint with temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ syndrome), and even facial changes."
What causes teeth grinding?,"'The exact cause of teeth grinding is not totally understood and there are numerous different theories. However, there is a link to breathing airway issues, such as' sleep apnea, jaw posture positions, tooth position, dental work that has changed jaw position or tooth positions, abnormal bite, trauma, repetitive strain, lifestyle activities, as well as emotional and developmental issues."
Who is at risk for teeth grinding?,'Anyone that has teeth can potentially grind their teeth. Anyone from small toddlers to the elderly and everyone in between can grind their teeth.'  
What are symptoms and signs of teeth grinding?,"'Symptoms of teeth grinding include' headaches, muscle pain, jaw tenderness, shortened teeth, gum recession, notches or indentations on the gum line of teeth, tooth sensitivity, cracked and broken teeth, and temporomandibular joint syndrome."
What is the treatment for teeth grinding?,"'A ''sleep'' study is recommended to rule out an airway issue because grinding occurs mostly at night while sleeping.' If a poor airway is a contributing factor then treatment can be offered for the airway first and sometimes the teeth grinding will cease. Every situation of teeth grinding is managed uniquely, but often a mouth guard fitted by a dentist is helpful. The mouth guard is worn when sleeping to protect the teeth from grinding. Dietary changes, postural modifications, emotional therapy, medications, injections, tooth adjustments and dental work, orthodontics, surgery, are various treatments used."
What is the prognosis for teeth grinding?," The prognosis for teeth grinding can very good, especially if the underlying cause can be determined. If it cannot, then at least wearing a properly fitting mouth guard can protect the teeth from further damage and often lessen the effects on the bone, muscle, and tissues. Babies and toddlers grinding their teeth should always have an airway evaluation."
About BSE,"'BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is a progressive neurological disorder of cattle that results from infection by an unusual transmissible agent called a prion. The nature of the transmissible agent is not well understood. Currently, the most accepted theory is that the agent is a modified form of a normal protein known as prion protein. For reasons that are not yet understood, the normal prion protein changes into a pathogenic (harmful) form that then damages the central nervous system of cattle.'""Research indicates that the first probable infections of BSE in cows occurred during the 1970's with two cases of BSE being identified in 1986. BSE possibly originated as a result of feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that contained BSE-infected products from a spontaneously occurring case of BSE or scrapie-infected sheep products. Scrapie is a prion disease of sheep. There is strong evidence and general agreement that the outbreak was then amplified and spread throughout the United Kingdom cattle industry by feeding rendered, prion-infected, bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.""'The BSE epizootic in the United Kingdom peaked in January 1993 at almost 1,000 new cases per week. Over the next 17 years, the annual numbers of BSE cases has dropped sharply; 14,562 cases in 1995, 1,443 in 2000, 225 in 2005 and 11 cases in 2010. Cumulatively, through the end of 2010, more than 184,500 cases of BSE had been confirmed in the United Kingdom alone in more than 35,000 herds.''There exists strong epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for a causal association between a new human prion disease called variant ''Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'' (vCJD) that was first reported from the United Kingdom in 1996 and the BSE outbreak in cattle. The interval between the most likely period for the initial extended exposure of the population to potentially BSE-contaminated food (1984-1986) and the onset of initial variant CJD cases (1994-1996) is consistent with known incubation periods for the human forms of prion disease.''Through February 2015, BSE surveillance has identified 24 cases in North America: 4 BSE cases in the United States and 20 in Canada. Of the 4 cases identified in the United States, one was born in Canada; of the 20 cases identified in Canada, one was imported from the United Kingdom (see figure above).' "
BSE Cases Identified in the United States,"'There have been 4 cases of BSE identified in the United States. The following information provides descriptions of these 4 cases:' On December 23, 2003, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a presumptive diagnosis of the first known case of BSE in the United States. It was in an adult Holstein cow from Washington State. This diagnosis was confirmed by an international reference laboratory in Weybridge, England, on December 25. Trace-back based on an ear-tag identification number and subsequent genetic testing confirmed that the BSE-infected cow was imported into the United States from Canada in August 2001. Because the animal was non-ambulatory (a ""downer cow"") at slaughter, brain tissue samples were taken by USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as part of its targeted surveillance for BSE. However the animal's condition was attributed to complications from calving. After the animal was examined by a USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) veterinary medical officer both before and after slaughter, the carcass was released for use as food for human consumption. During slaughter, the tissues considered to be at high risk for the transmission of the BSE agent were removed. On December 24, 2003, FSIS recalled beef from cattle slaughtered in the same plant on the same day as the BSE positive cow. On June 24, 2005, the USDA announced receipt of final results from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, England, confirming BSE in a cow that had conflicting test results in 2004. This cow was from Texas, died at approximately 12 years of age, and represented the first endemic case of BSE in the United States. On March 15, 2006, the USDA announced the confirmation of BSE in a cow in Alabama. The case was identified in a non-ambulatory (downer) cow on a farm in Alabama. The animal was euthanized by a local veterinarian and buried on the farm. The age of the cow was estimated by examination of the dentition as 10-years-old. It had no ear tags or distinctive marks; the herd of origin could not be identified despite an intense investigation. In August 2008, several ARS investigators reported that a rare, genetic abnormality that may persist within the cattle population ""is considered to have caused"" BSE in this atypical (H-type) BSE animal from Alabama. On April 24, 2012, the USDA confirmed a BSE case in a dairy cow in California. This cow was tested as part of the USDA targeted BSE surveillance at rendering facilities in the United States. The cow was 10 years and 7 months old and was classified as having the L-type BSE strain."
BSE Cases Identified in Canadian-born Cattle,"'As of February 18, 2015, 20 BSE cases in Canadian-born cattle have been identified, 19 in Canada and 1 in the U.S. Of these 20 cases, 14 were known to have been born after the implementation of the 1997 Canadian feed ban ; 13 of these 14 were born after March 1, 1999. (See Figure above: BSE Cases in North America, by Year and Country of Death, 1993-02/2015). This latter date is particularly relevant to the U.S. because since a USDA rule went into effect on November 19, 2007, Canadian cattle born on or after March 1, 1999 have been legally imported into this country for any use. One of the 20 Canadian-born BSE cases was reported in an animal that was most likely born before or possibly very shortly after implementation of the 1997 feed ban. Based on the known or most likely year of birth, an average of 1.4 cases of BSE occurred among the group of animals born each year in Canada from 1991 through 2004. The highest reported number of cases by birth year in a single year, 3 BSE cases, occurred in 2000, 2001 and 2002. The most recently reported case extends the period of BSE transmission in Canada through at least the early half of 2009.' "
Strains of BSE,"'There is increasing evidence that there are different strains of BSE: the typical BSE strain responsible for the outbreak in the United Kingdom and two atypical strains (H and L strains).''All (3) of the U.S.-born BSE cases and two of the 20 Canadian-born BSE cases were 10 years of age or older and caused by atypical BSE strains. Of these 5 older North American cases, 3 were linked to an atypical BSE strain known as the H-type. The strain type for the other two older North American cases, a 13-year-old BSE-infected Canadian cow and a 10-year-old BSE-infected US cow, have been identified as the L-type.' Typical BSE strain -- The BSE strain responsible for most of the BSE cases in Canada is the same classic or typical strain linked to the outbreak in the United Kingdom. It is known to be preventable through elimination of BSE contaminated feed and has been causally linked to vCJD in humans. This typical strain has not yet been identified in any U.S.-born cattle. Atypical BSE strain -- In July 2007, the UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) suggested that atypical BSE may be a distinct strain of prion disease. Unlike typical BSE, cases of atypical BSE, according to SEAC, may have risen spontaneously (although transmission through feed or the environment cannot be ruled out). Recently reported French surveillance data support this theory that unlike typical BSE, atypical BSE appears to represent sporadic disease."
Feed Bans,"'As of October 26, 2009, a regulation issued by FDA in April 2009 came into effect establishing an enhanced BSE-related feed ban in the United States. This enhanced ban will further harmonize BSE feed control measures in the U.S. with those in Canada (see below). In addition, FDA continues to enforce its important 1997 mammalian-to-ruminant feed ban through its BSE inspection and BSE feed testing programs.''As of July 12, 2007, an enhanced BSE-related feed ban came into effect in Canada. CFIA established this ban to more effectively prevent and quickly eliminate BSE from Canada. The enhanced ban prohibits most proteins, including potentially BSE infectious tissues known as ""specified risk materials"" (SRM) from all animal feeds, pet foods, and fertilizers, not just from cattle feed as required by the ban instituted in 1997. The 1997 feed ban in Canada was similar to the feed ban instituted in the United States that same year. As recently reported by CFIA, removing SRM from the entire animal feed system addresses risks associated with the potential contamination of cattle feed during production, distribution, storage, and use. Applying the same measure to pet food and fertilizer materials addresses the possible exposure of cattle and other susceptible animals to these products. CFIA expects that with this new ban, BSE should be eliminated from the Canadian cattle herd by about the year 2017.''The Canadian-born cow confirmed to be infected with BSE in 2015 illustrates the difficulty in determining the effectiveness of previously instituted feed bans to prevent BSE transmissions. The initial feed bans established in both the United States and Canada were instituted in 1997. After an assessment by USDA and its Canadian counterparts, the Canadian feed ban was judged to be fully effectiveness as of March 1999. However, largely because of recognized limitations of this ban and the ban established in the United States, new, enhanced feed bans went into effect in Canada, July 12, 2007, and in the U.S., October 26, 2009. While USDA has confirmed no U.S.-born cattle as having a classic form of BSE, Canadian cattle born after March 1999 have been legally imported into the United States for any purpose since November 19, 2007.' "
BSE Prevalence,"'Based on World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) standards for BSE surveillance, the reported national prevalence rates of BSE in North American cattle, particularly in animals born in the United States, is very low, and therefore, difficult to measure accurately. In September 2007, the USDA published updated results of the two statistical models used by Harvard University investigators to estimate the prevalence of BSE in Canada. The results incorporated the 11 Canadian-born animals with BSE that had been reported at that time. A key advantage of these models is that they provide statistical confidence limits that measure some of the uncertainty associated with expected estimates. This model estimated that the true prevalence of BSE in Canada has been 90% likely to be between 18-fold and 48-fold higher than the previously published best estimate of the prevalence of BSE in the United States (3.0 to 8.0 cases per million in Canada compared to a best estimate of 0.167 cases per million in the United States). The previously published best estimate of Canada\'s BSE prevalence in 2006 using the BSurveE model was 23-fold higher than that of the United States and is the estimate of the BSE prevalence in Canada that continues to be used in the Harvard Risk Assessments\' ""worst case"" analyses when evaluating the risk of imported Canadian cattle causing BSE to spread among U.S. animals.'

Bug bites and stings introduction,"'Warm weather makes it easier to spend more time outdoors, but it also brings out the bugs. Ticks are usually harmless. But a ''tick bite'' can lead to ''Lyme disease'', which is caused by the bacterium ''Borrelia burgdorferi''. The bacteria are transmitted to people by the black-legged deer tick, which is about the size of a pinhead and usually lives on deer. Infected ticks can also cause other diseases, such as ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever''.''Another insect-borne illness, ''West Nile virus'', is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and usually produces mild symptoms in healthy people. But the illness can be serious for older people and those with compromised immune systems.''Most reactions to bees and other stinging insects are mild, but severe allergic reactions can be deadly. An ''allergic reaction'' can occur even if a person has been stung before with no complications.''Here are tips for preventing and treating bites and stings.'  "
What can I do to keep insects away?,"  Use structural barriers such as window screens and netting. Avoid wooded, brushy, and grassy areas when possible. Don't wear heavily scented soaps and perfumes. Use caution eating outside and drinking; don't leave drinks and garbage cans uncovered. Don't wear bright colors, which attract bees. Wear long sleeves and long pants when possible. Tuck pant legs into socks or shoes. Wear a hat for extra protection. Get rid of containers with standing water that give mosquitoes a breeding ground. Examples include water in flowerpots and outdoor pet dishes. Use insect repellent if nonchemical methods are ineffective and you spend time in tall grass and woody areas. Treat camping gear, clothes, and shoes with permethrin, which repels and kills ticks, mosquitoes, and other insects. Clothing that is pre-treated with permethrin is also commercially available."
What's the proper way to use insect repellent?,"""It's okay to use insect repellent and sunscreen at the same time. The general recommendation is to apply sunscreen first, followed by repellent. There are also some combination products that contain both insect repellent and sunscreen. FDA regulates sunscreen as an ""'over-the-counter'' (OTC) drug. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates insect repellent products.' Use insect repellent that contains active ingredients that have been registered with EPA. An EPA registration number on the product label means the product has been evaluated by EPA to ensure that it will not pose unreasonable harmful effects on people and the environment. Spray insect repellent on clothes or skin, but not on the face. Don't use insect repellent on babies. Repellent used on older children should contain no more than 10 percent DEET. Oil of eucalyptus products should not be used in children under 3 years. Don't use insect repellent that's meant for people on your pets. Use insect repellent according to the labeled instructions. Avoid applying it to children's hands, around the eyes, or to areas where there are cuts and irritated skin. Store insect repellent out of children's reach. Wash the repellent off with soap and water and contact a Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) if you (or your child) experience a reaction to insect repellent. After returning indoors, wash skin with soap and water to remove repellent."
What's the best way to remove a bee stinger?,"""It's best to scrape a stinger away in a side-to-side motion with a straight-edged object like a credit card. Don't use tweezers because it may push more venom into the skin. After removing a stinger, wash the area with soap and water. You can apply ice or another ""'cold'' compress to help reduce swelling.' "
What should I do if I find a tick on me or my child?,"'Wearing light-colored clothing makes it easier to spot ticks. Check for ticks after outdoor activities. If you find a tick, remove it with tweezers. Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible and pull it straight out. Then drop it in a ''plastic'' bag, seal it up, and throw it away. Early removal of a tick is important because a tick generally has to be on the skin for 36 hours to transmit ''Lyme disease''. People who want to get a tick tested for disease or other information could check with their local health departments to see if they offer tick testing. After removing a tick, you can cleanse the area of the tick bite with antiseptic, such as rubbing ''alcohol'' or soap and water.'  "
What can be done for itching and pain from bites and stings?,"'Oral OTC ''antihistamines'' can bring ''itch'' relief. Oral OTC ''drugs'', such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, can provide relief of ''pain'' from bites and stings.''In addition, there are many topical OTC drugs that are applied to the skin and can provide ''itch'' and pain relief. Some of these topical OTC drugs are labeled as ""external analgesics"" or ""topical analgesics."" They contain ingredients such as hydrocortisone, ''pramoxine'', and ''lidocaine''. There are also topical OTC drugs labeled as ""skin protectants"" that provide itch relief for ''insect bites'' and stings. These products contain ingredients such as colloidal oatmeal and ''sodium bicarbonate''.'""Keep kids' nails short. If they scratch the area and break the skin, it can lead to a bacterial infection that will require treatment with antibiotics.""  "
When is medical attention needed?,"'Most bites and stings are minor and can be treated at home. But you should seek medical attention if you experience the following symptoms:''Signs of allergic reaction'': Some people can experience anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. This is a medical emergency that warrants calling 9-1-1 immediately. Signs of an allergic reaction, which may occur within seconds to minutes, include ''sneezing'', ''wheezing'', ''hives'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', sudden ''anxiety'', ''dizziness'', difficulty ''breathing'', ''chest tightness'', and ''itching'' or swelling of the eyes, lips, or other areas of the face. If you or your child has ever had an allergic reaction to a sting or bite, you should be evaluated by an allergist. In some cases, you may be advised to wear a medical identification tag that states the ''allergy'', and to carry epinephrine, a medication used to treat serious or life-threatening allergic reactions. Sometimes ''allergy shots'' may also be recommended.''Symptoms of Lyme disease'': ''Lyme disease'', which is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick, can cause ''fever'', ''headaches'', ''fatigue'', and a skin ''rash'' that looks like a circular red patch, or ""bull\'s-eye."" Left untreated, infection can spread to the joints, ''heart'', and nervous system. It is rarely, if ever, fatal. Patients who are treated with antibiotics in the early stages of the infection usually recover rapidly and completely. Antibiotics commonly used for oral treatment include ''doxycycline'', ''amoxicillin'', or ''cefuroxime'' axetil (''Ceftin''). People with certain illnesses related to the heart or the nervous system require intravenous treatment with drugs such as ceftriaxone or ''penicillin''.''Symptoms of West Nile virus'': ''West Nile virus'', which is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, can produce ''flu-like symptoms'' including ''fever'', ''headache'', body aches, and skin ''rash''. While most infected individuals have mild disease and recover spontaneously, infection can be serious or even fatal. There is no specific treatment for ''West Nile virus''.''Symptoms of ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever'': Initial symptoms may include fever, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', severe ''headache'', ''muscle pain'', and ''lack of appetite''. The characteristic red, spotted rash of Rocky Mountain ''spotted fever'' is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after symptoms begin. As many as 10% to 15 % of patients may never develop a rash. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is treated with antibiotics.''Signs of infection'': It is normal for a bite or sting to result in redness of the affected area and minor swelling. But if a bite or sting becomes infected, a fever may develop or the redness or soreness may worsen. In cases of infection, an antibiotic is the typical treatment.' "

What is bulimia?,"'Bulimia, also called ''bulimia nervosa'', is one of a number of ''eating disorders''. This ''mental illness'' is characterized by episodes of bingeing and somehow purging the food and/or associated calories in the pursuit of ''weight loss''. About 1%-2% of adolescent girls in the United States develop bulimia. While bulimia and other eating disorders tend to occur most often in Caucasian females in this country, males and ethnic minorities are increasingly developing eating disorders. Bulimia is also often co-morbid (co-occurs with) ''body dysmorphic disorder'', which involves the sufferer having a false sense that something is defective with their appearance beyond weight.''Women with eating disorders tend to have higher rates of ''infertility'' than women without an eating disorder, in that eating disordered women have lower rates of ''pregnancy'' and ''childbirth'' . However, an 11.5 year follow-up study of 173 women with bulimia nervosa found that 75% became ''pregnant'', indicating that ''fertility'' problems are not more common in these women. Bulimia nervosa is a more common eating disorder and has a prevalence of 0.5-1% in women of reproductive age . Evidence suggests a variable course for women with past or current eating disorders who become pregnant. The eating disorder may continue unchanged during the pregnancy., but two prospective studies found that symptoms may improve in women with bulimia nervosa. Given the changes in body chemistry that such behaviors can cause, bulimia during pregnancy can pose significant health risks for the developing fetus.''This illness is a significant public-health problem both because of the physical and mental-health effects it can have. Bulimia often co-occurs with ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and substance-abuse disorders and results in a loss of productivity due to disability that is higher than that of disability caused by ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' combined.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for bulimia?,"'While there is no known specific cause for bulimia, family history and environmental stressors are thought to contribute to the development of the illness. Generally, while people who have relatives with bulimia are at a higher risk of developing the disorder, this may be as much the result of ''inherited'' perfectionism and rigidity as it is an inheritance of the disorder itself. Some life stressors, like family economic problems, can increase the chance of developing bulimia as an adult.''Adolescents are at greatest risk for developing bulimia, as statistics show that about three-quarters of people who develop the illness do so before they reach 22 years of age, most often at 15 to 16 years of age. Adolescents who have any eating problem by 12 years of age are at higher risk for developing bulimia, but children with eating problems as ''babies'' are not necessarily at higher risk for getting the illness.''High body mass index, low self-esteem, and being part of a family that is suffering from financial difficulties are risk factors for developing purging behaviors. Involvement in activities that highly reward thinness, like gymnastics, ''running'', wrestling, horse jockeying, or modeling, are other risk factors for developing bulimia.' "
What are symptoms and signs of bulimia?,"'Symptoms of bulimia include repeated episodes of bingeing and purging. Binges are defined as uncontrolled episodes of eating food amounts in a short period of time that are clearly more than most people would consume in a similar time period. People with bulimia have trouble controlling their eating during the binges. They also engage in some form of repeated undoing of the excessive food/calories they ingest that occurs during episodes of binge eating. Examples of purging behaviors include making oneself throw up, fasting, excessive ''exercise'', or abuse of laxatives, ''diet'' pills, diuretics, or other medications. Bulimic individuals tend to have their self-esteem excessively linked to their appearance in terms of body shape and weight.''Physical signs and symptoms that can be associated with bulimia include ''sore throat'', discolored, deteriorating ''teeth'', and ''abdominal pain''/cramping and ''bloating'' associated with repeated ''vomiting''. Individuals with bulimia may develop swollen salivary glands that give the sufferer bigger cheeks. They may also develop ''constipation'', ''dehydration'', ''dry skin'', and ''thinning hair''.' "
How do physicians diagnose bulimia?,"'Many providers of health care may help make the diagnosis of bulimia, including licensed mental-health therapists, pediatricians, other primary-care providers, specialists whom you see for a medical condition, emergency physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers. One of these professionals will likely conduct or refer the individual with bulimia for an extensive medical interview and physical examination as part of establishing the diagnosis. Bulimia may be associated with a number of other medical conditions, so health-care professionals may perform routine laboratory tests during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of symptoms.''As part of this examination, a health-care professional may ask the sufferer a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the presence of ''depression''. Thorough exploration for any history or presence of mental-health symptoms will be conducted so that bulimia can be distinguished from other types of eating disorders like ''anorexia nervosa'', ''binge eating disorder'', or pica, or as part of a ''genetic disorder'' like ''Prader-Willi Syndrome''. The mental-health professional will also explore whether other forms of mental illness are present.' "
What is the treatment for bulimia?,"'Studies on treatment effectiveness for bulimia seem to show that psychotherapy treatment for bulimia is superior to medication or ''behavior therapy''. Cognitive behavior therapy is thought to be somewhat superior to other forms of psychotherapy in treating this eating disorder. This form of psychotherapy helps to alleviate bulimia and reduce the likelihood that it will come back by helping the eating disorder sufferer change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In ''CBT'', the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals:''Family therapy is also often used to treat bulimia, particularly for adolescent sufferers. It usually takes place in three phases:''Nutritional counseling involves teaching the bulimic individual how to ''diet'"" in a healthy way. It has been found to help decrease the sufferer's tendency to engage in purging behaviors.""'Regarding medication treatment of bulimia, ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac'') has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of this condition. Fluoxetine is a member of the serotonergic ''antidepressants'' (SSRIs). Other SSRIs, as well as serotonin/norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors like ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor'') and ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), and ''tricyclic antidepressants'' like ''imipramine'' (''Tofranil'') and amitryptiline (''Elavil''), have also been shown to decrease the binge eating and purging symptoms of bulimia.''SSRIs tend to have fewer side effects than the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Also, SSRIs do not cause ''orthostatic hypotension'' (sudden drop in ''blood pressure'' when sitting up or standing) and ''heart''-rhythm disturbances like the TCAs do. Therefore, SSRIs are often the first-line treatment for bulimia. Examples of other SSRIs include ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''fluvoxamine'' (''Luvox''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro'').''SSRIs are generally well tolerated, and side effects are usually mild. The most common side effects are ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', agitation, ''insomnia'', and ''headache''. However, these side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use. Some patients experience sexual side effects, such as decreased sexual desire (''decreased libido''), delayed ''orgasm'', or an inability to have an orgasm. Some patients experience ''tremors'' with SSRIs. The so-called serotonergic (meaning caused by serotonin) syndrome is a rare but serious neurologic condition associated with the use of SSRIs. It is characterized by high ''fevers'', ''seizures'', and heart-rhythm disturbances. This condition tends to occur only in very ill psychiatric patients taking multiple psychiatric medications.''The antiepileptic medication ''topiramate'' (''Topamax'') has also been shown to significantly decrease binge eating and is sometimes used to treat people who do not respond to or have intolerable side effects from the other medications.'   Didactic component: This phase helps to set up positive expectations for therapy and promote the person's cooperation with the treatment process. Cognitive component: This helps to identify the thoughts and assumptions that influence the bulimic individual's behaviors, particularly those that may predispose the sufferer to disordered eating. Behavioral component: This employs behavior-modification techniques to teach the person more effective strategies for dealing with problems. Initially, the family works with the therapist to help the adolescent maintain appropriate food intake and limit negative ways the eating-disordered person uses to control their weight. After the bulimic individual has begun to control their negative eating behaviors, he or she is encouraged to take responsibility for maintaining appropriate eating and refraining from purging behaviors. In the final phase of treatment, more general life issues of the adolescent are addressed and the effects of bulimia on normal activities and normal development are examined."
What are complications of bulimia?,"'The potential dangers of bulimia can be severe and affect virtually every organ system. The malnutrition that can result from inducing ''vomiting'' and abusing laxatives, diet pills, and/or diuretics (medications that cause increased urinating) can result in ''low blood pressure'' to the point of ''fainting'', ''cold hands'' and ''feet'', abnormalities in body chemistry (abnormal ''electrolyte'' levels), as well as abnormal hormone levels, failure to ovulate, and delayed ''puberty''. Permanent complications can include stunted growth, decreased ''bone density'"", and changes in the person's brain structure. Severe complications can include irregular heartbeat and rectal prolapse. People with bulimia tend to have twice the mortality rates as individuals with no eating disorder. ""'Suicide'' is a significant component of the higher mortality rate.'  "
What is the prognosis for bulimia?,"'In contrast to illnesses like depression, that can have as much as a 75% recovery rate, only about half the people with bulimia fully recover. Most full recovery takes place between four and nine years later. About one-third of bulimia sufferers have made a partial recovery and 10-20% continue to have chronic symptoms.''The mortality rate of bulimia, at 1.7 (deaths per 1000 person-years) is less than that of ''anorexia'', which is about 5. Both of these eating disorders often co-occur with depressive, ''anxiety'', and other mood disorders, as well as with personality disorders like ''borderline personality disorder''.' "
Are there support groups for people with bulimia?,"'B.E.A.T.-Beating Eating Disorders Support Groups''http://www.b-eat.co.uk''Daily Strength Eating Disorders Support Group''http://www.dailystrength.org''Eating Disorders Anonymous Online Meeting''http://edanonymous.blogspot.com''National Association of ''Anorexia'' Nervosa & Associated Disorders''750 E Diehl Road #127''Naperville, IL 60563''Helpline: 630-577-1330''National Association for Males With Eating Disorders-Online Support Groups''Phone: 877-780-0080''Email: ''[email\xa0protected]''National Eating Disorders Association''165 West 46th Street, Suite 402''New York, NY 10036''[email\xa0protected]''800-931-2237' "
Is it possible to prevent bulimia?,"'Most bulimia ''prevention'' programs focus on educating the public and at-risk populations like ''teens'' about the dangers of the disorder (psycho-education). While psycho-education has been found to increase the knowledge of those who receive it, studies do not show more than minimal change in behavior. More successful than passive psycho-education seems to be prevention approaches that specifically address eating-disordered ways of thinking, like considering thinness as the ideal body type.' "

Is it possible to prevent bulimia?,"'Most bulimia ''prevention'' programs focus on educating the public and at-risk populations like ''teens'' about the dangers of the disorder (psycho-education). While psycho-education has been found to increase the knowledge of those who receive it, studies do not show more than minimal change in behavior. More successful than passive psycho-education seems to be prevention approaches that specifically address eating-disordered ways of thinking, like considering thinness as the ideal body type.' "
Facts you should know about bullous pemphigoid, Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune skin disease characterized by blisters. The cause of bullous pemphigoid is not known. Bullous pemphigoid can involve the lining of the mouth and nose. The diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid is ultimately confirmed by biopsy. Treatment of bullous pemphigoid is individualized and depends on the location and severity of the disease.
What is bullous pemphigoid?,"'Bullous pemphigoid is an uncommon skin disease characterized by tense blisters on the surface of the skin. Occasionally, the inner lining tissue of the mouth, nasal passages, or conjunctivae of the eyes (mucous membrane tissue) can be involved. The condition is caused by antibodies and inflammation abnormally accumulating in a particular layer of the skin or mucous membranes. This layer of tissue is called the ""basement membrane."" These antibodies (immunoglobulins) bind to proteins in the basement membrane called hemidesmosomal BP antigens and this attracts cells of inflammation. The mucous membrane disease is also referred to separately as mucous membrane pemphigoid.'  "
What are signs and symptoms of bullous pemphigoid?,"'Symptoms of bullous pemphigoid include intense ''itching'' and burning sensation of the skin. When the mucous membranes of the mouth are affected, it can cause ''pain'', burning, peeling away of affected inner lining tissues, and sensitivity to acidic foods. Eating can be difficult, and involvement in the deeper areas of the throat can cause ''coughing''. Involvement of the inner nose can cause ''nosebleeds''. The disease typically worsens and improves over time.'  "
What are bullous pemphigoid causes and risk factors?,"'A majority of those affected by bullous pemphigoid are 50 years of age or older. While the cause is unknown, it is felt by some that an ''aging'' immune system may become activated in certain individuals with a genetic predisposition to develop bullous pemphigoid.' "
Is bullous pemphigoid contagious?,'No. Bullous pemphigoid cannot be transmitted from one person to another.' 
What types of specialists treat bullous pemphigoid?,'Bullous pemphigoid is diagnosed and treated by dermatologists.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose bullous pemphigoid?,"'Bullous pemphigoid is often diagnosed by clinical examination and is confirmed by the results of a biopsy of involved tissue. The biopsy with traditional pathology evaluation can demonstrate inflammation of the affected skin levels. Additional testing of the biopsy specimen for antibody immune deposits can reveal the abnormal antibodies located in the basement membrane layer of skin or mucous membrane tissue. Blood testing for circulating basement membrane antibodies can also be helpful.''Bullous pemphigoid-like condition can sometimes be associated with other illnesses, including ''systemic lupus erythematosus'' (''SLE'' or ''lupus'') and ''cancer''.' "
What is the treatment for bullous pemphigoid?,"'Bullous pemphigoid can be chronic and mild without substantially disturbing the general health of affected individuals. It can also significantly affect daily lives in its more severe forms. Mild bullous pemphigoid can resolve with topical prescription ''corticosteroid'' creams but sometimes requires high doses of steroids taken internally. Severe bullous pemphigoid can also require immune-suppression ''drugs'' such as ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), mycophenolate (''Cellcept''), and ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex''). The ''tetracycline'' derivatives such as ''minocycline'' or ''doxycycline'' have also been used as an option to reduce inflammation. Other treatments that have been used for severe disease include intravenous immunoglobulin infusions, typically given monthly.''Research has indicated that large quantities of high-potency ''topical corticosteroids'' applied to the body surface are safer in controlling localized bullous pemphigoid than oral ''corticosteroids''. It was felt by the researchers that topical corticosteroids should now be the treatment of choice for bullous pemphigoid, particularly when the disease is not extensive.'  "
Are there home remedies for bullous pemphigoid?,'No. There are no home remedies for bullous pemphigoid other than preventing skin irritation and infection from scratching.' 
What is the prognosis of bullous pemphigoid?,"'The outlook for bullous pemphigoid is variable. As described above, the symptoms tend to wax and wane. In its most severe form it can be fatal without treatment, especially if involving the airways and pharynx.' "
Is it possible to prevent bullous pemphigoid?,'No. There is no ''prevention'' for bullous pemphigoid.' 
What is bullying? How can someone distinguish bullying from hazing or meanness?,"'While state laws have little consistency in their definition of bullying, the accepted definition by the U.S. Department of Education and by many ''mental health'' professionals is unwanted physical or verbal aggression directed at a specific person, repeated over a period, involves an imbalance of power, and acts to exclude the victim from a group. It is further characterized by the bully repeatedly using higher social status over the victim to exert power and to hurt the victim. When the harassment, name calling, gossiping, outing, rumor spreading, threats, or other forms of intimidation expand from being done in person or by phone to the use of emails, chat rooms, blogs, or other social media over the Internet, it is referred to as cyber bullying or online bullying. In contrast, hazing is part of initiation of the victim into a group, and meanness does not involve an imbalance of power. Further, meanness involves hurtful behaviors between people who are equals, in social standing and otherwise.'""People usually think of bullying as taking place between children at school. However, it can also occur at work and include aggressive behaviors like verbal abuse, sabotaging the victim's job or work relationship, or misusing authority. Adult bullies who engage in these behaviors are males 60% of the time. While men who bully tend to victimize both genders equally, women bullies target other women about 80% of the time."" "
What are the different types of bullying?,"'There are at least five types of bullying.' Physical bullying can involve hitting, kicking, pinching, pushing, or otherwise attacking others. Verbal bullying refers to the use of words to harm others with name-calling, insults, making sexual or bigoted comments, harsh teasing, taunting, mimicking, or verbal threats. Relational bullying focuses on excluding someone from a peer group, usually through verbal threats, spreading rumors, and other forms of intimidation. Reactive bullying involves the bully responding to being a former victim by picking on others. Bullying can also involve assault on a person's property, when the victim has his or her personal property taken or damaged."
What are the different types of hazing?," Cursing or yelling at victims Compelling victims to eat disgusting things Beating, whipping, branding, tying up, or gagging victims Requiring victims to perform sexual acts Forced binge drinking"
How common is bullying? How common is hazing?,"'Some statistics on bullying suggest that 28% of students from grades six through 12 have a history of being the victim of bullying, while 30% of high school students acknowledge having bullied other students. About 10%-14% of children have been the victim of bullying for more than six months. Most victims of cyberbullying have also been victims of school bullying.''Boys tend to engage in bullying more often than girls, especially at high school age and beyond, and are more likely to engage in physical or verbal bullying, physically or verbally, while girls more often engage in relational bullying.''Studies show that teachers often underestimate how much bullying is occurring at their school since they only see about 4% of bullying incidents that occur. Further, victims of bullying only report it to school adults one-third of the time, usually when the bullying occurs repeatedly or has causes injury. Parents tend to be aware their child is being bullied only about half the time.''More than 40% of workers in the United States experienced bullying in the workplace. More than 90% of working women are estimated to believe they have been undermined by another woman at some time in their careers. However, due to the stereotype that women should be more nurturing, a woman may perceive normal supervision from another woman as undermining.''Nearly half of high school students and more than half of college students who have been part of a club, team, fraternity, sorority, or other organization have been hazed at some time.' "
What makes a bully? Why do kids bully? Why do adults bully?,"""Bullying is the result of the bully's need to get and keep control over someone else. The aggression that is involved in bullying interferes with the empathy needed to refrain from bullying others. There are two different types of aggression: proactive aggression and reactive aggression. Proactive aggression is described as being organized, emotionally detached, and driven by the desire for a reward. Reactive aggression is defined as impulsive, in response to a perceived threat or precipitant, and usually associated with intense emotion, especially ""'anxiety'' or anger. Contrary to the stereotype of the bully who is socially inept trying to make him or herself feel better, bullies who have never been the victim of bullying have rather high self-esteem and tend to be social climbers. Child and adult bullies have a tendency to have low tolerance for frustration, trouble empathizing with others, and a tendency to view innocuous behaviors by their victims as being provocative. They are more likely to suffer from a ''mental health'' problem compared to non-bullies. Many non-victimized bullies are thought of as bi-strategic controllers, using both prosocial actions (for example, likeability and popularity) and negative actions (for example, intimidating or coercing others) to engage in these hurtful behaviors toward others.''Bullies who have been the victim of bullying themselves (bully/victims) tend to be more aggressive than bullies who have never been a victim of bullying. They tend to be less popular, more often bullied by their siblings, to be otherwise abused or neglected, and to come from families of low socioeconomic status.'""Bystanders of bullying, those who witness it but are neither the primary bully nor the victim, tend to succumb to what they believe is peer pressure to support bullying behavior and fear of becoming the victim of the bully if they don't support the behavior. Further, bystanders are at risk for engaging in bullying themselves if they encourage the bullying by paying attention to the behavior or laughing about it."" "
What are causes and risk factors of bullying?,"'Risk factors for being the victim of bullying include having low understanding of emotional or social interactions, a tendency to become upset easily, or already suffering from ''anxiety'' or ''depression''. Actual or perceived ''obesity'' of the victim is also a risk factor. Being underweight is slightly associated with being bullied. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender youth are more often victims of bullying compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Children who have disabilities or are immigrants or highly achieving minorities are more vulnerable to being bullied, as well.' "
What are symptoms and warning signs of children and adults who are bullied?,"'Signs that may indicate that a child may be being bullied include missing belongings, unexplained injuries, and a limited number of friends. Symptoms experienced by victims of bullying may be physical, emotional, and behavioral. Examples of physical symptoms include those often associated with ''stress'', like ''headaches'', stomachaches, changes in appetite, ''bedwetting'', ''dizziness'', and general aches and pains. Psychological symptoms often include irritability, ''anxiety'', sadness, trouble sleeping, frequent ''nightmares'', ''tiredness'' in the mornings, loneliness, helplessness, and feeling isolated. Victims of bullying may exhibit behavioral symptoms as well, like avoiding social situations, getting to school or work late, taking off more days, skipping school without telling parents, or even trying to retaliate against their tormentors. Their grades may decline and they may become self-destructive (for example, run away from home, hurting themselves or contemplating ''suicide'').' "
What are the effects of bullying? What are the effects of hazing?,"'Bullying can be associated with significantly serious problems. ''Teens'' who bully are at greater risk for engaging in delinquent behaviors, including vandalism, as well as violence inside and outside of school. They are also at risk of ''substance abuse'' and dropping out of school. Victims of these behaviors also tend to develop or increase their severity of ''anxiety''. Bullies and victims tend to experience ''depression'' more than their peers who have not been involved in bullying, which can lead to academic problems, frequent absences from school, loneliness, and social isolation. Research shows that bullies and their victims are also at risk for having ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''). People who were bullied as children are at risk for having less of a supportive social network during adulthood, and those who were bullies/victims during childhood may have poorer physical and financial health, more antisocial behavior, and be more likely to become a young parent compared to bullies who have never been the victim of bullying. Victims of workplace bullying may suffer from reduced job performance, more absences, and less work satisfaction. Ultimately, bullying may be the cause of higher staff turnover. People who are both victims and perpetrators of bullying seem to be more vulnerable to experiencing both internalizing (for example, loneliness, ''depression'', and ''anxiety'') and externalizing (for example, antisocial) symptoms.''Victims of hazing are at risk for physical or emotional problems, ''sleep problems'', a decline in academic success, impaired relationships, a loss of respect for the group that hazed them, and a loss of trust in other group members. These individuals are also at risk for needing medical or psychiatric hospitalization.''Either being a bully or the victim of bullying increases the risk of engaging in self-harm, as well as ''suicidal thoughts'' and actions in both boys and girls. However, research indicates that the risk of both thoughts and attempts at ''suicide'' seem to be higher for girl victims and girl bullies no matter how infrequently the bullying occurs. However, the risk of ''suicidal'' thoughts seems to increase in boy bullies and victims when the bullying occurs repeatedly. Interestingly, the frequency of ''suicide'' gestures/attempts in boy bullies and victims seems to increase even when bullying occurs infrequently.' "
What should victims of bullying and their parents do to stop bullying? What are the treatment options for victims of bullying?,"""Child development professionals tend to suggest that if parents think their child is being bullied, they should take it seriously and encourage their child to talk about it. Remaining calm and supportive, and reassuring the youth that he or she is not to blame for the victimization can go a long way to creating a climate that helps the victim of bullying feel comfortable enough to talk about it. Parents should try to gain details about their child's bullying and who is involved, and teach the child how to respond to being bullied assertively without getting upset. The child may also find it helpful to stay with other students and a teacher so the bully has less opportunity to engage in the behavior. Other ways to stop bullying in schools include parents contacting school personnel and remaining in touch with them to seek their help in alleviating the bullying. At the same time, parents should understand that school personnel are often unaware that bullying is occurring, and their kid may fear reprisals for having school authorities alerted. Since 2015, the District of Columbia and all 50 U.S. states have laws against bullying, and as of 2018, 48 specifically include cyberbullying in the description. Contrary to the inclination of many parents, mental health professionals advise against contacting the parents of the bully.""'Aside from addressing the bullying directly, victims of bullying may benefit from engaging in activities that can improve their confidence, self-esteem, and overall emotional strength, whether it be sports, music, or other extracurricular activities. Engaging in such activities can also help the youth create and strengthen friendships and improve their social skills. Professional help in the form of ''psychotherapy'' and/or treatment with psychiatric medication may be necessary if the victim of bullying has significant emotional symptoms that interfere with his or her ability to function that rises to a diagnosable mental health condition. ''Cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT'') is a particularly effective approach to helping victims of bullying cope with the emotional turmoil that results from their victimization and to ultimately decrease their victimization. CBT helps bullying sufferers understand and manage their thoughts and feelings around being bullied, as well as understand how those thoughts and feelings affect their actions. This approach to therapy can further help the victims of bullying build confidence and learn ways to discourage their victimization.' "
What should parents do if they think their child is bullying others? What are treatment options for people who bully others?,"'Advice for parents who think their child is bullying others includes talking to their child to share the details of the actions of which he or she has been accused and listening to his or her side of what happened, holding the child fully and fairly accountable for his or her actions, spending more time with him or her, monitoring his or her activities, and supervising him or her appropriately. Other tips for parents whose children are bullying others include staying in close touch with the school to monitor for any further incidents and encouraging the child to engage in positive social activities with positive role models. All bullies may benefit from being given socially appropriate ways to express their aggression (for example, through martial arts, writing, or other supervised group activities). Those who were formerly victims of bullying may experience a decrease in bullying behavior when their life is improved through protection from adverse experiences, including ''domestic violence'', abuse, or neglect. Bullies who exhibit sufficient symptoms to qualify for a mental health diagnosis should receive treatment accordingly.' "
What can parents do if the school downplays a report of bullying?,"""Since bullying tends to flourish in secrecy, parents are commonly advised to continue communicating with school personnel and other pertinent community members until the bullying has been addressed and resolved. For example, if the behavior is reported to the child's teacher and the teacher fails to intervene, parents should consider advancing through the school chain of command to the school counselor, assistant principal, and principal. Parents of other victims of bullying may be sources of support, as can be the child's pediatrician."" "
What can people do if they see someone being bullied?,"'Bystanders to bullying can help discourage bullying behavior by asking other people who are witnessing the bullying how they feel about what they have seen and whether they feel the behavior is right or wrong. The group of bystanders can decide individually or as a group to positively influence the situation by expressing their disapproval toward the bully and/or notifying people in authority, like teachers, counselors, or administrators at school, or supervisors or the human resources department in the workplace. Bystanders to bullying can also discourage the behavior by encouraging the victim to ask for help from peers and authority figures.'  "
What measures can be implemented to prevent bullying at school and in the workplace?,"'Schools and individual classrooms that tend to be supportive of all children tend to prevent bullying. Effective bullying ''prevention'"" programs at school tend to be school-wide and involve education of students, teachers, administrators, and parents on what bullying is and the extent to which it is harmful for all involved, understanding how others may view victims, and how to get help. Yearly surveys of kids can help maintain awareness of how severe the bullying problem is in a school. Just informing the parents of bullying victims tends to improve the victim child's quality of life. Successful anti-bullying programs increase playground supervision, provide clear consequences for bullying, and teach students who are bystanders to bullying how to stand up for victims so that bullying behavior gains a stigma rather than being socially beneficial.""'Workplace interventions that tend to be effective are similar to those in school, in that the interventions are implemented throughout the workplace. Coworkers and supervisors are encouraged to address each other by name and with respect, fully participate in required tasks, and avoid gossiping about each other or excluding anyone from conversation.''Interventions that have not consistently been found to be helpful in preventing or decreasing bullying include having the bully and victim try to work out their differences in front of a teacher or counselor at school, a supervisor, or human resources staff at work. Rigid rather than firm no tolerance for bullying policies tend to result in overreactions to behaviors that do not constitute bullying. Telling students above the elementary school level to report bullying may lead to increased bullying. Teachers or work supervisors who either directly or indirectly intimidate other kids themselves or tolerate such behaviors are an obstacle to implementing an effective anti-bullying school program.' "
How can people reduce their risk for being bullied?,"'Since low self-esteem tends to be a risk factor for becoming the victim of bullying, interventions that promote confidence and self-esteem are important ways to reduce the risk of being bullied. Confidence builders can range from engaging in activities at which the person excels (for example, theatrical performances, sports teams, and special work projects) to engaging in ''psychotherapy''. As isolation is both a risk factor and result of bullying, helping the person feel less alone by lending a listening ear and/or engaging in a support group can go a long way toward providing the community needed to prevent a person from being bullied.'

Facts you should know about bunions," A bunion is a bony prominence from realignment of the joint at the base of the big toes. Bunions most commonly affect the inner foot at the base of the big toe but also can affect the outside of the foot at the base of the little toe, referred to as a bunionette or tailor's bunion. Bunions affect both women and men, however they are more common in women. Bunions may or may not cause symptoms. Bunions are a progressive deformity. Treatment of bunions can include rest, icing, alteration of footwear, foot supports (orthotics), medications, steroid injections, and/or surgery."
What are bunions?,"'The common bunion is a localized area of enlargement or prominence of the inner portion of the joint at the base of the big toe. The enlargement actually represents a misalignment of the big toe joint (''metatarsal'' phalangeal joint) and, in some cases, additional bone formation. The misalignment causes the big toe to point outward and rotate (medically termed hallux abducto valgus deformity) toward the smaller toes. This deformity is progressive and will increase with time although the symptoms may or may not be present. The enlarged joint at the base of the big toe (the first metatarsophalangeal joint, or MTP joint) can become inflamed with redness, tenderness, and ''pain''. A small fluid-filled sac (bursa) adjacent to the joint can also become inflamed (''bursitis''), leading to additional swelling, redness, and ''pain''. A deeper ''joint pain'' may occur as localized ''arthritis'' develops in later stages of the deformity.'""A less common bunion is located at the joint at the base of the fifth (pinky) toe. This bunion is sometimes referred to as a tailor's bunion or bunionette. The misalignment at the fifth MTP joint causes the pinky toe to point inward and create an enlargement of the joint.""  "
What are the causes of bunions?,"'While the precise cause is not known, it is believed that bunions are caused by multiple factors including abnormal foot function and mechanics, such as overpronation, abnormal anatomy at first MTP joint, and genetic factors. Overpronation is a common cause of bunion in younger individuals. Abnormal biomechanics can lead to instability of the metatarsal phalangeal joint and muscle imbalance, resulting in the deformity. Abnormal anatomy at the first MTP joint can predispose an individual to develop a bunion deformity. A study has found a significant genetic heritability of bunion deformity amongst Caucasians of European descent.'""Although shoe gear doesn't directly cause a bunion, it can certainly make the condition painful and swollen. Other less common causes of bunion deformities include ""'trauma'' (''sprains'', ''fractures'', and nerve injuries), neuromuscular disorders (''polio'' or ''Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease''), and limb-length discrepancies (one leg shorter than the other) where the longer leg develops the bunion. The longer limb will tend to cause the foot to overpronate.''Various arthritic conditions can cause or exacerbate bunion deformity. ''Gout'', a ''painful joint'' condition, very commonly involves the first MTP joint, which can progress to arthritic bunion deformity. ''Rheumatoid arthritis'' often causes severe bunions to develop along with other toe deformities.' "
Who develops bunions?,"'Bunions most commonly affect women. Some studies report that bunion symptoms occur nearly 10 times more frequently in women. It has been suggested that tight-fitting shoes, especially high-heel and narrow-toed shoes, might increase the risk for bunion formation. Tight footwear certainly is a factor in precipitating the pain and swelling of bunions. Complaints of bunions are reported to be more prevalent in people who wear closed shoes than in barefoot people.''Other risk factors for the development of bunions include abnormal formation of the bones of the foot at birth (congenital) and arthritic diseases such as ''rheumatoid arthritis''. In some cases, repetitive stresses to the foot can lead to bunion formation. Bunions are common in ballet dancers.' "
What are symptoms and signs of a bunion?,"'Bunions may or may not cause symptoms. Early symptoms may be ''foot pain'' in the involved area when ''walking'' or wearing shoes; rest and/or change to a wider shoe relieves this pain. Shoe pressure in this area can cause intermittent pain while the development of arthritis in more severe bunions can lead to chronic, constant pain. For arthritis sufferers, removing shoes or resting does not always provide relief. Besides ill-fitting shoes, unsupportive flimsy soled shoes can add ''stress'' to the bunion joint and increase pain and instability to the area.''Skin changes such as ''blisters'' and ''calluses'' may also develop as a result of repeated friction and pressure on the prominence by ill-fitting shoes or from the deformity caused by arthritis.''Bunions that cause marked pain are often associated with swelling of the soft tissues, redness, ''joint stiffness'', and local tenderness. It is important to note that, in postpubertal men and ''postmenopausal'' women, pain at the base of the big toe can be caused by ''gout'' and ''gouty arthritis'' that is similar to the pain caused by bunions.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose a bunion?,"'A physician will consider a bunion as a possible diagnosis when noting the symptoms described above. The anatomy of the foot, including joint and foot function, is assessed during the examination. Radiographs (X-ray films) of the foot can be helpful to determine the integrity of the joints of the foot and to screen for underlying conditions, such as arthritis or ''gout''. X-ray films are an excellent method of calculating the alignment of the toes when taken in a standing position (weight-bearing).' "
What is the treatment for bunions? Are there home remedies to treat bunions?,"'Nonsurgical treatments such as rest and wearing loose (wider) shoes or sandals (preferably with a supportive sole) can often relieve the irritating pain of bunions. Walking shoes may have some advantages, for example, over high-heeled styles that pressure the sides of the foot.''Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''acetylsalicylic acid'' (''aspirin'', Ecotrin), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'"", Children's Advil/""'Motrin'', Medipren, Motrin, ''Nuprin'', PediaCare ''Fever''), and ''naproxen'' (''Anaprox'', ''Naprelan'', ''Naprosyn'', ''Aleve''), can help to ease inflammation and provide pain relief. Local ''cold''-pack application is sometimes helpful, as well.''Bunion shields or pads can reduce pressure on the bunion caused by closed shoes. A bunion splint may also help if the condition is still in its early stage with minimal deformity. Splints help to place the toe in a corrected position, while stretching tight soft tissue structures. Night splints are used while sleeping and splint booties can be worn inside a shoe. Taping and toe separators can also be used to achieve the same goal.''Stretches and manipulation of first MTP joint structures can help preserve joint mobility. This can delay onset of arthritis at the joint -- a common late-stage finding of long-term bunion deformity.''Custom orthotics are used to improve foot mechanics and address overpronation. Orthotics can prevent progression of bunion and relieve pain by improving joint function. In addition, orthotics need to be worn in stable, well-fitting, laced shoes. These shoes can positively influence joint position and reduce discomfort that is commonly encountered in ill-fitting, tight shoes.''Inflammation of the joint at the base of the big toe can often be relieved by a local injection of cortisone.''Constant pressure or friction can lead to skin breakdown and infection that may require antibiotic therapy.''When the measures above are effective in relieving symptoms, patients should avoid irritating the bunion again by optimizing footwear and foot care. Many treatments without surgery can provide pain relief. However, the only way to change the bunion structure is by performing surgery.'  "
Is surgery required to correct a bunion?,"'For those whose bunions cause persisting pain despite conservative care, a surgical operation is considered for correction of the bunion. The surgical operation to cure a bunion is referred to as a bunionectomy. Surgical procedures can correct deformity and relieve pain, leading to improved foot function. These procedures typically involve removing bony growth of the bunion while realigning the big toe joint. Surgery is often, but not always, successful; failure to relieve pain can result from the big toe moving back to its previous deviated position even after surgery since bunion surgery does not always address mechanical problems. However, proper footwear and orthotics can reduce the chances of surgical failure.' "
Is it possible to prevent bunions?,"'If the diagnosis is made early on, such as in preadolescence, bunion development can be slowed and, in some cases, arrested with the proper supportive shoe gear and custom functional shoe inserts (orthotics). Physical therapy involving stretch can also be beneficial. Avoidance of certain athletic activities with improper shoe fit and toe pressure can prevent the symptoms that occur with bunions. Early examination by a podiatrist is recommended.' "
What is the prognosis of a bunion?,"'The treatments described above are very effective in treating bunion deformities, and the prognosis can be excellent. However, the correct diagnosis is essential to define any underlying associated deformities as well as the bunion severity. Also, a bunion is a progressive deformity and will get worse with time. It can cause instability to the rest of the foot and sometimes lead to arthritis in the joint at the base of the big toe. It is, therefore, advised to consult with a foot specialist to fully evaluate a bunion. Early recognition, diagnosis, and bunion care can prevent debilitating aftereffects.' "
What are Burkitt lymphomas?,"'Burkitt lymphomas are aggressive B-cell cancers (''non-Hodgkin type of lymphomas'"") that frequently involve aggressive progression in the bone marrow and in the central nervous system. Burkitt lymphoma (also known as small non-cleaved cell lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma) has a variant termed Burkitt-like lymphoma or BLL. Other types of Burkitt lymphoma are termed as follows:""'The WHO (World Health Organization) suggests that there is little difference between Burkitt lymphoma and BLL and considers them essentially the same disease. The other variants are classified under the term Burkitt lymphoma. For the purposes of this article, we will discuss only Burkitt lymphoma and will not discuss small differences in subtypes. Because of their rapid progression, these lymphomas are considered medical emergencies that require fast diagnosis and treatment.''Burkitt lymphomas comprise about 1%-2% of all lymphomas. The African variety usually starts as a jaw ''tumor'' while in United States, they usually begin as an abdominal tumor. About 90% of these lymphomas occur in males. In Africa, they occur mainly in children while in United States, the average age of onset is 30 years.' Endemic or African is a type that usually involves the jaw and the facial bones. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma involves abdominal tumors. Immunodeficiency-related Burkitt lymphoma has lymph node and bone marrow involvement."
What causes Burkitt lymphoma?,"'The exact cause of Burkitt lymphoma is not known. However, the lymphomas are characterized by a translocation and deregulation of a gene (c-myc) on chromosome 8. In addition, there has been an association between Burkitt lymphoma and a high incidence of malaria and/or infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Additionally, patients with a depressed immune response have also been noted to have a higher incidence of Burkitt lymphoma.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of Burkitt lymphoma?,"'Signs and symptoms of Burkitt lymphoma are somewhat similar in all types and may include the following:''Abdominal symptoms are more prominent with Burkitt lymphoma seen in the U.S., while endemic (African) Burkitt lymphoma tends to cause more jaw-related symptoms.'   nausea and vomiting loss of appetite abdominal pain abdominal masses masses in the jaw renal failure headaches visual impairment paraplegia night sweats weight loss fatigue enlarged lymph nodes gastrointestinal bleeding intestinal perforation"
How do health care professionals diagnose Burkitt lymphoma?,"'Diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma depends upon pathologic evaluation of the involved tissue; consequently a ''bone marrow biopsy'' or aspiration is sometimes required and/or a tissue sample (for example, lymph node biopsy or a jaw tissue mass biopsy is done.). In addition to the biopsy, laboratory testing is usually done, and imaging studies such as ''CT scanning'' and ''echocardiography'' help determine the extent of the disease. Other procedures or studies that may be performed are removal of fluid collections in the abdomen or thorax for cytogenetic evaluation.' "
How do physicians determine the staging of Burkitt lymphoma?,"'The stage of a tumor is the extent to which it has spread in the body. Unfortunately, different researchers have different ways of staging Burkitt lymphoma. The National Cancer Institute has a five stage system and is as follows:''The Michigan Ann Arbor system and St. Jude/Murphy system uses the following stages:''Patients should discuss which staging system their doctors use.' A: Single solitary extra-abdominal site AR: Intra-abdominal, more than 90% of tumor resected B: Multiple extra-abdominal tumors C: Intra-abdominal tumor D: Intra-abdominal plus 1 or more extra-abdominal sites Stage I: Single tumor (extranodal or outside a lymph node) or single anatomic area Stage II: Single tumor (extranodal) with regional node involved, primary gastrointestinal tumor and/or lymphoma involving nodal areas on the same side of the diaphragm Stage IIR: Completely resected intra-abdominal disease Stage III: Lymphoma involving sites on opposite sides of the diaphragm, all primary intrathoracic tumors, all paraspinal or epidural tumors, and/or extensive intra-abdominal disease"
What is the treatment for Burkitt lymphoma?,"'Because Burkitt lymphomas are very aggressive and fast-growing cancers, people with the disease should be quickly evaluated by an oncologist and/or hematologist for aggressive ''chemotherapy''. Because of the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (an emergency condition caused by lysis of tumor cells with the release of large amounts of tumor cell contents like nucleic acids, potassium, and uric acid into the body, resulting in renal, vascular, and inflammatory problems), patients will need close observation while undergoing therapy. Currently, there is no role for surgery or ''radiation therapy'' in treating these lymphoma types.' "
What is the prognosis for patients with Burkitt lymphoma?,"'The prognosis for about 90% of pediatric patients and up to 50%-60% of adults is good, with long-term survival expected if the patient is quickly diagnosed and treated appropriately with chemotherapy. The prognosis for adults is more guarded (see survival rate section below).' "
What are the survival rates for patients with Burkitt lymphoma?,"""Adults usually do not do as well as children, especially if they have bone marrow involvement; cytogenetics of adult cells is more complex, resulting in aggressive disease. Survival for children can be as high as 90% as compared to about 50%-60% for adults. For adults with low risk disease, the five-year survival rate is about 71%, while high-risk aggressive lymphomas have about a 29% five-year survival rate. The survival rate decreases as the patient's age increases."" "
What is the follow-up care for Burkitt lymphoma?,"'Patients who undergo chemotherapy may develop complications such as tumor lysis syndrome, renal failure, heart problems, infections, sterility, or other cancers. Consequently, patients need continual follow-up care to monitor for any complications that may develop, including recurrence of their lymphoma.' "
What are Burkitt lymphomas?,"'Burkitt lymphomas are aggressive B-cell cancers (''non-Hodgkin type of lymphomas'"") that frequently involve aggressive progression in the bone marrow and in the central nervous system. Burkitt lymphoma (also known as small non-cleaved cell lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma) has a variant termed Burkitt-like lymphoma or BLL. Other types of Burkitt lymphoma are termed as follows:""'The WHO (World Health Organization) suggests that there is little difference between Burkitt lymphoma and BLL and considers them essentially the same disease. The other variants are classified under the term Burkitt lymphoma. For the purposes of this article, we will discuss only Burkitt lymphoma and will not discuss small differences in subtypes. Because of their rapid progression, these lymphomas are considered medical emergencies that require fast diagnosis and treatment.''Burkitt lymphomas comprise about 1%-2% of all lymphomas. The African variety usually starts as a jaw ''tumor'' while in United States, they usually begin as an abdominal tumor. About 90% of these lymphomas occur in males. In Africa, they occur mainly in children while in United States, the average age of onset is 30 years.' Endemic or African is a type that usually involves the jaw and the facial bones. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma involves abdominal tumors. Immunodeficiency-related Burkitt lymphoma has lymph node and bone marrow involvement."
What causes Burkitt lymphoma?,"'The exact cause of Burkitt lymphoma is not known. However, the lymphomas are characterized by a translocation and deregulation of a gene (c-myc) on chromosome 8. In addition, there has been an association between Burkitt lymphoma and a high incidence of malaria and/or infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Additionally, patients with a depressed immune response have also been noted to have a higher incidence of Burkitt lymphoma.' "

What is a first-degree burn?,"'A ''burn'' is one of the most common injuries that happens in homes, especially among children. Depending upon their depth, ''burns'' have been classified into three types: first-degree ''burns'', second-degree burns, and third-degree burns.\xa0''A ''first-degree burn'' is the most minor form of ''burn'' and it usually heals within a week. It happens when the source of heat has come into contact with your skin for just a fraction of a second. It is generally caused when''Since a first-degree burn affects only the superficial or the outermost layer of your skin (''epidermis''), this type of burn is also referred to as a superficial partial-thickness burn. These types of burns are more common in children who out of curiosity and unknowingly touch hot surfaces.' You accidentally touch a hot surface such as a hot pan. Your skin is exposed to the sun for a long time resulting in sunburn. You are shortly exposed to a more intense source of heat such as an explosion. You get an electric shock and the area that was in contact with the electric surface gets burned (but the internal damage is greater)."
What are the signs and symptoms of a first-degree burn?  ,"'Signs and symptoms of a first-degree burn and their duration vary from person to person. These include' First-degree burns develop a pink or red color. They are painful and remain so for 48 to 78 hours. Depending on the amount of time since the injury occurred, there may be minor edema of the burned area. The skin is soft and blisters are usually absent. The skin usually remains unbroken and hence, infection is rare. There may be peeling of burned skin (superficial exfoliation) but the skin is usually normal within three to five days.  The burned area heals without any residual scarring."
How is a first-degree burn treated?,"'A first-degree burn can usually be self-treated at home. Treatment may include' Running the minorly burned skin under cool, running tap water. Applying petroleum jelly twice to three times a day if it’s a very minor burn. Holding a wet cloth soaked with cold water (cold compress) to the skin (to ease the pain). Applying antiseptics creams that include Polysporin or Povidone-Iodine (Betadine) to help prevent infection. Avoid neomycin. Using over-the-counter oral medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce pain and swelling. Applying creams to decrease pain; for example, local anesthetic such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) cream."
When should you see a doctor for a first-degree burn?,'It becomes vital to consult a doctor if the burn worsens or fails to improve within seven days of the injury.\xa0\xa0''Take your child to the doctor if they are less than two years old and have suffered a first-degree burn.''There are certain areas of your body that require a visit to the doctor even in case of a first- degree burn. These are' Face: Even a minor burn on the face carries a risk of disfigurement. Groin: Applying dressings to the burned area may become difficult. Hands: Burned areas may make you unable to carry out even simple tasks. Feet: Burned areas heal slowly.
What are the possible complications of a first-degree burn?,'The skin color of the burned area may become lighter or darker. The complications of a first-degree burn are usually rare except for a low risk of infection .' 
How can you prevent first-degree burns?,'It is possible to prevent most first-degree burns by following certain precautions. These include' Turning down the temperature on your water heater to 125 degrees Fahreinheit. Using sunscreen before you venture out to avoid sunburn and then reapplying it every three hours.  Placing pots and pans on the back burners while cooking. Installing grounded electrical sockets. Unplugging appliances that are not in use. Install smoke alarms/detectors in your home. Changing the batteries in your smoke detectors twice a year. Keeping a dry chemical fire extinguisher at home. Learn how to use it and teach other family members in your home how to use it as well.  Getting the wiring in your home checked by an electrician at least once every 10 years.
"What do first-, second-, third-, and fourth-degree burns look like?","'It may happen that initially a burn appears superficial but becomes deeper over time. If you are unsure how deeply your skin is burned, contact your doctor.''First-degree burns:\xa0''Second-degree burns:\xa0''Third-degree burns:''Fourth-degree burns:' Painful, dry, and red Turn white when pressed Usually, they heal in 3 to 6 days without scarring An example is a non blistering skin burn Painful to the extent of being sensitive to even air movement or air temperature Red and seep fluid Usually form blisters Turn white when pressed Heal within 7 to 21 days Affected skin becomes permanently dark or light in color Does not lead to scar formation An example is a sunburn that forms blisters after several hours Painful with deep pressure Almost always form blisters Do not turn white with pressure Take more than 21 days to heal Usually results in severe scarring An example is a burn that blisters immediately Usually painless (due to destruction of the nerve endings) Waxy white to leathery gray or charred black color Affected skin looks dry Does not turn white when touched Cannot heal without surgical treatment Usually result in severe scarring"
How do I heal a burn quickly?,"'The speed at which a burn heals depends on the cause of the burn and how extensive and deep the burn is.''Antibiotic creams can prevent or treat infections due to burns. Serious burns need regular cleaning of the ''wound'', replacing the skin (skin grafting), and a rich supply of fluids and ''nutrition'' with a few to several days of hospital stay.''General tips for healing a burn quickly include:' Keep the burn clean and protected with a dressing Avoid rubbing or scratching the skin; trim your nails regularly Moisturize the burnt skin after the wound heals to prevent scarring (petroleum jelly can be used 2 to 3 times a day) Increase your protein intake Drink plenty of water Wear a hat and long-sleeved tops and apply a sunscreen lotion while in the sun Wear loose clothes Ask your doctor if you can use antibiotic creams or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to hasten wound healing"
What happens if a burn is left untreated?,"'The most common complications of an untreated burn, depending on its depth, include infections and scarring.''Severe cases of deeper burns that cover an extensive part of the body can lead to ''dehydration'', ''shock'', and even death if left untreated.' "
Key Points," Burning mouth syndrome is burning pain in the mouth that may occur every day for months or longer. Doctors and dentists do not have a specific test for burning mouth syndrome, which makes it hard to diagnose. Your doctor or dentist will rule out other conditions before diagnosing burning mouth syndrome. No specific treatment works for all people. However, your doctor can prescribe medicine to help you manage mouth pain, dry mouth, or other symptoms."
Symptoms,"'The main symptom of burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is pain in the mouth that is burning, scalding, or tingling. Or, the pain may happen with a feeling of numbness, which comes and goes. Other symptoms include ''dry mouth'' or altered taste in the mouth.''BMS is a painful condition. Usually, the tongue is affected, but the pain may also be in the lips or roof of the mouth, or throughout the mouth.''BMS pain can last for months or years. Some people feel constant pain every day. For others, pain increases throughout the day. For many people, the pain is reduced when eating or drinking.'  "
Diagnosis,"""BMS is hard to diagnose. One reason is that people with BMS often don't have a mouth problem that the doctor or dentist can see during an exam. Your dentist or doctor may refer you to a specialist. Specialists who diagnose BMS include dentists who specialize in oral medicine or ""'oral surgery''. Other specialists include doctors who are ear, nose, and throat specialists; gastroenterologists; dermatologists; neurologists; ''rheumatologists''; and/or allergists.''The dentist or doctor will review your medical history and examine your mouth. A lot of tests may be needed. Tests may include:' Blood tests to check for certain medical problems Oral swab tests Allergy tests Salivary flow test Biopsy of tissue Imaging tests"
Primary and Secondary BMS,"'Primary BMS'': If tests do not reveal an underlying medical problem, the diagnosis is primary BMS. Experts believe that primary BMS is caused by damage to the nerves that control pain and taste.''Secondary BMS'': Certain medical conditions can cause BMS. Treating the medical problem will cure the secondary BMS. Common causes of secondary BMS include...'   Hormonal changes (such as from diabetes or thyroid problem) Allergies to dental products, dental materials (usually metals), or foods Dry mouth, which can be caused by certain disorders (such as Sjögren's syndrome) and treatments (such as certain drugs and radiation therapy) Certain medicines, such as those that reduce blood pressure Nutritional deficiencies (such as a low level of vitamin B or iron) Infection in the mouth, such as a yeast infection Acid reflux"
Treatment,"'Your doctor will help you get relief. Medicine can help control pain and relieve ''dry mouth''.''Because BMS is a complex pain disorder, the treatment that works for one person may not work for another.''Symptoms of secondary BMS go away when the underlying medical condition, such as ''diabetes'' or ''yeast infection'', is treated. If a drug is causing secondary BMS, then your doctor may switch you to a new medicine.'  "
Helpful Tips,"'To help ease the pain of BMS, sip a cold beverage, suck on ice chips, or chew sugarless gum.''Avoid irritating substances, such as...''Ask your dentist and doctor for other helpful tips.'   Tobacco Hot, spicy foods Alcoholic beverages Mouthwashes that contain alcohol Products high in acid, such as citrus fruits and juices"
Introduction to burns,"'The skin has an important role to play in the fluid and temperature regulation of the body. If enough skin area is injured, the ability to maintain that control can be lost. The skin also acts as a protective barrier against the bacteria and ''viruses'' that inhabit the world outside the body.''The anatomy of the skin is complex, and there are many structures within the layers of the skin. There are three layers:''The amount of damage that a ''burn'' can cause depends upon the type of burn, its location, its depth, and how much body surface area that it involves.'   Epidermis, the outer layer of the skin Dermis, made up of collagen and elastic fibers and where nerves, blood vessels, sweat glands, and hair follicles reside Hypodermis or subcutaneous tissue, where larger blood vessels and nerves are located. This is the layer of tissue that is most important in temperature regulation."
How are burns classified?,"'Burns'' are classified based upon their depth.''A ''first-degree burn'' is superficial and causes local inflammation of the skin. Sunburns often are categorized as first-degree burns. The inflammation is characterized by ''pain'', redness, and a mild amount of swelling. The skin may be very tender to touch.''Second-degree burns'' are deeper and, in addition to the ''pain'', redness and inflammation, ''blistering'' of the skin also occurs.''Third-degree burns'' are deeper still, involving all layers of the skin, in effect killing that area of skin. Because the nerves and blood vessels are damaged, third-degree burns appear white and leathery and tend to be relatively painless.''Burns are not static and may mature. Over a few hours a first-degree burn may involve deeper structures and become second degree. Think of a ''sunburn'' that ''blisters'' the next day. Similarly, second-degree burns may evolve into third-degree burns.''Regardless of the type of burn, inflammation and fluid accumulation in and around the ''wound'"" occur. Moreover, the skin is the body's first defense against infection by microorganisms. A burn is also a break in the skin, and the risk of infection exists both at the site of the injury and potentially throughout the body.""'Only the epidermis has the ability to regenerate itself. Burns that extend deeper may cause permanent injury and scarring and not allow the skin in that area to return to normal function.' "
What is the significance of the amount of body surface area burned?,"'In addition to the depth of the burn, the total surface area of the burn is significant. Burns are measured as a percentage of total body area affected. The ''""rule of nines"" ''is often used, adjusted for infants and children. This calculation is based upon the fact that the surface area of the following parts of an adult body each correspond to approximately 9% of total (and the total body area of 100% is achieved):''As an example, if both legs (18% x 2 = 36%), the groin (1%) and the front chest and abdomen were burned, this would involve 55% of the body.''Only second- and third-degree burn areas are added together to measure total body burn area. While first-degree burns are painful, the skin integrity is intact and it is able to do its job with fluid and temperature maintenance.''If more than 15%-20% of the body is involved in a burn, significant fluid may be lost. ''Shock'' may occur if inadequate fluid is not provided intravenously. As the percentage of burn surface area increases, the risk of death increases as well. Patients with burns involving less than 20% of their body should do well, but those with burns involving greater than 50% have a significant mortality risk, depending upon a variety of factors, including underlying medical conditions and age.'   Head = 9% Chest (front) = 9% Abdomen (front) = 9% Upper/mid/low back and buttocks = 18% Each arm = 9% Each palm = 1% Groin = 1% Each leg = 18% total (front = 9%, back = 9%)"
How important is the location of a burn?,"'Burn location is an important consideration.''If the burn involves the face, nose, mouth, or neck, there is a risk that there will be ''inhalation'' injury and enough inflammation and swelling to obstruct the ''airway'' and cause ''breathing'' problems.''If there are circumferential burns to the chest, as the burn progresses, the tissue involved may not allow enough motion of the chest wall to allow adequate breathing to occur. If circumferential burns occur to arms, legs, fingers, or toes, the same constriction may not allow blood flow and put the survival of the extremity at risk. Burns to areas of the body with flexion creases, like the palm of the hand, the back of the knee, the face, and the groin may need specialized care. As the burn matures, the skin may ''scar'' and shorten, preventing full range of motion of the body area.' "
What about electrical burns?,"'Electrical burns may cause serious injury that is not readily apparent. Often the entry and exit points for the electrical shock may not be easily identified.''Electricity flows more easily through tissues in the body that are designed to deal with electricity. Nerves and muscles are ""wired"" for this task and often are damaged. If significant muscle damage occurs, muscle fibers break down and chemicals can be released into the bloodstream causing ''electrolyte'' disturbances and ''kidney failure''.'  "
What about chemical burns?,"'Burns can also occur when chemicals are spilled onto the body and generate a reaction that creates heat. Chemical burns may be classified by their pH or acidity.'   Acids are those with pH less than 7 and include common household compounds like acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, or sulfuric acid. Bases or alkali compounds have a pH greater than 7. Ammonia is a common alkali found in the home."
First aid for burns,"'Burns of the face, hands, and ''feet'' should always be considered a significant injury (although this may exclude ''sunburn'').''Victims of electrical burns should always seek medical care.' Remove the victim from the burning area, remembering not to put the rescuer in danger. Remove any burning material from the person. Call 911 or activate the emergency response system in your area if needed. Once the victim is in a safe place, keep the person warm and still. Try to wrap the injured areas in a clean sheet if available. DO NOT use cold water on the victim; this may drop the body temperature and cause hypothermia. Gently clean the wound with lukewarm water. Though butter has been used as a home remedy, do NOT use it on any burn. Remove rings, bracelets, and other potentially constricting articles (edema, or swelling from inflammation may occur and the item may cut into the skin). The burn may be dressed with a topical antibiotic ointment like Bacitracin or Neosporin. Silvadene (silver sulfadiazine) topical is the preferred agent for most burns, and is available over the counter in many locations. If there is concern that the burn is deeper and may be second or third degree in nature, seek medical care. Update tetanus immunization if needed. Remove the chemical from contact with the victim. Identify the chemical that was involved. Contact the Poison Control Center in your area or your local hospital's emergency department. The United States National Poison Hotline is 1-800-222-1222. You will be automatically linked to the nearest poison control center. Many chemical burns may be treated with local wound care. Some chemicals can cause life- and limb-threatening injuries and need emergent intervention. Store the hotline phone number on your cell phone and post it at home and at work. Victims with chemical burns to their eyes should always seek emergency care."

What are causes of bursitis?,"'The three most common causes of bursitis are repetitive motions (for example, repeated throwing of a ball), ''trauma'' (extensive kneeling or hitting your knee on a table), infection, and preexisting rheumatoid conditions.''Trauma causes inflammatory bursitis from repetitive injury or direct impact.''Bursae close to the surface of the skin are the most likely to get infected with bacteria, a condition that is called septic bursitis. The most common bacteria to cause septic bursitis is ''Staphylococcus aureus'' or ''Staphylococcus'' ''epidermis''. People with ''diabetes'', ''alcoholism'', certain kidney conditions, those with suppressed immune systems such as from cortisone medications (steroid treatments), and those with wounds to the skin over a bursa are at higher risk for septic bursitis. About 85% of septic bursitis occurs in men.''People with certain rheumatoid diseases such as ''gout'' and ''pseudogout'' can develop bursitis from crystal deposits. When these crystals form in a bursa, they cause inflammation leading to bursitis.' Chronic bursitis: The most common cause of chronic bursitis is minor trauma that may occur to the shoulder (subdeltoid) bursa from repetitive motion, for example, throwing a baseball. Another example is prepatellar bursitis (in front of the knee) from prolonged or repetitive kneeling on a hard surface to scrub a floor or lay carpet. Acute bursitis: A direct blow (let's say you accidentally bang your knee into a table) can cause blood to leak into the bursa. This causes inflammation with pain as well as swelling."
What are bursitis risk factors?,"'Risk factors for bursitis include repetitive activities, ''gout'', pseudogout, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', trauma, and skin infections.' "
What are bursitis symptoms and signs?,"'Bursitis causes ''pain'' and tenderness around the affected bone or tendon. The bursae sacs may swell, often making movement difficult. The most commonly affected joints are the shoulder, elbow, knee, and foot.''In the shoulder, the subacromial bursa (subdeltoid bursa) separates the supraspinatus tendon from the overlying bone and deltoid muscle. Inflammation of this bursa is usually a result of injury to surrounding structures, most commonly the ''rotator cuff''. This limits the range of motion of the shoulder resulting in an ""''impingement syndrome''."" The condition causes pain in the side or front of the shoulder.''Bursitis of the tip of the elbow, olecranon bursitis, is the most common form of bursitis.''Retrocalcaneal bursitis occurs when the bursa under the Achilles tendon at the back of the heel becomes inflamed. This is commonly caused by local trauma associated with wearing a poorly designed shoe (often high heels) or prolonged ''walking''. It can also occur with Achilles tendonitis.''Bursitis in this part of the body often occurs as an overuse injury in young athletes, ice skaters, and people starting new ''exercise'' programs, including walking or jumping. The pain is usually on the back of the heel and increases with passive extension or resisted flexion.'""Ischiogluteal bursitis causes inflammation of the ischial bursa, which lies between the bottom of the pelvic bone and the overlying gluteus maximus muscle (one side of the buttocks). Inflammation can come from sitting for a long time on a hard surface or from bicycling. Ischiogluteal bursitis has also been called weaver's bottom because it is common from the positioning used in this occupation.""'The iliopsoas bursa is the largest in the body and lies in front of, and deep to, the hip joint. Bursitis here is usually associated with hip problems such as arthritis or injury (especially from ''running'').''The trochanteric bursa, at the outer thigh over the hip, can become inflamed to cause trochanteric bursitis. Trochanteric bursitis is very common and occurs most frequently in overweight, middle-aged women.'   Overhead lifting or reaching activities are uncomfortable. Pain is often worse at night. The shoulder will usually have decreased range of active motion and be tender at specific spots. The pain may increase if the elbow is bent because tension increases over the bursa. This bursa is frequently exposed to direct trauma (bumping your arm) or repeated motions from bending and extending the elbow (while painting, for example). Infection is common in this bursa. Bursitis in front of the kneecap (prepatellar): Swelling on the front of the kneecap can be caused by chronic trauma (as from kneeling) or an acute blow to the knee. Swelling may occur as late as seven to 10 days after a single blow to the area, usually from a fall. Prepatellar bursitis has also been called carpet-layer's knee, housemaid's knee, and clergyman's knee. Pes anserine bursitis: The pes anserine bursa is fan shaped and lies among three of the major tendons at the inner knee.This type of bursitis is most often seen in people with arthritis, especially overweight middle-aged women with osteoarthritis.The pain of anserine bursitis is typically produced when the knee is bent and is particularly troublesome at night. People often seek comfort in bed by sleeping with a pillow between their thighs.The pain can radiate to the inner thigh and mid-calf and usually increases on climbing stairs and at extremes of bending and extending.Pes anserine bursitis also occurs as an overuse or traumatic injury among athletes, particularly long-distance runners. This type of bursitis is most often seen in people with arthritis, especially overweight middle-aged women with osteoarthritis. The pain of anserine bursitis is typically produced when the knee is bent and is particularly troublesome at night. People often seek comfort in bed by sleeping with a pillow between their thighs. The pain can radiate to the inner thigh and mid-calf and usually increases on climbing stairs and at extremes of bending and extending. Pes anserine bursitis also occurs as an overuse or traumatic injury among athletes, particularly long-distance runners. The pain occurs when sitting and walking. There will be tenderness over the pubic bone, which may be made worse by bending and extending the leg. The pain may radiate down the back of the thigh. Direct pressure over the area causes sharp pain. The person may hold the painful buttock elevated when sitting. The pain is worse when person is lying down and the hip is passively bent. The person may have difficulty standing on tiptoe on the affected side. The pain of iliopsoas bursitis radiates down the front and middle areas of the thigh to the knee and is increased when the hip is extended and rotated. Extension of the hip during walking causes pain so the person may limit the stride on the affected side and take a shorter step. There may be tenderness in the groin area. Sometimes a mass may be felt resembling a hernia. The person may also feel numbness or tingling if adjacent nerves are compressed by the inflamed bursa. Trochanteric bursitis causes deep, aching hip pain along the side of the hip that may extend into the buttocks or to the side of the knee. Pain is aggravated by activity, local pressure, or stretching. Pain is often worse at night and can make it difficult to sleep on the involved side."
When should someone seek medical care for bursitis?,"'Because bursitis can be infectious and needs to be treated with antibiotics, it is best to see a doctor the first time you recognize symptoms.''If the pain is not getting better with home care, your doctor may be able to offer some alternatives such as a ''cortisone injection''.''Fever'' is a definite sign to seek immediate medical care because it may signify infection. Heed other warning signs of infection such as constant warmth or redness around the joint or severe tenderness. Skin infections around the area (''cellulitis'') may mean that the bursa is infected as well.' "
What specialists diagnose and treat bursitis?,"'Bursitis is treated by primary care physicians, including family medicine doctors, general practitioners, and internists, as well as orthopedists, physiatrists, and ''rheumatologists''.' "
"What 
exams do health care professionals use to diagnose bursitis?"," History: The doctor will usually take a detailed history about the onset of symptoms and will want to know what movement or activity makes you feel more or less pain. You will need to report other medical problems you may have. Fluid removal: The doctor may remove fluid from the bursa with a needle and send it to the lab for analysis. This analysis will help determine if the bursitis is due to an infection or rheumatoid condition or trauma). Bursitis in the knee and elbow are especially prone to infection. Removal of the fluid might alleviate some of the pain. X-rays: They are usually not helpful, but the doctor may get them if any other disease is suspected such as a fracture or dislocation. MRI and CT scans are obtained only to exclude other causes. Blood testing: The doctor may order blood tests to rule out infection or other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis."
What are bursitis treatments?,"'The doctor will probably recommend home care with P-R-I-C-E-M: protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and medications (discussed below).' "
"Are 
there bursitis home remedies?","'The treatment for bursitis can be remembered with the following memory device: P-R-I-C-E-M.' Protection includes padding especially for bursae close to the surface of the skin on the ankles and knees. Relative rest of the affected area if possible may help symptoms. Choose alternate types of exercise activities that eliminate painful motions. Swimming may help rather than hurt. Ice is very effective in reducing inflammation and pain. Small ice packs, such as packages of frozen vegetables, applied to the area for 10 minutes at least twice a day may help decrease inflammation. Compression and elevation are helpful when it is feasible to compress the area. An elastic bandage can be applied (especially to knees and elbows). Keep the area elevated above the heart to keep blood from pooling there. Medications such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil) can be helpful to reduce inflammation and pain. Consult your doctor before taking these if you are on any blood-thinning medications or have a history of stomach ulcers or kidney disease."
What is the medical treatment for bursitis?,"'If your bursitis is not infectious, the doctor may inject the bursa with a ''corticosteroid'' to reduce inflammation.''If your bursitis is infectious, the bursa will be drained with a needle. The doctor will prescribe antibiotics to be taken in pill form. If the infection is very serious, does not respond to oral antibiotics, or if your immune system is weakened for another reason, you may be admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics. Most causes of infectious bursitis, however, can be managed safely at home. Occasionally, a surgical operation to remove the bursa can be required.'  "
How often is follow-up needed after treatment of bursitis?,"""After you leave the doctor's office, try to change whatever caused the bursitis in the first place. Wear different shoes. Use kneepads when kneeling for activities or work.""'Rest the area and apply ice at least twice a day, keeping the area elevated when possible.''Schedule a follow-up visit with your doctor in one week. If your bursitis is infectious, a follow-up visit in three to four days is appropriate for reevaluation and possible fluid removal.' "
"Is 
there a way to prevent bursitis?","'If a certain activity causes you to develop bursitis, then limit that activity or use protective measures. Use kneepads or cushioning for gardening and scrubbing floors. Workers such as plumbers, roofers, and carpet layers should wear knee protection. Choose more appropriate shoes or cushion the ankles with pads.''You can improve your flexibility and strengthen muscles involved in joint motion through rehabilitative exercise.''Be concerned about muscle tone if you have bursitis that tends to return. A physical rehabilitation program can guide you in the proper exercises to strengthen weak muscles.' "
What is the prognosis for bursitis?,"'Most people respond to therapy in three to four days and can follow up with their doctor in a week. If the bursitis is infectious, however, the area may have to be drained with a needle every three to five days until the infectious fluid does not return.' "
Bursitis pictures, 
What is calcific bursitis?,"'A bursa is a thin fluid-filled sac that reduces friction forces between tissues of the body. Chronic (repeated or long-standing) inflammation of the bursa (''bursitis'') can lead to calcification of the bursa. This is referred to as ""calcific bursitis."" The calcium deposits (calcification) can occur as long as the inflammation is present and remain after it has resolved. Calcific bursitis occurs most commonly at the shoulder (in the bursa adjacent to the ''rotator cuff'' tendons) or hip (in the bursa at the greater trochanter).'  "
What are causes and risk factors for calcific bursitis?,'Calcific bursitis often has no direct cause that is identified and likely occurs in this setting after unnoticed strain of a joint caused local inflammation of the bursa (bursitis). Risk factors for developing calcific bursitis include joint injury (''trauma'') and underlying diseases such as ''ankylosing spondylitis'' and calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate deposition disease (''pseudogout'').' 
What are symptoms and signs of calcific bursitis?,"'Calcific bursitis may not cause any symptoms once the inflammation has subsided. Calcific bursitis typically leads to ''chronic pain'', ''stiffness'', and sometimes limited range of motion of the affected joint with use or when examined.'  "
How do doctors diagnose calcific bursitis?,"'The diagnosis of inflammation of the bursa (bursitis) can be made clinically based on the history and physical findings. Calcific bursitis is diagnosed when viewed with anX-ray test or ''MRI'' scan of the inflamed, painful bursa.' "
What is the treatment of calcific bursitis?,"'Treatment of the inflammation of calcific bursitis can help to prevent further calcification as well as relieve ''pain'' and stiffness. Treatments include medications for inflammation, ''cold'' packs, immobilization, injections of cortisone into the bursa, physical therapy, and occasionally surgery to remove the inflamed bursa and calcium deposit.'  "
What is the prognosis of calcific bursitis?,"'When the inflammation is quieted, the long-term outlook (prognosis) is excellent. Optimal improvement can require physical therapy treatment. The calcium deposit can remain indefinitely and may not cause any problems. Significant calcium deposits can sometimes, however, cause a mechanically abrasive area of tenderness. These deposits that continue to cause symptoms are considered for surgical removal.' "
Is it possible to prevent calcific bursitis?,'The ''prevention'' of calcific bursitis involves avoiding injury and reinjury to joints and treating any underlying medical condition (if present) that might increase the chances for developing calcific bursitis.' 
What is shoulder bursitis?,"'A bursa is a tiny fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body. The plural of ''bursa'' is ''bursae''. There are 160 bursae in the body. The major bursae are located adjacent to the tendons near the large joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees.''Bursitis'' is inflammation of a bursa. Injury or inflammation of a bursa around the shoulder joint causes shoulder bursitis.'  "
What causes shoulder bursitis?,"'A bursa can become inflamed from injury, infection (rare in the shoulder), or an underlying rheumatic condition. Examples include infection of the bursa in front of the knee from a knee scraping on asphalt (septic ''prepatellar bursitis''), inflammation of the elbow bursa from ''gout'' crystals (gouty olecranon bursitis), or injury as subtle as lifting a bag of groceries into the car, which could inflame the shoulder bursa and lead to shoulder bursitis.' "
What are risk factors for shoulder bursitis?,"'Injury or strain to the shoulder joint causes shoulder bursitis. Activities that are common risk factors for shoulder bursitis include throwing a ball, lifting objects overhead, and ''trauma'' from a fall onto the shoulder.' "
What are shoulder bursitis symptoms and signs? How is shoulder bursitis diagnosed?,"'Bursitis is typically identified by localized ''pain'' or swelling, tenderness, and ''pain'' with motion of the tissues in the affected area. X-ray testing can sometimes detect calcifications in the bursa when bursitis has been chronic or recurrent. ''MRI'' scanning (''magnetic resonance imaging'') can also define bursitis. Shoulder bursitis is often accompanied by tendinitis of tendons adjacent to the affected bursa in the shoulder. Shoulder bursitis causes focal tenderness of the inflamed tissues. It can also cause a ""pinching"" pain when the elbow is moved away from the body, referred to as an ""impingement"" sign.'  "
What are treatments for shoulder bursitis?,"""Sometimes shoulder bursitis requires aspiration of the bursa fluid. This procedure involves removal of the fluid with a needle and syringe under sterile conditions and can be performed in the doctor's office. Often the fluid is sent to the laboratory for further analysis. Noninfectious shoulder bursitis can also be treated with an injection of cortisone medication into the swollen bursa. This is typically done at the same time as the aspiration procedure. Physical therapy can be used to aid the recovery from bursitis, especially when it is accompanied by a ""'frozen shoulder''.''Infectious (septic) bursitis, which is uncommon in the shoulder, requires even further evaluation and aggressive treatment. The bursal fluid can be examined in the laboratory to identify the microbes causing the infection. Septic bursitis requires antibiotic therapy, sometimes intravenously. Repeated aspiration of the inflamed fluid may be required. Surgical drainage and removal of the infected bursa sac (bursectomy) may also be necessary. Generally, the adjacent joint functions normally after the surgical ''wound'' heals.'  "
Are there home remedies for shoulder bursitis?,"'Bursitis is initially treated with ice compresses, rest, and anti-inflammatory and pain medications.' "
What is the prognosis for shoulder bursitis?,"'The outlook for shoulder bursitis is generally excellent for a full recovery with shoulder bursitis. If the bursitis is accompanied by scarring around the shoulder joint (''adhesive capsulitis'' or ""''frozen shoulder''""), it can require long-term physical therapy.' "
Is it possible to prevent shoulder bursitis?,"'By avoiding overuse of the shoulder by excessive straining the shoulder and gradual ''exercise'' training, shoulder bursitis can be prevented.'  "
What health care specialties treat shoulder bursitis?,"'Specialists that treat shoulder bursitis include general medicine physicians, including general practitioners, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as orthopedic surgeons, ''rheumatologists'', and sports medicine specialists. Often physical therapists and rehabilitation physicians are involved in the care of shoulder bursitis.' "
What is coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery?,"'According to the American Heart Association, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries are among the most commonly performed major operations.'   CABG surgery is advised for selected groups of patients with significant narrowings and blockages of the heart arteries (coronary artery disease). CABG surgery creates new routes around narrowed and blocked arteries, allowing sufficient blood flow to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle."
What causes a coronary artery disease?,"'Coronary artery disease (''CAD'') occurs when ''atherosclerotic'' plaque (hardening of the arteries) builds up in the wall of the arteries that supply the heart.''The atherosclerotic process causes significant narrowing in one or more coronary arteries. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50 to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand during ''exercise''. The heart muscle in the territory of these arteries becomes starved of oxygen (ischemic).''When a ''blood clot'' (thrombus) forms on top of this plaque, the artery becomes completely blocked causing a heart attack.'""When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90 to 99%, patients often have accelerated angina or angina at rest (unstable angina). Unstable angina can also occur due to intermittent blockage of an artery by a thrombus that eventually is dissolved by the body's own protective clot-dissolving system.""   This plaque is primarily made of cholesterol. Plaque accumulation can be accelerated by smoking, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, and diabetes. Patients are also at higher risk for plaque development if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women), or if they have a positive family history for early heart artery disease. Patients often experience chest pain (angina) when the blood oxygen supply cannot keep up with demand. Up to 25% of patients experience no chest pain at all despite documented lack of adequate blood and oxygen supply. These patients have ""silent"" angina, and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina."
How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"'The resting ''electrocardiogram'' (EKG) is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and can demonstrate signs of oxygen starvation of the heart (ischemia) or heart attack.''If the stress tests do not reveal the diagnosis, greater accuracy can be achieved by adding a nuclear agent (''thallium'' or Cardiolite) intravenously during stress tests. Addition of the nuclear imaging agent allows imaging of the blood flow to different regions of the heart, using an external camera. An area of the heart with reduced blood flow during exercise, but normal blood flow at rest, signifies significant artery narrowing in that region.''Combining echocardiography (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart muscle) with exercise stress testing (stress echocardiography) is also a very accurate technique to detect CAD. When a significant blockage exists, the heart muscle supplied by this artery does not contract as well as the rest of the heart muscle. Stress echocardiography and nuclear stress tests are both at least 80% to 85% accurate in detecting significant coronary artery disease.''When a patient cannot undergo ''exercise stress test'' because of nervous system or joint problems, medications can be injected intravenously to simulate the stress on the heart due to exercise and imaging can be performed with a nuclear camera or ultrasound.''Cardiac catheterization'' with ''angiography'' (coronary arteriography) is the most accurate test to detect coronary artery narrowing. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the openings of the two main heart arteries (left and right). ''Iodine'' contrast, ""dye,"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded.''A newer modality, high speed CT scanning angiography has recently become available. This procedure uses powerful X-ray methods to visualize the arteries to the heart. Its role in the evaluation of CAD is currently being evaluated. For more, please read the CT Scanning Angiography article.' Often, the resting EKG is normal in patients with coronary artery disease and angina. Exercise treadmill tests are useful screening tests for patients with a moderate likelihood of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and a normal resting EKG. These stress tests are about 60 to 70% accurate in diagnosing significant CAD."
How is coronary artery disease (CAD) treated?,"'Medicines used to treat angina reduce the heart muscle demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply. Three commonly used classes of ''drugs'' are the ''nitrates'', ''beta blockers'' and calcium blockers.''Unstable angina is also treated with ''aspirin'' and the intravenous blood thinner ''heparin''. Aspirin prevents clumping of platelets, while heparin prevents blood clotting on the surface of plaques in a critically narrowed artery. When patients continue to have angina despite maximum medications, or when significant ischemia still occurs with exercise testing, coronary arteriography is usually indicated. Data collected during coronary arteriography help doctors decide whether the patient should be considered for ''percutaneous coronary intervention'', or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), whereby a small ''stent'' is used to open up the blockage.''Angioplasty'' can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients. Under X-ray guidance, a wire is advanced from the groin to the coronary artery. A small catheter with a balloon at the end is threaded over the wire to reach the narrowed segment. The balloon is then inflated to push the artery open, and a stent is inserted.' Nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid) is an example of a nitrate. Examples of beta blockers include propranolol (Inderal) and atenolol (Tenormin). Examples of calcium blockers include amlodopine and felodopine. CABG surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients who have failed medical therapy and are not good candidates for angioplasty (PCI). CABG surgery is ideal for patients with multiple narrowings in multiple coronary artery branches, such as is often seen in patients with diabetes. CABG surgery has been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and in patients with significant narrowing of multiple arteries, especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function."
How is CABG surgery done?,"'The CABG procedure\xa0steps are:''The most commonly used vessel for the bypass is the saphenous vein from the leg. Bypass grafting involves sewing the graft vessels to the coronary arteries beyond the narrowing or blockage. The other end of this vein is attached to the aorta. Chest wall arteries, particularly the left internal mammary artery, are now commonly used as bypass grafts. This artery is separated from the chest wall and usually connected to the left anterior descending artery and/or one of its major branches beyond the blockage.''The major advantage of using internal mammary arteries is that they tend to remain open longer than venous grafts. Ten years after CABG surgery, only 66% of vein grafts are open compared to 90% of internal mammary arteries. However, artery grafts are of limited length, and can only be used to bypass diseases located near the beginning (proximal) of the coronary arteries. Using internal mammary arteries may prolong CABG surgery because of the extra time needed to separate them from the chest wall. Therefore, internal mammary arteries may not be used for emergency CABG surgery when time is critical to restore coronary artery blood flow.''CABG surgery takes about four hours to complete.''The average length of stay in the hospital for CABG surgery has been reduced from as long as a week to only three to four days in most patients.''A new advance for many patients is the ability to do CABG without going on cardiopulmonary bypass (""off pump""), with the heart still beating. This may significantly minimize the occasional memory defects and other complications that may be seen after CABG, and is a significant advance.' The cardiac surgeon makes an incision down the middle of the chest and then saws through the breastbone (sternum). This procedure is called a median (middle) sternotomy (cutting of the sternum). The heart is cooled with iced salt water, while a preservative solution is injected into the heart arteries. This process minimizes damage caused by reduced blood flow during surgery and is referred to as ""cardioplegia."" Before bypass surgery can take place, a cardiopulmonary bypass must be established. Plastic tubes are placed in the right atrium to channel venous blood out of the body for passage through a plastic sheeting (membrane oxygenator) in the heart lung machine. The oxygenated blood is then returned to the body. The main aorta is clamped off (cross clamped) during CABG surgery to maintain a bloodless field and to allow bypasses to be connected to the aorta. The aorta is clamped off for about 60 minutes and the body is supported by cardiopulmonary bypass for about 90 minutes. The use of 3 (triple), 4 (quadruple), or 5 (quintuple) bypasses are now routine. At the end of surgery, the sternum is wired together with stainless steel and the chest incision is sewn closed. Plastic tubes (chest tubes) are left in place to allow drainage of any remaining blood from the space around the heart (mediastinum). About 5% of patients require exploration within the first 24 hours because of continued bleeding after surgery. Chest tubes are usually removed the day after surgery. The breathing tube is usually removed shortly after surgery. Patients usually get out of bed and are transferred out of intensive care the day after surgery. Up to 25% of patients develop heart rhythm disturbances within the first three or four days after CABG surgery. These rhythm disturbances are usually temporary atrial fibrillation, and are felt to be related to surgical trauma to the heart. Most of these arrhythmias respond to standard medical therapy that can be weaned one month after surgery. Many young patients can even be discharged home after two days."
How do patients recover after CABG surgery?,"'Sutures'' are removed from the chest prior to discharge and from the leg (if the saphenous vein is used) after 7 to 10 days. Even though smaller leg veins will take over the role of the saphenous vein, a certain degree of swelling (''edema'') in the affected ankle is common.''Exercise stress testing is routinely done four to six weeks after CABG surgery and signals the beginning of a cardiac rehabilitation program.'   Patients are advised to wear elastic support stockings during the day for the first four to six weeks after surgery and to keep their leg elevated when sitting. This swelling usually resolves after about six to eight weeks. Healing of the breastbone takes about six weeks and is the primary limitation in recovering from CABG surgery. Patients are advised not to lift anything more than 10 pounds or perform heavy exertion during this healing period. They are also advised not to drive for the first four weeks to avoid any injury to the chest. Patients can return to normal sexual activity as long as they minimize positions that put significant weight on the chest or upper arms. Return to work usually occurs after the six week recovery, but may be much sooner for non-strenuous employment. Rehabilitation consists of a 12 week program of gradually increasing monitored exercise lasting one hour three times a week. Patients are also counseled about the importance of lifestyle changes to lower their chance of developing further CAD. These includestopping smoking,reducing weight and dietary fat,controlling blood pressure and diabetes, andlowering blood cholesterol levels. stopping smoking, reducing weight and dietary fat, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and lowering blood cholesterol levels."
What are the risks and complications of CABG surgery?,"'Overall mortality related to CABG is 3-4%. During and shortly after CABG surgery, ''heart attacks'' occur in 5 to 10% of patients and are the main cause of death. About 5% of patients require exploration because of bleeding. This second surgery increases the risk of chest infection and lung complications. ''Stroke'' occurs in 1-2%, primarily in elderly patients. Mortality and complications increase with:''Mortality may be higher in women, primarily due to their advanced age at the time of CABG surgery and smaller coronary arteries. Women develop coronary artery disease about 10 years later than men because of hormonal ""protection"" while they still regularly menstruate (although in women with risk factors for coronary artery disease, especially ''smoking'', elevated ''lipids'', and diabetes, the possibility for the development of coronary artery disease at a young age is very real). Women are generally of smaller stature than men, with smaller coronary arteries. These small arteries make CABG surgery technically more difficult and prolonged. The smaller vessels also decrease both short and long-term graft function.' age (older than 70 years),  poor heart muscle function,  disease obstructing the left main coronary artery,  diabetes,  chronic lung disease, and  chronic kidney failure. "
What are the long-term results after CABG surgery?,"'A very small percentage of vein grafts may become blocked within the first two weeks after CABG surgery due to blood clotting.''It has been shown that in CABG patients with elevated ''LDL cholesterol'' (bad cholesterol) levels, use of cholesterol-lowering medications (particularly the statin family of drugs) to lower LDL levels to below 80 will significantly improve long-term graft patency as well as improve survival benefit and heart attack risk.''Patients are also advised about the importance of lifestyle changes to lower their chance of developing further atherosclerosis in their coronary arteries. These include''Frequent monitoring of CABG patients with physiologic testing can identify early problems in grafts. PTCA (angioplasty) with stenting, in addition to aggressive risk factor modification, may significantly limit the need for repeat CABG years later. Repeat CABG surgery is occasionally necessary, but may have a higher risk of complication.' Blood clots form in the grafts usually because of small arteries beyond the insertion site of the graft causing sluggish blood run off. Another 10% of vein grafts close off between two weeks and one year after CABG surgery. Use of aspirin to thin the blood has been shown to reduce these later closings by 50%. Grafts become narrowed after the first five years as cells stick to the inner lining and multiply, causing formation of scar tissue (intimal fibrosis) and actual atherosclerosis. After 10 years, only 2/3 of vein grafts are open and 1/2 of these have at least moderate narrowings. Internal mammary grafts have a much higher (90%) 10 year rate of remaining open. This difference in longevity has caused a shift in surgical practices toward greater use of internal mammary and other arteries as opposed to veins for bypasses. stopping smoking, exercise, reducing weight and dietary fat, as well as controlling blood pressure and diabetes."
How do CABG surgery and angioplasty (PTCA) compare?,"'References: American Heart Association, ""Open-Heart Surgery Statistics""' Ongoing studies are comparing the treatment results of angioplasty (PTCA) versus bypass (CABG surgery) in patients who are candidates for either procedure. Both procedures are very effective in reducing angina symptoms, preventing heart attacks, and reducing death. Many studies have either shown similar benefits or slight advantage to CABG (primarily in severe diabetics). The best choice for an individual patient is best made by their cardiologist, surgeon, and primary doctor."
Introduction,'Gastric bypass surgery combines the creation of a small stomach pouch to restrict food intake and construction of bypasses of the duodenum and other segments of the small intestine to cause malabsorption (decreased ability to absorb calories and nutrients from food).' 
Types of Gastric Bypass Surgery,"'Gastric bypass surgery that causes malabsorption and restricts food intake produces more ''weight loss'' than restriction operations like ''gastric banding'', which only decrease food intake. People who have bypass surgery generally lose two-thirds of their excess weight within two years.' Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RGB): This operation is the most common gastric bypass surgery performed in the U.S. First, a small stomach pouch is created by stapling part of the stomach together or by vertical banding. This limits how much food you can eat. Next, a Y-shaped section of the small intestine is attached to the pouch to allow food to bypass the duodenum as well as the first portion of the jejunum. This causes reduced calorie and nutrient absorption. This procedure can now be done with a laparoscope (a thin telescope-like instrument for viewing inside the abdomen) in some people. This involves using small incisions and generally has a more rapid recovery time.
 Extensive gastric bypass (biliopancreatic diversion): In this more complicated gastric bypass operation, the lower portion of the stomach is removed. The small pouch that remains is connected directly to the final segment of the small intestine, thus completely bypassing both the duodenum and jejunum. Although this procedure successfully promotes weight loss, it is not as widely used because of the high risk for nutritional deficiencies."
Risks of Gastric Bypass Surgery,"'People who undergo gastric bypass surgery are at risk for: ''Gastric bypass surgery also may cause ""dumping syndrome,"" whereby stomach contents move too rapidly through the small intestine. Symptoms include ''nausea'',  ''weakness'', ''sweating'', faintness, and, occasionally, ''diarrhea'' after eating, as well as the inability to eat sweets without becoming extremely weak. ''Gallstones'' can occur in response to rapid ''weight loss''. They can be dissolved with medication taken after the surgery. ' Pouch stretching (stomach gets bigger overtime, stretching back to its 
	original size). Band erosion (the band closing off part of the stomach disintegrates). Breakdown of staple lines (band and staples fall apart, reversing the 
	procedure). Leakage of stomach contents into the abdomen (this is dangerous because 
	the acid can eat away other organs).  Nutritional deficiencies causing health problems."
Complications From Nutritional Deficiencies,"'The limited absorption of ''vitamin B-12'' and iron can cause ''anemia''. The lack of calcium absorption can cause ''osteoporosis'' and metabolic bone disease. People who undergo this procedure are required to take nutritional ''supplements'' that usually prevent these deficiencies. ''The more extensive the gastric bypass surgery, the greater the risk for complications and nutritional deficiencies. People who undergo extensive bypasses of the normal digestive process require not only close monitoring, but also lifelong use of special foods and medications. ''WebMD Medical Reference' "
