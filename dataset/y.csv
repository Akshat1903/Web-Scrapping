What is yaws? What are symptoms of yaws?,"'Yaws is a common chronic infectious disease that occurs mainly in warm humid regions such as the tropical areas of Africa, Asia, South and Central Americas, plus the Pacific Islands. The disease has many names (for example, ''pian'', ''parangi'', ''paru'', ''frambesia tropica''). Yaws usually features lesions that appear as ''bumps on the skin'' of the face, hands, ''feet'', and genital area. The disease most often starts as a single lesion that becomes slightly elevated, develops a crust that is shed, leaving a base that resembles the texture of a raspberry or strawberry. This primary lesion is termed the ''mother yaw'' (also termed ''buba'', ''buba madre'', or ''primary frambesioma''). Secondary lesions, termed ''daughter yaws'', develop in about six to 16 weeks after the primary lesion. Almost all cases of yaws begin in children under 15 years of age, with the peak incidence in 6- to 10-year-old children. The incidence is about the same in males and females. Yaws is a member of the treponematoses, diseases caused by spiral bacteria in the genus ''Treponema''; besides yaws, the disease include endemic ''syphilis'' (bejel) and pinta. Of these three diseases, yaws is the most common.'  "
What causes yaws?,"'Yaws is caused by a particular bacterium called a spirochete (a spiral-shaped type of bacteria). The bacterium is scientifically referred to as ''Treponema pertenue''. This organism is considered by some investigators to be a subspecies of ''T. pallidum'', the organism that causes ''syphilis'' (a systemic sexually-transmitted disease). Other investigators consider it to be a closely related but separate species of Treponema. ''T. carateum'', the cause of ''pinta'' (a ''skin infection'' with bluish-black spots), is also closely related to ''T. pertenue''.  The history of yaws is unclear; the first possible mention of the disease is considered to be in the Old Testament. D. Bruce and D. Nabarro discovered the spirochete causing yaws (''T. pertenue'') in 1905.' "
What are risk factors for yaws?,"'The main risk factor for yaws is direct contact with another person (nonsexual contact) that has yaws lesions on the skin or being a member of the community where yaws infections are endemic. The bacteria that cause yaws only infect humans if there is a break (cut) or ''abrasion'' of the skin. Consequently, having a break (cut) or abrasion of the skin while in a geographic area where yaws is endemic is another risk factor for yaws. Poor hygiene and crowded conditions are also risk factors.' "
How does yaws begin and spread?,"'Yaws begins when ''T. pertenue'' penetrates the skin at a site where skin was scraped, cut, or otherwise compromised. In most cases, ''T. pertenue'' is transmitted from person to person. At the entrance site, a painless small  lesion, or bump, arises within two to eight weeks and grows. The initial lesion is referred to as the mother yaw. The ''lymph nodes'' in the area of the mother yaw are often swollen (regional ''lymphadenopathy''). When the mother yaw heals, a light-colored ''scar'' remains.' "
Why is this disease called yaws?,"'The term ''yaws'' is thought to be of Caribbean origin. In the language of the Carib Indian people, ''yaya'' is the word for ""a sore.""   ''Alternatively, the disease term yaws may have come from Africa where the word ''yaw'' may have meant ""a berry."" Because the lesions of yaws look like berries, the disease is also called ''frambesia'' (or ''frambesia tropica'') from the French ''framboise'', meaning ""raspberry."" Other older names for yaws include ''granuloma tropicum'','' polypapilloma tropicum'', and ''thymiosis''.' "
What are developmental stages in the course of yaws?,"'Yaws has four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. The primary stage is the appearance of the mother yaw. Patients with yaws develop recurring (""secondary"") lesions and more ''swollen lymph nodes''. This represents the secondary stage. These secondary lesions with ''rashes'' may be painless like the mother yaw or they may be filled with pus, burst, and form ulcers. The affected child often experiences malaise (feels poorly) and ''anorexia'' (''loss of appetite''). The latent stage occurs when the disease symptoms abate, although an occasional lesion may occur. In the tertiary stage, yaws can destroy areas of the skin, bones, and joints and deform them with pains in the joints and/or bones. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet tend to become thickened and painful (crab yaws).' "
What types of specialists treat yaws?,"'Usually, clinics or traveling doctors treat yaws because the populations that get the disease are usually the poor who have no medical care. However, specialists like infectious-disease doctors, travel-medicine specialists, ''rheumatologists'', dermatologists and others, depending on the extent of the disease, may be consulted if the patient is treated in more modern facilities.' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose yaws?,"'Yaws is suspected in any child who has the characteristic clinical features and lives in an area where the disease is common. With increasing travel, a child once in the tropics may carry the disease to a more temperate area of the world.''Laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is by blood serum tests (for example, RPR or rapid plasma reagent test, VDRL test or ''venereal disease'' research laboratory test, TPHA or Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test, FTA-ABS or fluorescent treponema antibody absorption), but most frequently the diagnosis is made on clinical findings. The reason that ''T. pallidum'' serum tests are used is that the spirochetes are so closely related, they have similar antigens on their surfaces so that ''T. pallidum'' and ''T. pertenue'' are cross-reactive (detected by the same serological tests). Special (dark-field) examination under the microscope in which technicians can actually see the spirochete bacterium is also used to help diagnose yaws. The lesions (both the mother yaw and the secondary lesions) usually have many ''T. pertenue'' organisms that can be visualized with dark-field examination of lesion scrapings. On a typical Gram stain (a procedure for identifying bacteria when viewed microscopically), the organisms are considered to be Gram-negative but stain so poorly and are so small and thin, the Gram stain often does not reveal the organisms; hence the use of the dark-field examination. Other tests that detect spirochetes such as a silver stain or electron microscopy are used mainly by research scientists. ''PCR'' tests can confirm yaws by detecting genetic material from organisms in samples from skin lesions.' "
What is the treatment for yaws?,"'Treatment of yaws is simple and highly effective. ''Penicillin G benzathine'' given IM (intramuscularly) can cure the disease in the primary, secondary, and usually in the latent phase. ''Penicillin V'' can be given orally for about seven to 10 days, but this route is less reliable than direct injection. Anyone ''allergic'' to penicillin can be treated with another antibiotic, usually ''erythromycin'', ''doxycycline'', or ''tetracycline''. Azithromycin (in a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg or the maximum 2 g) is the choice that the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends because of the ease of administration. Tertiary yaws, which occurs in about 10% of untreated patients five to 10 years after initially getting the disease, is not ''contagious''. The tertiary yaws patient is treated for the symptoms of the chronic conditions (altered or destroyed areas in bones, joints, cartilage, and soft tissues) that develop as complications of the infection. There is no ''vaccine'' for yaws.' "
Why is yaws a serious problem?,"'Yaws is a major public-health threat in the tropics. Tropical regions in Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania are all at continuing risk for yaws. A high percentage of children in such areas can be infected. Transmission of the disease is facilitated by overcrowding and poor hygiene, and yaws tends to be more prevalent in poor areas. In addition to making young children sick, approximately 10% of untreated children develop into young adults with deformities that are severely debilitating in the tertiary-yaws phase. For example, some patients develop destructive ulcerations of the nasopharynx, palate and nose (termed gangosa), painful skeletal deformities, especially in the legs (termed saber shins), and other soft-tissue changes (gummas, inflammatory cell infiltration).''Yaws can be completely eradicated from an area by giving penicillin or another appropriate antibiotics to everyone in the population. This may, unfortunately, cost more than a poor country can afford. From 1950-1970, a worldwide effort to eradicate yaws was begun and made progress in reducing the approximately 50 million worldwide cases; after its end, yaws has seen a resurgence. In the 1990s, attempts to eliminate yaws started again, with limited success as the effort is not worldwide or coordinated but done by individual countries. The WHO (World Health Organization) in 2007 reported about 2.5 million cases worldwide but freely admits their data is faulty, as most countries do not calculate the prevalence of yaws. WHO estimates that about 460,000 new cases of yaws occur each year.' "
What is the prognosis of yaws?,"'The prognosis of yaws depends upon effective treatment so that the patient will not develop complications. If appropriate treatment of yaws takes place before tertiary yaws develops, the prognosis for a possible cure with little or no complications is good. However, if tertiary yaws develops, the prognosis is worsened depending upon the severity of  complications.' "
Is it possible to prevent yaws?,"'There is no vaccine available to prevent yaws. However, the WHO has established a yaws eradication strategy also referred to as the Morges strategy by which the organization has established a goal of eradicating yaws by about 2020. Because this disease is spread by person-to-person transfer and has no animal reservoir, the WHO considers this a realistic goal. Currently, for individuals, ''prevention'' is based on interrupting the transmission of the disease from person to person by practicing good hygiene and by early diagnosis and rapid appropriate treatment with azithromycin to prevent spread in the community.' "
What is a vaginal yeast infection?,"'A vaginal yeast infection is an infection caused by yeast (a type of fungus). Vaginal yeast infection is sometimes referred to as yeast ''vaginitis'', Candidal ''vaginitis'', or Candidal vulvovaginitis. The scientific name for the yeast that causes vaginitis is ''Candida''. Over 90% of vaginal yeast infections are caused by the species known as ''Candida albicans''. Other ''Candida'' species make up the remainder of yeast infections.''Candida'' species can be present in healthy women in the vagina without causing any symptoms. In fact, it is estimated that 20% to 50% of women have ''Candida'' already present in the vagina. For an infection to occur, the normal balance of yeast and bacteria is disturbed, allowing overgrowth of the yeast. While yeast can be spread by sexual contact, vaginal yeast infection is not considered to be a sexually-transmitted disease because it can also occur in women who are not sexually active, due to the fact that yeast can be present in the vagina of healthy women.''Vaginal yeast infections are very common, affecting up to 75% of women at some point in life.' "
Signs and symptoms: How do I know if I have a vaginal yeast infection?,"'Symptoms can include:''The discharge has been described as having a cottage-cheese-like consistency.''Other symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection include:'   a vaginal discharge that is typically thick, odorless, and whitish-gray in color. An intense itching of the vaginal or genital area Irritation and burning Pain during sexual intercourse Pain or burning during urination Redness, irritation, or soreness of the vagina or vulva in women; swelling of the vagina"
What causes a vaginal yeast infection?,"'Vaginal yeast infections occur when new yeast is introduced into the vaginal area, or when there is an increase in the quantity of yeast already present in the vagina relative to the quantity of normal bacteria. For example, when the normal, protective bacteria are eradicated by antibiotics (taken to treat a urinary tract, respiratory, or other types of infection) or by immunosuppressive ''drugs'', the yeast can multiply, invade tissues, and cause irritation of the lining of the vagina (vaginitis).''Vaginal yeast infections can also occur as a result of injury to the inner vagina, such as after ''chemotherapy''. Also, women with suppressed immune systems (for example, those taking cortisone-related medications such as ''prednisone'') develop vaginal yeast infections more frequently than women with normal immunity.''Other conditions that may predispose women to developing vaginal yeast infections include'""The use of douches or perfumed vaginal hygiene sprays may also increase a woman's risk of developing a vaginal yeast infection.""'A vaginal yeast infection is not considered to be a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (STD), since ''Candida'' may be present in the normal vagina, and the condition does occur in celibate women.''However, it is possible for men to develop symptoms of skin irritation of the penis from a yeast infection after sexual intercourse with an infected partner, although this is not always the case.'   diabetes, pregnancy, and taking oral contraceptives."
What may increase my risk of getting a vaginal yeast infection?,"'Women who have conditions that result in decreased immune function are more likely than others to develop yeast infections. These include women with ''cancer'' or receiving ''cancer'' chemotherapy, those with ''diabetes'', and women taking steroid medications.''Pregnant'' women and women taking oral contraceptives are also at increased risk.''Taking antibiotics for any reason can alter the normal bacterial populations in the vagina and predispose to the overgrowth of yeast.''Taking steps to reduce moisture in the genital area can reduce the chances of developing a yeast infection. Wearing cotton underwear or underwear with a cotton crotch, wearing loose-fitting pants, and avoiding prolonged wearing of wet workout gear or bathing suits are all measures that can help control moisture, and may help reduce the chance of getting a yeast infection.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat yeast infections?,"'Primary care practitioners, including family practice physicians, internists, and pediatricians, may all treat yeast infections. In women, a gynecologist may also treat yeast infections.' "
How is a vaginal yeast infection diagnosed?,"'Even though the signs and symptoms of yeast infection may point to the cause, ''vaginal itching'' and discharge can be caused by other conditions including ''bacterial vaginosis'' and ''Trichomonas'' infections. To most accurately make the diagnosis, a sample of the discharge is tested in the laboratory, either by culture or by direct examination under a microscope, to identify the yeast organisms and to help rule out other causes such as bacterial vaginosis or sexually-transmitted diseases.' "
What home remedies can be used for the treatment of vaginal yeast infection?,"'Yeast infection is treated using antifungal drugs. Both prescription and ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) remedies are available that are effective in treating vaginal yeast infections. Nonprescription drugs are the best home remedy for yeast infections, and they can cure most yeast infections. However, homeopathic methods have not been adequately studied for doctors and other health care professionals to recommend them, and anti-''itch'' medications treat only the itching symptoms, but do not treat the underlying cause (yeast infection).'  "
What over-the-counter  (OTC) medications are used for the treatment of vaginal yeast infection?,"'Topical antibiotic (antifungal) treatments (applied directly to the affected area) are available without a prescription. These include vaginal creams, tablets, or suppositories. Regimens vary according to the length of treatment and are typically 1- or 3-day regimens. Recurrent infections may require even longer courses of topical treatment. These topical treatments relieve symptoms and eradicate evidence of the infection in up to 90% of those who complete treatment.''Examples of over-the-counter drugs for yeast infections include:'   clotrimazole (Gyne-Lotrimin, Mycelex) miconazole (Micatin, Monistat) terconazole (Terazol)"
When are prescription medications used for the treatment of vaginal yeast infection?,"'Oral prescription medications, taken in pill or tablet form, can be used to treat recurrent yeast infections or infections that do not respond to topical treatment. ''Fluconazole'' (''Diflucan'') is typically used as the first-choice oral antifungal medicine.''Fluconazole also may be taken as weekly or monthly maintenance for women who have recurrent yeast infections, but it is first necessary to prove by culture that recurrent infections are occurring.''Oral antifungal medications should not be used by pregnant women.''Oral medications also have more side effects, including'   nausea, headache, and abdominal pain, than topical medicines."
What is the treatment for a vaginal yeast infection during pregnancy?,'Yeast infections are common during pregnancy. Pregnant women who develop signs of a yeast infection should see a health care professional. He or she can recommend medications and treatments that are safe during pregnancy. Oral antifungal medications are not recommended for use during some states of pregnancy.' 
Can a man get a yeast infection from his sexual partner?,"'Most experts do not consider yeast infection to be a sexually-transmitted disease, but cases of irritation and itching of the penis in men have been reported after sexual contact with a woman with a yeast infection, so it is possible for an infected woman to spread the infection to her male sex partner. Treatment of male sexual partners is not considered necessary unless the man develops symptoms.'  "
What are the symptoms of a yeast infection in men?,"'Symptoms in men may include itching, burning, and pain at the tip of the penis. Discomfort during urination can also occur. The area may appear reddened or irritated. Symptoms may resemble those of other diseases, including some sexually-transmitted infections (''STDs''), so testing should always be carried out to determine the cause of symptoms in men.' "
What is the treatment for yeast infection in men?,"'Treatment for men, like for women, is based upon antifungal medications. These may be applied as topical creams or taken by mouth in pill or tablet form.' "
How can vaginal yeast infections be prevented?,"'Because yeast can be present normally in the vagina of healthy women, not all yeast infections can be prevented. However, it is possible to take preventive measures that may reduce your risk of getting a yeast infection. These include always cleaning the genital area from front to back and changing out of wet bathing suits or damp clothes as soon as possible. Wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear can help reduce moisture and prevent yeast infections. Since chemical irritants can influence the balance of bacteria in the vagina, avoiding products with potential irritants like douches or scented tampons can also help. Regular baths or showers are an adequate way to cleanse the vagina, and ''douching'' is not recommended and may actually increase your risk of yeast infection.''Some evidence shows that consumption of foods with ''probiotics'' (healthy bacteria that are normally found in the body) like ''probiotic''-containing yogurt may help prevent yeast infections.'  "
What about recurrent yeast infections?,"'A recurrent yeast infection occurs when a woman has four or more infections in one year that are not related to antibiotic use. Recurrent yeast infections may be related to an underlying medical condition such as impaired immunity and may require more aggressive treatment. This can include longer courses of topical treatments, oral medications, or a combination of the two.' "
How can you protect yourself from contracting a yeast infection from your sexual partner?,"'Condoms'' may help prevent transmission of a yeast infection from women to men, but they are not completely effective since there may be contact with areas of the body not covered by the ''condom''.''Avoiding intercourse when a woman has symptoms of a yeast infection is the best way to prevent spreading of the infection.' "
"What are yeast infections and diaper rash in infants, babies, toddlers, and children?","'Yeast infections are infections by fungi (yeast) predominantly of the genus ''Candida'', species ''albicans '""that\xa0may, depending on the health of an individual's immune system, cause superficial infections of\xa0mucocutaneous disease like ""'thrush'', to life-threatening invasive infections.\xa0''Diaper rash'' is a term used to describe ''rashes'' that occur due to wearing a ''diaper'' (here confined to those\xa0worn by ''babies'',\xa0infants, toddlers, and children up to about age 2. Peak incidence in ''diaper rash'' is ages 9-12 months.' "
What is the difference between a yeast infection and diaper rash?,"'Diaper ''rash'' lasting about 3 or more days may be caused by ''Candida ''in about 45%-75% of all diaper\xa0''rashes'' in infants, babies, toddlers, and kids that wear diapers, and is considered Candidal ''diaper dermatitis''\xa0or superficial mucocutaneous fungal infection. Consequently, a superficial ''yeast infection'' and diaper ''rash''\xa0can be the same infection in many infants, babies, toddlers, and children.''\xa0' "
How can you tell if it's a yeast infection or diaper rash?,"'If yeast cells are seen microscopically in diaper rash skin samples or in cultures, the rash is likely due to the fungi; if fungi is not found or cultured, the diaper rash probably has another cause.''\xa0' "
What are the differences in the symptoms and signs of a yeast infection vs. diaper rash?,"'If diaper rash is caused by yeast. There are no significant differences in the signs and symptoms of yeast infections and diaper rash; however, diaper rash caused by yeast is reddish and macerated skin that is painful when touched or rubbed against the diaper, and may extend\xa0past the diaper and include the genitals. About 75% of female babies/young girls may develop vaginal\xa0yeast infections (vulvovaginal ''candidiasis'').' "
What are the differences in the causes of yeast infections and diaper rash?,"'The main cause of most yeast infections are fungi in the genus ''Candida''. Although this genus causes about\xa045%-75% of all diaper rashes, some diaper rashes are caused by:'  Skin overhydration Skin maceration Skin with prolonged contact with urine and feces Diaper soaps 3 or more diarrheal stools per day Biotin deficiency Contact dermatitis Allergic reactions"
What exams or tests diagnose yeast infections and diaper rash?,"'Skin scrapings or biopsy material can be cultured or examined with a microscope after potassium\xa0hydroxide treatment that reveals the fungi, but is seldom used to diagnose diaper rash. Usually, observing\xa0a ''yeast infection'' and/or diaper rash is all that is needed.\xa0' "
What are the treatments for yeast infections and diaper rash?,"'Check with your pediatrician for their recommendations.'  Creams that contain zinc oxide are the first treatments for almost all diaper rash causes.  If yeast are the causes of infection/diaper rash, antifungal treatment (for example, nystatin cream and others) may be used. One percent hydrocortisone cream may reduce discomfort and inflammation.  There are many over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medications, creams and ointments available."
Can yeast infections or diaper rash be treated at home with natural remedies?," Changing diapers more often and keeping the diaper area clean and dry helps prevent all causes of diaper rash, including yeast.  The chance of a yeast infection decreases when you allow some time for the child to be without a diaper, for example, lying the baby on a dry towel.  Do not use diapers that fit too tightly against the skin.  Over-the-counter home remedies are available, to treat yeast infections, for example, Desitin, A+D ointment, Triple Paste, and Vaseline for both prevention and treatment.  Check with the child’s doctor before using any product on infants, babies, toddlers, and children for yeast infections and diaper rash.  Severe diaper rash and/or yeast infections usually require additional treatments that may include systemic antifungals and even hospitalization."
"Can yeast infections or diaper rashes be dangerous to infants, babies, toddlers, and children?"," In general, most diaper rashes caused by yeast are not dangerous. The exceptions are those individuals; who are immunocompromised because yeast may proliferate and become systemic.  Severe yeast infections and/or diaper rash may lead to skin breaks that allow other organisms to infect the person."
Can yeast infections and diaper rash be cured?,'Yes. Most yeast infections and diaper rash can be cured. However; bad or severe yeast infections in munocompromised individuals may be difficult to cure.' 
What is a yeast infection? What is bacterial vaginosis?,"'A ''yeast infection'' is an infection with any type of yeast. In women, vaginal yeast infections are common. This article will focus on the similarities and differences between vaginal yeast infections and ''bacterial vaginosis'' (BV), another condition of the vagina that causes ''vaginal discharge''.' "
What the causes and risk factors of a yeast infection and bacterial vaginosis?,"'A vaginal ''yeast infection'' usually occurs when the normal balance of yeast and bacteria in the vagina is altered, allowing excessive growth of the yeast. The yeast known as ''Candida'' is the main cause of vaginal yeast infections. Vaginal ''Candidiasis'' is another name for this infection. Suppression of immune function can increase the likelihood of developing yeast infections. Similarly, an abnormal overgrowth or imbalance of the bacteria that are normally present in the vagina cause ''bacterial vaginosis''. BV is not a true infection but rather a disruption in the balance of normal bacteria. BV was formerly referred to as ''Gardnerella ''vaginitis'', because people believed that ''Gardnerella'' bacteria were responsible for the condition.''Risk factors for both BV and ''yeast infection'' can include recent antibiotic use. Other risk factors for a ''yeast infection'' include'""A number of factors can increase a woman's risk of BV, including"" high estrogen levels, pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, and suppression of the immune system. multiple or new sex partners, IUD use, vaginal douching, and cigarette smoking."
What are the signs and symptoms of yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis?,"'BV often does not cause specific symptoms. When it does cause symptoms, both BV and yeast infections cause ''vaginal discharge''. With a yeast infection, the discharge is white-gray, thick, and often having the consistency of cottage cheese. Other symptoms of yeast infections include''The discharge typically seen with BV is thinner and grayish-white in color. BV also can cause ''vaginal odor'' and sometimes ''pain'' or irritation.'  intense itching, vaginal burning or irritation, painful intercourse, and pain or burning during urination."
What exams do doctors use to diagnose a yeast infection and bacterial vaginosis?,'Doctors diagnose both yeast infection and BV by examination of a sample of the vaginal discharge in the laboratory. There is also a whiff test for BV that involves testing the vaginal discharge with a chemical that produces a characteristic odor when BV is present.' 
What are treatments and home remedies for yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis?,"'There are no home remedies that can cure either a yeast infection or BV. Prescription and ''over-the-counter'' antifungals (for example, ''miconazole'' and ''fluconazole'') are the most common treatments of yeast infections. Antibiotics (for example, ''metronidazole'' and ''clindamycin'') are the treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis conditions.' "
What the prognosis of a yeast infection and bacterial vaginosis?,"'Symptoms of both a BV and yeast infection typically resolve once appropriate treatment starts. In both cases, recurrence of the yeast infection or repeat bouts of BV are common. However, they typically do not produce long-term complications.' "
Is it possible to prevent yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis?,"'Careful attention to hygiene may help prevent some yeast infections, as well as changing out of wet bathing suits or damp clothes as soon as possible. Loose-fitting cotton underwear decreases moisture in the genital area and may help prevent yeast infections. Avoidance of vaginal ''douching'"" can also help prevent both conditions. Reducing certain risk factors, such as limiting the number of sex partners and taking all medications as directed when being treated for bacterial vaginosis, can also help reduce a woman's risk of developing bacterial vaginosis. However, it is not possible to completely prevent either condition."" "
What is a yeast infection? What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?,"'A ''yeast infection'' is an infection with any type of yeast, but people commonly use the term to refer to vaginal yeast infections in women. A yeast known as ''Candida albicans'' typically causes vaginal yeast infections. Vaginal yeast infections are also referred to as vaginal ''Candidiasis''. In contrast, a ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'') is not an infection of the vagina but of the urinary tract (the lower urinary tract is made up of the urethra and bladder). Bacteria are the main cause of ''UTIs'', and the most common bacterial cause of a ''UTI'' is ''E. coli''.' "
How do the causes and risk factors of a yeast infection differ from the causes of a UTI?,"'Typically,UTIs occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract at the urethra. This can happen during sexual intercourse in women or due to improper wiping after a bowel movement. A vaginal ''yeast infection'' usually occurs when something alters the normal balance of yeast and bacteria in the vagina, allowing excessive growth of the yeast. Suppression of immune function can increase the likelihood of developing both UTIs and yeast infections. Antibiotic use, ''diabetes'', and impaired immune systems are all possible causes of a yeast infection.' "
Are UTIs and yeast infections contagious?,"'It is possible for a woman to transmit a yeast infection to a male sex partner, even though yeast infection is not considered to be a  ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD''). Yeast infections can occur in women who are not sexually active. UTIs are  not ''contagious''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of yeast infections and UTIs?,"'The most common symptoms of a ''UTI'' include''A mild ''fever'' may be present. Yeast infections are characterized by''Vaginal or vulvar swelling, redness, and soreness may be present.' pain with urination (dysuria), frequent urination, feeling an urgent need to urinate, blood in the urine, and cloudy urine or pus visible in the urine. intense itching, a thick white-gray vaginal discharge  that may resemble cottage cheese, vaginal burning or irritation, painful intercourse, and pain or burning during urination."
What exams do doctors use to diagnose a yeast infection and a UTI?,'Urine tests diagnose a UTI. Abnormalities can appear on a dipstick ''urinalysis'' test that suggest a UTI is present. Sometimes medical professionals take a culture of the urine to determine the type of bacteria causing the infection. A physical exam and an examination of a sample of the vaginal discharge in the laboratory can confirm the presence of a yeast infection.' 
What are treatments and home remedies for yeast infections and UTIs?,"'There are no home remedies that can cure either a yeast infection or a UTI. Prescription antibiotics are required for the treatment of a UTI, and antifungal ''drugs'' are required for treatment of a yeast infection. Some antifungal drugs are available over the counter. Depending on the frequency and duration of yeast infections, your provider will choose different therapies and lengths of treatment.' "
What is the prognosis and duration of a UTI compared to a yeast infection?,"'Both a UTI and yeast infection should resolve rapidly once appropriate treatment has begun. With both conditions, repeat infections or recurrences are common, but long-term complications are very rare.' "
Is it possible to prevent UTIs and yeast infections?,"'Careful attention to hygiene may help prevent some UTIs. This includes always cleaning the genital area from front to back. This practice can also help prevent yeast infections, as well as changing out of wet bathing suits or damp clothes as soon as possible. Loose-fitting cotton underwear can help reduce moisture in the genital area and may help prevent yeast infections. Avoiding products with potential irritants like douches or scented tampons can also help prevent yeast infections. However, it is not possible to completely prevent either condition from developing.' "
What are STDs?,"'STDs'', also termed ''sexually transmitted diseases'', are infections that are mainly transmitted to others during direct sexual contact (genital, anal and/or oral); a few types may be contracted by nonsexual means like needle sticks (for example, ''hepatitis B'', ''AIDS'').' "
What is a yeast infection?,"'A ''yeast infection'' is the invasion and multiplication of a fungus (yeast) in or on the body. Yeast infections are not usually transmitted person to person and are not considered to be an ''STD''. There are three types of yeast infections: \xa0Vaginal ''candidiasis'', ''Thrush'' (oral and ''esophagus'') and Invasive. This article will emphasize the vaginal (genital) type vs ''STDs''.' "
What yeast infections feel like STDs?,"'In women, a vaginal ''yeast infection'' may mimic STDs while in men, a yeast infection of the urethra and/or foreskin may feel like an STD.' "
Which symptoms and signs of yeast infections are similar to STDs?,"'Symptoms of a yeast infection (''itching'', irritation and a thick discharge) that may be similar to the symptoms of STDs.'  Trichomoniasis Herpes Genital warts Gonorrhea Chlamydia"
How do you get a yeast infection or an STD?," Most yeast infections occur when yeast, (Candida albicans, mainly) that are normally present on the body, develop conditions that allow the yeast to proliferate and produce symptoms. STDs are mainly transmitted person to person through sexual contact and occasionally by contaminated items like needles. "
What causes yeast infections vs. STDs?,"'The cause of yeast infections in men and women is most commonly Candida albicans. Women are more likely to get yeast infections (vaginal yeast infections) and develop symptoms.''In contrast, there are multiple causes for STDs:''Some diseases are listed as being STDs while other listings suggest they are incidentally transmitted by sexual contacts; for example, ''scabies'', ''bacterial vaginosis'', ''Molluscum contagiosum'' and others.\xa0'  Trichomoniasis: nematode Trichomonas vaginalis Herpes: Herpes virus Genital warts Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Gonorrhea: Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria  Chlamydia: Chlamydia species of intracellular bacteria HIV/AIDS virus Syphilis: Treponema pallidum bacteria Hepatitis viruses Chancroid: Haemophilus ducreyi bacteria Pubic lice: lice insect"
What tests diagnose yeast infections and STDs?,"'Tests to diagnose yeast infections include microscopic visualization of the yeast and/or culture of the fungi. However, blood tests or culture swabs for STDs are often done to prove or diagnose if an individual has an STD.' "
What is the treatment for yeast infections and STDs?,"   The treatment for yeast infections are usually over-the-counter (OTC) creams, ointments or suppositories containing antifungal medication like miconazole or fluconazole in women and mainly creams for men. Treatment for STDs vary depending on the cause of the STD (for example, antivirals for some and antibiotics for other STDs)."
Can condoms protect against yeast infections and STDs?,"'Because most yeast infections are not transmitted person to person, there is little evidence that a ''condom'' can protect against yeast infections. However, ''condoms'' have a good chance to prevent some STDs (estimated to be about 85-98% effective).' "
How long does it take for yeast infections and STDs to heal and cure?," Mild yeast infections may clear in about 3 days. More severe infections may take 1-2 weeks. Almost all yeast infections can be cured. In contrast, STDs time of infection and cure potential vary widely; some, depending on the cause, may last a lifetime and never be cured."
Are there home kits to test for a yeast infection or STD?,"'There are home kits to test for yeast infection (for example, ''Monistat'' Vaginal Health Test). Also, there are separate STD test kits for men and women that claim to be able to detect seven common STDs (for example, Everlywell STD for men).\xa0' "
Are there free or pay for clinics to get tested for yeast infections and STDs?, Free clinics in your area that can test or diagnose yeast vs STDs infections may be located by contacting your local Community Health Center or simply by going to the internet and searching for free clinics in your area. Almost all pay clinics and urgent care centers can test you for yeast infections and STDs. 
What is thrush?,"'Thrush (oropharyngeal candidiasis) is a medical condition in which a yeast-shaped fungus called ''Candida albicans'' (the older and less often used name for ''Candida'' is ''Monilia'') overgrows in the mouth and throat. ''C. albicans '""is normally present in the mouth, digestive tract, and skin of most healthy people. The immune system and the body's normal bacteria usually keep ""'Candida'' in balance. When this balance is interrupted, it can result in an overgrowth of the ''Candida'' fungus, causing thrush, a ''yeast infection'' of the mouth or throat (esophageal candidiasis).''Thrush infection (oral ''yeast infection'') is not the same as a vaginal yeast infection (also called ''moniliasis''). However, the ''Candida'' fungus also causes ''diaper rash'', but ''diaper rash'"" occurs on a child's rear end, genitals, and inner thighs, while ""'oral thrush'' occurs in the mouth and throat. Adults may get candidal infections in areas of overlapping skin, such as underneath breasts or in skin folds like creases in skin due to fatty tissue.'  "
What causes thrush?,"'An overgrowth of the ''Candida'' species of fungus in the mouth or throat is what causes an oral yeast infection. This overgrowth may be triggered to occur when the person experiences changes such as illness, pregnancy, new medications, or changes in the immune system.''Thrush in infants and newborns is relatively common and is only a concern if it causes poor feeding or is associated with ''weight loss'' or other symptoms of systemic illness. Consult a pediatrician if thrush in an infant lasts more than a couple of weeks.' "
What are risk factors for thrush?,"'Healthy adults generally do not get thrush without having some risk factors. Patients with weakened immune systems are most at risk for getting ''fungal infections'' such as thrush. Risk factors associated with thrush include the following:' Illnesses, including poorly controlled diabetes, HIV/AIDS infection, cancer, and dry mouth Pregnancy Taking medications such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, chemotherapy or other cancer drugs, radiation, and birth control pills Having an organ transplant Smoking Poorly fitting dentures Stress"
Is oral thrush contagious?,"'In general, thrush (or candidiasis) is not ''contagious'"". However, a breast-feeding infant with thrush may transmit it to the mother's breast by contact.""'Technically, oral thrush could be transmitted through kissing or oral sex, though this is uncommon. Thrush is an opportunistic infection, and its development depends on the strength of your immune system.' "
What are thrush symptoms and signs?,"'Thrush is characterized by a white coating or white patches on the tongue, mouth, inner cheeks, and the back of the throat. The tissue under the white patches is often red, raw, and sore. The lesions can be painful and even bleed when scraped. Oral thrush often looks like cottage cheese or milk curds. Some general symptoms and signs of thrush are as follows:''Oral thrush can also lead to a condition called ''burning mouth syndrome'', which can have symptoms of a painful burning sensation, mouth dryness, soreness, tingling or numbness throughout the mouth and tongue, and sometimes an abnormal bitter or ''metallic taste in the mouth''.''In severe cases of thrush, the ''esophagus'', which leads down to the stomach, may also be involved. This will cause ''pain'' with swallowing. If someone has a weakened immune system (''HIV/AIDS'', ''cancer'', chemotherapy, etc.), the ''Candida'' fungus can spread to other parts of the body and cause a systemic infection. If a person has signs or symptoms of thrush and develops a ''fever'', shaking or ''chills'', or ''difficulty swallowing'', contact a doctor immediately.'   Characteristic white patches Redness under the white patches White tongue Cracking at the outer edges of the lips (cheilosis) Dry mouth Feeling of food stuck in the throat or sore throat Soreness in teeth Strange or unpleasant taste in mouth Bad breath"
How do physicians diagnose thrush?,"'Candidiasis is clinically diagnosed by a physician or dentist when the characteristic-looking white patches are found in the mouth or throat.''To confirm the diagnosis, or if there is question about whether the white patches are caused by the ''Candida'' fungus, a scraping may be done. The doctor or dentist can scrape off a small amount of the white matter from the mouth or throat and look at it under a microscope and view the characteristic yeast-shaped fungi.''Thrush located farther down the throat or in the esophagus is usually found by doing a procedure called an ''endoscopy''. In this procedure, the doctor passes a small camera through the back of the throat into the esophagus and into the stomach to observe the tissue and take samples. If the white lesions are found, they may be biopsied or scraped to confirm the diagnosis of thrush. This procedure is usually performed by a ''gastroenterologist''.' "
What is the treatment for thrush?,"'Treatment of thrush depends on the cause and severity of the infection.''If thrush is caused by something reversible, such as taking antibiotics, smoking, ill-fitting dentures, or poorly controlled ''diabetes'', these factors must be corrected as part of the treatment.'""Infants, toddlers, and children with thrush often do not require treatment. In children who have thrush for more than a few weeks, a child's pediatrician may prescribe antifungal ""'nystatin'' (''Mycostatin'', Nilstat, Nystex) drops.''Antifungal medications may be used to treat thrush. If an adult patient is diagnosed with a mild case of thrush, the doctor may prescribe an antifungal mouthwash (nystatin) or lozenges (''clotrimazole'' [Mycelex]) for short-term use. ''Miconazole'' buccal (Oravig) is an antifungal medicine that consists of a tablet placed in the upper gum region and dissolved in the mouth to get rid of thrush.''For more severe cases of thrush or if someone has other reasons for a weakened immune system, he or she may need stronger systemic antifungal medicines, such as ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan'') or ''itraconazole'' (''Sporanox''). These antifungal medicines usually work better than ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral''). For severe or resistant thrush, amphotericin B may be prescribed instead of fluconazole or itraconazole.' "
Are there home remedies for thrush?,"'Home remedies for ''oral candidiasis'' are aimed at decreasing risk factors for thrush as well as preventing overgrowth of ''Candida'' yeast.''Home remedies that may reduce the discomfort of thrush include''Gentian violet (1%) is an ''over-the-counter'' natural treatment that sometimes works as a home remedy for thrush. It is a dye that kills bacteria and fungi, and it is available without a prescription. Talk to a doctor before using gentian violet.''Grapefruit seed extract is sometimes used by ''nursing'' mothers who have developed thrush of the nipples. It can be applied topically (on the skin) to the affected area or taken orally.''Apple cider vinegar has antifungal properties that may help regulate ''Candida'' in the body. Mix 1 tablespoon into 8 oz. water and drink daily.''Baking soda may also help kill the yeast that causes the fungal infection and maintain healthy pH levels in the mouth. Mix 1-2 tablespoons baking soda with water until it forms a paste. Apply the paste with a cotton ball onto the tongue and inner cheeks. Let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse with warm water. Repeat three times a day for several days. Alternately, mix ½ teaspoon baking soda into a glass of water and use as a mouth rinse twice daily.''Raw virgin coconut oil has antifungal properties. Nursing mothers sometimes use it on their nipples and the baby’s mouth to prevent spread of thrush.''Methylene blue'' oral is an antiseptic that is reported to help relieve oral candidiasis. Consult a doctor before using this or any supplement.' Brush the teeth with a soft toothbrush. Rinse the mouth with a diluted 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Rinse the mouth with warm saltwater. Avoid mouthwash as it can alter the normal flora of the mouth. Keep dentures clean and see a dentist if they do not fit correctly. Eat unsweetened yogurt while taking antibiotics. Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements may help maintain a healthy balance of Candida. drinking cold liquids, or eating frozen or ice treats; eating soft, easy-to-swallow foods; and drinking from a straw if the patches are painful."
What types of doctors treat oral thrush?,"""A primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, internist, or child's pediatrician may diagnose and treat oral thrush. Oral thrush may also be treated by a dentist. Severe infections usually require consultation with an immunologist and/or an infectious-disease specialist."" "
What is the prognosis of thrush?,"'The prognosis of candidiasis and how long it will last depends on the severity of the infection and the status of the immune system of the patient.''Mild cases of thrush caused by some of the reversible risk factors are generally easily treated, and the prognosis is good. Once you have started treatment for oral thrush, symptoms generally go away in about two weeks. In some cases, thrush will last for weeks even with treatment. Recurrent thrush can happen if thrush is not properly treated in the first place.'""Thrush in infants and children is rarely serious or life-threatening and often goes away on its own without any need for medical treatment. If a child's thrush does not improve within two weeks, consult the child's pediatrician.""'Patients with weakened immune systems are at risk for severe and life-threatening complications. These patients can become critically ill or die from severe ''Candida'' infections. ''Candida'' can spread throughout the body to other organs and can cause severe dysfunction. Systemic antifungal treatment in addition to long-term hospitalization may be necessary.' "
Is it possible to prevent thrush?,"'Thrush can be easily prevented in healthy adults by modifying risk factors that contribute to ''Candida'' fungus overgrowth.''Risk factor modifications for ''prevention'' of candidiasis include the following:''To prevent ''thrush in babies'' or nursing infants, keep pacifiers and bottle nipples clean and sterilized. Nursing mothers should discuss the use of any over-the-counter or prescribed medications with their doctor before ''breastfeeding'' as some medications may increase the risk of causing thrush.' Brush and floss teeth and gums regularly, and maintain proper oral hygiene. See a dentist regularly. Make sure dentures are clean, properly maintained, and fit well. Keep diabetes under control. Quit smoking. Eat a balanced, healthy diet low in sugar and yeast. Limit use of antibiotics. Only use as prescribed by a physician. Chlorhexidine (Peridex, Hibiclens) mouthwash may be recommended prevent thrush in people who take immunosuppressant medications."
What is yellow fever? What is the history of yellow fever?,"'Yellow fever is an acute viral infectious disease transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Though many cases of yellow fever are mild and self-limiting, yellow fever can also be a life-threatening disease causing hemorrhagic fever and ''hepatitis'' (hence the term ""yellow"" from the ''jaundice'' it can cause). This viral disease occurs in tropical areas of Africa and South America, and each year there are an estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever worldwide, leading to approximately 30,000 deaths. An increase in the number of cases of yellow fever in the last few decades has led to campaigns aimed at improving public awareness and ''disease prevention'' for this re-emerging infectious disease.''Several significant yellow fever outbreaks have occurred throughout history, with the first documented outbreak occurring in the Yucatan peninsula during the 17th century. During the late 18th century, a severe yellow fever outbreak struck New England and several North American port cities. The city of Philadelphia lost about one-tenth of its population during the 1793 yellow fever epidemic, causing many notable figures in American politics to flee the city. The last major yellow fever outbreak in North America occurred in New Orleans in 1905.''In the late 19th century, Dr. Carlos Finlay, a Cuban physician, first proposed the theory that a mosquito transmits yellow fever. It was not until 1900, using earlier research from Dr. Finlay as a foundation, that U.S. Army Major Dr. Walter Reed and his team proved that mosquitoes, in fact, transmit yellow fever. This groundbreaking idea was instrumental in leading to the subsequent control of yellow fever in various regions. The virus responsible for yellow fever was later isolated in the late 1920s, and this breakthrough discovery later allowed Max Theiler to develop the first ''vaccine'' against yellow fever in the 1930s. This successful vaccine helped control and eliminate yellow fever from various countries in Africa and South America during the mid-20th century.''Unfortunately, yellow fever has had a large outbreak of the disease that began in 2017 and has spread to several Brazilian states. In addition, some unvaccinated ''travelers'' became infected and several died. The CDC recommends ''travelers'' (age 9 months and older) are vaccinated against the disease at least 10 days before arriving in Brazil. Those people who are unvaccinated and traveling in Brazil should avoid areas where vaccination is recommended (see map below from CDC; most areas of Brazil are included).' "
What causes yellow fever?,"'A virus causes yellow fever. The yellow fever virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the ''Flavivirus'' genus. After transmission of the virus occurs, it replicates in regional ''lymph nodes'' and subsequently spreads via the bloodstream. This widespread dissemination can affect the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, kidneys, and ''liver'', in addition to other organs. Tissue damage to the liver, for example, can lead to ''jaundice'"" and disrupt the body's blood-clotting mechanism, leading to the hemorrhagic complications sometimes seen with yellow fever."" "
How do people contract yellow fever?,"'The bite of infected mosquitoes transmits yellow fever to humans. Various species of ''Aedes'' and ''Haemagogus'' mosquitoes serve as vectors and are responsible for the transmission to human and nonhuman primates, which serve as reservoirs for the disease. There are three transmission cycles for yellow fever.' Sylvatic (jungle) cycle: In tropical rainforests, infected monkeys pass the virus to mosquitoes that feed on them. These infected mosquitoes then bite humans who enter the rainforest for occupational (for example, loggers) or recreational activities. Intermediate (savannah) cycle: In humid or semi-humid regions of Africa, mosquitoes that breed around households and in the wild (semi-domestic mosquitoes) infect both humans and monkeys. The virus can be transmitted from monkeys to humans, or from human to human by the mosquitoes. This is the most common type of outbreak in Africa. Urban cycle: When infected humans introduce the virus into urban areas with large numbers of unvaccinated individuals, infected mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) transmit the disease from human to human. This form of transmission can lead to large epidemics."
What areas are high risk for contracting yellow fever?,"'Yellow fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of both Africa and South America, though an estimated 90% of the worldwide reported infections occur in Africa. Most of the infections on the African continent occur in unvaccinated individuals who inhabit the sub-Saharan region. In Asia, there have been no cases of yellow fever outbreaks. However, this area remains a theoretical risk because the mosquitoes responsible for transmission, as well as the susceptible primates, are there.'""Several factors determine an individual's risk of acquiring yellow fever during travel, including the area of travel, season, immunization status, duration of exposure, activities during travel, and the local rate of virus transmission. Review this information before any travel to endemic areas. Below is a map of areas of risk for yellow fever in Africa (CDC map, 2018)."" "
What is the incubation period for yellow fever?,'The period from contracting the infection to the development of symptoms (incubation period) is generally between three to six days.' 
"Is yellow fever contagious? How long is the contagious period for yellow 
fever?","'The bite of infected mosquitoes (for example, ''Haemagogus leucocelaenus'' and/or ''Aedes serratus'' mosquitoes) transmits yellow fever to humans. Direct contact with other infected individuals does not transmit yellow fever. Humans with yellow fever are infectious and can transmit the virus to uninfected mosquitoes shortly before the onset of fever and for three to five days after the onset of symptoms.' "
What types of specialists treat yellow fever?,"'A variety of specialists may become involved in the care of patients who develop symptoms of yellow fever. Initially, primary care physicians, including family physicians, internists, emergency physicians, and pediatricians, may encounter patients with yellow fever. Infectious-disease specialists care for individuals diagnosed with yellow fever, as well. Patients with yellow fever may see other specialists depending on the severity of their illness and the development of complications (for example, a nephrologist in cases of ''kidney failure'').' "
What are yellow fever symptoms and signs?,"'After infection with the yellow fever virus, many individuals will experience no clinically apparent manifestations of the mosquito-borne disease (asymptomatic), while others will go on to develop a mild, self-limiting ''flu-like'' illness characterized by the following symptoms and signs:''Most patients with this initial acute phase of the disease improve spontaneously after approximately three to four days. However, approximately 15% of patients may enter a second phase of the disease that typically appears after a short remission of symptoms (about 24 hours) from the initial phase of the illness. This next toxic phase of the disease is more severe, at which time the high fever returns and more organ systems become involved. In addition to the above symptoms, the following symptoms and signs may also develop:'  Fever Chills Generalized muscle pain Back pain Headache Malaise Weakness Lack of appetite Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Jaundice Bleeding from the gums, nose, eyes, and/or stomach Blood in the stool and blood in the vomit Easy bruising of the skin Kidney failure Confusion Seizures Coma"
How do health care professionals diagnose yellow fever?,"'Because the symptoms during the initial phase of yellow fever are nonspecific and similar to a ''flu'""-like illness, diagnosis during this stage can be difficult. Therefore, health care professionals make a preliminary clinical diagnosis based on the patient's signs and symptoms, the travel history (when and where), the related travel activities, and vaccine history.""'Various blood test abnormalities may be present in individuals with yellow fever, particularly those who go on to develop the second toxic phase of the disease. Blood test abnormalities may include a low white blood cell count (leukopenia), a ''low platelet count'' (''thrombocytopenia''), elevations in ''liver function'' tests, abnormally prolonged blood clotting times, and abnormal ''electrolyte'' and kidney function tests. None of these test results is specific to yellow fever and alone allow the health care provider to make a diagnosis. Urine tests may demonstrate elevated levels of urinary protein and urobilinogen. An ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'') may reveal heart conduction or rhythm disturbances if cardiac involvement has occurred.''The laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever requires specialized testing. Blood tests may demonstrate the presence of virus-specific antibodies (IgM and IgG) produced by the immune system in response to the infection, though cross-reactivity with antibodies from other flaviviruses may occur. Therefore, specific antibody testing, such as a plaque reduction neutralization test, may be done for confirmation of yellow fever virus versus others like ''Zika virus''.' "
What is the treatment for yellow fever?,"'There is no specific curative treatment for yellow fever. Treatment is supportive and aimed at relieving the symptoms of the disease, including the ''pain'' and fever. As previously mentioned, the majority of patients who do develop symptoms from yellow fever will experience a mild course of illness that will resolve on its own.''Supportive measures implemented depend on the severity of the disease, and may include''Avoid ''acetylsalicylic acid'' (''Aspirin'') and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') because of the increased risk of bleeding.''For the first few days of illness, infected individuals should also be isolated indoors and/or under mosquito netting in order to prevent further mosquito exposure, thus eliminating the potential for further transmission of the disease.'  oxygen administration, intravenous fluid administration for dehydration, medications to increase blood pressure in cases of circulatory collapse, transfusion of blood products in cases of severe bleeding, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, dialysis for kidney failure, and endotracheal intubation (placement of a breathing tube) and mechanical ventilation in cases of respiratory failure."
How long does yellow fever last?,"'For individuals with yellow fever who develop the acute mild course of the illness, the symptoms will generally last about three to four days, and most patients will recover fully. For those individuals who develop the more serious toxic phase of the disease and survive, the course of the illness may last for several weeks depending on the severity of illness and any associated complications.' "
What is the prognosis for people with yellow fever?,"'The prognosis for individuals who develop uncomplicated yellow fever is generally excellent. However, for those patients who go on to develop the toxic phase of yellow fever, case-fatality rates range from 20%-50% depending on the underlying condition of the patient and the availability of supportive resources. If death occurs, it is typically within 10-14 days after the onset of the toxic phase. Infants and those older than 50 years of age tend to have more severe disease and higher mortality rates. Furthermore, host susceptibility and the virulence of the particular infecting strain can also influence mortality rates. In those individuals who survive yellow fever, generally there is no residual permanent organ damage.' "
Is it possible to prevent yellow fever?,"'Vaccination remains the most effective way of preventing yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is a safe vaccine with only rare serious adverse events reported. Since the undertaking of the Yellow Fever Initiative in 2006, health care professionals have made visible progress in combating the disease in West Africa with more than 105 million people receiving the vaccine in mass campaigns.''The yellow fever vaccine is a live virus vaccine that provides long-lasting immunity after a single dose. It provides immunity (boosts the immune system) against yellow fever in 95% of individuals within one week of its administration. In select cases, certain individuals should get a booster dose. The vaccine is available for adults and children older than 9 months of age. Health care providers recommended vaccination for travelers going to areas where yellow fever is endemic (at least 10 days before going to the area) and to vaccinate local populations who are at risk. Several countries require travelers to demonstrate proof of yellow fever vaccination status for entry in order to prevent the importation and transmission of yellow fever. Check with a local health department for information regarding designated yellow fever vaccination centers.''Effective mosquito-control measures are also an important component for preventing or minimizing the risk of yellow fever. Avoid mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing (long sleeves and long pants) and remaining in properly screened or air-conditioned accommodations. Furthermore, health care providers advise individuals to apply an EPA-registered insect repellant containing DEET or picaridin on exposed skin; IR 3535 repellent may also be used. These precautions may also help to prevent other mosquito-related infections like ''Zika''.' "
What are the side effects of the yellow fever vaccine?,"""The yellow fever vaccine can have rare but serious adverse side effects. Health care professionals administer the yellow fever vaccine in designated vaccination centers. Health care providers need to consider the individual's underlying health, their risk of exposure to yellow fever, and the contraindications to vaccine administration before recommending it. To minimize the risk of serious adverse events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides the following vaccination recommendations:""'Individuals who do experience side effects from the yellow fever vaccine will generally experience mild symptoms, including low-grade fever, muscle aches, and ''headache''. However, in rare cases, serious adverse events from the yellow fever vaccine can occur including life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, yellow fever vaccine-associated neurologic disease (a condition affecting the nervous system), and yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (a condition affecting the internal organs).' Allergy to vaccine component Age <6 months Symptomatic HIV infection or CD4+ T-lymphocytes <200/mm3 (<15% of total in children aged <6 years) Thymus disorder associated with abnormal immune function Primary immunodeficiencies Malignant neoplasms Transplantation Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies Age 6-8 months Age ≥60 years Asymptomatic HIV infection and CD4+ T-lymphocytes 200 to 499/mm3 (15%-24% of total in children aged <6 years) Pregnancy Breastfeeding"

How much sleep do children need?,"'Just as with adults, the amount of ''sleep'' children need varies with both age and unique needs of the individual. Below are general guidelines for children of various ages. If your child is happy and thriving, but needs more or fewer hours of ''sleep'"" than indicated below - rest assured they will remain healthy. The National Sleep Foundation's 2015 Guidelines recommend the following for sleep in children and ""'teens''.'  1 to 4 weeks old: Neonates spend approximately 65% to 75% of their daily activity in a sleep state. Waking time is of short duration and it is rare for a child of this age to have a ""day-night"" cycle. Their day-night ""clock"" is not functional until 6 to 8 weeks of age. Mothers of newborns should use their infant's sleep pattern to sleep also. 1 to 4 months old: Infants at this early age require sleep 14 to 17 hours 
of sleep per day. Many begin to develop a day-night cycle during the early weeks of this period. 
At this age, many infants have the ability to sleep evening blocks of 5 to 6 hours without interruption; however most will wake for feedings or diaper changes during the night. 4 to 12 months old: Infants in this age range require 12 to 15 hours of sleep daily. Good news for parents 
- they begin to sleep for longer continuous periods at night. Also, early in this time period, many children benefit from multiple daytime naps, though there is significant variability between different infants.  1 to 3 years old: While specialists point out that most toddlers need about 12 to 14 hours of daily sleep, many may be forced to survive on less. Daycare and erratically spaced car trips necessary for the needs of older siblings often deny or disrupt continuous sleep patterns, most often naps. 3 to 6 years old: This age range commonly needs approximately 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day with younger individuals taking a nap after lunch. Any need for napping is generally absent by the time a child enters 1st grade. 7 to 12 years old: Younger children in this age range commonly require 
9 to 11 hours of sleep each night; pre-teens often receive 9 to 10 hours (though some may require more). 12 to 18 years old: Middle and high school student lifestyle requirements (school, after school activities, dinner and finally homework) often reduce the sleep duration from the recommended 8 to 
10 hours to 6 to 8 hours. The various social network computer websites coupled with cell phone text communication 
and television viewing also may cut into a teenager's sleep time."
Can a lack of sleep impact a child's behavior?,"'The symptoms of a lack of sleep are often obvious to watchful parents. Some of these tell-tale signs include: ' recurrently falling asleep in the car (excluding young infants); requiring extreme stimulation and repetitive reminders to get up in the morning;  behavioral abnormalities such as excessive emotionalism, aggression, and crankiness; and  an older child's (over 8 years of age) recurrent need for an afternoon nap."
What is sleep hygiene?,"'A common definition of sleep hygiene is'' '' ""all behavioral and environmental factors that precede sleep and may interfere with sleep."" Daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping may be a reflection of poor sleep hygiene. Detailed specifics are listed below. General areas to consider include: ' Personal habits: Establish consistent routines around bedtimes and awakening times  Sleep environment: The bedroom should be a slightly cooler temperature 
(between 60 F to 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C), and eliminate any distracting noise in the bedroom Getting ready for bed: Establish a calming pre-sleep ritual (for example, reading, not watching TV) and  Miscellaneous: Examples include limiting intake of foods/liquids/medications which may disrupt a restful sleep"
What are some common sleep disorders in children?,"""The University of Michigan's ""'Sleep Disorders'' program includes five issues that may be disruptive of good sleep practices. These include: ' Sleep deprivation: As noted in the previously, the amount of sleep generally required varies with age and genetic predisposition. Unfortunately many older children, especially teens, do not receive an appropriate amount of sound sleep. Night waking: All children after the first 7 to 8 months of life start to be more sensitive to internal and external stimuli. If an infant has not yet learned to calm himself and resettle back to sleep, the parents commonly are summoned to help the child return to sleep. This pattern may repeat itself several times each night. Separation anxiety: Children experience this emotion commonly at 5 months of age as well as during the toddler years. Such children become anxious and are unable to enter a comfortable sleep pattern unless parents are present.  Resistance to sleep/settling problems: This occurs when your child does not want to go to bed at a reasonable time. Stalling, temper tantrums, and other resistance patterns are common. Parental persistence generally will resolve this common issue. Parasomnias: Parasomnias are problems that disrupt sleep. Examples include night terrors, grinding of teeth, sleepwalking, etc."
Sleep Apnea symptoms in children,"'Sleep apnea'' is an extremely serious sleep pathology in which the child will struggle to breath and possibly stop ''breathing'"". This process most commonly is a consequence of an enlarged tonsil and adenoid tissues that obstruct the child's upper ""'airway'"". Parents of such children will report that it sounds as if their child is being choked during sleep. Complications of sleep apnea include reduced oxygen to the brain and strain of the right side of the heart. If you believe your child may have sleep apnea, you should discuss your concerns with your child's pediatrician. An evaluation by and ENT (ears-nose-throat) specialist is often indicated. It is helpful to either audio/video record such an episode prior to such an evaluation."" "
Parasomnia symptoms in children,"'Parasomnias are disruptive sleep related events. They include several infrequent events (''periodic limb movement disorder'', ''restless leg syndrome'') and more common events (''teeth grinding'', night terrors, and ''nightmares'', sleepwalking, and ''bedwetting''). Periodic limb movement disorder occurs while asleep and is characterized by repetitive leg and (occasionally) arm movement that persist throughout the night. The child or teenager does not complain of any discomfort or abnormal sensations. In contrast, ''restless leg syndrome'' occurs while awake and affected individuals often describe a sensation of their legs ""falling asleep.""''Nightmares occur during REM (dreaming period) sleep and thus are more common later in the night. The child acts scared but may be comforted by their parents. Such children will often be able to remember their dream. Simple parental reassurance and comforting is effective. In contrast, night terrors occur in non-''REM sleep'' and thus generally within the first 4 hours of sleep. The child may become very violent with crying out in a confused manner as well as thrashing of arms and legs. Routine comforting of the child is not helpful and the child will be confused and bewildered if awakened. Generally, the child will rapidly return to a ""normal"" sleep with no memory of the events in the morning.' "
Confusional arousal symptoms in children,"'Confusional arousals are a variant of night terrors in older infants and toddlers that occur during the first half of the nighttime sleep sequence. It is felt that the child is so deeply asleep and the normal waking pattern at the end of the sleep cycle is suppressed. ''The major distinguishing point of confusional arousals versus night terrors is that the former gradually build from moaning, to crying out, and may culminate in the child standing and yelling out apparent random words or phrases. ''Conversely, night terrors tend to have an acute onset with the very rapid development of thrashing and yelling (commonly for the parents or caregivers). Confusional arousal and night terrors share several key points important for the child:' Don't try to awaken the child. They are asleep and if awakened, will have difficult time falling back to sleep. Anything that upsets the normal sleep rhythms (illness, not sleeping in their own home, and disrupted naps) may trigger either pattern."
Night terror symptoms in children,"'Night terrors are somewhat rare events that have their highest frequency in children 4 to 12 years of age. They are commonly outgrown by adulthood, though some adults manifest the same brain ''EEG'' (""brain wave"") changes during sleepwalking. ''Night terrors differ from nightmares (see previously). Night terrors manifest themselves with the person bolting upright in bed, screaming and thrashing about and stare blankly at the concerned adult who has come to investigate. They tend to occur during the first third of the child\'s sleep cycle. Children characteristically do not ""calm down"" when their parent attempts to soothe what appears to be a fearful experience. EEG studies demonstrate that the child is not awake (i.e. he/she is asleep), and if awakened, has no knowledge or memory of the immediately preceding events. The duration of night terror episodes is short lived. Some authorities believe that night terrors may be a response to sleep deprivation, ''stress'', ''fever'', or ''fatigue''.' "
Narcolepsy symptoms in children,"'Narcolepsy'' is more common in adults than children. It has been defined as ""a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Narcolepsy is a chronic condition for which there is no cure."" Research has shown that narcolepsy is not a type of ''seizure'', ''fainting'' episode, or psychological illness. Symptoms of narcolepsy include:' Excessive daytime sleepiness: affected individuals have an uncontrollable need to sleep during the day; Sudden loss of muscle tone (Cataplexy): this may range from slurred speech to total collapse of all voluntary muscles. Emotional stimulation (often positive by nature, for example, laughter) may trigger such an attack; Sleep paralysis: Characterized by a temporary (1-2 minutes) period of the inability to speak or move when falling asleep or waking; Vivid or frightening hallucinations which occur most commonly during REM (dreaming) sleep."
Sleepwalking symptoms in children,"'The onset of sleepwalking (somnambulism) typically presents in prepubertal children most frequently at age 11 to 12, and occurs more often in boys than girls. The overall incidence of sleepwalking is approximately 18%. Like night terrors, the individual is difficult to arouse during the event and does not remember the experience. Sleepwalking most commonly occurs during the first third of the sleep cycle. Some sleepwalkers may also mumble during sleepwalking episodes and occasionally obscene words may be uttered. Medications are rarely necessary to manage sleepwalking episodes. Ensuring a safe environment (protection against falls or ''walking'' out of the house) and maintenance of good sleep habits (avoiding sleep deprivation) are important considerations to prevent sleepwalking.'

Do teenagers have the same sleep requirements as younger children?,"'Most teens need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day. Some studies have indicated that they have a different internal ""sleep clock"" than those younger or older than them. Researchers have demonstrated that teens are truly ""night owls,"" and if left to their own devices, would spontaneously wake from a good night\'s sleep anywhere from 9:00 am to 10:00 am. High school teachers who have classes before this time period have empiric experience to second this observation. Younger children may need anywhere from 12-15 hours (infant: 2 naps plus nighttime long block) to 9-11 hours (middle school child). ' "
How can I teach my child or teenager healthy sleep habits and good sleep hygiene?,"'Primary to establishing good sleep habits is a realization that sleep is a normal and necessary function. However, just as with other normal and necessary functions (for example, eating, toilet training, etc.), a battle may develop between parents and their child in this area. ''All children older than 5 to 6 months of age need to master the ability to self-soothe and relax in order to successfully fall asleep. Depriving them of this skill by either feeding or rocking them to sleep, reading until the child falls asleep, or lying down with the child in order to facilitate falling asleep, is a recipe for frustration - both for the child and the parent. ''Tired children (of any age) intuitively know when they are tired and, if provided the proper environment, will easily and quickly fall asleep. ''When they awaken during the middle of the night they are capable of falling back to sleep without parental intervention. In this circumstance, both child and parents awake refreshed the next morning.' "
What are some ways I can help my child or teenager get a better night's sleep?,"'These ""do\'s"" are adapted from ""''Sleep Problems'': Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System and ""Healthy Sleep Tips"" from the National Sleep Foundation.'  Make bedtime a special time. Create special soothing and calming experiences with the opportunity for special ""talks"" or sharing experiences that foster comfort for both child and parent. Study your child so you can determine when he is ready to sleep. Once this is determined you can start the ""get ready for bed"" routine with enough time in advance so the child doesn't get a ""second wind"". Keep the bedtime routine consistent and simple. Mental and physical stimulation is counter productive. Dim lights starting about 10 – 15 minutes before going to sleep.  Bright lights act as a stimulant to the child's brain.   Keep the bedtime routine portable. For example, it can occur whether at home or outside of the home (for example, in a motel during vacation). Make sure your child is both mentally and physically tired at the end of the day. Children need between 30 to 60 minutes per day of vigorous playtime (depending on the age). Besides fostering good sleep habits, such a program will help maintain optimum weight gain. Establish a restful atmosphere. Keep the lights dim, limit noise and electronic devices. Teens should turn off computers/TV's and cell phones when retiring to bed. 
The bedroom temperature should be between 60 F and 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C. Avoid afternoon naps in children over 6 years of age."
"What are some ""don'ts"" for getting my child or teen to sleep?","'These ""don\'ts"" are adapted from ""Sleep Problems: Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System.' Don't put your child to bed with a bottle of juice, milk or formula. Sugar in such drinks promotes tooth decay. Water is acceptable. Don't fill up the bed with toys. Limit the crib/bed to one to two ""special"" items. Too many items are over stimulating and the child will have a hard time not playing with them. Eliminate any object that might be a safety hazard. Don't threaten to send your child to bed as a punishment. Bedtime should be an enjoyable experience that will promote falling asleep in a timely fashion. Avoid caffeine before bed: Caffeinated drinks such as cola, chocolate, iced tea, 
energy drinks, etc. Limit TV in the afternoon and at night. TV stimulation may carry on longer than you suspect. Having a TV in a child's room may be counterproductive to getting your child or teen to sleep. A 2014 National Sleep Foundation study indicates that 72% of children 6 years old to 17 years old have at least one electronic device in their bedroom.  These children may get up to one hour less sleep per night as their peers without such devices in the bedroom."
