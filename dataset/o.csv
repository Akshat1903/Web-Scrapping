Questions,Answer
What is an overactive bladder?,"'Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition that is characterized by sudden, involuntary contraction of the muscle in the wall of the urinary bladder. This results in a sudden, compelling need to urinate that is difficult to suppress (''urinary urgency''), even though the bladder may only contain a small amount of urine. The key symptom is sudden urge to void (urgency) with or without urgency urinary incontinence, often associated with urinary frequency (voiding 8 or more times per day) and nocturia (awakening one or more times at night to void). Irritating fluids, such as ''caffeinated'' ''beverages'' (coffee, tea), spicy foods, and ''alcohol'' can worsen the symptoms. It is common for those affected to compensate for OAB by toilet mapping, fluid restriction, and timed voiding. There is no ''pain'', burning, or ''blood in the urine'' with OAB.''Overactive bladder coupled with urinary leakage (inability to suppress the urge to void) is also referred to as urgency urinary incontinence. Another common type of urinary incontinence is called ''stress'' incontinence, which is caused by ''weakness'' in the pelvic floor muscles that surround and support the bladder and urethra. The symptom of ''stress'' incontinence is leakage when ''coughing'', straining, jumping, or with other physical activity that increase the pressure in the abdomen (Valsalva). Treatment for stress incontinence is very different than urge incontinence. In some individuals, there can be a combination of urge and stress incontinence (mixed incontinence). Often, the most bothersome condition is treated first in individuals with mixed urinary incontinence. In general, urinary incontinence is more common in women compared to men.''The overall prevalence of overactive bladder is 13.9%, affecting men and women with equal frequency. Although it can happen at any age, overactive bladder is especially common in older adults. Overactive bladder should not be considered a normal part of ''aging''. The prevalence under the age of 50 is < 10%. After age 60, the prevalence increases to 20%-30%. It is estimated that 60% of patients have dry OAB (no leakage) while 40% have wet OAB.' "
What are the causes of overactive bladder?,"""Overactive bladder is typically caused by early, uncontrolled contraction (spasms) of the bladder muscle (detrusor muscle), resulting in an urge to urinate. Overactive bladder is primarily a problem of the nerves and muscles of the bladder that allow for early contraction during the normal relaxation phase of bladder filling. The bladder's contraction in response to filling with urine is one the steps in the normal process of urination. The contraction and relaxation of the detrusor muscle is regulated by the nervous system. Approximately 300 cc of urine in the bladder can signal the nervous to trigger muscles of the bladder to coordinate urination. Voluntary control of the sphincter muscles at the opening of the bladder can hold the urine in the bladder for longer. Up to 600 cc of urine can be contained in a normal adult bladder. For those with OAB, the bladder capacity is typically low (< 200cc).""'Overactive bladder typically results from inappropriate contraction of the detrusor muscle regardless of the amount of urine. The most common form of OAB is idiopathic, where the exact cause is not known. However, OAB can result from problems of the nervous system.''The common abnormalities of the nervous system that cause overactive bladder are''Other causes of ''OAB symptoms'' include ''urinary tract infection'', bladder stones, urethral strictures, benign prostatic enlargement (''BPH''), or bladder tumors.''Frequently, no apparent cause of overactive bladder can be determined (idiopathic overactive bladder).'   spinal cord injury, back problems (disc hernia, degenerative disc disease), strokes, Parkinson's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and diabetic neuropathy."
Are there any risk factors for overactive bladder?,"'Some of the common risk factors for overactive bladder include the following:' Advanced age Injury to the nervous systemStrokeSpinal cord injuryDementiaParkinson's diseaseMultiple sclerosis Stroke Spinal cord injury Dementia Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Prostate enlargement Prostate surgery Multiple pregnancies Previous pelvic surgery Previous radiotherapy of the pelvis Postmenopausal women have an increased risk of OAB. Race may affect risk of developing OAB: African-American and Hispanic men and women have a higher risk of developing OAB. Obesity also appears to increase the risk of OAB. OAB is also associated with depression, anxiety, and other symptoms."
What are overactive bladder symptoms?,"'The symptoms of an overactive bladder include ''frequent urination'' (urinating eight or more times per day), urgency of urination (sudden, compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer) with or without urgency urinary incontinence, and nocturia (awakening one or more times at night to urinate). Overactive bladder may cause significant social, psychological, occupational, domestic, physical, sexual, and financial problems. Again, these symptoms should not be considered a normal part of aging.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose overactive bladder?,"'The diagnosis of overactive bladder is based on the presence of symptoms, while excluding other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. This is based on history, physical examination, and a urine test. Waking up to urinate one or more times at night, urinary frequency (urinating at least eight times daily), urinary urgency, and urinary incontinence are all important clues in evaluating someone suspected of having overactive bladder.''In addition to a general physical examination, a ''pelvic exam'' in women (to assess for dryness, atrophy, inflammation, infection, stress incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse [seeing a bulge in the vagina particularly with increasing abdominal pressure by straining]) and a prostate examination in men (to assess for size, tenderness, texture, and/or masses) are helpful in excluding other contributing conditions.''Urine analysis (UA) to assess for infection, blood cells in the urine, and high levels of glucose (''sugar'') in the urine is recommended. Occasionally, urine cytology (to look for ''cancer'' cells in the bladder) is sometimes advised in individuals undergoing evaluation of urinary incontinence and overactive bladder, particularly individuals with blood cells in the urine (''hematuria''). Bladder ''ultrasound'' measurement of the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination (called post-void residual) may also provide additional information about the cause of urinary incontinence (obstruction to urine flow or weak bladder muscle) but is not needed in all individuals with OAB symptoms.' "
What are the treatments for an overactive bladder?,"'The treatment for overactive bladder can vary with each individual. Guidelines suggest starting with less invasive therapies first. The recommended first line of therapy is behavioral, dietary, and lifestyle therapies. In some individuals, the addition of biofeedback is helpful. Biofeedback may be done in the office or by a physical therapist. In those individuals who do not respond adequately to behavioral, dietary, or lifestyle therapies, the addition of medications (pharmacologic therapy) is recommended as a second-line treatment. Third-line therapies consist of less-invasive surgical options (injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder wall) and electrical stimulation therapies, including sacral neuromodulation (Interstim) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PTNS). More extensive surgical therapies are available but are rarely needed for treatment of OAB that is not the result of a nervous system condition.''Here are commonly recommended treatments.''Dietary and Lifestyle''Behavioral'   Weight loss in obese individuals may decrease incontinence episodes. Reducing fluid intake to a recommended daily amount may be helpful in decreasing OAB symptoms. Decreasing/eliminating caffeine intake may be helpful in some individuals. Kegel exercises: Regular, daily exercising of pelvic muscles can improve, and even prevent, urinary incontinence. This is particularly helpful for younger women. These exercises should be performed 30-80 times daily for at least eight weeks. These exercises are thought to strengthen the muscles of the pelvis and urethra, which can support the opening to the bladder to prevent incontinence. Their success depends on practicing the proper technique and the recommended frequency. These exercises may be helpful for women with both stress and urgency urinary incontinence. Biofeedback: Used in conjunction with Kegel exercises, biofeedback helps people gain awareness and control of their pelvic muscles. Biofeedback is often performed by a physical therapist but may also be performed in the office of a urologist or urogynecologist. Biofeedback can help identify the pelvic floor muscles to ensure proper contractions of these muscles. Vaginal weight training: Small weights are held within the vagina by tightening the vaginal muscles. These exercises should be performed for 15 minutes, twice daily, for four to six weeks. Pelvic-floor electrical stimulation: Mild electrical pulses stimulate muscle contractions. This should be done in conjunction with Kegel exercises. Bladder training teaches people to resist the urge to void by conscious suppression of the need to urinate as well as using pelvic floor muscle contractions to suppress the urge to void and gradually expand the intervals between voiding. Toileting assistance uses routine or scheduled toileting, habit-training schedules, and prompted voiding to empty the bladder regularly to prevent leaking."
What is the role of medications in treating overactive bladder?,"'There are several medications recommended for the treatment of overactive bladder. Using these medications in conjunction with behavioral therapies has shown to increase the success rate for the treatment of overactive bladder.''The main goals of OAB treatment are to''Typically, the medications for overactive bladder start to work within one to two weeks, and optimal relief of OAB symptoms is usually achieved by six weeks. The most common medications (anticholinergics), bladder relaxants, target to decrease the overactivity of the detrusor muscle. Anticholinergics should be used under the direction of the physician prescribing them. They may have some common side effects, including ''dry mouth'', ''constipation'', facial flushing, blurry vision, and ''confusion'' (in the elderly). There are multiple anticholinergic therapies approved for the treatment of overactive bladder. They all are similar in their ability to treat the ''symptoms of overactive bladder'' but differ in the frequency and type of side effects as well as method of use. Some are once daily, some are topical treatments applied to the skin, and some come in different doses, allowing one to increase the dose if needed. Lastly, several of these medications are now available in generic forms.''Contraindications: The use of anticholinergics in individuals with narrow-angle ''glaucoma'' is not recommended without approval from an eye specialist. The side effects of anticholinergic medications for OAB may be increased with the use of other medications, thus it is important to always review current medications with the prescribing physician prior to starting an anticholinergic.''Injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder is considered a third-line therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder and is used in individuals who have tried and failed and/or cannot tolerate the side effects of medical therapy and/or has contraindications to the use of medications to treat overactive bladder.''Another third-line therapy is neuromodulation.''Neuromodulation is a newer method of treating overactive bladder with electrical stimulation that results in reorganization of the spinal reflexes involved in bladder control. There are two types of neuromodulation available: percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and sacral neuromodulation (Interstim). PTNS is performed in the office and is usually performed once a week for 12 weeks with periodic therapies thereafter to maintain a response. It involves placing a small needle into the area near the ankle and administering electrical stimulation. Sacral neuromodulation is usually performed in two stages. The first stage involves the placement of wires (leads) into areas in the ''sacrum'' and then using a small generator to test the response to stimulation. If there is a 50% or more improvement in symptoms the wires (leads) are internalized and an internal generator is placed, typically under the skin near the buttocks.''Surgery is rarely necessary in treating overactive bladder unless symptoms are debilitating and unresponsive to other treatments. Reconstructive bladder surgery (cystoplasty) is the most common surgical procedure. This surgery involves enlarging the size of the bladder by using part of the intestine.' reduce urinary urgency and frequency, increase voided volume (bladder capacity), and decrease urge incontinence (reduce leakage episodes). Oxybutynin (Ditropan) prevents urge incontinence by relaxing the detrusor muscle. This is typically taken two to three times a day (Ditropan XL is extended release, taken once a day). This medication was the first-generation therapy available, and its main side effects include dry mouth (60%) and constipation. Ditropan patch (Oxytrol) is also available with fewer side effects, but it releases a smaller dose than the oral form. The patch is placed on the skin once to twice weekly, and it may cause some local skin irritation. Tolterodine (Detrol, Detrol LA) is indicated for the treatment of an overactive bladder with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence. This medication affects the salivary glands less than oxybutynin, thus, it is better tolerated with fewer side effects (dry mouth). Detrol is usually prescribed twice a day, whereas the long-acting type (Detrol LA) is taken only once a day. Trospium chloride (Sanctura) is available in both a once a day and twice a day therapy. Trospium is less likely to get into the brain and is broken down differently than other medications, which may be beneficial in some individuals. Solifenacin (Vesicare) is a relatively newer medication in this group. It is generally similar to tolterodine, but it has a longer half-life and needs to be taken once a day. Darifenacin (Enablex) is also a newer anticholinergic medicine for treating overactive bladder with fewer side effects, such as confusion. Therefore, it may be more helpful in the elderly with underlying dementia. This medication is also typically taken once a day. Fesoterodine fumarate (Toviaz) is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. The medication is taken once daily. Common side effects include constipation and dry mouth. Mirabegron (Myrbetriq) is a new type of medication, a beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, to treat overactive bladder that is not an anticholinergic and can be used alone or more recently is being tested in combination with anticholinergic medications. Unlike anticholinergic medications that work to prevent the bladder muscle from contracting, the beta-3 adrenoceptor agonists work on the bladder to help it to relax. As these medications have a very different mechanism of action, they have different side effects. The side effects include increased blood pressure, incomplete bladder emptying, sinus irritation, constipation, and dry mouth (< 2%-3%). Currently, mirabegron is the only drug of this type that is FDA approved, however, other similar agents are being studied.It is recommended that blood pressure checks be performed when starting mirabegron. It is recommended that blood pressure checks be performed when starting mirabegron. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) is a toxin that is injected directly into the bladder muscle with a cystoscope and may be repeated every four to six months. The effects of the toxin are to prevent the release of chemicals from the nerves that supply the bladder, preventing stimulation of the bladder muscle. As the chemical cannot spread very far when injected, to treat the bladder adequately, multiple injections of a small amount of the toxin are necessary for the treatment to be effective. In most individuals, this can be done in the office. The treatment does not cause permanent changes and thus will require periodic retreatments for the effect to be continued. Serious side effects are unusual but may include difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty talking, muscle weakness, and more commonly, urinary tract infection and urinary retention. Individuals undergoing injection of Botox into the bladder muscle must be willing to perform clean, intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder. The effect of Botox is not permanent, thus repeat injections are needed to maintain the improvement, typically once every six to 16 months. Estrogen, either oral or vaginal, may be helpful in conjunction with other treatments for postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence."
Are there alternative therapies for OAB?,"'There is limited information on the effects of ''acupuncture'' on OAB symptoms. However, small studies have demonstrated improvements in OAB symptoms.''Select herbal therapies have also demonstrated improvement in OAB symptoms in small studies.' "
What are treatments for the chronically incontinent?,"'Although many people will improve their continence through medications, pelvic-muscle exercises, and bladder training, some will never achieve complete dryness. Sometimes treatment failures are due to concurrent use of other necessary medications, such as diuretics (water pills that increase urination), that actually can cause incontinence. Others may have dementia or other physical impairments that keep them from being able to perform pelvic-muscle exercises or retrain their bladders. Many will be cared for in long-term care facilities or at home. The following recommendations can help keep the chronically ''incontinent'' drier and reduce their cost of care:'   Scheduled toileting (timed voiding): Take people to the toilet every two to four hours or according to their toilet habits. Prompted voiding: Check for dryness and encourage use of the toilet. Improved access to toilets: Use equipment such as canes, walkers, wheelchairs, and devices that raise the seating level of toilets to make toileting easier. Managing fluids and diet: Behavioral modifications can directly impact symptoms of OAB. These include eliminating dietary caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods (for those with urge incontinence) and encourage adequate fiber in the diet. Disposable absorbent garments: Use these to keep people dry. Avoid indwelling catheters as much as possible, as these are associated with a risk of urinary tract infection, stones, and urethral and bladder irritation."
What measures can be taken at home to prevent overactive bladder symptoms?,"'The exact cause of overactive bladder syndrome is not known, thus preventative strategies are not established. However, the following options can avoid exacerbating symptoms in some individuals.''Caffeine may exacerbate urinary urgency, and it is potentially an irritant to the bladder. Eliminating caffeine intake can diminish some of the symptoms of overactive bladder.''Some experts suggest that avoidance of certain foods, such as ''chocolate'', spicy foods, alcohol, carbonated beverages, and nuts, can be beneficial in preventing symptoms of overactive bladder. Others encourage increasing the amount of dietary fiber for people with overactive bladder. Limiting fluid intake can also help to reduce urinary frequency.''Excess weight can put more pressure on the bladder, causing urinary incontinence. Therefore, ''weight loss'' can also help with urinary incontinence in general.' "
What are some of the complications of overactive bladder?,"'Common complications that can result from overactive bladder include' urinary tract infections (UTIs), skin irritation, skin infection, bladder stones, falls/fractures in elderly, sleep disturbances, negative impact on quality of life, and depression."
What is the prognosis for overactive bladder?,"'The overall prognosis for overactive bladder is generally good. Through a combined approach of behavioral modifications and medications, the patient can help significantly improve bladder urgency, and the quality of life of those affected by overactive bladder can substantially improve.' "
What is obesity?,"'The definition of obesity varies depending on what one reads. In general, overweight and obesity indicate a weight greater than what is healthy. Obesity is a chronic condition defined by an excess amount of body fat. A certain amount of body fat is necessary for storing energy, heat insulation, ''shock'' absorption, and other functions.'""Body mass index best defines obesity. A person's height and weight determines his or her body mass index. The body mass index (BMI) equals a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by their height in meters (m) squared (more information will be found later in the article). Since BMI describes body weight relative to height, there is a strong correlation with total body fat content in adults. An adult who has a BMI of 25-29.9 is overweight, and an adult who has a BMI over 30 is obese. A person with a BMI of 18.5-24.9 has a normal weight. A person is morbidly obese (extreme obesity) if his or her BMI is over 40."" "
How common is obesity?,"'Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Over two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, and one in three Americans is obese. The prevalence of obesity in children has increased markedly. Obesity has also been increasing rapidly throughout the world, and the incidence of obesity nearly doubled from 1991 to 1998. In 2015, nearly 40% of adults were obese in the U.S.'  "
What are the health risks associated with obesity?,"""Obesity is not just a cosmetic consideration; it is harmful to one's health as it is a risk factor for many conditions. In the United States, roughly 112,000 deaths per year are directly related to obesity, and most of these deaths are in patients with a BMI over 30. Patients with a BMI over 40 have a reduced life expectancy. Obesity also increases the risk of developing a number of chronic diseases, including the following:"" Insulin resistance. Insulin is necessary for the transport of blood glucose (sugar) into the cells of muscle and fat (which the body uses for energy). By transporting glucose into cells, insulin keeps the blood glucose levels in the normal range. Insulin resistance (IR) is the condition whereby there is diminished effectiveness of insulin in transporting glucose (sugar) into cells. Fat cells are more insulin resistant than muscle cells; therefore, one important cause of insulin resistance is obesity. The pancreas initially responds to insulin resistance by producing more insulin. As long as the pancreas can produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance, blood glucose levels remain normal. This insulin resistance state (characterized by normal blood glucose levels and high insulin levels) can last for years. Once the pancreas can no longer keep up with producing high levels of insulin, blood glucose levels begin to rise, resulting in type 2 diabetes, thus insulin resistance is a pre-diabetes condition. Type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases with the degree and duration of obesity. Type 2 diabetes is associated with central obesity; a person with central obesity has excess fat around his/her waist (apple-shaped figure). High blood pressure (hypertension). Hypertension is common among obese adults. A Norwegian study showed that weight gain tended to increase blood pressure in women more significantly than in men. High cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) Stroke (cerebrovascular accident or CVA) Heart attack. A prospective study found that the risk of developing coronary artery disease increased three to four times in women who had a BMI greater than 29. A Finnish study showed that for every 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) increase in body weight, the risk of death from coronary artery disease increased by 1%. In patients who have already had a heart attack, obesity is associated with an increased likelihood of a second heart attack. Congestive heart failure Cancer. Obesity is a risk factor for cancer of the colon in men and women, cancer of the rectum and prostate in men, and cancer of the gallbladder and uterus in women. Obesity may also be associated with breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. Fat tissue is important in the production of estrogen, and prolonged exposure to high levels of estrogen increases the risk of breast cancer. Gallstones Gout and gouty arthritis Osteoarthritis (degenerative arthritis) of the knees, hips, and the lower back Sleep apnea"
9 Most common causes of obesity,"""The balance between calorie intake and energy expenditure determines a person's weight. If a person eats more calories than he or she ""'burns'' (metabolizes), the person gains weight (the body will store the excess energy as fat). If a person eats fewer calories than he or she metabolizes, he or she will lose weight. Therefore, the most common causes of obesity are overeating and physical inactivity. Ultimately, body weight is the result of genetics, metabolism, environment, behavior, and culture.' Physical inactivity. Sedentary people burn fewer calories than people who are active. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed a strong correlations between physical inactivity and weight gain in both sexes. Overeating. Overeating leads to weight gain, especially if the diet is high in fat. Foods high in fat or sugar (for example, fast food, fried food, and sweets) have high energy density (foods that have a lot of calories in a small amount of food). Epidemiologic studies have shown that diets high in fat contribute to weight gain. Genetics. A person is more likely to develop obesity if one or both parents are obese. Genetics also affect hormones involved in fat regulation. For example, one genetic cause of obesity is leptin deficiency. Leptin is a hormone produced in fat cells and in the placenta. Leptin controls weight by signaling the brain to eat less when body fat stores are too high. If, for some reason, the body cannot produce enough leptin or leptin cannot signal the brain to eat less, this control is lost, and obesity occurs. The role of leptin replacement as a treatment for obesity is under exploration. A diet high in simple carbohydrates. The role of carbohydrates in weight gain is not clear. Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, which in turn stimulate insulin release by the pancreas, and insulin promotes the growth of fat tissue and can cause weight gain. Some scientists believe that simple carbohydrates (sugars, fructose, desserts, soft drinks, beer, wine, etc.) contribute to weight gain because they are more rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream than complex carbohydrates (pasta, brown rice, grains, vegetables, raw fruits, etc.) and thus cause a more pronounced insulin release after meals than complex carbohydrates. This higher insulin release, some scientists believe, contributes to weight gain. Frequency of eating. The relationship between frequency of eating (how often you eat) and weight is somewhat controversial. There are many reports of overweight people eating less often than people with normal weight. Scientists have observed that people who eat small meals four or five times daily, have lower cholesterol levels and lower and/or more stable blood sugar levels than people who eat less frequently (two or three large meals daily). One possible explanation is that small frequent meals produce stable insulin levels, whereas large meals cause large spikes of insulin after meals. Medications. Medications associated with weight gain include certain antidepressants (medications used in treating depression), anticonvulsants (medications used in controlling seizures such as carbamazepine [Tegretol, Tegretol XR , Equetro, Carbatrol] and valproate [Depacon, Depakene]), some diabetes medications (medications used in lowering blood sugar such as insulin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones), certain hormones such as oral contraceptives, and most corticosteroids such as prednisone. Some high blood pressure medications and antihistamines cause weight gain. The reason for the weight gain with the medications differs for each medication. If this is a concern for you, you should discuss your medications with your physician rather than discontinuing the medication, as this could have serious effects. Psychological factors. For some people, emotions influence eating habits. Many people eat excessively in response to emotions such as boredom, sadness, stress, or anger. While most overweight people have no more psychological disturbances than normal weight people, about 30% of the people who seek treatment for serious weight problems have difficulties with binge eating. Diseases such as hypothyroidism, insulin resistance, polycystic ovary syndrome, and Cushing's syndrome are also contributors to obesity. Some diseases, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, can lead to obesity. Social issues: There is a link between social issues and obesity. Lack of money to purchase healthy foods or lack of safe places to walk or exercise can increase the risk of obesity."
What are other factors associated with obesity?," Ethnicity. Ethnicity factors may influence the age of onset and the rapidity of weight gain. African-American women and Hispanic women tend to experience weight gain earlier in life than Caucasians and Asians, and age-adjusted obesity rates are higher in these groups. Non-Hispanic black men and Hispanic men have a higher obesity rate then non-Hispanic white men, but the difference in prevalence is significantly less than in women. Childhood weight. A person's weight during childhood, the teenage years, and early adulthood may also influence the development of adult obesity. Therefore, decreasing the prevalence of childhood obesity is one of the areas to focus on in the fight against obesity. For example,being mildly overweight in the early 20s was linked to a substantial incidence of obesity by age 35;being overweight during older childhood is highly predictive of adult obesity, especially if a parent is also obese;being overweight during the teenage years is even a greater predictor of adult obesity. being mildly overweight in the early 20s was linked to a substantial incidence of obesity by age 35; being overweight during older childhood is highly predictive of adult obesity, especially if a parent is also obese; being overweight during the teenage years is even a greater predictor of adult obesity. Hormones. Women tend to gain weight especially during certain events such as pregnancy, menopause, and in some cases, with the use of oral contraceptives. However, with the availability of the lower-dose estrogen pills, weight gain has not been as great a risk."
What methods measure body fat?,"""BMI is a calculated value and approximates the body's fat percentage. Actually measuring a person's body fat percentage is not easy and is often inaccurate without careful monitoring of the methods. The following methods require special equipment, trained personnel, can be costly, and some are only available in certain research facilities.""'The following two methods are simple and straightforward:' Underwater weighing (hydrostatic weighing): This method weighs a person underwater and then calculates lean body mass (muscle) and body fat. This method is one of the most accurate ones; however, the equipment is costly. BOD POD: The BOD POD is a computerized, egg-shaped chamber. Using the same whole-body measurement principle as hydrostatic weighing, the BOD POD measures a subject's mass and volume, from which their whole-body density is determined. Using this data, body fat and lean muscle mass can then be calculated. DEXA: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measures bone density. It uses X-rays to determine not only the percentage of body fat but also where and how much fat is located in the body. Skin calipers: This method measures the skinfold thickness of the layer of fat just under the skin in several parts of the body with calipers (a metal tool similar to forceps); the results are then used to calculate the percentage of body fat. Bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA): There are two methods of the BIA. One involves standing on a special scale with footpads. A harmless amount of electrical current is sent through the body, and then percentage of body fat is calculated. The other type of BIA involves electrodes that are typically placed on a wrist and an ankle and on the back of the right hand and on the top of the foot. The change in voltage between the electrodes is measured. The person's body fat percentage is then calculated from the results of the BIA. Early on, this method showed variable results. Newer equipment and methods of analysis seem to have improved this method."
Are weight-for-height tables useful to determine obesity?,"""Measuring a person's body fat percentage can be difficult, so other methods are often relied upon to diagnose obesity. Two widely used methods are weight-for-height tables and body mass index (BMI). While both measurements have their limitations, they are reasonable indicators that someone may have a weight problem. The calculations are easy, and no special equipment is required.""""Most people are familiar with weight-for-height tables. Although such tables have existed for a long time, in 1943, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company introduced their table based on policyholders' data to relate weight to disease and mortality. Doctors and nurses (and many others) have used these tables for decades to determine if someone is overweight. The tables usually have a range of acceptable weights for a person of a given height.""""One problem with using weight-for-height tables is that doctors disagree over which is the best table to use. Several versions are available. Many have different weight ranges, and some tables account for a person's frame size, age and sex, while other tables do not.""'A significant limitation of all weight-for-height tables is that they do not distinguish between excess fat and muscle. A very muscular person may be classified as obese, according to the tables, when he or she in fact is not.' "
What is the body mass index (BMI)?,"'The body mass index (BMI) is a now the measurement of choice for many physicians and researchers studying obesity.'""The BMI uses a mathematical formula that accounts for both a person's weight and height.""'The BMI measurement, however, poses some of the same problems as the weight-for-height tables. Not everyone agrees on the cutoff points for ""healthy"" versus ""unhealthy"" BMI ranges. BMI also does not provide information on a person\'s percentage of body fat. However, like the weight-for-height table, BMI is a useful general guideline and is a good estimator of body fat for most adults 19 and 70 years of age. However, it may not be an accurate measurement of body fat for bodybuilders, certain athletes, and ''pregnant'' women.'""The BMI equals a person's weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (BMI = kg/m""'2''). To calculate the BMI using pounds, divide the weight in pounds by the height in inches squared and multiply the result by 703.''It is important to understand what ""healthy weight"" means. Healthy weight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 19 and less than 25 among all people 20 years of age or over. Generally, obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 30, which approximates 30 pounds of excess weight.''The World Health Organization uses a classification system using the BMI to define overweight and obesity.''The table below has already done the math and metric conversions. To use the table, find the appropriate height in the left-hand column. Move across the row to the given weight. The number at the top of the column is the BMI for that height and weight.''Table Courtesy of the National Institutes of Health''Below is a table identifying the risk of associated disease according to BMI and waist size''.''* Disease risk for type 2 diabetes, ''hypertension'', and CVD.''+ Increased waist circumference can also be a marker for increased risk even in persons of normal weight.''Table Courtesy of the National Institutes of Health' A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is defined as a ""pre-obese."" A BMI of 30 to 34.99 is defined as ""obese class I."" A BMI of 35 to 39.99 is defined as ""obese class II."" A BMI of or greater than 40.00 is defined as ""obese class III."""
"Does it matter where body fat is located? (Is it worse to be an ""apple"" or a
""pear""?)","'Concern is directed not only at how much fat a person has but also where that fat is located on the body. The pattern of body fat distribution tends to differ in men and women.''In general, women collect fat in their hips and buttocks, giving their figures a ""pear"" shape. Men, on the other hand, usually collect fat around the belly, giving them more of an ""apple"" shape. (This is not a hard and fast rule; some men are pear-shaped and some women become apple-shaped, particularly after ''menopause''.)''Apple-shaped people whose fat is concentrated mostly in the abdomen are more likely to develop many of the health problems associated with obesity. They are at increased health risk because of their fat distribution. While obesity of any kind is a health risk, it is better to be a pear than an apple.'""In order to sort the types of fruit, doctors have developed a simple way to determine whether someone is an apple or a pear. The measurement is called waist-to-hip ratio. To find out a person's waist-to-hip ratio""'Women with waist-to-hip ratios of more than 0.8 and men with waist-to-hip ratios of more than 1.0 are ""apples.""'""Another rough way of estimating the amount of a person's ""'abdominal fat'' is by measuring the waist circumference. Men with a waist circumference of 40 inches or greater and women with a waist circumference of 35 inches or greater are considered to have increased health risks related to obesity.' measure the waist at its narrowest point, and then measure the hips at the widest point; divide the waist measurement by the hip measurement. For example, a woman with a 35-inch waist and 46-inch hips would have a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.76 (35 divided by 46 = 0.76)."
What can be done about obesity?,"'All too often, obesity prompts a strenuous diet in the hopes of reaching the ""ideal body weight."" Some amount of weight loss may be accomplished, but the lost weight usually quickly returns. Most people who lose weight regain the weight within five years. It is clear that a more effective, long-lasting treatment for obesity must be found.''We need to learn more about the causes of obesity, and then we need to change the ways we treat it. When obesity is accepted as a chronic disease, it will be treated like other chronic diseases such as diabetes and ''high blood pressure''. The treatment of obesity cannot be a short-term ""fix"" but has to be an ongoing lifelong process.''Obesity treatment must acknowledge that even modest weight loss can be beneficial. For example, a modest weight loss of 5%-10% of the initial weight, and long-term maintenance of that weight loss can bring significant health gains, including''It is not necessary to achieve an ""ideal weight"" to derive health benefits from obesity treatment. Instead, the goal of treatment should be to reach and hold to a ""healthier weight."" The emphasis of treatment should be to commit to the process of lifelong ''healthy living'', including eating more wisely and increasing physical activity.''In sum, the goal in dealing with obesity is to achieve and maintain a ""healthier weight.""' lowered blood pressure; reduced blood levels of cholesterol; reduced risk of type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes (In the Nurses Health Study, women who lost 5 kilograms [11 pounds] of weight reduced their risk of diabetes by 50% or more.); decreased chance of stroke; decreased complications of heart disease; decreased overall mortality."
What is the role of physical activity and exercise in obesity?,"'The National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES I) showed that people who engage in limited recreational activity were more likely to gain weight than more active people. Other studies have shown that people who engage in regular strenuous activity gain less weight than sedentary people.''Physical activity and exercise help ''burn'' calories. The amount of calories burned depends on the type, duration, and intensity of the activity. It also depends on the weight of the person. A 200-pound person will burn more calories ''running'' 1 mile than a 120-pound person, because the work of carrying those extra 80 pounds must be factored in. But exercise as a treatment for obesity is most effective when combined with a diet and weight-loss program. Exercise alone without dietary changes will have a limited effect on weight because one has to exercise a lot to simply lose 1 pound. However regular exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle to maintain a healthy weight for the long term. Another advantage of regular exercise as part of a weight-loss program is a greater loss of body fat versus lean muscle compared to those who diet alone.''Remember, these health benefits can occur independently (with or without) achieving weight loss. Before starting an exercise program, talk to a doctor about the type and intensity of the exercise program.''The following people should consult a doctor before vigorous exercise:' improved blood sugar control and increased insulin sensitivity (decreased insulin resistance), reduced triglyceride levels and increased ""good"" HDL cholesterol levels, lowered blood pressure, a reduction in abdominal fat, reduced risk of heart disease, release of endorphins that make people feel good. Perform 20-30 minutes of moderate exercise five to seven days a week, preferably daily. Types of exercise include stationary bicycling, walking or jogging on a treadmill, stair climbing machines, jogging, and swimming. Exercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions. Start slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury, excessive soreness, or fatigue. Over time, build up to 30-60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. People are never too old to start exercising. Even frail, elderly individuals (70-90 years of age) can improve their strength and balance. Men over age 40 or women over age 50 Individuals with heart or lung disease, asthma, arthritis, or osteoporosis Individuals who experience chest pressure or pain with exertion, or who develop fatigue or shortness of breath easily Individuals with conditions or lifestyle factors that increase their risk of developing coronary heart disease, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, high blood cholesterol, or having family members with early onset heart attacks and coronary heart disease A patient who is obese"
What is the role of diet in the treatment of obesity?,"'The first goal of ''dieting'' is to stop further weight gain. The next goal is to establish realistic weight-loss goals. While the ideal weight corresponds to a BMI of 20-25, this is difficult to achieve for many people. Thus, success is higher when a goal is set to lose 10%-15% of baseline weight as opposed to 20%-30% or greater. It is also important to remember that any weight reduction in an obese person would result in health benefits.'""One effective way to lose weight is to eat fewer calories. One pound is equal to 3,500 calories. In other words, you have to burn 3,500 more calories than you consume to lose 1 pound. Most adults need between 1,200-2,800 calories per day, depending on body size and activity level to meet the body's energy needs.""'If you skip that bowl of ice cream, then you will be one-seventh of the way to losing that pound! Losing 1 pound per week is a safe and reasonable way to take off extra pounds. The higher the initial weight of a person, the more quickly he/she will achieve weight loss. This is because for every 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight, approximately 22 calories are required to maintain that weight. So for a woman weighing 100 kilograms (220 pounds), he or she would require about 2,200 calories a day to maintain his or her weight, while a person weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds) would require only about 1,320 calories. If both ate a calorie-restricted diet of 1,200 calories per day, the heavier person would lose weight faster. Age also is a factor in calorie expenditure. Metabolic rate tends to slow as we age, so the older a person is, the harder it is to lose weight.''There is controversy in regard to carbohydrates (low carbohydrate diet) and weight loss. When carbohydrates are restricted, people often experience rapid initial weight loss within the first two weeks. This weight loss is due mainly to fluid loss. When carbohydrates are added back to the diet, weight gain often occurs, simply due to a regain of the fluid.''Other diets such as low-fat diets all show a similar pattern of weight loss that is difficult to maintain if there are not additional general lifestyle changes.''General diet guidelines for achieving and (just as importantly) maintaining a healthy weight'   A safe and effective long-term weight reduction and maintenance diet has to contain balanced, nutritious foods to avoid vitamin deficiencies and other diseases of malnutrition. Eat more nutritious foods that have ""low energy density."" Low energy dense foods contain relatively few calories per unit weight (fewer calories in a large amount of food). Examples of low energy dense foods include vegetables, fruits, lean meat, fish, grains, and beans. For example, you can eat a large volume of celery or carrots without taking in many calories. Eat less ""energy dense foods."" Energy dense foods are high in fats and simple sugars. They generally have a high calorie value in a small amount of food. The United States government currently recommends that a healthy diet should have less than 30% fat. Fat contains twice as many calories per unit weight than protein or carbohydrates. Examples of high-energy dense foods include red meat, egg yolks, fried foods, high fat/sugar fast foods, sweets, pastries, butter, and high-fat salad dressings. Also cut down on foods that provide calories but very little nutrition, such as alcohol, non-diet soft drinks, and many packaged high-calorie snack foods. About 55% of calories in the diet should be from complex carbohydrates. Eat more complex carbohydrates such as brown rice, whole-grain bread, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid simple carbohydrates such as table sugars, sweets, doughnuts, cakes, and muffins. Cut down on non-diet soft drinks, these sugary soft drinks are loaded with simple carbohydrates and calories. Simple carbohydrates cause excessive insulin release by the pancreas, and insulin promotes growth of fat tissue. Educate yourself in reading food labels and estimating calories and serving sizes. Consult a doctor before starting any dietary changes. You doctor or a nutritionist should prescribe the amount of daily calories in your diet."
What is the role of medication in the treatment of obesity?,"'Medication treatment of obesity should be used only in patients who have health risks related to obesity. Medications should be used in patients with a BMI greater than 30 or in those with a BMI of greater than 27 who have other medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high blood cholesterol) that put them at risk for developing heart disease. Medications should not be used for cosmetic reasons.''Medications should only be used as an adjunct to diet modifications and an exercise program.''Like diet and exercise, the goal of medication treatment has to be realistic. With successful medication treatment, one can expect an initial weight loss of at least 5 pounds during the first month of treatment, and a total weight loss of 10%-15% of the initial body weight. It is also important to remember that these medications only work when they are taken. When they are discontinued, weight gain often occurs.''The first class (category) of medication used for ''weight control'' cause symptoms that mimic the sympathetic nervous system. They cause the body to feel ""under ''stress''"" or ""nervous."" As a result, the major side effect of this class of medication is high blood pressure. This class of medication includes ''sibutramine'' (''Meridia'', which was taken off the market in the U.S. in October 2010 due to safety concerns) and ''phentermine'' (Adipex P). These medications also decrease appetite and create a sensation of fullness. Hunger and fullness (satiety) are regulated by brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. Examples of neurotransmitters include serotonin, norepinephrine, and ''dopamine''. Anti-obesity medications that suppress appetite do so by increasing the level of these neurotransmitters at the junction (called synapse) between nerve endings in the brain.''Phentermine (Fastin, Adipex P) -- the other half of fen/phen -- suppresses appetite by causing a release of norepinephrine in the body. Phentermine alone is still available for treatment of obesity but only on a short-term basis (a few weeks). The common side effects of phentermine include ''headache'', ''insomnia'', irritability, and nervousness. Fenfluramine (the fen of fen/phen) and dexfenfluramine (Redux) suppress appetite mainly by increasing release of serotonin by the cells. Both fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were withdrawn from the market in September 1997 because of association of these two medications with ''pulmonary hypertension'' (a rare but serious disease of the arteries in the ''lungs'') and association of fen/phen with damage to the heart valves. Since the withdrawal of fenfluramine, some have suggested combining phentermine with ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), a combination that has been referred to as phen/pro. However, no ''clinical trials'' have been conducted to confirm the safety and effectiveness of this combination. Therefore, this combination is not an accepted treatment for obesity.''The next class (category) of ''drugs'' changes the metabolism of fat. ''Orlistat'' (''Xenical'', ''alli'') is the only drug of this category that is U.S. FDA approved. This is a class of anti-obesity drugs called lipase inhibitors, or fat blockers. Fat from food can only be absorbed into the body after being broken up (a process called ''digestion'') by ''digestive enzymes'' called lipases in the ''intestines''. By inhibiting the action of lipase enzymes, orlistat prevents the intestinal absorption of fat by 30%. Drugs in this class do not affect brain chemistry. Theoretically, orlistat also should have minimal or no systemic side effects (side effects in other parts of the body) because the major locale of action is inside the gut lumen and very little of the drug is absorbed.''The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved orlistat capsules, branded as alli, as an ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) treatment for overweight adults in February 2007. The drug had previously been approved in 1999 as a prescription weight loss aid, whose brand name is Xenical. The OTC preparation has a lower dosage than prescription Xenical.''Orlistat is recommended only for people 18 years of age and over in combination with a diet and exercise regimen. People who have difficulties with the absorption of food or who are not overweight should not take orlistat. Overweight is defined by the U.S. National Institutes of Health as having a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or greater.''Orlistat can be taken up to three times a day, with each fat-containing meal. The drug may be taken during the meal or up to one hour after the meal. If the meal is missed or is very low in fat content, the medications should not be taken.''The most common side effects of orlistat are changes in bowel habits. These include ''gas'', the urgent need to have a bowel movement, oily bowel movements, oily discharge or ''spotting'' with bowel movements, an increased frequency of bowel movements, and the inability to control bowel movements. Women may also notice irregularities in the ''menstrual cycle'' while taking orlistat. Side effects are most common in the first few weeks after beginning to take orlistat. In some people, the side effects persist for as long as they are taking the drug.''People with diabetes, thyroid conditions, who have received an organ transplant, or who are taking prescription medications that affect blood clotting should check with their physician before using OTC orlistat (alli), since ''drug interactions'' with certain medications are possible.''A long-term decrease in fat absorption can cause deficiency of fat-soluble ''vitamins'' (such as ''vitamins'' A, D, E, K). Therefore, patients on orlistat should receive adequate vitamin supplementation.''In June 2012, the FDA approved ''Belviq'' (lorcaserin hydrochloride) as a weight-loss medication. The medication works by controlling appetite (via serotonin activation). According to the FDA data, nearly half the patients using the medication lost at least 5% of their starting weight, which is more than double that lost by patients in the control group. This was only true for patients without type 2 diabetes.''The medication is approved for patients who are obese (BMI >30) or overweight (BMQ >27) with one weight-related health issue. The predominant side effects were ''headache'' and ''dizziness'', as well as ''fatigue''. In patients with diabetes, ''low blood sugar'' was also a concern when taking Belviq.''Qsymia'' is the newest medication approved for weight loss. It is a combination of phentermine and extended-release ''topiramate''. As with the other medications, it is only approved for patients who are obese (BMI >30) or overweight (BMQ >27) with one weight-related health issue. According to the FDA data, a statistically significant greater proportion of the patients taking Qsymia achieved 5% and 10% weight loss. All patients in the study were also encouraged to eat a well-balanced, reduced-calorie diet.''It is important to note that Qsymia can lead to ''birth defects'', and it is important for women to know that they are not pregnant before starting the medication. Other possible serious side effects include increased heart rate, ''eye problems'' (''glaucoma''), and ''suicidal thoughts''. In patients with diabetes, low blood sugar was also a concern when taking Qsymia.''This is a combination drug of naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) and ''bupropion'' HCL (an ''antidepressant'' medication that is an inhibitor of the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine). The main side effects observed with this medication are ''nausea'', ''constipation'', and ''headaches''. The medication is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or a history of ''seizures''.''The medication is approved as an adjunct to dietary changes and increased physical activity in adults with an initial BMI of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with at least one comorbidity.''Saxenda'' was approved in late 2014 as a weight-loss drug in combination with physical activity and diet modifications. It is a once-a-day injection (not a pill) that mimics a hormone related to digestion and appetite control (GLP-1) that is used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It activates areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation.''Saxenda has been linked to thyroid tumors in rats and mice as well as ''pancreatitis'' in humans.''The medication is approved as an adjunct to dietary changes and increased physical activity in adults with an initial BMI of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with at least one comorbidity.' "
Is there an herbal fen/phen preparation?,"'Since the withdrawal of fen/phen from the market, ""herbal fen/phen"" has been proposed as an alternative in treating obesity. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning that ""herbal fen/phen"" has not been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for obesity and may contain ingredients that have been associated with injuries.''The main ingredients in most herbal fen/phen products are ''ephedrine'"" and St. John's wort. Ephedrine acts like ""'amphetamines'"" in stimulating the central nervous system and the heart. Ephedrine promotes weight loss in part by an increase the body's temperature, and when this happens, the body ""'burns'' more calories. Ephedrine use has been associated with high blood pressure, heart-rhythm irregularities, ''strokes'', ''insomnia'', seizures ''tremors'', and nervousness. There have been reports of deaths in young individuals taking ephedrine.' "
"Are meal substitutes, artificial sweeteners, and over-the-counter (OTC) products 
effective in treating obesity?","'When used as substitutes for regular meals, meal substitutes are a convenient way to reduce calories as part of a low-calorie diet plan. A typical meal substitute available in powder and liquid form is Slim-Fast. Ensure is another meal substitute available in both liquid and bars. Meal substitutes should provide protein and be low in fat and calories. The label should include the amount of calories per serving and the percentages of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. The total number of calories per serving is predetermined so it is easier to keep track of the daily consumption of calories. As with all dramatic changes in your diet, you should consult your health care provider to make sure that these changes will not have negative consequences.''Saccharin'"" (Sweet'N Low) and ""'aspartame'' (Equal) are sugar substitutes that provide little or no calories. They may be used as a substitute for table sugar. Using saccharin instead of a teaspoonful of sugar eliminates 33 calories from the diet. People with ''phenylketonuria'' (a serious ''genetic disease'' in which an individual is unable to break down and eliminate an amino acid, phenylalanine) should not use aspartame because it contains phenylalanine.''Fructose, ''sorbitol'', and xylitol may be used as alternatives to sugar, but they provide more calories than saccharin and aspartame. Excessive use of sorbitol also may cause ''diarrhea''.''Despite claims by manufacturers, the use of OTC products alone does not cause weight loss. Herbal weight-loss products or preparations called ""fat burners"" are even more misleading. These products may contain a combination of ma huang (a botanical source of ephedrine), white willow (a source of salicin), ''Hoodia gordonii'', and/or ''guarana'' or kola nut (a source of ''caffeine''). These agents are ''stimulants'', which theoretically increase the metabolism and help the body break down fat. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that they are effective for weight loss. In addition, ma huang has been linked to serious side effects such as ''heart attacks'', seizures, and death. Chromium also is a popular ingredient in weight-loss products, but there is no evidence that chromium has any effect on weight loss.''Weight-loss teas contain strong botanical laxatives (''Senna'', cascara sagrada) and diuretics (''Rhamnus purshiana'') that cause ''diarrhea'' and ''loss of water'' from the body. ''Diarrhea'' and water loss lead to the depletion of sodium and potassium and can lead to ''dehydration'"". Although an individual's weight may decrease, the loss is due to a decrease in fluid and is only temporary. Moreover, low sodium and potassium levels may cause ""'abnormal heart rhythms'' and can even lead to death.''Guar gum preparations have also been promoted as a weight-loss agent. Guar gum is thought to work by leading to a feeling of fullness early in the meal. It has not been scientifically proven and has been associated with ''abdominal pain'', gas, and diarrhea.''All of the OTC products discussed above are not considered drugs and are therefore not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. As a result, there is little information on their effectiveness or safety. You should discuss any OTC weight loss products you are planning on taking or are taking with a health care professional.''It cannot be overemphasized that a successful program needs to be built on dietary and lifestyle changes.'

What is the role of weight loss surgery in the treatment of obesity?,"'The National Institute of Health consensus has suggested the following guidelines for ''weight loss surgery'' in obese patients:'""A study done in Sweden compared the rates of diabetes and hypertension in two groups of obese patients: those who underwent surgery and those who didn't. Each group had similar body weight at baseline (the start of the study). At two years, diabetes and high blood pressure were lower in the patients treated with surgery.""'Surgical procedures of the upper gastrointestinal tract are collectively called bariatric surgery. The initial surgeries performed were the jejunocolic bypass and the jejunoileal bypass (where the small bowel is diverted to the large bowel, bypassing a lot of the surface area where food would have been absorbed). These procedures were fraught with problems and are no longer performed. Currently, procedures used include making the stomach area smaller or bypassing the stomach completely.''Currently, there are basically two types of bariatric surgery:''Restrictive surgeries'': These surgeries restrict the size of the stomach and slow down digestion.''Malabsorptive/restrictive surgeries'': These surgeries restrict the size of the stomach but also bypass or remove part of your ''digestive system'' to decrease absorption of food/calories.''In the cases of making the stomach smaller, vertically banded gastroplasty is the most common procedure, where the ''esophagus'' is banded early in the stomach. The other procedure is ''gastric banding'', where an inflatable pouch causes gastric constriction. Changing the volume in the ring that encircles the stomach can change the amount of constriction. Gastric bypass essentially causes weight loss by bypassing the stomach.''The most common malabsorptive surgery is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, in which the stomach is stapled to create a small pouch, and then part of the intestine is attached to this pouch to decrease food absorption.''The surgical treatment of obesity and the surgical procedures are evolving constantly and frequently are done by laparoscopic methods (using tiny incisions and a camera to carry out the surgery). Although these procedures are becoming more routine, the mortality rate for these procedures is still between 0.5%-2% with a significant incidence of complications.''The risks of surgery include the usual complications of infection, ''blood clots'' in the lower extremities (''deep vein thrombosis'') and in the lungs (''pulmonary embolism''), and anesthesia risk. Specific long-term risks related to obesity surgery include ''lack of iron'' absorption and ''iron deficiency anemia''. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also develop and could lead to nerve damage (neuropathies). Rapid weight loss may also be associated with ''gallstones''. Bariatric surgery should be performed at a center with a whole weight-loss program in place that includes dieticians and therapists and follow-up care.'  Patients with a BMI of greater than 40 (morbid obesity) Patients with a BMI of greater than 35 who have serious medical problems such as sleep apnea that would improve with weight loss"
How can people choose a safe and successful weight-loss program?,"'Scientists have made tremendous strides in understanding obesity and in improving the medication treatment of this important disease. In time, better, safer, and more effective obesity medications will be available. But currently there is still no ""magic cure"" for obesity. The best and safest way to lose fat and keep it off is through a commitment to a lifelong process of proper diet and regular exercise. Medications should be considered helpful adjuncts to diet and exercise for patients whose health risk from obesity clearly outweigh the potential side effects of the medications. Medications should be prescribed by doctors familiar with the patients\' conditions and with the use of the medications. Medication(s) and other ""herbal"" preparations with unproven effectiveness and safety should be avoided.''Almost any of the commercial weight-loss programs can work but only if they motivate you sufficiently to decrease the amount of calories you eat or increase the amount of calories you burn each day (or both). What elements of a weight-loss program should a consumer look for in judging its potential for safe and successful weight loss? A responsible and safe weight-loss program should be able to document for you the five following features:''Obesity is a chronic condition. Too often it is viewed as a temporary problem that can be treated for a few months with a strenuous diet. However, as most overweight people know, weight control must be considered a lifelong effort. To be safe and effective, any weight-loss program must address the long-term approach or else the program is largely a waste of time, money, and energy.''Maintaining your ideal body weight is a balancing act between food consumption and calories needed by the body for energy. You are what you eat. The kinds and amounts of food you eat affect your ability to maintain your ideal weight and to lose weight.'""Medical science has established that eating proper foods can influence health for all age groups. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's current dietary guidelines state the following:"" The diet should be safe. It should include all of the recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for vitamins, minerals, and protein. The weight-loss diet should be low in calories (energy) only, not in essential foodstuffs. The weight-loss program should be directed toward a slow, steady weight loss unless your doctor feels your health condition would benefit from more rapid weight loss. Expect to lose only about a pound a week after the first week or two. With many calorie-restricted diets there is an initial rapid weight loss during the first one to two weeks, but this loss is largely fluid. If you plan to lose more than 15 to 20 pounds, have any health problems, or take medication on a regular basis, you should be evaluated by your doctor before beginning your weight-loss program. A doctor can assess your general health and any medical conditions that might be affected by dieting and weight loss. Also, a physician should be able to advise you on the need for weight loss, the appropriateness of the weight-loss program, and a sensible goal of weight loss for you. If you plan to use a very low-calorie diet (a special liquid formula diet that replaces all food intake for one to four months), you should do so under the close supervision of a health care professional. Your program should include plans for weight maintenance after the weight-loss phase is over. It is of little benefit to lose a large amount of weight only to regain it. Weight maintenance is the most difficult part of controlling weight and is not consistently implemented in weight-loss programs. The program you select should include help in permanently changing your dietary habits and level of physical activity, and to alter a lifestyle that may have contributed to weight gain in the past. Your program should provide behavior modification help, including education in healthy eating habits and long-term plans to deal with weight problems. One of the most important factors in maintaining weight loss appears to be increasing daily physical activity. Try to be more active throughout the day and incorporate some simple calorie burners into your everyday routine. Even the most basic activities (such as taking an after-dinner walk, using the stairs at the mall or office instead of taking an escalator or elevator, park your car farther away so you have a longer walk) can get you prepared for more regular exercise like walking or jogging. You may choose to incorporate an individually tailored exercise program into your schedule. A commercial weight-loss program should provide a detailed statement of fees and costs of additional items such as dietary supplements. Eat a variety of foods. Balance the food you eat with physical activity -- maintain or improve your weight. Choose a diet with plenty of grain products, vegetables, and fruits. Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Choose a diet moderate in sugars. Choose a diet moderate in salt and sodium. If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation."
How common is a foreign body in the ear? Is it serious?,"'Foreign objects in the ear are common reasons for emergency room visits, especially in children.'""If a you aren't sure of the potential for harm of the foreign body, seek medical care immediately."" The majority of these things are harmless. Some are extremely uncomfortable (insects or sharp objects) and some can rapidly produce an infection (food or organic matter) requiring emergency treatment."
What types of objects get stuck in the ear?,"'Most objects that get stuck in the ear canal are placed there by the person themselves. Children who are curious about their bodies and interesting objects, are the group most often has this problem (children aged 9 months to 8 years).''The most common things they put in their ears include:''Earwax'':'' Earwax is a naturally occurring substance in the ear canal but can become a problem when it builds up to the point that it clogs the ear canal, and causes ''hearing loss'' or ''pain''. Overuse of cotton swabs such as Q-tips to clean the ear can actually push wax and skin cell debris further into the canal and pack it against the eardrum causing symptoms.''Insects:'"" Insects can also fly or crawl into the ear canal. Usually this happens while sleeping on the floor or outdoors (for example, camping). This is often a frightening and dramatic event as the insect's buzzing and movement is very loud and sometimes painful.""   Beads Food (especially beans) Paper Cotton swabs Rubber erasers Small toys Marbles Small shells"
What are symptoms and signs of a foreign body in ear?,"'Pain'', inflammation, and irritation: ''The skin in the ear canal and the eardrum is very sensitive. Any inflammation or injury is usually readily apparent due to pain or irritation.''In young children:'' The diagnosis can be challenging in young children who are not old enough to verbalize their pain. Redness, swelling, or discharge (blood, inflammatory fluid, or pus) are the main signs of injury to the ear. Small children often scratch or rub the ear repeatedly.''Earwax impaction:'' If impacted earwax is the cause you may experience symptoms of a ""fullness"" or pressure, and a decrease in ''hearing'' on the affected side. In extreme cases, ''dizziness'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', or unsteady ''walking'' results from inflammation of the ear or build-up of pressure on the eardrum causing dysfunction of their middle ear.'  "
How do you remove a foreign body from your ear?,'If the item is very small you can try to gently shake it out. Pulling the back of the ear (the pinna) gently toward the back of the head straightens out the ear canal and the foreign body may roll or slide out with a gentle shake of the ear. Do not strike your head on the opposite side to try to dislodge the stuck item.'  
When should you call a doctor or other health care professional if you have something foreign in your ear?,"'The vast majority of foreign bodies in the ear are not true medical emergencies. Call a doctor or other health care professional if something is in your ear, but the symptoms are minor. This can usually wait until the morning if the office is closed.''Organic material (bugs, plants, or food) should be removed promptly due to the possibility of swelling of the material and rapid onset of infection.'""If you have a swollen (inflamed) ear that's red and is displaced outward, ""'fever'', discharge, bleeding, or increasing pain; see a doctor urgently. If the object in the ear is a battery, seek medical attention immediately. If you are unsure of the severity of the injury, see a doctor.' Insects should be removed quickly as they cause distressing symptoms and great discomfort, and can sting or bite causing further damage. A few drops of mineral oil may be placed in the ear canal prior to going to the doctor to kill the insect and stop the buzzing or scraping sensation on the eardrum. Button-type batteries from household gadgets or watches are particularly dangerous and need to be removed as soon as possible as they may leak chemicals that can burn and severely damage the ear canal even within an hour."
How can a doctor or other medical professional tell if there is something in your ear?,"'A doctor or other health care professional usually can see the foreign body by directly looking in the ear with an instrument called an otoscope. A magnifying light with a ''plastic'' cone tip is slid into the ear canal to look at the structures inside. In cases involving children, it is important to realize there may be more than one foreign body, and other orifices (other ear, mouth, nose and rectum) also may need to be examined. Once the object is seen, there are many ways of retrieving it.' "
How do you remove a foreign body deep in your ear?,"'Foreign bodies stuck deep in the ear:'"" If the item is deeper in the ear than can be seen with the naked eye, a qualified medical professional should remove it. Don't stick anything into the ear to remove an object yourself, as you may push it in further and cause damage or rupture of the eardrum or scratch the skin of the ear canal.""""At the doctor's office or in the emergency room the foreign body can be removed using several techniques. (Don't try these at home.)""'Small children: '""Small children don't tolerate painful or scary interventions, and may need to be sedated medically to have foreign bodies removed from their ears. Often with children, the first try is the most successful, as subsequent attempts to remove an object can be painful and frightening to the child.""'Insects and bugs:'' Insects in the ear canal are often killed with either ''lidocaine'' (an anesthetic) or mineral oil. They are then flushed out with gentle warm water irrigation.''Antibiotics:'' After the foreign body is removed the doctor may put the patient on antibiotic drops for five days to a week to prevent infection from ''trauma'' to the ear canal.' Modified tweezers or forceps can be used to reach in and grab the object with the help of an otoscope so important structures are not damaged. Gentle suction can be used to suck out the object. Irrigation of the canal with warm water and a small catheter can flush certain materials out of the canal and clean out debris. Some doctors have devised ingenious and novel ways to remove objects from ear canals."
What are some other types of ear emergencies?," Ruptured tympanic membrane (eardrum) can be a result of foreign bodies, middle ear infection, or pressure trauma to the ear. Often the patient feels pain, notices a thin bloody discharge from the ear, and has a decreased sense of hearing. If a person experiences these symptoms and thinks the eardrum may be ruptured or damaged, keep the ear dry, and seek medical care. Do not place cotton swabs, liquids, or other objects in ear. Acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear) is an infection of the outer ear canal that is usually caused by irritation of the canal skin that is made worse by water remaining in the ear canal after swimming or bathing. Cellulitis (skin infection) causes the ear canal to turn red and swell. The ear becomes very painful and a thin yellow fluid (infected pus) comes out of the canal. Some patients experience pain with mouth opening and chewing because of inflammation in the ear canal. The infection can spread to the side of the face or the lymph glands in the neck. Treatment of swimmer's ear includes antibiotic drops and, in severe cases, IV or oral antibiotics. Earwax impaction is usually a harmless cause of decreased hearing. Wax is formed in the ear canals naturally. Individuals who over-aggressively clean their ears with cotton swabs can push wax further into the canal, impacting (compressing) it against the ear drum. Over-the-counter (OTC) products, like carbamide peroxide (Auro, Debrox, Murine Earwax Drops) can be used to clean the ear regularly. If the wax impaction is causing pain, decreased hearing or dizziness, a doctor can irrigate (flush) the wax out of the ear gently with warm water and peroxide. If a person has chronic problems with earwax buildup, discuss long-term solutions with an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist (an otolaryngologist)."
Facts you should know about obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),"   Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of a number of obsessive compulsive and related disorders that has irresistible ideas or images (obsessions) and/or specific rituals/behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) that may be driven by obsessions as characteristics of the illness. OCD occurs in a small percentage of populations worldwide in every culture. The average age for OCD to begin is 19 years of age, and it usually begins by the time the individual is 30 years old. People with OCD are at risk for also suffering from anxiety disorders. While there is no known specific cause for OCD, having other family members with the condition and an imbalance of the brain chemical serotonin increase the likelihood of OCD occurring. A health care professional diagnoses OCD by looking for signs and symptoms of this and other emotional problems, as well as assessing for the presence for a medical condition that might be a contributing to developing the disorder. OCD most likely improves when treated with a combination of behavior therapies like exposure and ritual prevention, group or individual cognitive behavioral therapy, and medications. Although not thought to be as effective in treating OCD symptoms as clomipramine (Anafranil), SSRIs are the group of medications that physicians most often use to treat this illness since the SSRIs tend to cause fewer side effects. SSRIs work by increasing the activity of serotonin in the brain. When the combination of psychotherapy and SSRI treatment does not produce adequate symptom relief, doctors may add a neuroleptic medication to improve the treatment outcome. For some people with severe OCD, deep brain stimulation can be helpful, and researchers continue to study treatment with hallucinogen medications. Although the symptoms of OCD may last indefinitely, the prognosis for OCD sufferers is best when the person's symptoms are milder and have been present for a short time, and the OCD sufferer has no other emotional problems. If left untreated, OCD can worsen to the point that the sufferer develops physical problems, becomes unable to function, or experiences suicidal thoughts. About 1% of OCD sufferers die by suicide."
"What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and what are OCD symptoms 
and signs?","'A departure from its classification in the previous edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-IV-TR''), where it was grouped with ''anxiety'' disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is now classified as one of a number of obsessive compulsive and related disorders in the ''DSM-5'"". Repeated obsessions and/or compulsions that interfere with the sufferer's ability to function in their relationships, at work or in school, either because of all the time that is consumed by the symptoms or the marked apprehension, fear or other distress suffered by the person characterize OCD. Other separate kinds of obsessive compulsive and related disorders include ""'body dysmorphic disorder'"" (preoccupation with at least one perceived flaw in one's physical appearance that others do not observe); hoarding disorder (chronic difficulty discarding possessions); ""'trichotillomania'' (hair-pulling disorder); excoriation disorder (skin picking), as well as OCD and related disorders that are caused by a medical condition or exposure to a substance.''Obsessions are recurrently intrusive or unrelenting, unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that may cause severe ''anxiety'"". These ideas are irresistible to the OCD sufferer despite the person's usually understanding that these ideas are irrational. That understanding may lead to their feeling guilt at being unable to resist having the ideas. Examples of obsessions include sexual obsessions, religious obsessions (scrupulosity), fear of germs/worries about cleanliness, or worries about safety or order. A compulsion is a ritualistic or otherwise repetitive behavior or mental act that the individual with OCD engages in, because of their obsessions or according to rigid rules. Obsessive thoughts may cause compulsions like excessive hand washing, skin picking, lock checking, repeatedly going over intrusive thoughts, meaningless counting, repetition of one's own words, repeatedly arranging items, or other repetitive actions. Compulsive hoarding is also a manifestation of OCD.""'In contrast to the repetitive behaviors of compulsions, habits are actions that occur with little to no thought, occur routinely, are not caused by an obsession, are not excessively time-consuming, and do not result in ''stress''. Examples of habits include cracking knuckles or storing a wallet in a purse or pocket.''Medicinal writings have described OCD for at least the past century. Statistics on how many people in the United States have OCD range from 1%-2%, or more than 2 million adults. About one in 200 children and adolescents, or half a million minors, have OCD. Interestingly, how often this condition occurs and the symptoms involved are remarkably similar across cultures. While it often starts in childhood and adolescence, the average age of onset of the disorder is 19 years of age. OCD usually develops by 30 years of age, afflicting more males than females.''Children with OCD do not always realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable. They might have tantrums when prevented from completing rituals. Also in contrast to adults, children and teenagers tend to develop physical complaints like ''tiredness'', ''headaches'', and stomach upset when afflicted with OCD.''People with OCD are at risk for also developing chronic hair pulling (trichotillomania) or muscle or vocal ''tics'' ('""Tourette's""' disorder). People who have both '""Tourette's""' or another tic disorder and OCD are more likely to suffer from more OCD symptoms, like aggressive, religious or sexual obsessions, and certain compulsions than do those who do not have tics with their OCD. OCD sufferers are also more likely to develop an eating disorder like ''anorexia'' or ''bulimia'', or mood problems, like ''depression'', ''generalized anxiety disorder'', ''panic attacks'', and full-blown ''panic disorder''. This ''mental illness'' also increases the risk of sufferers having excessive concerns about their bodies (somatoform disorders) like ''hypochondriasis'', which is excessive worry about having a serious illness. People with OCD are more vulnerable to having ''bipolar disorder'', also called ''manic'' ''depression''.''While it is sometimes confused with OCD, characteristics of obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) include perfectionism and an unyielding expectation that the sufferer and others will adhere to a rigid set of rules. People with OCPD do not tend to engage in compulsions. However, people with OCD are at higher risk for developing OCPD than those without OCD.'  "
What causes obsessive-compulsive disorder?,"'While there is no clear cause for OCD, family history and possible chemical imbalances in the brain contribute to developing the illness. While people who have relatives with the illness are at a higher risk of developing OCD, most people with the condition have no such family history. A specific genetic variation of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene potentially doubles the chances of a person developing OCD in general, as well as having a significant association with developing this disorder at an early age. An imbalance of the chemical serotonin in the brain may also contribute to the development of this disorder. Certain life stressors, like being the victim of childhood sexual abuse, is a risk factor for developing OCD during adulthood.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose obsessive-compulsive disorder?,"'Some health care professionals will give a self-test of screening questions to people whom they suspect may have OCD. One such scale, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), is a widely accepted measure of OCD symptoms. In addition to looking for symptoms of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors by conducting a ''mental health'"" interview and mental status examination, mental health practitioners will explore the possibility that an emotional disorder instead of or in addition to OCD cause the person's symptoms. For example, people with ""'addiction'' often have obsessive thoughts or compulsions, but those characteristics usually just involve the addiction. Individuals who suffer from narcissism may have obsessions, but those tend to be limited to self-obsession. The professional will also likely ensure that a medical examination and any other necessary tests consider whether there is any medical issue that could be causing any of the signs or symptoms of OCD.' "
What are the treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder?,"'Most individuals with OCD have some symptoms of the disorder indefinitely, comprised of times of improvement alternating with times of increased symptoms. The prognosis for this disorder is most favorable for sufferers who have milder symptoms that have occurred for less time and who have no other medical or mental-health issues prior to developing OCD.''Treatment of OCD includes cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, behavioral therapies, and medications. Behavioral therapies for OCD include systematic desensitization therapy, aversion therapy, rational emotive ''behavior therapy'', and ritual prevention and exposure therapy. Prevention of rituals involves a mental-health professional helping the person with OCD endure longer and longer periods of resisting the urge to engage in compulsive behaviors. Exposure and response prevention therapy is a type of behavior modification that involves the individual getting in touch with situations that tend to increase their urge to perform compulsions then helping the person resist that urge. Cognitive/behavioral therapy begins with psycho-education of the OCD sufferer regarding their illness and works towards changing the negative ways of thinking and behaving associated with the ''anxiety'' involved with obsessive-compulsive disorder.''Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the medications that doctors prescribe most often to treat OCD. These medications increase the amount of the neurochemical serotonin in the brain. (Brain serotonin levels are low in OCD.) SSRIs work by selectively inhibiting (blocking) serotonin reuptake in the brain, specifically at the synapse, the place where brain cells (neurons) connect to each other. Serotonin is one of the brain chemicals that carries messages across synapses from one neuron to another.''SSRIs work by keeping serotonin present in high concentrations in the synapses. These medications do so by preventing the reuptake of serotonin back into the nerve cell that is transmitting an impulse. Since the reuptake of serotonin is responsible for turning off the production of new serotonin, the serotonin message keeps on coming through. This helps activate cells that have been deactivated by OCD, thereby relieving the symptoms of the condition.''SSRIs have fewer side effects than clomipramine, which is an older medication that is somewhat more effective in treating OCD but might cause ''orthostatic hypotension'' (a sudden drop in ''blood pressure'' when sitting up or standing that can cause ''fainting'') and ''heart''-rhythm disturbances. Therefore, SSRIs are often the first-line treatment for this disorder. Examples of SSRIs include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''fluvoxamine'' (''Luvox''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix), and vilazodone (Viibryd). When the improvement that people with OCD experience is not optimal when an SSRI is the only medication prescribed, the addition of a neuroleptic medication like ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), or lurasidone (''Latuda'') can sometimes help.''Some studies show that SNRI medications like ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), and ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq'') can be an effective alternative to SSRIs. These medications increase the amount of the neurochemicals serotonin, epinephrine and norepinephrine in the brain. Some mental health prescribers use ''buspirone'' (Buspar) to treat OCD and related disorders, particularly when added to other medications in an attempt to improve the response of people who did not improve optimally to one medication. However, this medication is not a primary treatment for these disorders.''Patients generally tolerate SSRIs well, and side effects are usually mild. The most common side effects include ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', ''agitation'', ''insomnia'', and ''headache''. However, these side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use. Some individuals experience sexual side effects, like decreased sexual desire (libido), delayed ''orgasm'', or an inability to have an orgasm. Some patients develop ''tremors'' with SSRIs. The so-called serotonergic (meaning caused by serotonin) syndrome is a serious neurologic condition associated with the use of this group of medications that is characterized by high ''fevers'', ''seizures'', and heart-rhythm disturbances. This condition is very rare, and physicians have only reported this in very sick psychiatric patients taking multiple psychiatric medications.''Newer, often called atypical, neuroleptic medications like the ones named above tend to cause fewer side effects than many of the older medications in this class. The most common side effects of atypical neuroleptics include sleepiness, ''dizziness'', ''dry mouth'', and ''weight gain''. Sometimes, people can be more sensitive to the effects of the sun while taking these medications and therefore should be sure to wear adequate sunblock whenever exposed to the sun. Less commonly, side effects of atypical neuroleptic medications can result in painless, although abnormal, muscle movements like ''tremors'', ''stiffness'', and very rarely a syndrome of permanent muscle twitches called ''tardive dyskinesia''.''Mood stabilizers like ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), ''divalproex'' sodium (''Depakote''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'') sometimes treat OCD, particularly in individuals who also suffer from ''bipolar disorder''. The side effects that professionals look for tend to vary depending on the prescribed medication. Professionals tend to watch for mild side effects like sleepiness when using Depakote or Tegretol or stomach upset when using any of these medications. Professionals also monitor patients for serious side effects like severely low white blood cell count with Tegretol or severe autoimmune reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome with Depakote or Lamictal. While ''lithium'' remains a hallmark treatment for ''bipolar disorder'', particularly in adults, studies have not indicated significant benefit for its use in treating OCD.''Studies on the effectiveness of treatment of OCD in adults have variable results. Some indicate that medications, response prevention, and ''CBT'' are equally, although only mildly to moderately, effective in treating this problem. Cognitive behavioral group psychotherapy (CBGT) is an effective treatment for OCD.''Research on treating OCD in children and adolescents indicates that while medications are clearly effective in treating this disorder, the improvement that is experienced is quite mild. However, clomipramine tends to be more effective than the SSRIs, and the individual SSRIs tend to be equally effective as each other. Similar to adults, people under 18 years of age tend to improve more significantly when treated with a combination of medication and CBT. There is increasing evidence that deep brain stimulation may be effective in treating severe OCD that has not responded to other treatments. ''Clinical trials'' on OCD are primarily focusing on novel ways of understanding the illness and developing new ways to help treatment-resistant patients. For people who are severely disabled by their OCD symptoms, brain surgical and stimulation procedures are a focus of research.' "
What happens if OCD is not treated? What are complications of obsessive-compulsive disorder?,"""Without treatment, the severity of OCD can worsen to the point that it consumes the sufferer's life. Specifically, it can inhibit their ability to attend school, keep a job, and/or can lead to social isolation. Many people with this condition consider killing themselves, and about 1% die by ""'suicide''.'""Regarding the prognosis for the specific symptoms, it is rare for any to progress to a physically debilitating level. However, problems like compulsive hand washing can eventually cause complications like the skin becoming dry and even breaking down, and trichotillomania can result in unsightly scabs on the person's ""'scalp''.' "
What is the prognosis for obsessive-compulsive disorder?,"'While in about 40% of people diagnosed with OCD the symptoms tend to persist indefinitely to some degree, most are only mildly to moderately affected by those symptoms if adequately treated. People who have the symptoms of this condition longer prior to being diagnosed and treated are both at higher risk of having more severe OCD and of developing other mental health illnesses (co-morbidity) in the future. Youth with OCD are at risk for having academic difficulties, participating in fewer recreational activities, and experiencing problems with peer relationships.' "
Is it possible to prevent obsessive-compulsive disorder?,"'OCD is best prevented through early recognition and treatment. Specifically, recognizing warning signs that a child may be at risk for developing this illness can be a place to start. Examples of such early warning signs include excessive complaints by or agitation of (hypersensitivity) the child that certain clothes or food textures are intolerable, specific food aversion, as well as the child engaging in rigid patterns of behavior.' "

What is an occipital neuralgia headache?,"'Occipital neuralgia'' is a form of ''headache'' that causes ''pain'' along the upper neck and back of the head. The ''pain'' is in the distribution of the nerves known as occipital nerves (sensory nerves that run from the upper part of the neck to the back of the head).''The ''pain'' of an occipital neuralgia ''headache'' can be;''Sometimes, this condition is referred to as occipital neuritis, suggesting there are some associated inflammatory changes that have affected the occipital nerves.'   throbbing, aching, burning, or can feel sharp and stabbing."
Where is the pain and other symptoms of an occipital neuralgia headache?,"'Pain'' along the neck where it meets the skull, as well as ''pain along the back of the head ''and neck people with occipital neuralgia usually have.''If the pain caused by occipital neuralgia travels along the side of the head to the face, it might initially be mistaken for a condition known as ''trigeminal neuralgia'' . However, physical examination and assessment of the history of the pain should reveal important differences that will help lead to the correct diagnosis. '   The pain might be one-sided or bilateral (located on both sides of the head). The pain might be sharp or stabbing, or feel like an electric shock along the nerve. Sometimes the pain is a dull aching or throbbing. The pain often can travel along the side of the head, sometimes as far forward as the forehead. There can be some symptoms that are frequently seen with migraine headache or other headaches, including sensitivity to light or sound, or scalp tenderness. People with an occipital neuralgia headache may have increased pain when moving their neck."
What causes and triggers an occipital neuralgia headache?,"'The cause of occipital neuralgia is poorly understood. It is thought to occur when the occipital nerves become irritated or inflamed. There can be many different causes and triggers of this nerve irritation, including;''Infrequent causes of this type of ''headache'' can include;' whiplash or other injury to the neck, injury to the back of the head, muscle spasm or recurrent muscle tightness, arthritis of the cervical spine, or other structural changes to the upper cervical spine. diabetes, infection, or inflammation of different blood vessels."
What procedures and tests diagnose an occipital neuralgia headache?,"'There is no test to specifically diagnose or confirm occipital neuralgia. The diagnosis is made on physical examination findings such as a marked tenderness to pressure along the occipital nerve; palpation of this region often will reproduce or worsen the pain that the patient is experiencing. If the patient has tenderness over the distribution of the greater occipital nerve is important in making this diagnosis. There may be some associated muscle tightness or spasm in the neck region. Some doctors perform a nerve block using a local anesthetic to see if this will eliminate or relieve the pain, helping to confirm the diagnosis. ''X-rays'' of the neck, ''CT scan'', or ''MRI'' scan may be ordered if there is a concern that some underlying problem is causing the symptoms.' "
Will a ketogenic (keto) diet help reduce inflammation and pain from an occipital neuralgia headache?,"'The ''ketogenic diet'' is a high-fat ''diet'' that drastically restricts carbohydrates. It produces a reaction in the body that is similar to fasting. The low-carb, high-fat ''keto diet'' causes the metabolic state known as ketosis, in which substances known as ketones or ketone bodies accumulate in the blood. These are the same substances that accumulate during ''ketoacidosis'' (a medical emergency) in people with ''type 1 diabetes''.''A ketogenic ''diet'' has been shown to be effective in treating ''seizure disorders'' that have not responded to two different antiseizure medications. While this treatment is most often used in children, some adults with ''seizure'' disorders may also be helped by a ketogenic diet. Recent studies have explored the ability for ketogenic diets to reduce inflammation and pain from an occipital neuralgia.''A ketogenic diet is typically not recommended for ''weight control'' because it is not superior to other more standard ''weight management'' plans and may be associated with health risks, including nutritional deficiencies.''Most ketogenic diets permit foods high in saturated fat, including;''Usually, a keto genic diet also includes unsaturated ''fats'' like;' processed meats, fatty cuts of meat, for example; red meat,  lard, and  butter. oily fish,  nuts,  seeds, and  plant oils."
"What medications, treatments, and surgery reduce pain from an occipital neuralgia headache?","'If the pain persists, daily medications to help calm the nerve may be used. These medications can include anti-''seizure'' medications or ''antidepressants''. Occipital ''nerve blocks'' using an injection of a local anesthetic and a steroid agent may be performed. These often are quite successful in relieving the ''chronic pain'' for several weeks or months at a time.''When combined with physical therapy, daily stretching and strengthening exercises, and other conservative measures, people with this type of ''headache'' can often do well for many weeks or months at a time. Some people find that a one-time course of physical therapy or a single nerve block alleviates their pain completely.''If the pain from an occipital neuralgia ''headache'' fails to respond to conservative treatment options, there are several more invasive therapies that have been shown to be successful. These include:''Decompression surgery to open the area around the nerve also can be performed.''Although a specific cure for occipital neuralgia does not exist, there are many effective symptomatic treatment options.'   Rhizotomy (destroying the nerve root to eliminate the pain) Neurolysis (applying heat, freezing the nerve, or applying different chemicals to the nerve to block the transmission through the nerve) Implanting an occipital nerve stimulator (similar to a TENS unit)."
What natural home therapies help relieve head and scalp pain from an occipital neuralgia headache?,"'The medical treatment for occipital neuralgia can vary. Often, conservative treatments are used as first-line options, including;' heat, massage, rest, physical therapy, muscle relaxants, and anti-inflammatory medications."
Can occiptal neuralgia be cured?,"'For most people, conservative therapy or occipital ''nerve blocks'' are quite effective in relieving their pain. For others, more invasive therapies can be quite successful. As with many other conditions, the response to treatments can vary widely. This type of ''headache'' does not lead to other neurological conditions or nerve problems, even if left untreated.' "

This type of headache does not lead to other neurological conditions or nerve problems, even if left untreated.' "
What is a fecal occult blood test?,"'Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is testing that is performed on samples of ''stool'' in order to detect occult blood (blood that is not visible to the naked eye) in otherwise normal-colored ''stool''. Fecal occult blood usually is a result of slow (often intermittent) bleeding from inside the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. The slow bleed does not change the color of the stool or result in visible bright red blood. Therefore, the blood is found only by testing the stool for blood in the laboratory. Occult bleeding has many of the same causes as other forms of more rapid gastrointestinal bleeding, such as ''rectal bleeding'' (passage of red blood and/or ''blood clots'' rectally) and melena (black tarry stool as a result of bleeding from the upper ''intestines'' such as ulcers). Please read the ''Rectal Bleeding'' article for a more detailed explanation of different patterns of gastrointestinal bleeding. ' "
Why is fecal occult blood testing done?,"'A fecal occult blood test is done primarily to detect\xa0''colon cancer'' in people without intestinal symptoms. ''Cancers'' of the colon are common and frequently produce fecal occult blood long before they cause other symptoms such as ''abdominal pain'', rectal bleeding, or changes in bowel habits. In addition, some precursors of colon ''cancer'', specifically, some types of ''colon polyps'', also may bleed slowly and cause fecal occult blood. By finding the cancers early through fecal occult blood testing when the cancers are small and before they ''metastasize'' (spread to distant organs), patients may be cured of their cancers by removing them surgically. By removing ''precancerous'' polyps that are found through fecal occult blood testing, ''cancer'' may be prevented.'  "
How is a fecal blood test performed?,"'For fecal occult blood testing, several (usually three) samples of stool are collected for testing.  The reason for testing multiple samples is that bleeding from cancers and polyps often is intermittent and only one of the samples may show blood.''There are two types of fecal occult blood testing, 1) chemical and 2) immunologic.'  Chemical testing: For chemical testing, a solution containing the chemical guaiac and an oxidizing chemical is used.  If blood is present in the sample of stool, the mixing of the solution with blood causes the guaiac to turn visibly blue.  The blue color is caused by the interaction (promoted by the oxidizing agent) of the heme portion of the hemoglobin molecule, the oxygen carrying molecule in red blood cells, and the guaiac. Immunologic testing: For immunologic testing, a sample of stool is mixed with a solution that contains an antibody to globin, the protein part of the hemoglobin molecule.   The antibody is combined with a small amount of gold.  When the antibody/gold complex binds to the globin in stool, the antibody/gold/globin complex settles out of the solution as a visible line on the test strip."
How do the results of chemical fecal occult blood testing compare with immunologic fecal occult blood testing?,"'A chemical fecal occult blood test is inexpensive and easy, but it has several disadvantages.''The immunologic fecal occult blood test has additional advantages over the chemical fecal occult blood test.  First, it is more sensitive for blood.  This means that given the same amount of ''blood in the stool'', the immunologic fecal occult blood test will more frequently be abnormal.  In other words, it will more frequently detect cancers and precancerous polyps.  Second, it is more specific for blood.  That is, there will be fewer abnormal tests due to interfering substances in the ''diet'', and as a result, an abnormal immunologic fecal occult blood test will more commonly be due to ''cancer'' or a precancerous polyp.  As a result, less follow-up testing (for example, ''colonoscopy'') will be necessary to pursue a falsely abnormal fecal occult blood test.'  Substances in fruits and vegetables can mimic heme and cause chemical fecal occult blood tests to be falsely positive, that is, falsely abnormal.  Therefore, it is necessary to restrict certain fruits and vegetables before and during the collection of stool samples. Unlike heme which can travel intact from the stomach or small intestine and into the stool, globin is destroyed in the small intestine.  As a result, a positive chemical fecal occult blood test can be caused by bleeding anywhere in the stomach or intestines, but a positive immunologic fecal occult blood test only occurs when there is bleeding into the colon.  Therefore, it is necessary to restrict red meat containing hemoglobin before and during the collection of stool samples or the heme from the ingested meat will cause a falsely positive test. Some drugs commonly cause small amounts of bleeding into the stomach or small intestine.  Moreover, vitamin C and a few other drugs can cause an abnormal chemical fecal occult blood tests.  Therefore, these drugs must be stopped before and during the collection of samples."
How effective are fecal occult blood tests?,"'The true bottom line for a fecal occult blood test is how many cancers or precancerous polyps can be detected and, ultimately, how many cancer-related deaths can be prevented by fecal occult blood tests.  Large studies with chemical fecal occult blood tests have demonstrated at least a 15%-20% reduction in mortality due to colon cancer.  Similar studies are now underway with immunologic fecal occult blood tests, and, based on factors discussed previously, the results are expected to be better.  Nevertheless, the results of these ongoing studies are necessary to demonstrate what the bottom line truly is for immunologic fecal occult blood tests. ' "
How should fecal occult blood tests be used?,"'Fecal occult blood tests offer an important screening modality for colon cancer, but, because it detects only a minority of cancers and precancerous polyps, by itself it is not sufficient.  It needs to be complemented by endoscopic examination of the colon, either ''sigmoidoscopy'' and/or colonoscopy.  ''Recommendations for the age at which fecal occult blood tests and endoscopic examinations should be initiated, and the frequency with which they should be repeated depend on the risk for colon cancer.  Patients who are older, have relatives with colon cancer, have had polyps previously, or have diseases that are associated with a higher risk for colon cancer may have testing that begins earlier and is done more frequently.  '""The use of fecal occult blood tests has only one downside. Tests can be falsely positive, that is, tests that show blood in patients who don't have colon cancer or ""'premalignant'' polyps.  Every test showing blood requires the performance of colonoscopy, an expensive procedure that carries a small but definite risk of serious complications.  The more frequently tests are falsely positive, the more frequently unnecessary colonoscopies are performed.  If studies underway (discussed previously) demonstrate an increased ability to diagnose cancer and colon polyps with a reduced frequency of these falsely positive tests, there will be clear advantages for immunologic over chemical fecal occult blood tests. ''For this reason, immunologic fecal occult blood tests have advantages over chemical fecal occult blood tests since it has fewer false positive tests.''It is important to remember that having occult blood in the stool does not automatically imply that one has colon cancer or a polyp. There are many causes of occult  blood in the stomach, small intestine, or colon, most of which are benign. Some examples include bleeding from use of ''aspirin'' or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, ''ibuprofen''), ulcers, ''esophagitis'', ''colitis'', and intestinal angiodysplasias (weakened clusters of blood vessels on the surface of intestinal linings). Therefore, patients with stools containing occult blood should be evaluated by physicians to exclude cancers and polyps, as well as to identify other causes of intestinal bleeding.' "
What is occupational asthma?,"'Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by reversible inflammation of the airways (''bronchi''). This inflammation, caused by the immune system, leads to narrowing of the airways, known as bronchoconstriction. ''Symptoms of asthma'' include shortness of breath, wheezing, ''cough'', and chest tightness. Occupational asthma is a type of asthma that is caused by exposure to a particular substance in the workplace. Previously diagnosed asthma that worsens at work is known as work-aggravated asthma.'""There are two main types of occupational asthma: one type caused by an agent that stimulates the body's immune system that then triggers asthma (immune-mediated); and another where the agent directly irritates the airways (irritant-induced). Immune-mediated occupational asthma typically has a period of time (latency period) between the workplace exposure and the beginning of symptoms. This latency period can be from a few weeks to several years. In contrast, irritant-induced occupational asthma usually causes symptoms immediately after exposure."" "
What causes occupational asthma?,"'Occupational asthma is caused by exposure to particular inhaled chemicals in the workplace that cause the airways to become excessively reactive.''There are many agents that can cause occupational asthma. Inhalations of isocyanates, cereal dust, or flour are currently the most common causes of occupational asthma. Agents that cause occupational asthma are usually divided into two different groups: smaller molecules (low molecular weight chemicals), such as isocyanates used in rubber manufacturing, and larger molecules, typically organic substances such as flour. You can find lists of known agents at ''http://www.hse.gov.uk/asthma/substances.htm''.'  "
What are risk factors for occupational asthma?,"""A patient's individual characteristics, as well as other factors in the workplace environment play a role in the development of occupational asthma. One of the main risk factors for occupational asthma is atopy. Atopy is a syndrome characterized by sensitivity to allergens that predisposes an individual to develop occupational asthma. People with atopy often have seasonal ""'allergies'' or ''hay fever'' (''allergic rhinitis''), ''allergic'' skin rashes (''eczema''), and food ''allergies''. An important risk factor for occupational asthma, which fortunately can be eliminated, is ''cigarette'' ''smoking'"". Scientists have also discovered specific genes involved with the immune system that may be associated with a person's risk of developing occupational asthma in response to specific agents, such as isocyanates and dust from western red cedar trees. However, there is no role for this type of genetic testing in routine clinical practice.""'Although the intensity of exposure is important in the development of occupational asthma, it is less clear if it is the amount of the agent, duration of exposure, or frequency of exposures that represents the most important factor. Therefore, for most agents, it is difficult to determine what concentration of agent in the air is considered ""safe.""' "
What are symptoms and signs of occupational asthma?,"'Symptoms usually begin with wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness weeks to years after workplace exposure. Often, ''runny nose'' (rhinorrhea) and inflammation of the lining around the eyes (''conjunctivitis'') are present as well and may even occur before any wheezing or shortness of breath develops. Occasionally cough with or without phlegm (sputum) production may be present as well.''Initially, patients may notice that their symptoms are worse at work and better during weekends or holidays away from work. If no action is taken, patients may develop constant symptoms.''The latency period between the time of exposure to the time of onset of symptoms is highly variable. The latency period for occupational asthma caused by low-molecular weight compounds seems to be shorter than that for high-molecular weight compounds. The latency period for high-molecular weight compounds is often several years.''A severe form of irritant-induced occupational asthma is called reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). This is a condition where the patient suffers a single exposure to a very high concentration of a noxious chemical, usually a gas. A person suffering from RADS will have shortness of breath and chest tightness severe enough to seek medical attention within 24 hours of the exposure. After recovery from the initial massive exposure, the patient will have airways that remain excessively reactive, or ""twitchy,"" from stimulation by the agent that caused the initial symptoms or other agents. Almost all patients with RADS will have excessively responsive airways for three months, and 50%-60% will still have excessively responsive airways even 18 months later.' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose occupational asthma?,"'A thorough history and physical examination is performed for any patient in whom occupational asthma is suspected. Important questions include the type of symptoms, duration of symptoms, timing of symptoms, and factors that make symptoms better or worse. The characteristics of the workplace, including any inhalational exposures, is evaluated. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) may contain helpful information about the workplace. These will generally be on site in your workplace.''A test to measure the flow of air in and out of your ''lungs'', called spirometry or a pulmonary function test, may be performed. This test is used to define the diagnosis of asthma. This test may involve giving an inhaled medicine called a bronchodilator to relax or dilate the airways. Alternatively, the test may involve administering a medicine to see how excessively responsive, or twitchy, the airways are (bronchoprovocation test).''A peak expiratory flow meter may be recommended to measure airflow during ''exhalation'' both at home and at work. Typically, results are recorded daily for a few weeks to see if there is a difference in airflow at work and away from work. Skin tests can be done, where an agent thought to cause your symptoms is introduced below the first layer of skin with a small needle to see if this agent triggers an inflammatory response. However, skin tests are not available for most agents that cause occupational asthma.' "
What is the treatment for occupational asthma?,"'The mainstay of treatment for occupational asthma is removal from the exposure. Most patients with occupational asthma will get worse over time if they remain exposed, so avoidance of the trigger is important. This often means changing jobs or changing the particular duty at the workplace.''Occupational asthma can be treated the same as regular asthma, with inhaled medicines called bronchodilators that open (dilate) the airways as well as inhaled anti-inflammatory medicines (glucocorticoids). However, the most important intervention is to avoid any further exposure.''Respiratory masks do not prevent symptoms of occupational asthma.' "
What are complications of occupational asthma?,"'Occupational asthma becomes worse over time if the patient continues to be exposed to the offending agent. After a person becomes sensitized, even very small amounts of the offending agent are capable of triggering significant symptoms. The ''airway'' constriction (bronchospasm) can be life-threatening if severe.''After avoiding any further exposure, most patients will have improvement in their asthma over a span of months to years, but it is rare that occupational asthma will completely go away. People who were exposed to lower levels of an offending agent for shorter periods of time are more likely to experience eventual improvement in their asthma.' "
Is it possible to prevent occupational asthma?,"'Occupational asthma can be prevented by monitoring levels of exposure in the workplace, which may help employees from becoming sensitized to the agent. Many potential agents can be monitored continuously. Close monitoring of employee symptoms and prompt removal from the environment once symptoms arise will help prevent occupational asthma complications and maybe reduce its severity. All smokers are advised to quit ''smoking'', and this may help prevent the development of occupational asthma.' "

What is occupational asthma?,"'Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by reversible inflammation of the airways (''bronchi''). This inflammation, caused by the immune system, leads to narrowing of the airways, known as bronchoconstriction. ''Symptoms of asthma'' include shortness of breath, wheezing, ''cough'', and chest tightness. Occupational asthma is a type of asthma that is caused by exposure to a particular substance in the workplace. Previously diagnosed asthma that worsens at work is known as work-aggravated asthma.'""There are two main types of occupational asthma: one type caused by an agent that stimulates the body's immune system that then triggers asthma (immune-mediated); and another where the agent directly irritates the airways (irritant-induced). Immune-mediated occupational asthma typically has a period of time (latency period) between the workplace exposure and the beginning of symptoms. This latency period can be from a few weeks to several years. In contrast, irritant-induced occupational asthma usually causes symptoms immediately after exposure."" "
What causes occupational asthma?,"'Occupational asthma is caused by exposure to particular inhaled chemicals in the workplace that cause the airways to become excessively reactive.''There are many agents that can cause occupational asthma. Inhalations of isocyanates, cereal dust, or flour are currently the most common causes of occupational asthma. Agents that cause occupational asthma are usually divided into two different groups: smaller molecules (low molecular weight chemicals), such as isocyanates used in rubber manufacturing, and larger molecules, typically organic substances such as flour.

What Is the Goal of Physical Therapy?,"'The goal of physical therapy is to get a person back to the point where he or she can perform normal, everyday activities without difficulty. ''Preserving good range of motion is key to maintain the ability to perform daily activities. Therefore, increasing the range of motion of a joint is the primary focus of physical therapy. Building strength in the involved muscles surrounding the joint also is extremely important, since stronger muscles can better stabilize a weakened joint. ''Physical therapists provide exercises designed to preserve the strength and use of your joints. They can show you the best way to move from one position to another and can also teach you how to use ''walking'' aids such as crutches, a walker or a cane, if necessary. ' "
What Are Some Benefits of Occupational and Physical Therapy?,"'If you have arthritis, there are many benefits to participating in a physical and occupational therapy program, including: ' You gain education about your type of arthritis, so that you can be well 
	informed. If you are overweight, a dietary plan can be created to reduce the 
	stress of excess weight on supporting joints of the back, legs, and feet. As 
	yet, no specific diet -- other than a diet designed for weight loss -- has 
	proved helpful for arthritis. You gain foot-care advice, including choice of well-fitting shoes with 
	shock-absorbing outer soles and sculptured (orthotic) insoles molded exactly 
	to the contour of each foot. You will learn therapeutic methods to relieve discomfort and improve 
	performance through various physical techniques and activity modifications."
What Techniques Will I Learn?,"""You'll learn several techniques, including:"" Rest. Bed rest helps reduce both joint inflammation and pain, and is especially useful when multiple joints are affected and fatigue is a major problem. Individual joint rest is most helpful when arthritis involves one or only a few joints. Custom splints can be made to rest and support inflamed joints and a soft collar can support the neck while you are sitting or standing. Thermal modalities. Applying ice packs or heating pads, as well as deep heat provided by ultrasound and hot packs, can help relieve local pain. Heat also relaxes muscle spasm around inflamed joints. Heating joints and muscles with a warm bath or shower before exercising may help you exercise more easily. Exercise. Exercise is an important part of arthritis treatment that is most effective when done properly every day. Your doctor and therapist will prescribe a program for you that may vary as your needs change."
What Therapy Is Offered for People Recovering From Joint Replacement?,"'Preoperative programs of education and exercise, started before joint replacement surgery, are continued at home. They may be changed in the hospital after surgery to fit new needs during the rehabilitation period. These exercises may be added to your usual exercise regimen, and you may find your ability to exercise has improved after surgery.' "
What Joint Protection Techniques Are Offered?,"'There are ways to reduce the ''stress'' on joints affected by arthritis while participating in daily activities. Some of these include: ''An occupational therapist can show you ways to do everyday tasks without worsening pain or causing joint damage. Some joint protection techniques include: ' Controlling your weight to avoid putting extra stress on weight-bearing 
	joints such as the back, hips, knees, and feet. Being aware of body position, using good posture to protect your back 
	and the joints of your legs and feet. When possible, sit down to do a job 
	instead of standing. Change position often since staying in one position for 
	a long time tends to increase stiffness and pain. Conserving energy by allowing for rest periods, both during the workday 
	and during an activity. Respecting pain. It is your body's way of telling you something is 
	wrong. Don't try an activity that puts strain on joints that are already 
	painful or stiff. Using proper body mechanics for getting in and out of a car, chair or 
	tub, as well as for lifting objects. Using your strongest joints and muscles to reduce the stress on smaller 
	joints. For example, carrying a purse or briefcase with a shoulder strap 
	rather than with your hand. Distributing pressure to minimize stress on any one joint. Lifting 
	dishes with both palms rather than with your fingers and carrying heavy 
	loads in your arms instead of with your hands. If your hands are affected by arthritis, avoid tight gripping, pinching, 
	squeezing, and twisting. Ways to accomplish the same tasks with alternate 
	methods or tools can usually be found."
What Are Assistive Devices for Arthritis?,"'If you have arthritis, many assistive devices have been developed to make activities easier and less stressful for the joints and muscles. Your therapist can suggest devices that will be helpful for tasks you may find difficult at home or at work.''A few examples of helpful devices include a bath ''stool'' for use in the shower or tub, grab bars around the toilet or tub, and long-handled shoehorns or sock grippers. Your therapist can show you catalogs that have a wide variety of assistive devices.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Facts you should know about hormonal methods of birth control,"'If a woman is sexually active and she is ''fertile'', meaning that she is physically able to become ''pregnant'', she needs to ask herself, ""Do I want to become pregnant now?"" If her answer is ""No,"" she must use some method of ''birth control'' (''contraception'').''Terminology for ""''birth control''"" includes contraception, ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from a variety of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of birth control available today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.'""In simple terms, all methods of birth control are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'Unfortunately, no birth-control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Types of hormonal methods of contraception,"'There are several different hormonal methods of birth control. The differences among them involve''The hormones can be estrogen and/or ''progesterone'', or preparations that contain a combination of these hormones. These hormones may be taken orally (taken by mouth), implanted into body tissue, injected under the skin, absorbed from a patch on the skin, or placed in the vagina. The mode of delivery determines whether the hormonal exposure is continuous or intermittent.'  the type of hormone, the amount of hormone, and the way the hormone enters a woman's body."
What are advantages and disadvantages of hormonal birth control methods?,"'Advantages of hormonal methods of birth control include that they are all highly effective and their effects are reversible. They do not rely on spontaneity and can be used in advance of sexual activity.''Disadvantages of hormonal methods for birth control include:' The necessity of taking medications continuously The cost of the medications Women must remember to take them regularly or use them exactly as prescribed A doctor’s visit and prescription are required. They do not protect a woman against STDs or sexually transmitted diseases Women must begin using hormonal contraceptives in advance before they become effective. For some women, hormonal preparations are associated with unpleasant side effects or increased health risks."
Oral hormones: The pill,"'The combination pill '""contains the hormones estrogen and progestin, a form of progesterone. When a woman uses the combination pill, the eggs in her ovaries do not mature and she does not ovulate. She doesn't become pregnant because no egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.""'The traditional combination pill comes in 21-day packs or 28-day packs depending on the manufacturer. The 21-pill pack has pills for 21 ""on"" days and no pills for the 7 ""off"" days that follow. The 28-pill pack has active pills for the first 21 ""on"" days and seven inactive (placebo) or reminder pills for the following 7 ""off"" days.''New preparations have been developed that allow for extended or continuous use of combination pills for months at a time. These products allow for a reduction in the number of menstrual periods a woman experiences.''The minipill'' only contains one hormone, progestin. Progestin thickens the cervical ''mucus'', making it more difficult for sperm to pass through the cervix. It also makes the lining of the uterus less receptive to the implantation of a fertilized egg. The progesterone-only pill is sometimes recommended for women who have medical reasons for which they must avoid taking estrogen hormones. (These reasons can include ''liver disease'', certain types of ''blood clots'' in the veins, ''breast cancer'', and ''uterine cancer''.) In addition, it is often recommended in ''nursing'' mothers because it has no adverse effects on ''breastfeeding''. Indeed, extended breastfeeding, as well as delay in the need for formula supplementation has been observed in breastfeeding users of the minipill.''The minipill is taken every day. There are no ""on"" or ""off"" days with the minipill.' "
What are the side effects of the pill?,"'Most side effects from the combination pill or the minipill decrease after two to three months of use. It is important to remember that because most side effects of oral contraceptives decrease in the first two to three months of use, women should try to avoid switching pills prior to an adequate trial. Trying to stick with any given product for two to three months may be necessary to really determine whether or not it will be tolerated over time. Switching too early to another brand may only needlessly subject the woman to the possibility of similar side effects starting all over again with the new pill.''There is no increased risk of ''birth defects'' in ''babies'' born to women who have taken the pill, but a woman should not use either type of pill if she is pregnant.''A woman who is breastfeeding should not use the combination pill because it can reduce the amount of her ''breast milk'' and the concentration of proteins and fat in her breast milk. Additionally, her breast milk will contain traces of the hormones from the pill. However, in contrast to the combination pill, the minipill is routinely used in lactating women.''Women who smoke and take the pill are at increased risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. There is no increased risk of ''heart attack'' or ''stroke'' among healthy nonsmoking women who use the pill.''Blood clots in the legs (''DVT'') and elsewhere are slightly more frequent with low-dose oral contraceptives, but the risk is very low, and lower than the increased risk of clotting that occurs with pregnancy. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives are ''not'' recommended for:''Smokers'' over 35 years of age should not use oral contraceptives, nor should women with a significant ''liver'' disorder.''A woman should contact her healthcare professional immediately if she experiences any of these side effects while taking the pill:' Some women experience temporary symptoms of spotting or light vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, and nausea during the first one to three months of taking the pill. Nausea can be helped if the pill is taken after a meal. While women sometimes fear weight gain with oral contraceptives, studies of the low-dose preparations demonstrate that there is no significant weight gain with oral contraception and no major difference in weight change comparing various contraception products. Negative mood changes, such as depression, and pigmented patches of skin on the face (melasma) may occur with oral-contraceptive use. Because the progesterone in women can cause thinning of the lining of the uterus, some women may experience loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea). Oral contraceptive-induced amenorrhea happens in about 1% of women in the first year of use. As long as the woman is properly taking her pills, amenorrhea is not harmful and it does not signal any loss of effectiveness of the pills. women with clotting tendencies (such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Leiden Factor 5), known coronary heart disease, stroke, unevaluated breast lumps, vaginal bleeding, or breast cancer. severe headache; leg cramps; change in vision, including blurred vision, vision loss, or flashing lights; abdominal pain; chest pain; shortness of breath; coughing up blood; or leg swelling or pain."
How is the pill taken?,"'No matter which type of birth-control pill a woman uses, she should take it every day at the same time in order to establish a routine. The woman needs to minimize the chance she will forget to take the pill, which is not an uncommon occurrence. This is especially critical in the case of the progestin-only pill (minipill). Forgetting to take the minipill, or taking it at varying times of the day, can significantly impair its effectiveness in contraception. This is due to the low dose of the minipill causing its effects to wear off rapidly if the pill is missed.' "
How long will it take before the pill prevents conception?," When a woman begins taking the pill, she may not be protected from pregnancy until she has been taking the pill for 10 consecutive days in a row. If a woman forgets to take a pill after she has started, she may be at risk for getting pregnant. If she only misses one pill, she should take it as soon as she remembers, even if it means taking two pills in the same day. If she misses two pills, she should take both of them as soon as she remembers, plus the pill for that day at her regular time. If she misses three pills, she should discontinue use of the pill for 4 more days to complete one week and then begin taking a new pack of birth control pills, whether she has a menstrual period or not. She must use an alternate form of birth control or abstain from sexual activity during the week that she stops taking her pills. If a woman continually forgets to take her pills, perhaps she should consider a different method of birth control."
What drugs or conditions reduce the effectiveness of the pill?,"'A woman should ask her healthcare professional about these matters and the necessity of using a backup method of birth control if any of these conditions exist.' The pill may partially lose its effectiveness if a woman vomits or has diarrhea for any reason. Some medications, including certain sedatives and some antibiotics such as penicillin and tetracycline, may reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Research in this area is ongoing."
What are the benefits of taking the pill?,"""There are a number of benefits to taking the pill. Both the combination pill and the minipill can regularize a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' and reduce her menstrual flow and ''menstrual cramps''. There is evidence that the pill protects against ''cancer of the ovary'' and uterus as well as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID) and ''iron deficiency anemia''.''The combination pill can reduce:''According to several studies, the combination pill confers no long-term risk of ''breast cancer'' for women at average risk. In addition, a woman who has taken the pill is less likely to develop ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''osteoporosis''.''Users of oral contraceptives have experienced significant decreases in excessive menstrual flow and in occurrence and severity of ''menstrual cramps''.' acne (although maximal acne reduction may take six months to occur), the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, noncancerous breast cysts, and ovarian cysts."
When will I start having periods again after I quit taking the pill?," A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within about 3 months of stopping the oral-contraceptive pill. However, the length of delay before a woman's period returns after stopping the pill varies from woman to woman. Oral contraceptives are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. The pill does not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections."
Injection: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA),"'Depot ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate  (DMPA) is a synthetic long-acting form of the hormone progesterone. DMPA is similar to the birth-control minipill in that it does not contain estrogen. Like other progesterone-based contraceptives, DMPA acts by preventing the release of the egg from the ovary (''ovulation'"") and by promoting thick cervical mucus that impedes the sperm's progress. Its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy is close to 100%.""""DMPA must be injected by a health care professional every three months (12 weeks). It is administered as a deep muscle (intramuscular) injection. A lower-dose formulation of the drug that is injected beneath the skin (subcutaneously) is also available. The injection must be administered within the first 5 days of a woman's menstrual period. She is then protected from pregnancy within 24 hours of receiving the injection.""'A woman may stop having periods altogether after using DMPA for one year. After two years of use, 70% of women will have no menstrual bleeding. Menstrual periods stop because the DMPA causes the ovaries to go into a ""resting"" state. When the ovaries do not release an egg every month, the regular growth of the lining of the uterus does not occur and no uterine lining is shed during the subsequent menstrual cycle.'""A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within six to 18 months after she stops taking the injections. A woman can also become pregnant, usually within 12 to 18 months, once she stops using DMPA. If a new mother does not breastfeed her baby, she can resume the injections right after ""'childbirth''. Mothers who are breastfeeding can safely begin the injections six weeks after ''childbirth''. The injections do not reduce the flow of her breast milk, and no harmful effects on the baby have been noted.''The most common side effects of DMPA injections are irregular menstrual cycles, cessation of menstrual periods, and weight gain. Other side effects may include nervousness, ''dizziness'', stomach discomfort, ''headaches'', ''fatigue'', or breast tenderness. It is important that a woman realize that once she has been injected with DMPA, any side effects she may experience cannot be neutralized or eliminated. She has to tolerate these side effects until the medication wears off, typically three months later.''DMPA has also been shown to have a negative effect on ''bone mineral density'', especially with longer-term use; however, studies have shown that her previous ''bone density'' is usually restored when the drug is discontinued.''Women may be able to use DMPA when avoidance of estrogen is prudent for medical reasons (see oral contraceptives). A qualified health care provider should be able to help make the proper distinction. DMPA should not be used by women who have a history of breast ''cancer'', blood clots, ''liver disease'', unexplained vaginal bleeding, or ''stroke''. A woman on DMPA should contact her health care professional if she experiences a heavy menstrual flow, severe ''abdominal pain'', ''headaches'', or ''depression''.'""DMPA injections are over 99% effective if the injections are received according to the correct schedule. A woman using injection contraceptives has the advantage of being capable of becoming pregnant at a later time, if desired, simply by discontinuing use. DMPA does not increase a woman's risk of ""'cancer'', including breast ''cancer'', and greatly reduces her risk of developing uterine cancer.''Injectable hormonal contraceptives do not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive patch: Ortho-Evra,"'An adhesive patch has been developed that provides hormonal contraception through the skin, which is known as a transdermal (through the skin) delivery system. The patch is about the size of a half-dollar and can be worn on the arm, abdomen, or buttocks. A woman wears the patch for a week and then replaces it with a new patch.''These patches are called Ortho-Evra (ethinyl ''estradiol''/norelgestromin patch-topical), and are similar to the pill in that they contain both estrogen and progesterone. Ortho-Evra should be just as effective in preventing pregnancy as the pill. Ortho-Evra is similar to the pill in that it suppresses ovulation and has the advantage of improved compliance and convenience due to weekly administration. A woman only needs to remember to replace the patch once a week instead of being required to remember taking a pill every day. However, some studies have shown that the contraceptive patch may be associated with a greater risk of negative side effects, such as blood-clotting problems, than oral contraceptive pills.''Women who have medical reasons why oral contraceptives are not recommended (such as already having an underlying tendency toward blood clotting) may find that their prescribing physician also recommends against Ortho-Evra because of the similarity in the hormone ingredients of both types of contraceptives.'""It is important to ensure that the patch makes good contact with the skin. The patch could be a problem for those women who perspire heavily, swim, and/or take frequent showers because moisture can interfere with the patch's contact with the skin. Some women may also experience skin irritation at the site of the patch. Furthermore, contraceptive failure may be a risk in heavier women (those who weigh over 198 pounds, or 90 kilograms).""'As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, the patch will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive implants,"'A contraceptive implant known as Implanon is available in the U.S. Implanon provides contraception by the slow release of the progestin etonogestrel over a period of three years. Implanon is a thin rod that is inserted in the upper arm under local anesthesia. Protection from pregnancy occurs within 24 hours of insertion of the rod, and the failure rate is comparable with surgical sterilization (tubal ligations). One advantage of the Implanon rod is that fertility rapidly returns after removal of the rod.''A two-rod implant containing the progestin ''levonorgestrel'' (Jadelle) was approved by the FDA for 5 years of use, although it has not been marketed in the United States. Similarly, the Sino-Implant II contraceptive implant is similar to Jadelle, but is designed to remain in place for 4 years.''Preliminary studies of the product showed that it was generally well tolerated and effective in preventing pregnancy. However, these studies showed that irregular bleeding is a possible side effect of the product.''As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, Implanon will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Vaginal ring: NuvaRing,"'A ring-shaped device that contains the hormones estradiol and etonogestrel (a progestin) can be placed in the vagina. It remains in place for three weeks continuously, then it is removed for one week to allow for a menstrual period. It continuously releases low levels of the hormone into the bloodstream for the entire three weeks.'' There is currently one brand available in the U.S., ''NuvaRing'' (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol-vaginal ring). It is about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy, having the same high effectiveness as the other hormonal methods of contraception. The incidence of hormone-related side effects is similar to those seen with other hormonal contraceptive methods such as the pill and the patch. ''Vaginal discharge'' can sometimes occur as a side effect of the ring preparation.''NuvaRing does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
How effective are hormonal birth control methods?,"'Hormonal methods of birth control are some of the most effective forms of birth control available. When used properly, their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy can approach 99%-100%. With typical use of ''birth control pills'', effectiveness is estimated to be about 95%. With any form of hormonal contraception, precisely following instructions for proper use will increase its effectiveness.' "
"Intraocular melanoma is a 
disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.","'Intraocular melanoma begins in the middle of three layers of the wall of the eye. The outer layer includes the white sclera (the ""white of the eye"") and the clear ''cornea'' at the front of the eye. The inner layer has a lining of nerve tissue, called the retina, which senses light and sends images along the ''optic nerve'' to the brain.''The middle layer, where intraocular melanoma forms, is called the uvea or uveal tract, and has three main parts:''The iris is the colored area at the front of the eye (the ""eye color""). It can be seen through the clear cornea. The pupil is in the center of the iris and it changes size to let more or less light into the eye. Intraocular melanoma of the iris is usually a small tumor that grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.''The ciliary body is a ring of tissue with muscle fibers that change the size of the pupil and the shape of the ''lens''. It is found behind the iris. Changes in the shape of the lens help the eye focus. The ciliary body also makes the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the iris. Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.''The choroid is a layer of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the eye. Most intraocular melanomas begin in the choroid. Intraocular melanoma of the choroid is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.''Intraocular melanoma is a rare ''cancer'' that forms from cells that make melanin in the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. It is the most common eye ''cancer'' in adults.' "
"Being older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular 
melanoma.","""Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.""'Risk factors for intraocular melanoma include the following:' Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.Blue or green or other light-colored eyes. Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly. Blue or green or other light-colored eyes. Older age. Being white."
Signs of intraocular melanoma include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris.,'Intraocular melanoma may not cause early signs or symptoms. It is sometimes found during a regular eye exam when the doctor dilates the pupil and looks into the eye. Signs and symptoms may be caused by intraocular melanoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'  Blurred vision or other change in vision. Floaters (spots that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light. A dark spot on the iris. A change in the size or shape of the pupil. A change in the position of the eyeball in the eye socket.
"Tests that examine the eye are used to help detect (find) and diagnose 
intraocular melanoma.","'The following tests and procedures may be used:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Eye exam with dilated pupil: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the lens and pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor. There are several types of eye exams:Ophthalmoscopy: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.Slit-lamp biomicroscopy: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope.Gonioscopy: An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris. A special instrument is used to see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked. Ophthalmoscopy: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope. Gonioscopy: An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris. A special instrument is used to see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked. Ultrasound exam of the eye: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. The picture, called a sonogram, shows on the screen of the ultrasound monitor. High-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a more detailed picture of the inside of the eye than a regular ultrasound. The tumor is checked for its size, shape, and thickness, and for signs that the tumor has spread to nearby tissue. Transillumination of the globe and iris: An exam of the iris, cornea, lens, and ciliary body with a light placed on either the upper or lower lid. Fluorescein angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye. An orange fluorescent dye (fluorescein) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. Indocyanine green angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. A green dye (indocyanine green) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. Ocular coherence tomography: An imaging test that uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina, and sometimes the choroid, to see if there is swelling or fluid beneath the retina."
A biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.,"'A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. Rarely, a biopsy of the tumor is needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma. Tissue that is removed during a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor may be tested to get more information about prognosis and which treatment options are best.''The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue:''A biopsy may result in ''retinal detachment'' (the retina separates from other tissues in the eye). This can be repaired by surgery.' Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Gene expression profiling: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are checked for certain types of RNA."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:' How the melanoma cells look under a microscope. The size and thickness of the tumor. The part of the eye the tumor is in (the iris, ciliary body, or choroid). Whether the tumor has spread within the eye or to other places in the body. Whether there are certain changes in the genes linked to intraocular melanoma. The patient's age and general health. Whether the tumor has recurred (come back) after treatment."
"After intraocular 
melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have 
spread to other parts of the body.","'The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.''The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:''The following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma:''Small''The tumor is 5 to 16 millimeters in diameter and from 1 to 3 millimeters thick.''Medium''The tumor is 16 millimeters or smaller in diameter and from 3.1 to 8 millimeters thick.''Large''The tumor is:''Though most intraocular melanoma tumors are raised, some are flat. These diffuse tumors grow widely across the uvea.' Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Liver function tests: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found. more than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or at least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter."
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
"Cancer may 
spread from where it began to other parts of the body.","'When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not ''liver cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
"There are 
two staging systems for intraocular melanoma.","'Intraocular melanoma has two staging systems. The staging system used depends on where in the eye the cancer first formed:''If intraocular melanoma spreads to the optic nerve or nearby tissue of the eye socket, it is called extraocular extension.''The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the iris:''Stage I''In stage I, the tumor is in the iris only and is not more than one fourth the size of the iris.''Stage II''Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.''Stage III''Stage III is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.''Stage IV''In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread:''The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid:''Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid is grouped into four size categories.

Recurrent intraocular (uveal) melanoma,'Recurrent intraocular melanoma is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The melanoma may come back in the eye or in other parts of the body.' 
There are different types of treatments for patients with intraocular melanoma.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with intraocular melanoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Five types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery is the most common treatment for intraocular melanoma. The following types of surgery may be used:'""Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient's condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Pictures are taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor and how fast it is growing.""'Watchful waiting is used for patients who do not have signs or symptoms and the tumor is not growing. It is also used when the tumor is in the only eye with useful vision.''Radiation'' therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat intraocular melanoma.''Photocoagulation is a procedure that uses laser light to destroy blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor, causing the tumor cells to die. Photocoagulation may be used to treat small tumors. This is also called light coagulation.''Thermotherapy is the use of heat from a laser to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor.'  Resection: Surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of healthy tissue around it. Enucleation: Surgery to remove the eye and part of the optic nerve. This is done if vision cannot be saved and the tumor is large, has spread to the optic nerve, or causes high pressure inside the eye. After surgery, the patient is usually fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye. Exenteration: Surgery to remove the eye and eyelid, and muscles, nerves, and fat in the eye socket. After surgery, the patient may be fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye or a facial prosthesis. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:Charged-particle external beam radiation therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy. A special radiation therapy machine aims tiny, invisible particles, called protons or helium ions, at the cancer cells to kill them with little damage to nearby normal tissues. Charged-particle radiation therapy uses a different type of radiation than the x-ray type of radiation therapy.Gamma Knife therapy is a type of stereotactic radiosurgery used for some melanomas. This treatment can be given in one treatment. It aims tightly focused gamma rays directly at the tumor so there is little damage to healthy tissue. Gamma Knife therapy does not use a knife to remove the tumor and is not an operation. Charged-particle external beam radiation therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy.

Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:Localized plaque radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used for tumors of the eye. Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the eye near the tumor. The side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming radiation at the tumor. The plaque helps protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.

Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.' "
"Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their 
cancer treatment.",'Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' 
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "

What is the glucose tolerance test?,"'Though no longer routinely used for diagnosing ''diabetes''.' The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was the gold standard for making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It is still commonly used during pregnancy for diagnosing gestational diabetes. With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least 8 hours, but not more than 16 hours). The next morning, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives a dose of oral glucose (the dose depends upon the length of the test). There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person drinks. Blood samples are taken up to four times at different time points after consumption of the sugar to measure the blood glucose."
How reliable is the glucose tolerance test?,"'For the glucose tolerance test to give reliable results, the person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a ''common cold''). Also, the person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital) and should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose.' In preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test, the person should eat and drink as they normally would. The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or consume caffeine."
What does the glucose tolerance test measure?,"'The classic oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels five times over a period of three hours. Some physicians simply take a baseline blood sample followed by a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without ''diabetes'', the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with ''diabetes'', glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast.''People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic levels have so-called ''impaired glucose tolerance'' (IGT). People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes.''Each year, 5% to 10% of people whose test results show impaired glucose tolerance actually develop diabetes. ''Weight loss'' and ''exercise'' may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as ''metformin'' (''Glucophage''), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes. Studies have shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the development of ''heart disease'', and whether impaired glucose tolerance turns out to be an entity that deserves treatment itself is something that physicians are currently debating.' "
What is the preparation for a glucose tolerance test?," As mentioned previously, preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test involves fasting overnight (from 8 to 16 hours) and participating normally in activities of daily living. The individual should eat and drink as they normally do prior to the test. The morning of the test, the person should not consume caffeine or smoke."
How are the results of the glucose tolerance test evaluated?,"'Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:' Normal response: A person is said to have a normal 
  response when the two hour glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values 
  between 0 and 2 hours are less than 200 mg/dl. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): A person is said to have impaired 
  glucose tolerance when the fasting plasma glucose is 
  less than 126 mg/dl and the two hour glucose level is between 140 and 199 
  mg/dl. This is sometimes referred to as ""prediabetes"" because people with IGT 
  have a higher risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes: A person has diabetes when two diagnostic 
  tests done on different days show that the blood glucose level is high. This means either the 
  two hour levels is greater than 200 mg/dl or the fasting glucose is noted as greater than 126 mg/dl.
  A 
  glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5% or more also supports a 
  diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes during pregnancy: A pregnant woman has diabetes 
	if she has a fasting plasma glucose of over 92 mg/dl, or a two hour glucose level 
	greater than 153 mg/dl."
What about glucose tolerance testing during pregnancy?,"'As mentioned previously, the glucose tolerance test is used for the diagnosis of ''gestational diabetes'' (diabetes that develops during pregnancy). It may be used if there are equivocal fasting or random blood glucose results, or to screen for gestational diabetes in pregnant women between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation who are not known to have diabetes.\t ''The test may also be used in the postpartum period to detect diabetes in women who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Women who had gestational diabetes do not always develop diabetes later in life, but they should undergo diabetes screening at least every three years throughout their life.\t ' "
What are omega-3 fatty acids?,"'Fatty acids consist of chains of carbon atoms linked together by chemical bonds. On one end (terminal) of the carbon chain is a methyl group (a cluster of carbon and hydrogen atoms). On the other terminal is a carboxyl group (a cluster of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms). The chemical bonds between carbon atoms can be either single or double bonds. Single bonds have more hydrogen molecules around them than double bonds. These chemical bonds determine whether a fatty acid is saturated or unsaturated (see discussion below). Fatty acids also come in different lengths: short chain fatty acids have fewer than 6 carbons, while long chain fatty acids have 12 or more carbons.''Fatty acids serve as energy for the muscles, ''heart'', and other organs as building blocks for cell membranes and as energy storage for the body. Fatty acids that are not used up as energy are converted into ''triglycerides''. A triglyceride is a molecule formed by attaching three fatty acids onto a glycerol compound that serves as a backbone. ''Triglycerides'' are then stored in the body as fat (adipose) tissue.''Saturated fatty acids contain single bonds only. ''Fats'' containing saturated fatty acids are called saturated fats. Examples of foods high in saturated fats include lard, butter, whole milk, cream, eggs, red meat, ''chocolate'', and solid shortenings. An excess intake of saturated fat can raise blood ''cholesterol'' and increase the risk of developing coronary ''heart disease''.''Monounsaturated fatty acids contain one double bond. Examples of foods high in monounsaturated fat include avocados, nuts, and olive, peanut, and canola oils. Scientists believe that increased consumption of monounsaturated fats (for example, eating more nuts) is beneficial in lowering ''LDL cholesterol'' (the ""bad"" cholesterol) and lowering the risk of coronary ''heart disease'', especially if monounsaturated fats are used to substitute for saturated fats and refined sugars.''Polyunsaturated fatty acids contain more than one double bond. Examples of foods high in polyunsaturated fats include vegetable oils, ''corn'', sunflower, and ''soy''.''Essential fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids that the ''human body'' needs for metabolic functioning but cannot produce, and therefore has to be acquired from food.''Omega-3 fatty acids'' are a class of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids with the double bond in the third carbon position from the methyl terminal (hence the use of ""3"" in their description). Foods high in ''omega-3'' fatty acids include salmon, halibut, sardines, albacore, trout, herring, walnut, ''flaxseed'' oil, and canola oil. Other foods that contain omega-3 fatty acids include shrimp, clams, light chunk tuna, catfish, cod, and spinach.''Omega-6 fatty acids are a class of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids with the initial double bond in the sixth carbon position from the methyl group (hence the ""6""). Examples of foods rich in omega-6 fatty acids include ''corn'', safflower, sunflower, soybean, and cottonseed oil.''Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are also referred to as n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, respectively.''Trans fatty acids (trans fats) are made through hydrogenation to solidify liquid oils. Heating omega-6 oils, such as ''corn'' oil, to high temperatures creates trans fats. Trans fats increase the shelf life of oils and are found in vegetable shortenings and in some margarines, commercial pastries, fried foods, crackers, cookies, and snack foods. The intake of trans fatty acids increases blood LDL-cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol), decreases ''HDL cholesterol'' (""good cholesterol""), and raises the risk of coronary ''heart disease''.' "
What are the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids?,"'Scientific evidence is mounting that fish oil (predominantly omega-3 fatty acids) can reduce the risk of ''sudden cardiac death'"". Some scientists also believe that omega-3 fatty acids can improve one's blood ""'lipid'' (cholesterol and triglyceride) levels and decrease the risk of coronary heart disease.' "
What foods are rich in omega-3 fatty acids?," Eat whole, natural, and fresh foods. Eat five to ten servings of fruits and vegetables daily and eat more peas, beans, and nuts. Increase intake of omega-3 fatty acids by eating more fish, walnuts, flaxseed oil, and green leafy vegetables. An example of meeting the recommended intake of omega-3 fats is to eat 2 salmon portions a week or 1 gram of omega-3-fatty acid supplement daily. Drink water, tea, non-fat dairy and red wine (two drinks or less daily for men, one drink or less daily for women). Eat lean protein such as skinless poultry, fish, and lean cuts of red meat. Avoid trans-fats and limit intake of saturated fats. This means avoiding fried foods, hard margarine, commercial baked goods, and most packaged and processed snack foods, high fat dairy and processed meats such as bacon, sausage, and deli meats. Limit glycemic foods. Glycemic foods are those made with sugar and white flour, which increase blood sugar levels. Increased blood sugar levels stimulate the pancreas to release insulin. Chronically high insulin levels are believed to cause weight gain as well as atherosclerosis of the arteries. Exercise daily."
Has science proven the beneifts of omega-3 fatty acids?,"'In studies involving animals (''dogs'', rats, and marmosets), omega-3 fatty acids were found to prevent ventricular ''fibrillation'' (see MedicineNet article on ''heart attack'') when given to animals just prior to experimentally induced ''heart attacks''. Omega-3 fatty acids were also found to terminate ventricular fibrillation in animals undergoing experimentally induced ''heart attacks''. Therefore, scientists suspect that omega-3 fatty acids may prevent ventricular fibrillation of the heart in the event of a heart attack in humans. Since ventricular fibrillation is the most important cause of sudden death among heart attack victims, omega-3-fatty acids is believed to prevent sudden death.''Evidence from observational studies:'"" Two large, long-term observational studies have been published on the relationship between dietary intake of fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids and risk of heart disease and sudden cardiac death; The Nurses' Health Study and the Physician's Health Study.""""The Physician's Health Study began in 1982 when more than 20,000 healthy male physicians were followed for 11 years. Lifestyle, coronary risk factors, and ""'diet'' data were collected at entry, and life style and ''diet'' data were collected via questionnaires at 12 months and 18 months. The results of the study were published in JAMA 1998, vol. 279, p. 23. The title of the article is ""Fish consumption and risk of sudden cardiac death."" The study found that men who consumed one or more fish meals per week had a 50% lower risk of developing sudden cardiac death than men who rarely ate fish (less than one fish meal per month).''In a separate article, scientists compared blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids in 94 of these men who died of sudden cardiac death against living men matched for age and ''smoking'' habits. They found that high levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the blood were associated with a low risk of cardiac sudden death. Men with the highest blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids had an 80% lower risk of sudden cardiac death than men with the lowest blood levels. High omega-3 fatty acids in the blood are usually due to a high consumption of fish.'""The Nurses' Health Study began in 1976 when more than 80,000 female nurses completed life style and diet questionnaires. They were followed for 16 years for the development of coronary heart disease. Omega-3 fatty acid consumption was calculated from the questionnaires. The result of the study was published in JAMA vol 287. No.14, p. 1815. The title of the article is ""'""Fish and omega-3-fatty acid intake and risk of coronary ''heart disease in women''.""'' The study found that compared to women who rarely ate fish (less than one fish meal per month), women who ate fish once a week had a 29% lower risk of developing coronary heart disease. Those who ate fish five times a week had a 34% reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease and a 45% reduction in the risk of death from heart disease (usually sudden cardiac death).''Controlled Studies:'' Controlled studies are prospective studies that randomly (by chance, e.g., by a flip of a coin) assign subjects to two groups, a treatment group and control group. Subjects in the treatment group are given the medication (or diet) being tested, while the subjects in the control group are usually given an inert substance (placebo).''Two controlled studies on omega-3 fatty acids and fish oil have recently been published. The GISSI-''Prevention'' trial studied the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sudden death and the recurrence of coronary heart disease in patients who recently survived a heart attack. The Lyon Diet Heart Study studied the effect of a ''Mediterranean diet'' (see discussion below) on the recurrence of coronary heart disease in patients who recently survived a heart attack.''The GISSI-Prevention trial randomly assigned more than 11,000 patients with recent ''heart attacks'' to four treatment groups; omega-3 fatty acids (850 mg capsule daily), ''vitamin E'', both, or neither (control). The study subjects in all four groups were followed for 3.5 years. Study results were published in ''Circulation'', 2002; 105:1897-1903. Subjects given omega-3 fatty acids had a 20% lower death rate from coronary heart disease than subjects in the vitamin E and control groups. Omega-3 fatty acids were particularly effective in preventing sudden cardiac death (45% reduction in sudden cardiac death). The scientists believed that the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids are in the prevention of ventricular fibrillation. Vitamin E was found to have no benefit compared to controls.''The Lyon Diet Heart Study randomly assigned 600 subjects who survived recent heart attacks to either the ''Mediterranean diet'' or a prudent Western diet (diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol). The Mediterranean diet is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, as well as monounsaturated fats, fruits, vegetables, and nuts. The study subjects were followed for 4 years. The results of the study were published in ''Circulation'', 1999; 99:779-785. The subjects eating the Mediterranean diet had more than a 50% reduction in sudden cardiac death and in repeat fatal or nonfatal heart attacks as compared to the Western diet group.''The GISSI-Prevention trial found that omega-3 fatty acids prevented sudden cardiac death, but did not prevent repeat heart attacks. The Lyon Diet Heart Study found that the Mediterranean diet not only prevented sudden cardiac death, but also prevented the recurrence of both fatal and nonfatal heart attacks. The reasons for the difference in the two studies are not clear. Perhaps there are additional cardiac protective factors in the Mediterranean diet.' "
Facts you should know about onchocerciasis," Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease that may cause blindness. It occurs mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and a few isolated areas in the Americas (Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Venezuela) and is transmitted by blackfly bites. It is called river blindness as the blackfly that transmits the disease lives and breeds near fast-flowing rivers. Symptoms include skin changes, itching, nodules, and alterations in vision. Symptoms may not appear for months to years. Onchocerciasis is diagnosed by finding the parasites in skin nodules, skin biopsies, or skin scrapings. The treatment is the antiparasite drug ivermectin, given once or twice a year for about 10-15 years; the antibiotic doxycycline may also be utilized. The major risk factor for onchocerciasis is residing or having extended visit time in areas where blackflies are endemic. There are no vaccines or drugs that prevent onchocerciasis. Avoiding areas where blackflies are endemic and the use of personal protection items (clothing, insect repellents) reduce the chance of infection. The earlier that onchocerciasis is diagnosed and treated, usually the better is the prognosis."
What is onchocerciasis?,"'Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease caused by parasites (nematode) named ''Onchocerca volvulus''. It is transmitted to humans by the bite (blood meal) of the female blackfly (''Simulium''). The disease is also termed river blindness because the vector, the blackfly, is usually found breeding close to rapidly flowing streams and rivers, and because the most devastating manifestation of the infection is blindness. Although the majority of people infected reside in sub-Saharan Africa (for example, Nigeria), it also occurs in Central and South American countries and Yemen but much less frequently. After ''trachoma'', it is the second-leading cause of infection-caused blindness worldwide. The CDC classifies it in the Neglected Tropical Diseases category: a group of parasitic and bacterial disease that cause substantial illness in more than 1 billion patients.' "
What causes onchocerciasis?,"'The cause of onchocerciasis is the transfer of larvae of the parasite ''Onchocerca volvulus'' by the female blackfly when the fly gets a blood meal (bites) a human. The larvae enter the subcutaneous tissues and develop into adult male and female worms (filarial nematodes). These reproduce in the human tissue and form microfilariae that migrate to other areas of connective tissue and occasionally to the blood, urine, and sputum. In addition, both the adult worms and the microfilaria are colonized with bacteria termed ''Wolbachia'' that help these parasites survive. When the worms die, a host immune response ensues that can destroy optical tissue in the eye. The life cycle of the parasites is continued when a blackfly bites a human and, during its blood meal, ingests microfilariae. The complex life cycle is shown below.' "
What are risk factors for onchocerciasis?,"'Living in and visiting sub-Sahara Africa and the few other areas where the blackfly is endemic is a major risk factor for developing onchocerciasis. The disease usually occurs after repeated exposures to blackfly bites so short-term ''travelers'' through these areas pose little risk; however, missionaries, volunteer health workers, and others who may spend a few months in the areas have an increased risk of infection.' "
Is onchocerciasis contagious?,'Onchocerciasis is not ''contagious'' person to person. Transmission of the disease is through the bite of female blackflies (usually occurring during the daytime near rapidly flowing rivers and streams). Multiple bites are usually needed before being infected.' 
What are onchocerciasis symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms and signs of onchocerciasis are as follows:'   Skin inflammation that is very itchy and forms papules on the skin Nodules in the skin (subcutaneous nodules or bumps) Scarred, saggy, or drooping areas of skin Patchy skin depigmentation (leopard skin) Lymph node inflammation (lymphadenitis) Eye (ocular) lesions (eye itching, redness, or swelling) Visual problems (visual impairment and/or inability to distinguish certain colors, partial or complete blindness) Eosinophilia (unusually high levels of eosinophils in the blood) ""Sowda"" is a term used to describe the severe itching and skin discoloration (darkening), that is often confined to one limb, that can be found with onchocerciasis."
Is there an incubation period for onchocerciasis?,"'Although the infection with larvae begins immediately, the disease may not become apparent in an individual for months to years. In most individuals, it develops slowly in the skin although some patients may present initially with ''eye problems''.' "
What types of specialists treat onchocerciasis?,"""Although local clinic doctors, who are often the patient's primary-care provider, usually treat onchocerciasis, specialists may be consulted. Such specialists are infectious-disease, ophthalmologist, dermatologists, and travel-medicine doctors. These specialists can help diagnose and treat patients with onchocerciasis."" "
How do health care professionals diagnose onchocerciasis?,"'Clinical presumptive diagnosis is made if the patient lives or visits areas where the disease is endemic and has characteristic skin or eye changes described above. Definitive diagnosis is simply done by seeing adult worms in excised skin nodules, eye lesions, or by finding microfilariae in skin shavings or punch biopsies of the skin. In addition, an immunological test for antibodies developed against the parasites early in the infection is useful to determine if a person is infected before microfilariae are detectable. This test is available from the CDC. It is important to obtain a definitive diagnosis so that appropriate treatment can be started (see treatment section below). Onchocerciasis is a type of filariasis that does not respond well to some other ''drugs'' used to treat other similar filarial diseases. Diethylcarbamazine, a commonly used drug that is a derivative of piperazine, actually has been linked to severe and sometimes fatal patient reactions when used to treat onchocerciasis.' "
What is the treatment for onchocerciasis?,"'Treatment is done by giving the patient ''ivermectin'', an antiparasitic drug once or twice per year for about 10-15 years (the life span of adult worms). This antiparasite drug is effective in killing the microfilariae but does not kill the adult worms. The mature worms may remain alive for 10-15 years in the patient. Most clinicians recommend that subcutaneous nodules should be excised, if possible, thereby removing the adult worms that may reproduce more microfilariae over time. Some clinicians recommend that after ivermectin treatment, patients may benefit from a six-week dose of ''doxycycline'' antibiotic. Doxycycline damages and kills ''Wolbachia'' bacteria that are inside the microfilariae and adult worms, resulting in the death of microfilariae and ineffective microfilariae produced by the surviving adult worms. This may slow or halt further disease development.''The use of diethylcarbamazine (a treatment used before ivermectin became available) is contraindicated. It may cause severe or fatal patient reactions in individuals with onchocerciasis.'""A new drug capable of killing the adult worms of onchocerciasis is under study for use in humans. It's named moxidectin but has not yet been approved for use in humans for treatment of onchocerciasis."" "
Is it possible to prevent onchocerciasis?,"'Currently, there is no drug or ''vaccine'' available that prevents onchocerciasis. However, preventing blackfly bites by avoiding areas where they are endemic can prevent infections. Other measures such as personal protection against blackfly bites and other biting insects (for example, insect repellent, pants tucked in boots, long-sleeved shirts) may reduce the chances of infection. ''Permethrin'', an insect repellent, can be impregnated into cloth (shirts, pants, netting) and offers additional protection against blackfly bites' "
"What is the prognosis 
and possible complications of onchocerciasis?","'The prognosis (outcome) depends on how quickly the infection is recognized and treated. The prognosis is good if the disease is adequately treated and the patient makes their follow-up appointments and treatments. However, if the diagnosis and treatment is accomplished late in the disease, the prognosis may be fair to poor because the patient may develop complications of significant skin alterations, visual problems, or complete blindness.' "
What are ingrown toenails?,"'An ingrown toenail (onychocryptosis) is caused by the pressure from the ingrowth of the nail edge into the skin of the toe. Once the edge of the nail breaks through the skin, it produces inflammation. Initially presenting as a minor discomfort, it may progress into an infection in the adjacent skin (''cellulitis'') and/or become a reoccurring problem. Ingrown toenails most commonly affect the large (great) toes.'  "
What causes ingrown toenails?,"'An imbalance between the size of the nail and the enlargement of the nail skin edge causes ingrown toenails. This condition can be exacerbated by improper trimming of the toenail, an ''inherited'"" or hereditary condition, and improper shoe fitting. Injury by overly aggressive pedicures and nail picking are also common causes. Some people's toenails naturally curl inward (known as pincer nails). These toenails can easily become painful. Adolescents and athletes perspire more often. This causes nails and skin to be soft. The thin nail can eventually split and pierce the softened skin.""  "
Are some people more prone to ingrown toenails?,"'There are a number of risk factors that may predispose a person to having an ingrown toenail. The following are some of the more common:' Athletics, particularly stop and start sports such as tennis, soccer, and basketball Improper shoe gear that is either too small or too large Repetitive pressure or trauma to the feet Poor foot hygiene Abnormal gait and poor foot mechanics such as pronation Foot or toe deformities, such as bunions, hammertoes, and flat foot Congenital toenail deformity Abnormally long toes Obesity Diabetes Heart, kidney, and thyroid problems, which may cause foot and leg swelling Fungus infection of the nails (onychomycosis) Arthritis Bony or soft-tissue tumors of the toes Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating of the feet) Edema of the lower extremities"
Which nails are most commonly affected by ingrown toenails?,"'Ingrown toenails most commonly occur in the large or ""great toes."" Those great toes that are shorter than the second toes are even more prone to ingrown toenails. However, any of the toenails can be affected on either border or side.' "
What causes infections in ingrown toenails?,"'The warm, moist environment of the feet can be a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. These commonly include ''Staphylococcus'', ''Pseudomonas'', dermatophytes, ''Candida'', and ''Trichophyton''. When there is a break in the skin from the offending nail border, these organisms can invade the area and cause an infection. Treatment for these infections is essential to maintain healthy toenails and feet. The medical term for infected ingrown toenail is called ''paronychia''. If not treated, the infected toenail can cause serious problems such as ''chronic pain'' and disfigurement, cellulitis, and bone infection.' "
What are ingrown toenail symptoms and signs?,"'Ingrown toenail symptoms and signs include redness, ''pain'', and swelling. Sometimes there may be a clear yellowish drainage, or if it becomes infected, ''pus drainage''. Young children may show signs of ''limping'' in order to avoid putting pressure at the ingrown toenail site. Occasionally, ingrown toenails resolve without treatment. A podiatrist should treat painful, persistent, and recurring ingrown toenails. If the ingrown toenail has been present for a long time, a very vascular tissue called granulation tissue may form that easily bleeds.' "
How do physicians diagnose an ingrown toenail?,"'The diagnosis of an ingrown toenail is typically straightforward and does not require diagnostic labs or images. However, the signs and symptoms of ingrown toenails can vary quite dramatically, particularly if an infection develops. There may simply be some tenderness at the nail border when pressure is applied. There is typically an incurvation of the nail or a spike of nail (spicule) pressing into the skin of the nail border. Associated redness and swelling localized to the nail also suggest the diagnosis of an ingrown toenail. When an infection is involved, there may be severe redness and swelling, drainage, pus, and malodor.''Making the proper diagnosis requires taking into account the medical history and all possible causative factors. If one is unsure, seek professional help. Some conditions such as tumors, foreign bodies, trauma, and fungal infection may appear to be an ingrown toenail to the untrained eye.' "
What are possible complications of ingrown toenails?,"'A persisting ingrown toenail can have serious consequences. A localized infection of the nail border (paronychia) can progress to a deeper soft-tissue infection (cellulitis), which can in turn progress to a bone infection (''osteomyelitis''). Complications can include scarring of the surrounding skin and nail borders (nail fold hypertrophy) as well as thickened, deformed (onychodystrophy) fungal toenails (''onychomycosis''). Sometimes, there is an enlargement of soft tissue at the nail fold that easily bleeds and drains.' "
Are there any home remedies for an ingrown toenail?,"'The following home remedies may provide temporary relief.''If symptoms persist, seek medical treatment from a podiatrist.'   Lukewarm water foot soaks for 15-20 minutes with any one of the following options can be helpful: one part white vinegar to four parts water; 2 tablespoons Epsom salts per quart of water; or a dilute Clorox type bleach with 1/3 teaspoon of Clorox in 1 gallon of water. Gently massage the affected skin area downward while soaking. Elevate the foot and leg. Take oral anti-inflammatory medications. Apply antibacterial ointments on the affected side of the nail. Trim the toenail straight across the top without digging into the corners or leaving them too short. Carefully rolling back the overgrown skin at the affected nail border may allow you to slip a small piece of cotton or dental floss to lift the offending edge of the nail up from the skin. Wait for the nail to outgrow while attempting any one of the above methods."
When should someone seek medical treatment for an ingrown toenail?,"'People with ''diabetes'' or those who have a compromised immune system or poor circulation should promptly seek the care of a podiatrist/physician for ingrown toenail treatment even if the symptoms appear mild. If home remedies are not successful within a week or there is persistent ''pain'' and/or signs of infection, seek podiatric medical treatment. Symptoms and signs of infection can include:' Swelling Redness Streaking (redness spreading from the toe to middle of the foot) Pain Malodor Drainage that may be yellow, green, or white and purulent (containing pus)"
What kind of doctor treats ingrown toenails?,"""Although many types of doctors, including family physicians, pediatricians, urgent-care walk-in physicians, and dermatologists, can treat ingrown toenails, podiatrists (foot and ankle specialty doctors) are uniquely qualified among the medical professionals to treat this condition. A podiatrist's office is also equipped with necessary instruments required to perform ingrown toenail procedures."" "
What is the treatment for ingrown toenails?,"'There are various types of treatments, including self-care, soaking, avoidance of shoe pressure on the toenails, proper methods to trim the nails, and various surgical treatments. Sometimes antibiotics may be required.' "
What types of nail surgery are used for ingrown toenails?,"'Surgical treatments include the following: temporary resection and removal of the offending nail border or corner, avulsion (detachment) of the nail or offending nail border, or permanent elimination of the nail (matrixectomy) or offending nail border (partial matrixectomy). A matrixectomy is the destruction or removal of the cells where the nail grows from called the nail matrix. The nail matrix is at the base of the toenail under the skin. This procedure can be done surgically by dissection, chemically, or electrically by destroying part or all of the matrix cells. These procedures are commonly reserved for chronic or recurrent situations.'  "
Do surgical procedures that treat ingrown toenails require anesthesia?,"'Simple resection and removal of the offending nail edge often does not require anesthesia. However, nail avulsion and matrixectomy does require local anesthesia. The anesthesia is injected directly into the toe and its effect lasts throughout the procedure. Because the anesthesia is administered locally, there is a minimal effect on driving or ''walking'' after the procedure.' "
What does the recovery from toenail surgery entail?,"'The operated foot should be elevated for the remainder of the day. Typically, the dressings are removed the day following the procedure. Cleansing of the ''wound'' or soaks in Epsom salts and/or antimicrobial soap followed by application of an antibacterial cream and small bandage (Band-Aid) twice a day for one to two weeks can help to prevent infection. Open toe or loose-fitting, wide toe box shoes are recommended to avoid pressure to the toe while healing. Your doctor may want to see you return in a few weeks to ensure appropriate healing of the procedure site.' "
What is the appearance of the nail after surgery?,"'If a permanent resection of the nail was performed (matrixectomy), the nail will appear narrower by a few millimeters on the affected nail border. Unless a large portion of the nail was removed during the procedure, the overall appearance of the nail does not change significantly. If the nail matrix is not removed or cauterized, then the nail should regrow to its original appearance and width.'""If conservative treatments fail, surgery to remove the offending nail border is recommended. If the condition is recurrent and/or chronic, a matrixectomy may be recommended. Both procedures (removal of offending nail and matrixectomy) are usually performed in your doctor or podiatrist's office."" "
What are the potential complications of surgery?,"'Complications from ingrown toenail surgeries are rare but can occur. Complications include infection after the procedure, prolonged tenderness along the procedure site, a slow-healing wound (especially in those with ''diabetes''), and recurrence. You are more prone to post-surgery complications if you do not follow proper instruction to care for the ingrown toenail. Fortunately, these complications are fairly easy to manage. If you are prone to infection, your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics following the procedure.' "
How can people prevent ingrown toenails from recurring?,"'Avoid shoes that are too small (putting pressure on the toenail) or too large (where the foot is moving back-and-forth inside the shoe). Improperly fitting footwear can cause trauma to the toenail. Sometimes the best shoes for symptomatic ingrown toenails are those without a closed toe box. Use proper methods of trimming the toenail with clean instruments, cut straight across toenails, and do not trim them too short. Wear corrective orthotic devices if you have faulty foot mechanics that result in excessive pressure at the nail fold.'  "
Ingrown toenail do's, Do wear properly fitting shoes that allow you to wiggle your toes without having your foot slide around within. Do avoid repeated pressure and trauma to the toenails. Do wear sport-specific shoes. Do practice good foot hygiene. Do trim toenails straight across.
Ingrown toenail don'ts, Don't cut down the corners of the toenails. Don't trim toenails too short. Don't wear improperly fitting shoes. Don't avoid treatment by a professional if symptoms persist. Don't do surgery on the toenail yourself.
What is the prognosis for an ingrown toenail?,"'The prognosis for an ingrown toenail is generally very good, particularly if you seek professional treatment when the problem does not resolve itself after a week or so and a medical professional addresses risk factors.' "
"Facts you should know about fungal nails (onychomycosis, tinea unguium)","'Many changes in fingernails or toenails may cause people to think they have a fungal infection of the nails, medically known as ''onychomycosis'' or ''tinea unguium''.''Fungal infection of the nails sometimes makes the condition sound ''contagious'' or related to ''poor hygiene''. In fact, up to 10% of all adults in Western countries have fungal infection of the nails. This percentage increases to 20% of adults who are age 60 or older. ''Toenail fungus'' is much more common than fingernail fungus.''In reality, abnormal-looking nails may be caused by a number of conditions including, but not limited to, fungal infection. There are many other reasons why your nails may look different.' "
What other conditions can be mistaken for fungal nails?,"'Here are some other conditions you may have instead of ''fungal nails'':' Lines and ridges: These are common and may be considered normal. They may worsen during pregnancy. A large groove down the center of the nail can be caused by nail biting. Some people may develop these changes following chemotherapy. Senile nails: As you age, the nails become brittle and develop ridges and separation of the nail layers at the end of the nail. To avoid this, try to clean solutions and don't soak the nails in water. Whitish or yellowish nails can occur due to onycholysis. This means separation of the nail from the nail bed. The color you see is air beneath the nail. The treatment is to trim the nail short, don't clean under it, polish if you want to hide the color, and wait two to three months. Persistent onycholysis can make the nails susceptible to fungal infection. Red or black nails due to a hematoma, or blood under the nail, usually occur from trauma (like whacking yourself on the thumb with a hammer). The discolored area will grow out with the nail and be trimmed off as you trim your nails. If you have a black spot under your nail that was not caused by trauma, you may want to see a dermatologist or a podiatrist if it involves a toenail to make sure it is not melanoma (a type of skin cancer associated with pigmented cells). A simple biopsy can rule out malignancy (cancer). Green nails can be caused by Pseudomonas bacteria, which grow under a nail that has partially separated from the nail bed. This infection may cause a foul odor of the nails. The treatment is to trim the nail short every four weeks, don't clean it, polish if you want to hide the color, and wait two to three months. It is also advised to avoid soaking the nail in any sort of water (even if inside gloves) and to thoroughly dry the nail after bathing. If the problem continues, there are prescription treatments that your doctor may try. Pitted nails may be associated with psoriasis or other skin problems that affect the nail matrix, the area under the skin just behind the nail. This is the area from which the nail grows. Nails affected by psoriasis can also be tan in color. Swelling and redness of the skin around the nail is called paronychia. This is an infection of the skin at the bottom of the nail (cuticle). If the infection is acute (has a rapid onset), it is usually caused by bacteria. It may respond to warm soaks but will often need to be drained by a doctor. A chronic paronychia occurs when a cuticle becomes inflamed or irritated over time. Sometimes, yeast will take advantage of the damaged skin and infect the area as well. Therapy begins with keeping the skin dry and out of water. If the problem continues, a physician should be consulted. Antibiotics are not often used but may be necessary in severe infection. Chronic nail trauma, such as repeatedly starting and stopping, kicking, and other athletic endeavors, can cause damage to the nails that can look a lot like fungal nails. This sort of repetitive trauma can also occur with certain types of employment or wearing tight-fitting shoes. Some traumas may cause permanent changes that may mimic the appearance of fungal nails."
"What causes fungal nails, and what are some of the risk factors?","'In normal, healthy people, ''fungal infections'' of the nails are most commonly caused by fungus that is caught from moist, wet areas. Communal showers, such as those at a gym or ''swimming'' pools, are common sources. Going to nail salons that use inadequate sanitization of instruments (such as clippers, filers, and foot tubs) in addition to living with family members who have fungal nails are also risk factors. Athletes have been proven to be more susceptible to ''nail fungus''. This is presumed to be due to the wearing of tight-fitting, sweaty shoes associated with repetitive trauma to the toenails. Having '""athlete's foot""' makes it more likely that the fungus will infect your toenails. Repetitive trauma also weakens the nail, which makes the nail more susceptible to fungal infection.''Elderly people and people with certain underlying disease states are also at higher risk. Anything that impairs your immune system can make you prone to getting infected with the fungus. These include conditions such as ''AIDS'', ''diabetes'', ''cancer'', ''psoriasis'', or taking any immunosuppressive medications like steroids.' "
Are fungal nails contagious?,"'While the fungus must be obtained from someplace, it is not highly contagious. Nail fungus is so common that finding more than one person in a household who has it is hardly more than a coincidence. It can be transmitted from person to person but only with constant intimate contact.' "
What are fungal nail symptoms and signs?,"'Although fungal nails are usually cosmetic concerns, some patients do experience ''pain'' and discomfort. These symptoms may be exacerbated by footwear, activity, and improper trimming of the nails.''There are many species of fungi that can affect nails. By far the most common, however, is called ''Trichophyton rubrum ''(''T. rubrum''). This type of fungus has a tendency to infect the skin (known as a dermatophyte) and manifests in the following specific ways.'   Starts at the ends of the nails and raises the nail up: This is called ""distal subungual onychomycosis."" It is the most common type of fungal infection of the nails in both adults and children. It is more common in the toes than the fingers, and the great toe is usually the first one to be affected. Risk factors include older age, swimming, athlete's foot, psoriasis, diabetes, family members with the infection, or a suppressed immune system. It usually starts as a discolored area at a corner of the big toe and slowly spreads toward the cuticle. Eventually, the toenails will become thickened and flaky. Sometimes, you can also see signs of athlete's foot in between the toes or skin peeling on the sole of the foot. It is often accompanied by onycholysis. The most common cause is T. rubrum. Starts at the base of the nail and raises the nail up: This is called ""proximal subungual onychomycosis."" This is the least common type of fungal nail. It is similar to the distal type, but it starts at the cuticle (base of the nail) and slowly spreads toward the nail tip. This type almost always occurs in people with a damaged immune system. It is rare to see debris under the tip of the nail with this condition, unlike distal subungual onychomycosis. The most common cause is T. rubrum and non-dermatophyte molds. Yeast onychomycosis: This type is caused by a yeast called Candida and not by the Trichophyton fungus named above. It is more common in fingernails and is a common cause of fungal fingernails. Patients may have associated paronychia (infection of the cuticle). Candida can cause yellow, brown, white, or thickened nails. Some people who have this infection also have yeast in their mouth or have a chronic paronychia (see above) that is also infected with yeast. White superficial onychomycosis: In this nail condition, a doctor can often scrape off a white powdery material on the top of the nail plate. This condition is most common in tropical environments and is caused by a fungus known and Trichophyton mentagrophytes."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose fungal nails?,"'Physical exam alone has been shown to be an unreliable method of diagnosing fungal nails. There are many conditions that can make nails look damaged, so even doctors have a difficult time. In fact, studies have found that only about 50% of cases of abnormal nail appearance were caused by fungus. Therefore, laboratory testing is almost always indicated. Some insurance companies may even ask for a laboratory test confirmation of the diagnosis in order for antifungal medicine to be covered. A nail sample is obtained either by clipping the toenail or by drilling a hole in the nail. That piece of nail is sent to a lab where it can by stained, cultured, or tested by ''PCR'' (to identify the genetic material of the organisms) to identify the presence of fungus. Staining and culturing can take up to six weeks to get a result, but PCR to identify the fungal genetic material, if available, can be done in about one day. However, this test is not widely used due to its high cost. If a negative biopsy result is accompanied by high clinical suspicion, such as nails that are ragged, discolored, thickened, and crumbly, it warrants a repeat test due to the prevalence of false-negative results in these tests.''Most of the medications used to treat nail fungus have side effects, so you want to make sure of what you are treating.'  "
What specialists treat nail fungus?,"'There are several doctors who can provide nail fungus treatment. Your primary care provider, a dermatologist, or a podiatrist can treat nail fungus. Any one of these doctors can provide proper diagnosis and prescribe medications specific to fungal infection. A podiatrist or dermatologist may shave the top layer of the nail off or even remove part of the nail.' "
Who should be treated for fungal nails?,'Medical treatment of onychomycosis is suggested in patients who are experiencing ''pain'' and discomfort due to the nail changes. Patients with higher risk factors for infections such as ''diabetes'' and a previous history of ''cellulitis'' (infection of the soft tissue) near the affected nails may also benefit from treatment. Poor cosmetic appearance is another reason for medical treatment.' 
How to get rid of toenail fungus?,"'Keeping nails trimmed and filed can help to reduce the amount of fungus in the nails and is highly recommended. This also provides pain relief when thickened nails cause pressure-related pain.''Creams and other topical medications have traditionally been less effective against nail fungus than oral medications. This is because nails are too hard for external applications to penetrate. It is also cumbersome to adhere to topical medication regimens. Oftentimes, these medications require daily applications for a period of time up to one year to see results. One of the major advantages of topical treatment is the minimal risk for serious side effects and ''drug interactions'' compared to oral therapy.''Prescription topical medications for fungal nails include the following:''Ciclopirox'' (''Penlac'') topical solution 8% is a medical nail lacquer that has been approved to treat finger or toenail fungus that does not involve the white portion of the nail (lunula) in people with normal immune systems. In one study, ciclopirox got rid of the fungus 22% of the time. The medication is applied to affected nails once daily for up to one year. The lacquer must be wiped clean with ''alcohol'' once a week.''Amorolfine topical solution 5%: There is some evidence that using an antifungal nail lacquer containing amorolfine can prevent reinfection after a cure, with a success rate of about 70%. However, this drug is currently unavailable in the United States.''Efinaconazole'' (''Jublia'') is a medication that was approved in 2014. It is a topical (applied to the skin) antifungal used for the local treatment of toenail fungus due to two most common fungal species affecting nails (''Trichophyton rubrum'' and ''Trichophyton mentagrophytes''). Once-daily application is required for 48 weeks. The most common side effects of Jublia are ''ingrown toenails'' and application site ''dermatitis'' and pain.''Tavaborole (Kerydin) is another new medication that is indicated for onychomycosis of the toenails. This medicine has the same indication as efinaconazole. It also requires application once daily for 48 weeks. Common side effects of Kerydin are similar to those of Jublia.'  "
What is the treatment for fungal nails?,"'Oral antifungal therapy has a high cure rate, depending on the medication. It can take nine to 12 months to see if it has worked or not, because that is how long it takes for the nail to grow out. Even when therapy works, the fungus may come back. Currently, an oral antifungal therapy is considered the best treatment for toenail fungus because of higher cure rates and shorter treatment duration compared to topical therapy.''Prescription oral medications that are effective against nail fungus include the following:''There are several innovative treatments that are still being tested:''One way to definitively get rid of toenail fungus is by surgery. Surgical treatment of onychomycosis involves nail removal. However, this often only provides temporary relief, and recurrence is common unless additional antifungal medication (oral or topical) is simultaneously used. However, surgical removal may be warranted when the affected nail is associated with other factors such as trauma and or infection.' Griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Grifulvin, Gris-Peg): This drug has been the mainstay of oral antifungal therapy for many years. Although this drug is safe, it is not very effective against toenail fungus. Disappointing long-term results have been reported. Newer agents have largely supplanted it. Terbinafine (Lamisil): This drug is taken daily for 12 weeks for toenails and six weeks for fingernails. The drug is safe, effective, and produces few side effects. However, it must be used with caution in patients with liver disease. This medication is also affordable. Itraconazole (Sporanox): This is often prescribed in ""pulse doses"" -- one week per month for two or three months. It can interact with some commonly used drugs such as the antibiotic erythromycin or certain asthma medications. It is considered the treatment of choice for onychomycosis caused by Candida yeast and non-dermatophytic molds. Fluconazole (Diflucan): This drug may be given once a week for several months. The dosing of this drug may need to be modified if the patient has impaired kidney function or is taking it simultaneously with certain other medications. It is not as effective as Lamisil or Sporanox and should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease. A doctor will determine whether a simple blood test is needed to check for liver disease. Laser therapy or photodynamic therapy uses application of light-activated agents onto the nail followed by shining light of a proper wavelength on the nail. Use of electrical current to help absorption of topical antifungal medications into the nail: This is also called iontophoresis. Use of a special nail lacquer that changes the micro-climate of the nail to make it inhospitable for the fungus to grow: If this works, it may be an inexpensive way to treat this problem in the future."
Are there home remedies for toenail fungus?,"'The Internet is filled with anecdotal information on how to cure toenail fungus using home remedies. Vinegar is a commonly recommended home remedy. Some people apply various oils such as ''tea tree oil'', coconut oil, essential oils, and oil of cedar leaf (such as Vicks VapoRub) to their nails as well. The effectiveness of these home remedies is highly doubtful. Application of household bleach and hydrogen peroxide is also not recommended due to lack of evidence that these treatments work. These agents can also cause unwanted skin irritation. Thickened nails that have been affected by fungus can be difficult to trim. Using topical urea cream will soften the nail and make it easier to trim. These creams do not require a prescription.' "
Are there over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus?,"'The definition of ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) products means that they are available by ordinary retail purchase, not requiring a prescription or a license. Although there are few OTC medications aimed to treat fungal nails, many of these medications have not been tested and therefore are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of onychomycosis. Most OTC agents are aimed at treating fungal infection of the skin rather than the nail. Some medications list undecylenic acid and/or propylene glycol as main ingredients. These ingredients inhibit fungal growth; however, they may not adequately penetrate the nail to be effective in treating fungal nails.' "
Are oral medications for nail fungus toxic?,"'The newer drugs are unlikely to cause any liver problems in patients without known liver disease. Blood tests are not needed for once-weekly treatment with fluconazole (Diflucan); however, people taking longer courses often have their ''liver function'' tested before starting the medicine and then retested during the course of treatment. It is important to notify the doctor of all side effects while on the medication. You should tell your doctor of all current medications to prevent potential serious drug interactions.' "
What about the cost of oral medications for fungal nails?,"'A further consideration is cost. Because newer oral antifungal agents are very expensive, some insurance companies balk at paying for what they consider a ""cosmetic issue,"" unless nail fungus causes pain or other functional symptoms. Terbinafine and fluconazole are now available as generic drugs and are quite inexpensive.' "
What is the prognosis of fungal nails?,"'Curing fungal nails can be difficult and treatment can take up to 18 months. Relapse and reinfection are common. Trying to remove or modify your risk factors, if possible, is essential to preventing reinfection. People who have medical illnesses that predispose them to fungal nails can have an even more difficult time eradicating the fungus.' "
Is it possible to prevent the recurrence of nail fungus?,"'Tinea pedis'', also known as '""athlete's foot""' or ''foot fungus'', can cause recurrence of fungal nails. Therefore, it is important to manage this condition. One can apply over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medicines such as ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin) or terbinafine (Lamisil) cream as directed to affected skin. Keeping footwear and socks clean can be helpful. You can also use portable UV light sanitizers to disinfect shoes.' "
Tips for prevention of fungal nails,"'Nail fungus causes only 50% of abnormal-appearing nails. It can be hard to tell the difference between the different causes of discolored nails (even for doctors). Onychomycosis is often not treated. Reasons to receive treatment include''Treatment failures and recurrences are common.''Prevention'' is the key. The following preventive measures may be helpful:' diabetes, previous leg infection (cellulitis), if you have pain or discomfort from your nails, or you would like them treated for cosmetic reasons. Keep your toenails short, and don't dig into the corners of your nails when cutting toenails. Keep feet clean, and dry them thoroughly. Wear dry socks and no tight shoes. Alternate your exercise shoes. Don't soak your hands in water or use harsh cleaners. Treat athlete's foot when it occurs."
Is it possible to prevent fungal nails?,"'No one knows where a specific person catches the fungus, as it is everywhere. However, since the fungus does thrive in warm moist areas (like sweaty feet), there are certain areas one should avoid or use with caution. Shower floors, locker rooms, and swimming pools are suspected of being sources of the fungus, although there are no studies proving this fact. Nail polish and acrylic nails also make the nail less ""breathable"" and make the nail more susceptible to fungal infection. Fungi are everywhere -- in the air, the dust, and the soil. Hygienic measures such as spraying socks and footgear sound sensible, and perhaps these measures can even help a little bit. However, avoiding tight, nonbreathing shoes or steering clear of athletic facility floors may very well be the best prevention available. Daily washing of the feet and drying between the toes can help to prevent nail fungus. The fungi carried on the coats of pets, like cats and ''dogs'"", don't often cause nail fungus. Wearing white socks does not help.""  "
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
What does an inguinal hernia mean?,"'An ''inguinal hernia'' is the bulging fatty tissue or a part of the bowel (such as the intestine) that pushes through a weakened area or defect in the abdomen near the groin. The ''hernia'' protrudes through a weak spot in the muscle wall and goes through a passage, called an inguinal canal, near the groin.\xa0''An ''inguinal hernia'' may become more prominent and cause discomfort when you ''cough'', sneeze, lift heavy weights or do physical activities. The hernia does not get cured on its own and you need to consult a surgeon to guide you on the options available to correct the defect.\xa0''Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in the world. A well-timed inguinal hernia surgery may protect you from complications, such as bowel obstruction or blockage, and disruption or cut-off of the blood supply to the bowel.' "
What are the types of inguinal hernia repair?,'An inguinal hernia repair may be done as an open surgery or as a laparoscopic (or keyhole) surgery. There are three broad types of inguinal hernia repairs:' Herniotomy (removal of the hernial sac only): This is preferred in young individuals who have normal muscles and repair of the wall of the inguinal canal is not required. Herniorrhaphy (herniotomy along with the repair of the wall at the back of the inguinal canal): This may be suitable for a small hernia in a young adult with healthy abdominal muscles. Hernioplasty (herniotomy plus strengthening of the wall at the back of the inguinal canal with a synthetic mesh): This procedure is suitable for large hernias and hernias in middle-aged and elderly patients with weak abdominal wall musculature.
What happens during an open inguinal hernia surgery?,"'Open inguinal surgery is generally performed by a general surgeon. The surgery may be done under regional or general anesthesia.''Before the surgery''Your doctor may:''During the surgery''After the surgery' Order some blood tests and imaging studies (such as X-ray, computed tomography scan,  magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography). Ask you about any chronic health conditions. Ask you about any medications you are taking. Ask about any allergies you may have. Explain the surgical procedure in detail, including possible complications. and address your doubts and concerns related to the surgery. Obtain your written consent. Tell you not to eat anything for at least eight hours before the procedure You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. The anesthesiologist will attach an intravenous line and administer anesthesia. The surgeon will clean the skin with an antiseptic and make a surgical cut (incision) over the hernia sac. The incision is generally around 6 to 8 centimeters long The surgeon places the lump of fatty tissue or loop of bowel back into your abdomen. A mesh may be placed in the abdominal wall, at the site of the weak spot where the hernia came through, to strengthen it. When the repair is done, the incision will be closed with stitches. In case of a complicated hernia, such as a strangulated hernia where the bowel is damaged due to disruption in its blood supply, the affected bowel segment may need to be removed and the two ends of healthy bowel rejoined.  Your vital signs will be monitored in the recovery room.   You will be weaned off the anesthesia and administered painkillers."
How long does an open inguinal hernia repair take?,"'On average, an open inguinal hernia repair usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes to complete. You may be allowed to go home on\xa0the same day.\xa0If you have other medical problems or do not have a ''caregiver'', you may stay in the hospital overnight for better care and observation. Furthermore, if your hernia gets complicated, by obstruction or strangulation of the bowel, the surgery may take longer to complete, and you may be asked to stay in the hospital for four to five days.' "
What is optic neuritis?,"'Optic neuritis is an inflammation that affects the myelin lining of the optic nerve, which transmits visual stimuli to the brain. The optic nerve is actually a nerve tract of axons that originate in the ganglion cells of the retina in the back of the eye. Nerve tracts are the information pathways in the brain. The ""optic nerves"" are the only nerve tracts not located entirely within the brain. The optic nerves carry visual information from the retina to the area of the brain that recognizes vision (the occipital cortex).''Optic neuritis can occur in children or adults and may involve either one or both optic nerves. Optic neuritis typically affects young adults ranging from 20 to 40 years of age. There is a strong female predominance. The annual incidence is approximately 6.4/100,000.'  "
What causes optic neuritis?,"'The precise cause of optic neuritis is unknown, but most cases are thought to be a type of autoimmune disorder. The immune system is generally used by the body to fight infection by creating a reaction that combats bacteria, ''viruses'', fungi, and other foreign proteins. In autoimmune diseases, this reaction is mistakenly directed against a normal part of the body, creating inflammation and potential damage. In the case of optic neuritis, the optic nerve becomes swollen and its function is impaired. Inflammation and destruction of the protective myelin sheath that coats and insulates the optic nerve, plus direct damage to the nerve axons results in ''loss of vision'', which may be temporary or permanent.''Optic neuritis is frequently an indication of ''multiple sclerosis'' (''MS''), a disease in which the immune system attacks the myelin sheath covering nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in inflammation and nerve damage. Optic neuritis typically resolves initially but often recurs.''In 15%-20% of people who eventually develop multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis is their first symptom. The risk of developing multiple sclerosis following one episode of optic neuritis is approximately 50% within 15 years of any first episode of optic neuritis. Various studies have shown that approximately 50% of patients who have optic neuritis for the first time will have ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI) brain and/or spinal cord abnormalities consistent with ''MS'' at the time of the initial optic neuritis.''Neuromyelitis optica'' is another autoimmune condition in which ''demyelination'' occurs both in the spinal cord and both optic nerves but often sparing the brain. In this infrequent condition, the patient can experience ''weakness'' or ''paralysis'' in the limbs and/or bladder and bowel dysfunction, as well as loss of vision.''Approximately one-half of initial cases of optic neuritis are presumed to be an inflammatory reaction developing one week to one month following an upper respiratory viral infection.''Certain ''bacterial infections'' (including ''Lyme disease'', cat scratch ''fever'', and ''syphilis'', as well as viral infections such as ''measles'', ''mumps'', ''herpes'' simplex, and ''herpes zoster'') can cause optic neuritis.''Other diseases (including ''sarcoidosis'' and systemic autoimmune disorders such as ''lupus'') can cause optic neuritis.''Some ''drugs'' (including quinine, ''tetracycline'', ''linezolid'' antibiotics, ''amiodarone'', ''ethambutol'', and ''isoniazid'') have been associated with the development of optic neuritis. The phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, such as ''Viagra'', may cause damage to the optic nerve from inadequate blood supply (ischemia), rather than primary inflammation.''There are a variety of conditions that can affect the optic nerve, causing symptoms like optic neuritis. These include various optic neuropathies due to infection, ''trauma'', hereditary conditions, toxic or nutritional problems, compressive lesions of the optic nerves, and vascular diseases, including arteritic ''optic neuropathy'', ''diabetes'', and ''glaucoma''. Treatment of these optic neuropathies is directed at the underlying disease.' "
What are optic neuritis risk factors?,"'Optic neuritis risk factors include trauma, hereditary conditions, toxic or nutritional problems, compressive lesions of the optic nerves, and vascular diseases, including arteritic optic neuropathy, ''diabetes'', and ''glaucoma''.' "
What are symptoms of optic neuritis?,"'The major symptom of optic neuritis is vision loss, usually in one eye, often developing within hours to a couple of days and peaking in one to two weeks. It may vary from a small area of blurring to complete ''blindness'"". Affected individuals may also notice distorted vision, inability to distinguish certain colors (dyschromatopsia), loss of contrast, and washed-out or less vivid vision than normal. Symptoms may be worsened by heat (Uthoff's phenomenon) or ""'exercise''. Vision loss is usually temporary, but it may be permanent in some cases.''Most people who develop optic neuritis experience ''eye pain'' that is worsened by eye movement. The intensity of the ''pain'' usually follows the course of the vision loss, decreasing and disappearing within one to four weeks.''Because optic neuritis usually affects one eye, patients may be unaware of subtle visual loss or changes in the color vision until they or doctors close or cover the healthy eye.'  "
What are signs of optic neuritis?,"'The most characteristic findings on examination include reduced visual acuity (typically 20/25 to 20/200), a measurable change in peripheral vision, decreased perception of brightness in the affected eye, and loss of color vision out of proportion to the loss of visual acuity. A disturbance in reaction of the pupil (afferent pupillary defect or APD) is usually detectable if the other eye is either unaffected or involved to a lesser degree.''The optic nerve head can easily be visualized with an ophthalmoscope. In one-third of the cases, there is visible swelling of the optic nerve head, and there may be enlargement of the blood vessels around the nerve. This condition is called papillitis. In about two-thirds of patients, the inflammation is entirely behind the eye (retrobulbar), causing no visible changes when the physician examines the optic nerve with an ophthalmoscope. This is called retrobulbar neuritis.' "
What types of doctors treat optic neuritis?,"'An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. Ophthalmologists diagnose and treat optic neuritis, often in conjunction with a neurologist or family physician. A neuro-ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who subspecializes in the connections between the eye and the brain. Other specialists are involved based on any underlying diseases.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose optic neuritis?,"'Optic neuritis is suspected based on the characteristic history of eye pain and vision loss. The standard exam includes visual acuity, pupillary reduction, visual field evaluation, color vision testing, and visualization of the optic disc by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy.''A person experiencing a first episode of optic neuritis should undergo an MRI of the brain to detect central nervous system lesions associated with ''MS''. If there is active brain inflammation, single or multiple ''brain lesions'' may be seen which light up (enhance) with injection of contrast material. The MRI may also show an enlarged optic nerve or inflamed optic nerve sheath.''Visual symptoms usually progress for the first few weeks and then start to improve within the first month. If the course of recovery is not typical, further testing can be performed to look for more unusual causes of optic neuritis/neuropathy.' "
What is the treatment for optic neuritis?,"'If a definite cause (such as infection or underlying other disease) is determined, appropriate therapy for that cause is instituted.''The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial, a multicenter randomized trial with 15 years of follow-up, showed that oral corticosteroids (''prednisone'') had no benefit on recovery to normal visual acuity. High-dose intravenous steroids, which involve some risks and can have significant side effects in some patients, including elevated blood ''sugar'', ''depression'', and ''insomnia''. In the trial, high-dose intravenous steroids did speed up the initial recovery of vision in the acute phase. However, there was no conclusive evidence that intravenous steroids had any long-term benefit on visual acuity, visual field, or contrast sensitivity five years later.''Although there is no evidence that the use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') have an effect on ultimate visual outcomes, they are effective in decreasing the pain on eye movement often associated with optic neuritis.''Various disease-modifying agents, including Glatiramer acetate (''Copaxone''), ''interferon beta-1a'' (''Avonex'', ''Rebif''), ''interferon'' beta-1b (Betaseron, Extavia), ''mitoxantrone'' (''Novantrone''), and natalizumab (''Tysabri''), are used to decrease episodes of demyelination in patients with suspected or proven multiple sclerosis.''Good ''nutrition'' and hydration, avoidance of tobacco, and refraining from vigorous ''exercise'' or over-heating is often recommended during the acute phase of optic neuritis.'  "
What is the prognosis for optic neuritis?,"'The prognosis depends on the underlying cause. Most episodes resolve spontaneously, with return of vision in two weeks to three months. About 90% of people with optic neuritis will recover most of their vision within six months of onset. However, about 14% will have a recurrence of optic neuritis in the affected eye, and 12% will develop optic neuritis in the other eye within 10 years. If the patient has one or more abnormal lesions on the MRI, the risk of MS within 15 years is 72%.' "
Is it possible to prevent optic neuritis?,"'Since almost 50% of optic neuritis is likely a result of a post-viral immune reaction, minimizing your risk of acquiring a viral ''respiratory infection'"" decreases your risk of optic neuritis. It is impossible to totally avoid exposure to respiratory viruses, but research has shown that frequent hand-washing and attempting to not touch one's face without first washing one's hands decreases the incidence of the ""'common cold''. Teaching children to cover their mouths and noses when ''sneezing'' and instructing them on personal hygiene can also decrease the chances of upper respiratory virus spreading within families.''In patients with recurrent optic neuritis secondary to multiple sclerosis, there are approved disease-modifying agents that reduce disease activity and disease progression for many people with relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing-remitting MS, as well as progressive forms of MS in those people who experience relapses. These include injectable forms of interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and the biologic monoclonal antibody, ''daclizumab''. Oral medications include ''teriflunomide'' (''Aubagio''), ''fingolimod'' (''Gilenya''), and ''dimethyl fumarate''.''Relapses of multiple sclerosis are sometimes treated with a three- to five-day course of intravenous high-dose corticosteroids such as ''methylprednisolone''. Similar to the use of this regimen in treating acute optic neuritis, intravenous corticosteroids will often end the relapse more rapidly but does not have any effect on the long-term outcome of the disease.'

What is the oral cavity?,'This article is about ''cancers'' that occur in the mouth (oral cavity) and the part of the throat at the back of the mouth (oropharynx). The oral cavity and oropharynx have many parts:' Lips Lining of your cheeks Salivary glands (glands that make saliva) Roof of your mouth (hard palate) Back of your mouth (soft palate and uvula) Floor of your mouth (area under the tongue) Gums and teeth Tongue Tonsils
What is cancer?,"'Cancer begins in cells, the building blocks that make up tissues. Tissues make up the organs of the body.''Normally, cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old, they die, and new cells take their place.''Sometimes this orderly process goes wrong. New cells form when the body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass of tissue called a growth or ''tumor''. The kinds of cells found in the tumor determine how the tumor will behave.''Tumors can be benign or malignant:''Oral cancer is part of a group of cancers called head and neck cancers. Oral cancer can develop in any part of the oral cavity or oropharynx. Most oral cancers begin in the tongue and in the floor of the mouth. Almost all oral cancers begin in the flat cells (squamous cells) that cover the surfaces of the mouth, tongue, and lips. These cancers are called squamous cell carcinomas.''When oral cancer spreads (metastasizes), it usually travels through the lymphatic system. Cancer cells that enter the lymphatic system are carried along by lymph, a clear, watery fluid. The cancer cells often appear first in nearby ''lymph nodes'' in the neck.''Cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the neck, the ''lungs'', and other parts of the body. When this happens, the new tumor has the same kind of abnormal cells as the primary tumor. For example, if oral cancer spreads to the lungs, the cancer cells in the lungs are actually oral cancer cells. The disease is metastatic oral cancer, not ''lung cancer''. It is treated as oral cancer, not ''lung cancer''. Doctors sometimes call the new tumor ""distant"" or metastatic disease.' Benign tumors are not cancer: Benign tumors are rarely life-threatening. Generally, benign tumors can be removed, and they usually do not grow back. Cells from benign tumors do not invade the tissues around them. Cells from benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors are cancer: Malignant tumors are generally more serious than benign tumors. They may be life-threatening. Malignant tumors often can be removed, but sometimes they grow back. Cells from malignant tumors can invade and damage nearby tissues and organs. Cells from malignant tumors can spread to other parts of the body. The cells spread by breaking away from the original cancer (primary tumor) and entering the bloodstream or lymphatic system. They invade other organs, forming new tumors and damaging these organs. The spread of cancer is called metastasis."
Who's at risk for oral cancer?,"'Doctors cannot always explain why one person develops oral cancer and another does not. However, we do know that this disease is not ''contagious''. You cannot ""catch"" oral cancer from another person.''Research has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop oral cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases your chance of developing a disease.''The following are risk factors for oral cancer:''Quitting tobacco reduces the risk of oral cancer. Also, quitting reduces the chance that a person with oral cancer will get a second cancer in the head and neck region. People who stop ''smoking'' can also reduce their risk of cancer of the lung, larynx, mouth, pancreas, bladder, and ''esophagus''.There are many resources to help smokers quit:''Some studies suggest that not eating enough fruits and vegetables may increase the chance of getting oral cancer. Human papilloma virus is a common viral infection. Today, it is emerging as another important risk factor. Research now suggests as many as half of oropharynx cancers are caused by ''HPV'' infection.''If you think you may be at risk, you should discuss this concern with your doctor or dentist. You may want to ask about an appropriate schedule for checkups. Your health care team will probably tell you that not using tobacco and limiting your use of alcohol are the most important things you can do to prevent oral cancers. Also, if you spend a lot of time in the sun, using a lip balm that contains sunscreen and wearing a hat with a brim will help protect your lips.' Tobacco: Tobacco use accounts for most oral cancers. Smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes; using chewing tobacco; and dipping snuff are all linked to oral cancer. The use of other tobacco products (such as bidis and kreteks) may also increase the risk of oral cancer. Heavy smokers who use tobacco for a long time are most at risk. The risk is even higher for tobacco users who drink alcohol heavily. In fact, three out of four oral cancers occur in people who use alcohol, tobacco, or both alcohol and tobacco. Alcohol: People who drink alcohol are more likely to develop oral cancer than people who don't drink. The risk increases with the amount of alcohol that a person consumes. The risk increases even more if the person both drinks alcohol and uses tobacco. Sun: Cancer of the lip can be caused by exposure to the sun. Using a lotion or lip balm that has a sunscreen can reduce the risk. Wearing a hat with a brim can also block the sun's harmful rays. The risk of cancer of the lip increases if the person also smokes. A personal history of head and neck cancer: People who have had head and neck cancer are at increased risk of developing another primary head and neck cancer. Smoking increases this risk. The Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER can talk with callers about ways to quit smoking and about groups that offer help to smokers who want to quit. Groups offer counseling in person or by telephone. Also, your doctor or dentist can help you find a local smoking cessation program. Your doctor can tell you about medicine (bupropion) or about nicotine replacement therapy, which comes as a patch, gum, lozenges, nasal spray, or inhaler. The ""National Cancer Institute Information Resources"" section has information about the Federal Government's smoking cessation Web site, http://www.smokefree.gov."
What are the symptoms of oral cancer?,"'Your regular checkup is a good time for your dentist or doctor to check your entire mouth for signs of cancer. Regular checkups can detect the early stages of oral cancer or conditions that may lead to oral cancer. Ask your doctor or dentist about checking the tissues in your mouth as part of your routine exam.''Common symptoms of oral cancer include:''Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor or dentist so that any problem can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Most often, these symptoms do not mean cancer. An infection or another problem can cause the same symptoms.'   Patches inside your mouth or on your lips that are white, a mixture of red and white, or red White patches (leukoplakia) are the most common. White patches sometimes become malignant. Mixed red and white patches (erythroleukoplakia) are more likely than white patches to become malignant. Red patches (erythroplakia) are brightly colored, smooth areas that often become malignant. A sore on your lip or in your mouth that won't heal Bleeding in your mouth Loose teeth Difficulty or pain when swallowing Difficulty wearing dentures A lump in your neck An earache"
How is oral cancer diagnosed?,"'If you have symptoms that suggest oral cancer, the doctor or dentist checks your mouth and throat for red or white patches, lumps, swelling, or other problems. This exam includes looking carefully at the roof of the mouth, back of the throat, and insides of the cheeks and lips. The doctor or dentist also gently pulls out your tongue so it can be checked on the sides and underneath. The floor of your mouth and lymph nodes in your neck also are checked.''If an exam shows an abnormal area, a small sample of tissue may be removed. Removing tissue to look for cancer cells is called a biopsy. Usually, a biopsy is done with local anesthesia. Sometimes, it is done under general anesthesia. A pathologist then looks at the tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. A biopsy is the only sure way to know if the abnormal area is cancerous.''If you need a biopsy, you may want to ask the doctor or dentist some of the following questions:'   Why do I need a biopsy? How much tissue do you expect to remove? How long will it take? Will I be awake? Will it hurt? How soon will I know the results? Are there any risks? What are the chances of infection or bleeding after the biopsy? How should I care for the biopsy site afterward? How long will it take to heal? Will I be able to eat and drink normally after the biopsy? If I do have cancer, who will talk with me about treatment? When?"
How is oral cancer treated?,"'If the biopsy shows that cancer is present, your doctor needs to know the stage (extent) of your disease to plan the best treatment. The stage is based on the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread and, if so, to what parts of the body.''Staging may require lab tests. It also may involve ''endoscopy''. The doctor uses a thin, lighted tube (endoscope) to check your throat, windpipe, and lungs. The endoscope may be flexible or rigid. The doctor inserts the endoscope through your nose or mouth. Local anesthesia is used to ease your discomfort and prevent you from gagging. Some people also may have a mild sedative. Sometimes the doctor uses general anesthesia to put a person to ''sleep'"". This exam may be done in a doctor's office, an outpatient clinic, or a hospital.""'The doctor may order one or more imaging tests to learn whether the cancer has spread:''Many people with oral cancer want to take an active part in making decisions about their medical care. It is natural to want to learn all you can about your disease and your treatment choices. However, ''shock'' and ''stress'' after the diagnosis can make it hard to think of everything you want to ask the doctor. It often helps to make a list of questions before an appointment. To help remember what the doctor says, you may take notes or ask whether you may use a tape recorder. You may also want to have a family member or friend with you when you talk to the doctor - to take part in the discussion, to take notes, or just to listen.''Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral. Specialists who treat oral cancer include oral and maxillofacial surgeons, otolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat doctors), medical oncologists, ''radiation'' oncologists, and ''plastic'' surgeons. You may be referred to a team that includes specialists in surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Other health care professionals who may work with the specialists as a team include a dentist, speech pathologist, nutritionist, and ''mental health'' counselor.''Before starting treatment, you might want a second opinion about the diagnosis and the treatment plan. Some insurance companies require a second opinion; others may cover a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Do not be afraid to ask for a second opinion. These are serious conditions and you may want to learn about your diagnosis and treatment options from more than one source. Your doctor should not be offended if you ask for a second opinion, and can help you to arrange it, if asked.''There are a number of ways to find a doctor for a second opinion:''You may want to ask the doctor these questions before treatment begins:''The choice of treatment depends mainly on your general health, where in your mouth or oropharynx the cancer began, the size of the tumor, and whether the cancer has spread. Your doctor can describe your treatment choices and the expected results. You will want to consider how treatment may affect normal activities such as swallowing and talking, and whether it will change the way you look. You and your doctor can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs and personal values.''You do not need to ask all your questions or understand all the answers at once. You will have other chances to ask your doctor to explain things that are not clear and to ask for more information.'  Dental x-rays: An x-ray of your entire mouth can show whether cancer has spread to the jaw. Chest x-rays: Images of your chest and lungs can show whether cancer has spread to these areas. CT scan: An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures of your body. You may receive an injection of dye. Tumors in the mouth, throat, neck, or elsewhere in the body show up on the CT scan. MRI: A powerful magnet linked to a computer is used to make detailed pictures of your body. The doctor can view these pictures on a monitor and can print them on film. An MRI can show whether oral cancer has spread. PET scan: A small amount of radioactive sugar is given into the vein. Cancer cells use sugar differently than normal cells. A scan for radioactivity may then help to localize cancer cells. The PET scan is often done along with a CT scan. Your doctor may refer you to one or more specialists. At cancer centers, several specialists often work together as a team. The Cancer Information Service, at 1-800-4-CANCER, can tell you about nearby treatment centers. A local or state medical or dental society, a nearby hospital, or a medical or dental school can usually provide the names of specialists in your area. The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) has a list of doctors who have had training and exams in their specialty. You can find this list in the Official ABMS Directory of Board Certified Medical Specialists. The directory is available in most public libraries. Or you can look up doctors at http://www.abms.org.

Methods of treatment,"'Oral cancer treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Some patients have a combination of treatments.'""At any stage of disease, people with oral cancer may have treatment to control pain and other symptoms, to relieve the side effects of therapy, and to ease emotional and practical problems. This kind of treatment is called supportive care, symptom management, or palliative care. Information about supportive care is available on NCI's Web site at ""'http://cancer.gov'"" and from NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER.""'You may want to talk to the doctor about taking part in a clinical trial, a research study of new treatment methods. The section on ""The Promise of Cancer Research"" has more information about clinical trials.''Surgery to remove the tumor in the mouth or throat is a common treatment for oral cancer. Sometimes the surgeon also removes lymph nodes in the neck. Other tissues in the mouth and neck may be removed as well. Patients may have surgery alone or in combination with radiation therapy.''You may want to ask the doctor these questions before having surgery:''Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) is a type of local therapy. It affects cells only in the treated area. Radiation therapy is used alone for small tumors or for patients who cannot have surgery. It may be used before surgery to kill cancer cells and shrink the tumor. It also may be used after surgery to destroy cancer cells that may remain in the area.''Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. Doctors use two types of radiation therapy to treat oral cancer:''Some people with oral cancer have both kinds of radiation therapy.''You may want to ask the doctor these questions before having radiation therapy:''Chemotherapy uses anticancer ''drugs'' to kill cancer cells. It is called systemic therapy because it enters the bloodstream and can affect cancer cells throughout the body. A new targeted therapy called cetuximab, which blocks a growth factor upon which cancer cells may depend, is being used today, either alone or in combination with radiation and older chemotherapy drugs.'""Chemotherapy is usually given by injection. It may be given in an outpatient part of the hospital, at the doctor's office, or at home. Rarely, a hospital stay may be needed.""'You may want to ask the doctor these questions before having chemotherapy:' What kind of operation do you recommend for me? Do I need any lymph nodes removed?

External radiation: The radiation comes from a machine. Patients go to the hospital or clinic once or twice a day, generally 5 days a week for several weeks. Internal radiation (implant radiation): The radiation comes from radioactive material placed in seeds, needles, or thin plastic tubes put directly in the tissue. The patient stays in the hospital.

What are the side effects of treatment for oral cancer?,"'Because treatment often damages healthy cells and tissues, unwanted side effects are common. These side effects depend mainly on the location of the tumor and the type and extent of the treatment. Side effects may not be the same for each person, and they may even change from one treatment session to the next. Before treatment starts, your health care team will explain possible side effects and suggest ways to help you manage them.''The NCI provides helpful booklets about cancer treatments and coping with side effects.

''Head and Neck Radiation Treatment and Your Mouth'', ''Chemotherapy and Your Mouth'', and other booklets are available from NIDCR. See ""National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research Information Resources"" for a list of publications.''It takes time to heal after surgery, and the time needed to recover is different for each person. You may be uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. However, medicine can usually control the pain. Before surgery, you should discuss the plan for pain relief with your doctor or nurse. After surgery, your doctor can adjust the plan if you need more pain relief.''It is common to feel tired or weak for a while. Also, surgery may cause tissues in your face to swell. This swelling usually goes away within a few weeks. However, removing lymph nodes can result in swelling that lasts a long time.''Surgery to remove a small tumor in the mouth may not cause any lasting problems. For a larger tumor, however, the surgeon may remove part of the palate, tongue, or jaw. This surgery may change your ability to chew, swallow, or talk. Also, your face may look different after surgery. Reconstructive or plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the bones or tissues of the mouth. (See ""Reconstruction."")''Almost all patients who have radiation therapy to the head and neck area develop oral side effects. That is why it is important to get the mouth in good condition before cancer treatment begins. Seeing a dentist two weeks before cancer treatment begins gives the mouth time to heal after dental work.''The side effects of radiation therapy depend mainly on the amount of radiation given. Some side effects in the mouth go away after radiation treatment ends, while others last a long time. A few side effects (such as ''dry mouth'') may never go away.''Radiation therapy may cause some or all of these side effects:''Although the side effects of radiation therapy can be distressing, your doctor can usually treat or control them. It helps to report any problems that you are having so that your doctor can work with you to relieve them.''Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can cause some of the same side effects, including skin ''rashes'', painful mouth and gums, dry mouth, infection, and changes in taste. Some anticancer drugs can also cause bleeding in the mouth and a deep pain in the jaw that feels like a ''toothache''. The problems you have depend on the type and amount of anticancer drugs you receive, and how your body reacts to them. You may have these problems only during treatment or for a short time after treatment ends.''Generally, anticancer drugs affect cells that divide rapidly. In addition to cancer cells, these rapidly dividing cells include the following:'  Dry mouth: Dry mouth can make it hard for you to eat, talk, and swallow. It can also lead to tooth decay. You may find it helpful to drink lots of water, suck ice chips or sugar-free hard candy, and use a saliva substitute to moisten your mouth. 
This problem can be permanent or temporary. Tooth decay: Radiation can cause major tooth decay problems. Good mouth care can help you keep your teeth and gums healthy and can help you feel better. Doctors usually suggest that people gently brush their teeth, gums, and tongue with an extra-soft toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste after every meal and before bed. If brushing hurts, you can soften the bristles in warm water. Your dentist may suggest that you use fluoride gel before, during, and after radiation treatment. It also helps to rinse your mouth several times a day with a solution made from 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and 1/8 teaspoon salt in one cup of warm water. After you rinse with this solution, follow with a plain water rinse. Sore throat or mouth: Radiation therapy can cause painful ulcers and inflammation. Your doctor can suggest medicines to help control the pain. Your doctor also may suggest special rinses to numb the throat and mouth to help relieve the soreness. If your pain continues, you can ask your doctor about stronger medicines. Sore or bleeding gums: It is important to brush and floss teeth gently. You may want to avoid areas that are sore or bleeding. To protect your gums from damage, it is a good idea to avoid the use of toothpicks. Infection: Dry mouth and damage to the lining of the mouth from radiation therapy can cause infection to develop. It helps to check your mouth every day for sores or other changes and to tell your doctor or nurse about any mouth problems. Delayed healing after dental care: Radiation treatment may make it hard for tissues in the mouth to heal. It helps to have a thorough dental exam and complete all needed dental treatment well before radiation therapy begins. Jaw stiffness: Radiation can affect the chewing muscles and make it difficult for you to open your mouth. You can prevent or reduce jaw stiffness by exercising your jaw muscles. Health care providers often suggest opening and closing the mouth as far as possible (without causing pain) 20 times in a row, 3 times a day. Denture problems: Radiation therapy can change the tissues in your mouth so that dentures do not fit anymore. Because of soreness and dry mouth, some people may not be able to wear dentures for as long as one year after radiation therapy. After the tissues heal completely and your mouth is no longer sore, your dentist may need to refit or replace your dentures. Changes in the sense of taste and smell: During radiation therapy, food may taste or smell different. Changes in voice quality: Your voice may be weak at the end of the day. It may also be affected by changes in the weather. Radiation directed at the neck may cause your larynx to swell, causing voice changes and the feeling of a lump in your throat. Your doctor may suggest medicine to reduce this swelling. Changes in the thyroid: Radiation treatment can affect your thyroid (an organ in your neck beneath the voice box). If your thyroid does not make enough thyroid hormone, you may feel tired, gain weight, feel cold, and have dry skin and hair. Your doctor can check the level of thyroid hormone with a blood test. If the level is low, you may need to take thyroid hormone pills. Skin changes in the treated area: The skin in the treated area may become red or dry. Good skin care is important at this time. It is helpful to expose this area to the air while protecting it from the sun. Also, avoid wearing clothes that rub the treated area, and do not shave the treated area. You should not use lotions or creams in the treated area without your doctor's advice. Fatigue: You may become very tired, especially in the later weeks of radiation therapy. Resting is important, but doctors usually advise their patients to stay as active as they can. Blood cells: These cells fight infection, help your blood to clot, and carry oxygen to all parts of the body. When drugs affect your blood cells, you are more likely to get infections, bruise or bleed easily, and feel very weak and tired. Cells in hair roots: Chemotherapy can lead to hair loss. The hair grows back, but sometimes the new hair is somewhat different in color and texture. Cells that line the digestive tract: Chemotherapy can cause poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, or mouth and lip sores. Many of these side effects can be controlled with drugs."
What is rehabilitation for oral cancer?,"'Eating well  during cancer treatment means getting enough calories and protein to prevent ''weight loss'', regain strength, and rebuild healthy tissues. But eating well may be difficult after treatment for oral cancer. Some people with cancer find it hard to eat because they lose their appetite. They may not feel like eating because they are uncomfortable or tired. A dry or sore mouth or changes in smell and taste also may make eating difficult.''If your mouth is dry, you may find that soft foods moistened with sauces or gravies are easier to eat. Thick soups, puddings, and milkshakes often are easier to swallow. Nurses and dietitians can help you choose the right foods. Also, the National Cancer Institute booklet ''Eating Hints for Cancer Patients'' contains many useful ideas and ''recipes''. The ""National Cancer Institute Information Resources"" section tells how to get this publication.''After surgery or radiation therapy for oral cancer, some people need a feeding tube. A feeding tube is a flexible plastic tube that is passed into the stomach through an incision in the abdomen. In almost all cases, the tube is temporary. Most people gradually return to a regular diet.''To protect your mouth during cancer treatment, it helps to avoid:''Some people with oral cancer may need to have plastic or reconstructive surgery to rebuild the bones or tissues of the mouth. Research has led to many advances in the way bones and tissues can be replaced.''Some people may need dental implants. Or they may need to have grafts (tissue moved from another part of the body). Skin, muscle, and bone can be moved to the oral cavity from the chest, arm, or leg. The ''plastic surgeon'' uses this tissue for repair.''If you are thinking about reconstruction, you may wish to consult with a plastic or reconstructive surgeon before your treatment begins. You can have reconstructive surgery at the same time as you have the cancer removed, or you can have it later on. Talk with your doctor about which approach is right for you.''The health care team will help you return to normal activities as soon as possible. The goals of rehabilitation depend on the extent of the disease and type of treatment. Rehabilitation may include being fitted with a dental prosthesis (an artificial dental device) and having dental implants. It also may involve speech therapy, dietary counseling, or other services.''Sometimes surgery to rebuild the bones or tissues of the mouth is not possible. A dentist with special training (a prosthodontist) may be able to make you a prosthesis to help you eat and talk normally. You may need special training to learn to use it.''If oral cancer or its treatment leads to problems with talking, speech therapy will generally begin as soon as possible. A speech therapist may see you in the hospital to plan therapy and teach speech exercises. Often speech therapy continues after you return home.' Sharp, crunchy foods like taco chips Foods that are hot, spicy, or high in acid like citrus fruits and juices Sugary foods that can cause cavities Alcoholic drinks"
What happens after treatment for oral cancer?,"'Follow-up care after treatment for oral cancer is important. Even when the cancer seems to have been completely removed or destroyed, the disease sometimes returns because undetected cancer cells remained in the body after treatment. The doctor monitors your recovery and checks for recurrence of cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted. Your doctor will probably encourage you to inspect your mouth regularly and continue to have exams when you visit your dentist. It is important to report any changes in your mouth right away.''Checkups include exams of the mouth, throat, and neck. From time to time, your doctor may do a complete physical exam, order blood tests, and take x-rays.''People who have had oral cancer have a chance of developing a new cancer in the mouth, throat, or other areas of the head and neck. This is especially true for those who use tobacco or who drink alcohol heavily. Doctors strongly urge their patients to STOP using tobacco and drinking to cut down the risk of a new cancer and other health problems.''The NCI has prepared a booklet for people who have completed their treatment to help answer questions about follow-up care and other concerns. ''Facing Forward Series: Life After Cancer Treatment'' provides tips for making the best use of medical visits. It describes how to talk to your health care team about creating a plan of action for recovery and future health.' "
What does the future hold for patients with oral cancer?,"'Living with a serious disease such as oral cancer is not easy. You may worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing daily activities. You may have concerns about treatments and managing side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills. Doctors, nurses, and other members of the health care team can answer your questions about treatment, working, or other activities. Meeting with a social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy can be helpful if you want to talk about your feelings or discuss your concerns. Often, a social worker can suggest resources for financial aid, transportation, home care, or emotional support.''Support groups also can help. In these groups, patients or their family members meet with other patients or their families to share what they have learned about coping with the disease and the effects of treatment. Groups may offer support in person, over the telephone, or on the Internet. You may want to talk with a member of your health care team about finding a support group. The NCI\'s fact sheets ""Cancer Support Groups: Questions and Answers"" and ""National Organizations That Offer Services to People With Cancer and Their Families"" tell how to find a support group. See ""National Cancer Institute Information Resources"" for ordering information.''The Cancer Information Service can provide information to help patients and their families locate programs, services, and publications.''Doctors all over the country are conducting many types of clinical trials. These are research studies in which people volunteer to take part. In clinical trials, doctors are testing new ways to treat oral cancer. Research has already led to advances, and researchers continue to search for more effective approaches.''People who join clinical trials may be among the first to benefit if a new approach is shown to be effective. And if participants do not benefit directly, they still make an important contribution to medical science by helping doctors learn more about the disease and how to control it. Although clinical trials may pose some risks, researchers do all they can to protect their patients.''Researchers are testing anticancer drugs and combinations of drugs. They are studying radiation therapy combined with drugs and other treatments. They also are testing drugs that prevent or reduce the side effects of radiation therapy.''If you are interested in learning more about joining a clinical trial, you may want to talk with your doctor. You may want to read Taking Part in Clinical Trials: What Cancer Patients Need To Know. The NCI also offers an easy-to-read brochure called If You Have Cancer...What You Should Know About Clinical Trials.

What is oral thrush?,"'Thrush'' is a ''yeast infection'' of the mouth and throat. ''Thrush'' can also be associated with yeast infections of the ''esophagus''. Thrush appears as creamy white curd-like patches on the tongue and inside of the mouth and back of the throat. As mentioned above, in individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast infections are more common. For example, in a non-infant population, thrush may be a sign of an underlying ''HIV'' infection. The child may not have any symptoms from the condition or may refuse to eat or swallow because of ''pain'' or an unusual feeling in the mouth. Sometimes older children complain of a cottony feeling in the mouth.''Another form of oral ''yeast infection'' is ''angular cheilitis'', which is the development of painful fissures at the corners of the mouth. Yeast infection can also involve the tongue and lead to flattening (erosion) of the papillae of the surface of the tongue, along with ''pain'' and reddening of the tongue (acute atrophic ''candidiasis'').' "
What are yeast infections?,"'What are commonly known as ""yeast"" infections are caused by various species of a yeast-like fungus called ''Candida'', particularly the species ''Candida albicans''. Yeast organisms are some of the germs (including bacteria) that normally reside on various parts of the body and that ordinarily cause no symptoms or signs.' "
Why do yeast sometimes cause symptoms and signs?,"'Certain conditions, such as antibiotic use, may upset the balance of microbes in the body (particularly between the bacteria and fungi) and allow an overgrowth of ''Candida''. Yeast also can thrive in chronically moist folds of skin, such as in the groin.''Yeast infections may flare up and then heal in most people. However, in newborns or individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast can cause more serious or chronic infections.'  "
How do babies get yeast infections?,"'Many infants acquire ''Candida'"" infections from their mothers during the process of birth. Yeast exists naturally in the mother's vagina. The baby comes in direct contact with the yeast during delivery through the birth canal.""'Many ''babies'' who escape this infection at birth soon acquire ''Candida'' from close contact with other family members.' "
What are oral thrush symptoms and signs?,"'Most common ''oral thrush'' symptoms include:' Thrush is characterized by a white coating or white patches on the tongue, mouth, inner cheeks, and the back of the throat.  The tissue under the white patches is often red, raw, and sore. Lesions can be painful and even bleed when scraped.  Oral thrush often looks like cottage cheese or milk curds. Bad breath Cheilosis (Cracking at the outer edges of the lips) Feeling of food stuck in the throat or sore throat Strange or unpleasant taste in the mouth Burning mouth syndrome: Symptoms of a painful burning sensation, mouth dryness, soreness, tingling, or numbness throughout the mouth and tongue. Symptoms can be associated with an abnormal bitter or metallic taste in the mouth. In severe cases of thrush, the esophagus (food pipe), which leads down to the stomach, may also be involved. This will cause pain with swallowing, fever, shaking or chills, or difficulty swallowing."
How do children (and adults) acquire thrush?,"'Outbreaks of thrush in childcare settings may be the result of an increased use of antibiotics and growth of the yeast normally present in the mouth, rather than newly acquired ''Candida'' infections. In children (and adults) taking antibiotics or steroids (such as cortisone-related ''asthma medications''), the balance of the normal microbes in the mouth can be disturbed. This may cause an overgrowth of ''Candida'', which in turn results in oral thrush.'  "
How does yeast affect diaper rash?,"'Candida'"" may infect an infant's ""'diaper'' area and worsen a ''diaper rash''. This is because yeast can grow very readily on irritated, moist skin. The infected skin is usually fiery red with areas that may have a raised red border and is usually intensely ''itchy'' (pruritic).' "
Can thumb sucking cause problems with yeast?,'Children who suck their thumbs or other fingers may occasionally develop ''Candida'' around their fingernails. This causes redness at the edges of the nails.' 
Can a nursing mother acquire yeast infections from her infant?,'Nursing'' mothers are at risk for developing ''Candida'' infections on their breasts (this is called ''mastitis'') and can be treated with the same medication that is used for infants.' 
What is the treatment for thrush and other yeast infections?,"'Health care professionals usually treat oral thrush and yeast infections, such as ''Candida'' ''diaper rash'', with antifungal medicines; these include ''nystatin'' (''Mycostatin''), ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin), or ''miconazole'' (''Monistat'') either by mouth or in a topical cream. Luckily, most ''Candida'' are very sensitive to nystatin, and resistance is rare. There are many topical antifungals available as ''over-the-counter'' brands. Oral thrush requires an oral medication that is available by prescription only.''The following tips can help care for children with diaper ''rash'':'   Caregivers should change the child's diapers frequently and gently cleanse the child's skin with water and a mild soap and pat it dry. It is important to minimize skin contact with urine and stool. Allowing periods of exposure to dry air without wearing a diaper can also be helpful. Barrier creams or ointments, such as Desitin or A&D, are helpful. While cornstarch may help mild diaper rash, it should not be used for children with significantly inflamed skin. High-absorbency disposable diapers may help keep the skin dry. A baby's bottom is very sensitive, so staying dry is very important. Avoid plastic pants that do not allow air to circulate over the diaper area. The diapering system should be able to hold urine or liquid feces."
What should caregivers do if the medication does not effectively treat the yeast infection?,"'There are some situations when a child may need a different medication to clear a yeast infection. A health care provider may prescribe another type of antifungal cream or oral preparation that may include ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral'', ''Extina'', ''Xolegel'', ''Kuric''), ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''), or ''itraconazole'' (''Sporanox'').' "
Should a child with yeast infection be kept out of childcare?,"'There is no need to remove a child with yeast infection from childcare. Since most healthy people already harbor ''Candida'', children with thrush and ''Candida'' diaper rash do not have to be excluded from child care (as long they are able to participate comfortably).''Childcare providers should follow good hygiene, including careful hand washing and disposal of nasal and oral secretions of children with thrush, in order to avoid transmitting the infection to children who may not already be infected.' "
Are there other names for yeast infection?,"'Health care professionals refer to a yeast infection as candidiasis because ''Candida'' causes the infection. Thrush is another name for ''oral candidiasis''. The old name for ''Candida'' was ''Monilia''. The infection is still sometimes called ''moniliasis'', and thrush is still at times known as oral moniliasis.' "
How Should I Care for My Teeth and Gums?,'There are four basic steps to caring for teeth and gums:' Brushing Flossing Eating right Visiting the dentist
Tips for Brushing,"'Brush at least twice a day. If you can, brush after every meal. Brushingremoves plaque, a film of bacteria that clings to teeth. When bacteria in plaquecome into contact with food, they produce acids. These acids lead to ''cavities''.To brush:' Place a pea-sized dab of fluoride toothpaste on the head of the toothbrush.
(Use a soft toothbrush.) Place the toothbrush against the teeth at a 45-degree angle to the gum
line. Move the brush across the teeth using a small circular motion. Continue
with this motion cleaning one tooth at a time. Keep the tips of the bristles
against the gum line. Avoid pressing so hard that the bristles lie flat against
the teeth. (Only the tips of the toothbrush clean the teeth.) Let the bristles
reach into spaces between teeth. Brush across the top of the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Make sure the
bristles get into the groves and crevices. Use the same small circular motion to clean the backside of the upper and
lower teeth -- the side that faces the tongue. To clean the inside of the bottom front teeth, angle the head in an
up-and-down position toward the bottom inside of the mouth and move the
toothbrush in a small circle. For the inside of the top front teeth, angle the brush in an up-and-down
position with the tip of the head pointing towards the roof of the mouth. Move
the toothbrush in a small circle. Give your tongue a few gentle brush strokes, brushing from the back of your
tongue forward. Do not scrub. This helps remove bacteria and freshens your
breath. After brushing your teeth for two to three minutes, rinse your mouth with
water. Replace your toothbrush with a new one every 3 to 4 months."
Tips for Flossing,"'Floss once a day. Flossing gets rid of food and plaque between the teeth,where your toothbrush cannot reach. If plaque stays between teeth, it canharden into tartar, which must be removed by a dentist. To floss:' Remove about an 18-inch strip of floss from the dispenser. Wind the floss around the middle fingers of each hand, leaving a 1-inch
section open for flossing. Floss the top teeth first, then the bottom. Place the floss in your mouth and use your index fingers to push the floss
between the teeth. Be careful not to push too hard and injure the gums. Move the floss up and down against the tooth and up and around the gum
line. The floss should form a C-shape around the tooth as you floss. Floss between each tooth as well as behind the back teeth. Use a clean section of floss as needed and take up used floss by winding it
around the fingers."
Tips for Eating Right,"'Eat a variety of foods but eat fewer foods that contain sugars and starches.These foods produce the most acids in the mouth and the longer they stay in themouth, the more they can damage the teeth. Hard ""sucking candies"" areespecially harmful because they stay in the mouth a long time.'""Snacking on sugary foods can lead to tooth decay because most people don'tbrush after snacks. Starchy snack foods, like potato chips, stick to the teeth.Avoid snacking on:"" Candies, cookies, cakes and pie Sugary gum Crackers, breadsticks and chips Dried fruits and raisins"
Dental Check-Ups,"""Visit your dentist at least once every six months. To maintain healthy teethand gums, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings.You should also see your dentist if you have ""'pain'' in your teeth or mouth orbleeding, swollen gums.''You can also ask your dentist about ''dental sealants''. Sealant is a material used to coat the top, chewingsurfaces of the teeth. This coating protects the tooth from decay and usuallylasts a long time.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Reviewed by Brunilda Nazario, MD, on October 22, 2007''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2005' "
What is the oral cavity?,'This article is about ''cancers'' that occur in the mouth (oral cavity) and the part of the throat at the back of the mouth (oropharynx). The oral cavity and oropharynx have many parts:' Lips Lining of your cheeks Salivary glands (glands that make saliva) Roof of your mouth (hard palate) Back of your mouth (soft palate and uvula) Floor of your mouth (area under the tongue) Gums and teeth Tongue Tonsils
What is cancer?,"'Cancer begins in cells, the building blocks that make up tissues. Tissues make up the organs of the body.''Normally, cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old, they die, and new cells take their place.''Sometimes this orderly process goes wrong. New cells form when the body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass of tissue called a growth or ''tumor''. The kinds of cells found in the tumor determine how the tumor will behave.''Tumors can be benign or malignant:''Oral cancer is part of a group of cancers called head and neck cancers. Oral cancer can develop in any part of the oral cavity or oropharynx. Most oral cancers begin in the tongue and in the floor of the mouth. Almost all oral cancers begin in the flat cells (squamous cells) that cover the surfaces of the mouth, tongue, and lips. These cancers are called squamous cell carcinomas.''When oral cancer spreads (metastasizes), it usually travels through the lymphatic system. Cancer cells that enter the lymphatic system are carried along by lymph, a clear, watery fluid. The cancer cells often appear first in nearby ''lymph nodes'' in the neck.''Cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the neck, the ''lungs'', and other parts of the body. When this happens, the new tumor has the same kind of abnormal cells as the primary tumor. For example, if oral cancer spreads to the lungs, the cancer cells in the lungs are actually oral cancer cells. The disease is metastatic oral cancer, not ''lung cancer''. It is treated as oral cancer, not ''lung cancer''. Doctors sometimes call the new tumor ""distant"" or metastatic disease.' Benign tumors are not cancer: Benign tumors are rarely life-threatening. Generally, benign tumors can be removed, and they usually do not grow back. Cells from benign tumors do not invade the tissues around them. Cells from benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors are cancer: Malignant tumors are generally more serious than benign tumors. They may be life-threatening. Malignant tumors often can be removed, but sometimes they grow back. Cells from malignant tumors can invade and damage nearby tissues and organs. Cells from malignant tumors can spread to other parts of the body. The cells spread by breaking away from the original cancer (primary tumor) and entering the bloodstream or lymphatic system. They invade other organs, forming new tumors and damaging these organs. The spread of cancer is called metastasis."
Who's at risk for oral cancer?,"'Doctors cannot always explain why one person develops oral cancer and another does not. However, we do know that this disease is not ''contagious''. You cannot ""catch"" oral cancer from another person.''Research has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop oral cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases your chance of developing a disease.''The following are risk factors for oral cancer:''Quitting tobacco reduces the risk of oral cancer. Also, quitting reduces the chance that a person with oral cancer will get a second cancer in the head and neck region. People who stop ''smoking'' can also reduce their risk of cancer of the lung, larynx, mouth, pancreas, bladder, and ''esophagus''.There are many resources to help smokers quit:''Some studies suggest that not eating enough fruits and vegetables may increase the chance of getting oral cancer. Human papilloma virus is a common viral infection. Today, it is emerging as another important risk factor. Research now suggests as many as half of oropharynx cancers are caused by ''HPV'' infection.''If you think you may be at risk, you should discuss this concern with your doctor or dentist. You may want to ask about an appropriate schedule for checkups. Your health care team will probably tell you that not using tobacco and limiting your use of alcohol are the most important things you can do to prevent oral cancers. Also, if you spend a lot of time in the sun, using a lip balm that contains sunscreen and wearing a hat with a brim will help protect your lips.' Tobacco: Tobacco use accounts for most oral cancers. Smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes; using chewing tobacco; and dipping snuff are all linked to oral cancer. The use of other tobacco products (such as bidis and kreteks) may also increase the risk of oral cancer. Heavy smokers who use tobacco for a long time are most at risk. The risk is even higher for tobacco users who drink alcohol heavily. In fact, three out of four oral cancers occur in people who use alcohol, tobacco, or both alcohol and tobacco. Alcohol: People who drink alcohol are more likely to develop oral cancer than people who don't drink. The risk increases with the amount of alcohol that a person consumes. The risk increases even more if the person both drinks alcohol and uses tobacco. Sun: Cancer of the lip can be caused by exposure to the sun. Using a lotion or lip balm that has a sunscreen can reduce the risk. Wearing a hat with a brim can also block the sun's harmful rays. The risk of cancer of the lip increases if the person also smokes. A personal history of head and neck cancer: People who have had head and neck cancer are at increased risk of developing another primary head and neck cancer. Smoking increases this risk. The Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER can talk with callers about ways to quit smoking and about groups that offer help to smokers who want to quit. Groups offer counseling in person or by telephone. Also, your doctor or dentist can help you find a local smoking cessation program. Your doctor can tell you about medicine (bupropion) or about nicotine replacement therapy, which comes as a patch, gum, lozenges, nasal spray, or inhaler. The ""National Cancer Institute Information Resources"" section has information about the Federal Government's smoking cessation Web site, http://www.smokefree.gov."
What are the symptoms of oral cancer?,"'Your regular checkup is a good time for your dentist or doctor to check your entire mouth for signs of cancer. Regular checkups can detect the early stages of oral cancer or conditions that may lead to oral cancer. Ask your doctor or dentist about checking the tissues in your mouth as part of your routine exam.''Common symptoms of oral cancer include:''Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor or dentist so that any problem can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Most often, these symptoms do not mean cancer. An infection or another problem can cause the same symptoms.'   Patches inside your mouth or on your lips that are white, a mixture of red and white, or red White patches (leukoplakia) are the most common. White patches sometimes become malignant. Mixed red and white patches (erythroleukoplakia) are more likely than white patches to become malignant. Red patches (erythroplakia) are brightly colored, smooth areas that often become malignant. A sore on your lip or in your mouth that won't heal Bleeding in your mouth Loose teeth Difficulty or pain when swallowing Difficulty wearing dentures A lump in your neck An earache"
How is oral cancer diagnosed?,"'If you have symptoms that suggest oral cancer, the doctor or dentist checks your mouth and throat for red or white patches, lumps, swelling, or other problems. This exam includes looking carefully at the roof of the mouth, back of the throat, and insides of the cheeks and lips. The doctor or dentist also gently pulls out your tongue so it can be checked on the sides and underneath. The floor of your mouth and lymph nodes in your neck also are checked.''If an exam shows an abnormal area, a small sample of tissue may be removed. Removing tissue to look for cancer cells is called a biopsy. Usually, a biopsy is done with local anesthesia. Sometimes, it is done under general anesthesia. A pathologist then looks at the tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. A biopsy is the only sure way to know if the abnormal area is cancerous.''If you need a biopsy, you may want to ask the doctor or dentist some of the following questions:'   Why do I need a biopsy? How much tissue do you expect to remove? How long will it take? Will I be awake? Will it hurt? How soon will I know the results? Are there any risks? What are the chances of infection or bleeding after the biopsy? How should I care for the biopsy site afterward? How long will it take to heal? Will I be able to eat and drink normally after the biopsy? If I do have cancer, who will talk with me about treatment? When?"
How is oral cancer treated?,"'If the biopsy shows that cancer is present, your doctor needs to know the stage (extent) of your disease to plan the best treatment. The stage is based on the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread and, if so, to what parts of the body.''Staging may require lab tests. It also may involve ''endoscopy''. The doctor uses a thin, lighted tube (endoscope) to check your throat, windpipe, and lungs. The endoscope may be flexible or rigid. The doctor inserts the endoscope through your nose or mouth. Local anesthesia is used to ease your discomfort and prevent you from gagging. Some people also may have a mild sedative. Sometimes the doctor uses general anesthesia to put a person to ''sleep'"". This exam may be done in a doctor's office, an outpatient clinic, or a hospital.""'The doctor may order one or more imaging tests to learn whether the cancer has spread:''Many people with oral cancer want to take an active part in making decisions about their medical care. It is natural to want to learn all you can about your disease and your treatment choices. However, ''shock'' and ''stress'' after the diagnosis can make it hard to think of everything you want to ask the doctor. It often helps to make a list of questions before an appointment. To help remember what the doctor says, you may take notes or ask whether you may use a tape recorder. You may also want to have a family member or friend with you when you talk to the doctor - to take part in the discussion, to take notes, or just to listen.''Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral. Specialists who treat oral cancer include oral and maxillofacial surgeons, otolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat doctors), medical oncologists, ''radiation'' oncologists, and ''plastic'' surgeons. You may be referred to a team that includes specialists in surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Other health care professionals who may work with the specialists as a team include a dentist, speech pathologist, nutritionist, and ''mental health'' counselor.''Before starting treatment, you might want a second opinion about the diagnosis and the treatment plan. Some insurance companies require a second opinion; others may cover a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Do not be afraid to ask for a second opinion. These are serious conditions and you may want to learn about your diagnosis and treatment options from more than one source. Your doctor should not be offended if you ask for a second opinion, and can help you to arrange it, if asked.''There are a number of ways to find a doctor for a second opinion:''You may want to ask the doctor these questions before treatment begins:''The choice of treatment depends mainly on your general health, where in your mouth or oropharynx the cancer began, the size of the tumor, and whether the cancer has spread. Your doctor can describe your treatment choices and the expected results. You will want to consider how treatment may affect normal activities such as swallowing and talking, and whether it will change the way you look. You and your doctor can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs and personal values.''You do not need to ask all your questions or understand all the answers at once. You will have other chances to ask your doctor to explain things that are not clear and to ask for more information.'  Dental x-rays: An x-ray of your entire mouth can show whether cancer has spread to the jaw. Chest x-rays: Images of your chest and lungs can show whether cancer has spread to these areas. CT scan: An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures of your body. You may receive an injection of dye. Tumors in the mouth, throat, neck, or elsewhere in the body show up on the CT scan. MRI: A powerful magnet linked to a computer is used to make detailed pictures of your body. The doctor can view these pictures on a monitor and can print them on film. An MRI can show whether oral cancer has spread. PET scan: A small amount of radioactive sugar is given into the vein. Cancer cells use sugar differently than normal cells. A scan for radioactivity may then help to localize cancer cells. The PET scan is often done along with a CT scan. Your doctor may refer you to one or more specialists. At cancer centers, several specialists often work together as a team. The Cancer Information Service, at 1-800-4-CANCER, can tell you about nearby treatment centers. A local or state medical or dental society, a nearby hospital, or a medical or dental school can usually provide the names of specialists in your area. The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) has a list of doctors who have had training and exams in their specialty. You can find this list in the Official ABMS Directory of Board Certified Medical Specialists. The directory is available in most public libraries. Or you can look up doctors at http://www.abms.org. (Click on Who's Certified.) The American Dental Association (ADA) Web site provides a list of dentists by specialty and location. The ADA Member Directory is available on the Internet at http://www.ada.org. The NCI provides a helpful fact sheet on how to find a doctor called ""How To Find a Doctor or Treatment Facility If You Have Cancer."" It is available on the Internet at http://cancer.gov/publications. What is the stage of the disease? Has the cancer spread? If so, where? What are my treatment choices? Which do you recommend for me?

Methods of treatment,"'Oral cancer treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Some patients have a combination of treatments.'""At any stage of disease, people with oral cancer may have treatment to control pain and other symptoms, to relieve the side effects of therapy, and to ease emotional and practical problems. This kind of treatment is called supportive care, symptom management, or palliative care. Information about supportive care is available on NCI's Web site at ""'http://cancer.gov'"" and from NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER.""'You may want to talk to the doctor about taking part in a clinical trial, a research study of new treatment methods. The section on ""The Promise of Cancer Research"" has more information about clinical trials.''Surgery to remove the tumor in the mouth or throat is a common treatment for oral cancer. Sometimes the surgeon also removes lymph nodes in the neck. Other tissues in the mouth and neck may be removed as well. Patients may have surgery alone or in combination with radiation therapy.''You may want to ask the doctor these questions before having surgery:''Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) is a type of local therapy. It affects cells only in the treated area. Radiation therapy is used alone for small tumors or for patients who cannot have surgery. It may be used before surgery to kill cancer cells and shrink the tumor. It also may be used after surgery to destroy cancer cells that may remain in the area.''Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. Doctors use two types of radiation therapy to treat oral cancer:''Some people with oral cancer have both kinds of radiation therapy.''You may want to ask the doctor these questions before having radiation therapy:''Chemotherapy uses anticancer ''drugs'' to kill cancer cells. It is called systemic therapy because it enters the bloodstream and can affect cancer cells throughout the body. A new targeted therapy called cetuximab, which blocks a growth factor upon which cancer cells may depend, is being used today, either alone or in combination with radiation and older chemotherapy drugs.'""Chemotherapy is usually given by injection. It may be given in an outpatient part of the hospital, at the doctor's office, or at home. Rarely, a hospital stay may be needed.""'You may want to ask the doctor these questions before having chemotherapy:' What kind of operation do you recommend for me? Do I need any lymph nodes removed? Why? How will I feel after the operation? How long will I be in the hospital? What are the risks of surgery? Will I have trouble speaking, swallowing, or eating? Where will the scars be? What will they look like? Will I have any long-term effects? Will I look different? Will I need reconstructive or plastic surgery? When can that be done? Will I lose my teeth? Can they be replaced? How soon? Will I need to see a specialist for help with my speech? When can I get back to my normal activities? How often will I need checkups? Would a clinical trial be appropriate for me? External radiation: The radiation comes from a machine. Patients go to the hospital or clinic once or twice a day, generally 5 days a week for several weeks. Internal radiation (implant radiation): The radiation comes from radioactive material placed in seeds, needles, or thin plastic tubes put directly in the tissue. The patient stays in the hospital. The implants remain in place for several days. Usually they are removed before the patient goes home. Which type of radiation therapy do you recommend for me? Why do I need this treatment?

What are the side effects of treatment for oral cancer?,"'Because treatment often damages healthy cells and tissues, unwanted side effects are common. These side effects depend mainly on the location of the tumor and the type and extent of the treatment. Side effects may not be the same for each person, and they may even change from one treatment session to the next. Before treatment starts, your health care team will explain possible side effects and suggest ways to help you manage them.''The NCI provides helpful booklets about cancer treatments and coping with side effects. Booklets such as ''Radiation Therapy and You'', ''Chemotherapy and You'', and ''Eating Hints for Cancer Patients'' may be viewed, downloaded, and ordered from http://cancer.gov/publications. These materials also may be ordered by calling the Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER.''The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) also provides helpful materials. ''Head and Neck Radiation Treatment and Your Mouth'', ''Chemotherapy and Your Mouth'', and other booklets are available from NIDCR. See ""National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research Information Resources"" for a list of publications.''It takes time to heal after surgery, and the time needed to recover is different for each person. You may be uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. However, medicine can usually control the pain. Before surgery, you should discuss the plan for pain relief with your doctor or nurse. After surgery, your doctor can adjust the plan if you need more pain relief.''It is common to feel tired or weak for a while. Also, surgery may cause tissues in your face to swell. This swelling usually goes away within a few weeks. However, removing lymph nodes can result in swelling that lasts a long time.''Surgery to remove a small tumor in the mouth may not cause any lasting problems. For a larger tumor, however, the surgeon may remove part of the palate, tongue, or jaw. This surgery may change your ability to chew, swallow, or talk. Also, your face may look different after surgery. Reconstructive or plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the bones or tissues of the mouth. (See ""Reconstruction."")''Almost all patients who have radiation therapy to the head and neck area develop oral side effects. That is why it is important to get the mouth in good condition before cancer treatment begins. Seeing a dentist two weeks before cancer treatment begins gives the mouth time to heal after dental work.''The side effects of radiation therapy depend mainly on the amount of radiation given. Some side effects in the mouth go away after radiation treatment ends, while others last a long time. A few side effects (such as ''dry mouth'') may never go away.''Radiation therapy may cause some or all of these side effects:''Although the side effects of radiation therapy can be distressing, your doctor can usually treat or control them. It helps to report any problems that you are having so that your doctor can work with you to relieve them.''Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can cause some of the same side effects, including skin ''rashes'', painful mouth and gums, dry mouth, infection, and changes in taste. Some anticancer drugs can also cause bleeding in the mouth and a deep pain in the jaw that feels like a ''toothache''. The problems you have depend on the type and amount of anticancer drugs you receive, and how your body reacts to them. You may have these problems only during treatment or for a short time after treatment ends.''Generally, anticancer drugs affect cells that divide rapidly. In addition to cancer cells, these rapidly dividing cells include the following:'  Dry mouth: Dry mouth can make it hard for you to eat, talk, and swallow. It can also lead to tooth decay. You may find it helpful to drink lots of water, suck ice chips or sugar-free hard candy, and use a saliva substitute to moisten your mouth. 
This problem can be permanent or temporary. Tooth decay: Radiation can cause major tooth decay problems. Good mouth care can help you keep your teeth and gums healthy and can help you feel better. Doctors usually suggest that people gently brush their teeth, gums, and tongue with an extra-soft toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste after every meal and before bed. If brushing hurts, you can soften the bristles in warm water. Your dentist may suggest that you use fluoride gel before, during, and after radiation treatment. It also helps to rinse your mouth several times a day with a solution made from 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and 1/8 teaspoon salt in one cup of warm water. After you rinse with this solution, follow with a plain water rinse. Sore throat or mouth: Radiation therapy can cause painful ulcers and inflammation. Your doctor can suggest medicines to help control the pain. Your doctor also may suggest special rinses to numb the throat and mouth to help relieve the soreness. If your pain continues, you can ask your doctor about stronger medicines. Sore or bleeding gums: It is important to brush and floss teeth gently. You may want to avoid areas that are sore or bleeding. To protect your gums from damage, it is a good idea to avoid the use of toothpicks. Infection: Dry mouth and damage to the lining of the mouth from radiation therapy can cause infection to develop. It helps to check your mouth every day for sores or other changes and to tell your doctor or nurse about any mouth problems. Delayed healing after dental care: Radiation treatment may make it hard for tissues in the mouth to heal. It helps to have a thorough dental exam and complete all needed dental treatment well before radiation therapy begins. Jaw stiffness: Radiation can affect the chewing muscles and make it difficult for you to open your mouth. You can prevent or reduce jaw stiffness by exercising your jaw muscles. Health care providers often suggest opening and closing the mouth as far as possible (without causing pain) 20 times in a row, 3 times a day. Denture problems: Radiation therapy can change the tissues in your mouth so that dentures do not fit anymore. Because of soreness and dry mouth, some people may not be able to wear dentures for as long as one year after radiation therapy. After the tissues heal completely and your mouth is no longer sore, your dentist may need to refit or replace your dentures. Changes in the sense of taste and smell: During radiation therapy, food may taste or smell different. Changes in voice quality: Your voice may be weak at the end of the day. It may also be affected by changes in the weather. Radiation directed at the neck may cause your larynx to swell, causing voice changes and the feeling of a lump in your throat. Your doctor may suggest medicine to reduce this swelling. Changes in the thyroid: Radiation treatment can affect your thyroid (an organ in your neck beneath the voice box). If your thyroid does not make enough thyroid hormone, you may feel tired, gain weight, feel cold, and have dry skin and hair. Your doctor can check the level of thyroid hormone with a blood test. If the level is low, you may need to take thyroid hormone pills. Skin changes in the treated area: The skin in the treated area may become red or dry. Good skin care is important at this time. It is helpful to expose this area to the air while protecting it from the sun. Also, avoid wearing clothes that rub the treated area, and do not shave the treated area. You should not use lotions or creams in the treated area without your doctor's advice. Fatigue: You may become very tired, especially in the later weeks of radiation therapy. Resting is important, but doctors usually advise their patients to stay as active as they can. Blood cells: These cells fight infection, help your blood to clot, and carry oxygen to all parts of the body. When drugs affect your blood cells, you are more likely to get infections, bruise or bleed easily, and feel very weak and tired. Cells in hair roots: Chemotherapy can lead to hair loss. The hair grows back, but sometimes the new hair is somewhat different in color and texture. Cells that line the digestive tract: Chemotherapy can cause poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, or mouth and lip sores. Many of these side effects can be controlled with drugs."
What is rehabilitation for oral cancer?,"'Eating well  during cancer treatment means getting enough calories and protein to prevent ''weight loss'', regain strength, and rebuild healthy tissues. But eating well may be difficult after treatment for oral cancer. Some people with cancer find it hard to eat because they lose their appetite. They may not feel like eating because they are uncomfortable or tired. A dry or sore mouth or changes in smell and taste also may make eating difficult.''If your mouth is dry, you may find that soft foods moistened with sauces or gravies are easier to eat. Thick soups, puddings, and milkshakes often are easier to swallow. Nurses and dietitians can help you choose the right foods. Also, the National Cancer Institute booklet ''Eating Hints for Cancer Patients'' contains many useful ideas and ''recipes''. The ""National Cancer Institute Information Resources"" section tells how to get this publication.''After surgery or radiation therapy for oral cancer, some people need a feeding tube. A feeding tube is a flexible plastic tube that is passed into the stomach through an incision in the abdomen. In almost all cases, the tube is temporary. Most people gradually return to a regular diet.''To protect your mouth during cancer treatment, it helps to avoid:''Some people with oral cancer may need to have plastic or reconstructive surgery to rebuild the bones or tissues of the mouth. Research has led to many advances in the way bones and tissues can be replaced.''Some people may need dental implants. Or they may need to have grafts (tissue moved from another part of the body). Skin, muscle, and bone can be moved to the oral cavity from the chest, arm, or leg. The ''plastic surgeon'' uses this tissue for repair.''If you are thinking about reconstruction, you may wish to consult with a plastic or reconstructive surgeon before your treatment begins. You can have reconstructive surgery at the same time as you have the cancer removed, or you can have it later on. Talk with your doctor about which approach is right for you.''The health care team will help you return to normal activities as soon as possible. The goals of rehabilitation depend on the extent of the disease and type of treatment. Rehabilitation may include being fitted with a dental prosthesis (an artificial dental device) and having dental implants. It also may involve speech therapy, dietary counseling, or other services.''Sometimes surgery to rebuild the bones or tissues of the mouth is not possible. A dentist with special training (a prosthodontist) may be able to make you a prosthesis to help you eat and talk normally. You may need special training to learn to use it.''If oral cancer or its treatment leads to problems with talking, speech therapy will generally begin as soon as possible. A speech therapist may see you in the hospital to plan therapy and teach speech exercises. Often speech therapy continues after you return home.' Sharp, crunchy foods like taco chips Foods that are hot, spicy, or high in acid like citrus fruits and juices Sugary foods that can cause cavities Alcoholic drinks"
What happens after treatment for oral cancer?,"'Follow-up care after treatment for oral cancer is important. Even when the cancer seems to have been completely removed or destroyed, the disease sometimes returns because undetected cancer cells remained in the body after treatment. The doctor monitors your recovery and checks for recurrence of cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted. Your doctor will probably encourage you to inspect your mouth regularly and continue to have exams when you visit your dentist. It is important to report any changes in your mouth right away.''Checkups include exams of the mouth, throat, and neck. From time to time, your doctor may do a complete physical exam, order blood tests, and take x-rays.''People who have had oral cancer have a chance of developing a new cancer in the mouth, throat, or other areas of the head and neck. This is especially true for those who use tobacco or who drink alcohol heavily. Doctors strongly urge their patients to STOP using tobacco and drinking to cut down the risk of a new cancer and other health problems.''The NCI has prepared a booklet for people who have completed their treatment to help answer questions about follow-up care and other concerns. ''Facing Forward Series: Life After Cancer Treatment'' provides tips for making the best use of medical visits. It describes how to talk to your health care team about creating a plan of action for recovery and future health.' "
What does the future hold for patients with oral cancer?,"'Living with a serious disease such as oral cancer is not easy. You may worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing daily activities. You may have concerns about treatments and managing side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills. Doctors, nurses, and other members of the health care team can answer your questions about treatment, working, or other activities. Meeting with a social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy can be helpful if you want to talk about your feelings or discuss your concerns. Often, a social worker can suggest resources for financial aid, transportation, home care, or emotional support.''Support groups also can help. In these groups, patients or their family members meet with other patients or their families to share what they have learned about coping with the disease and the effects of treatment. Groups may offer support in person, over the telephone, or on the Internet. You may want to talk with a member of your health care team about finding a support group. The NCI\'s fact sheets ""Cancer Support Groups: Questions and Answers"" and ""National Organizations That Offer Services to People With Cancer and Their Families"" tell how to find a support group. See ""National Cancer Institute Information Resources"" for ordering information.''The Cancer Information Service can provide information to help patients and their families locate programs, services, and publications.''Doctors all over the country are conducting many types of clinical trials. These are research studies in which people volunteer to take part. In clinical trials, doctors are testing new ways to treat oral cancer. Research has already led to advances, and researchers continue to search for more effective approaches.''People who join clinical trials may be among the first to benefit if a new approach is shown to be effective. And if participants do not benefit directly, they still make an important contribution to medical science by helping doctors learn more about the disease and how to control it. Although clinical trials may pose some risks, researchers do all they can to protect their patients.''Researchers are testing anticancer drugs and combinations of drugs. They are studying radiation therapy combined with drugs and other treatments. They also are testing drugs that prevent or reduce the side effects of radiation therapy.''If you are interested in learning more about joining a clinical trial, you may want to talk with your doctor. You may want to read Taking Part in Clinical Trials: What Cancer Patients Need To Know.

What is an oral cholecystogram (OCG)?,"'The oral cholecystogram, or OCG, is a radiologic procedure for diagnosing ''gallstones''. An oral cholecystogram is in contrast to an ''intravenous cholangiogram'' (IVC). The oral cholecystogram is rarely used, as ''ultrasound'' or CT are more accurate, faster techniques for identifying ''gallstones'' without exposure to ''iodine''.' "
How is an oral cholecystogram done?,"'The bile ducts themselves cannot be seen on the x-ray in an OCG because the iodine is not concentrated in the ducts. Therefore, any gallstones lodged in the ducts will go undetected on OCG.'""Failure to visualize the gallbladder on an OCG may occur for one of two reasons.  First, a gallstone may have obstructed the cystic duct and prevented the iodine-containing bile from entering the gallbladder. Second, inflammation of the gallbladder -- usually due to gallstones -- may have interfered with the gallbladder's ability to concentrate bile and iodine. Whichever the cause, failure to visualize the gallbladder on an OCG strongly suggests a diseased gallbladder."" "
What are the risks of an oral cholecystogram?,"' The risks of an oral cholecystogram are few. One, of course, is the ''radiation''. However, in an OCG there is a relatively small amount of radiation from the x-rays.''Another risk involves the iodine. Some people are ''allergic'' to iodine.  Fortunately, most people who are allergic know that they are, and therefore do not undergo the test.' "
When is an oral cholecystogram useful?,"'The OCG finds gallstones 95% of the time. However, the OCG has tended to be replaced by ''ultrasonography'"" because ultrasonography is slightly better at diagnosing gallstones and can be done immediately without waiting one or two days for the OCG's iodine to be absorbed, excreted, and concentrated. The OCG also cannot give information about the presence of non-gallstone related diseases, which ultrasonography is sometimes able to do. A limitation of the OCG is that it does not work well when there is more than a minimal amount of ""'jaundice''. Fortunately, most people with gallstones are not jaundiced.''As would be expected, ultrasonography sometimes finds gallstones that are missed by the OCG. Less frequently, the OCG finds gallstones that are missed by ultrasonography. For this reason, if gallstones are strongly suspected but ultrasonography does not show them, it is reasonable to consider doing an OCG. So OCGs are still done, and for good reason.' "
What is the glucose tolerance test?,"'Though no longer routinely used for diagnosing ''diabetes''.' The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was the gold standard for making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It is still commonly used during pregnancy for diagnosing gestational diabetes. With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least 8 hours, but not more than 16 hours). The next morning, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives a dose of oral glucose (the dose depends upon the length of the test). There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person drinks. Blood samples are taken up to four times at different time points after consumption of the sugar to measure the blood glucose."
How reliable is the glucose tolerance test?,"'For the glucose tolerance test to give reliable results, the person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a ''common cold''). Also, the person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital) and should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose.' In preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test, the person should eat and drink as they normally would. The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or consume caffeine."
What does the glucose tolerance test measure?,"'The classic oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels five times over a period of three hours. Some physicians simply take a baseline blood sample followed by a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without ''diabetes'', the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with ''diabetes'', glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast.''People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic levels have so-called ''impaired glucose tolerance'' (IGT). People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes.''Each year, 5% to 10% of people whose test results show impaired glucose tolerance actually develop diabetes. ''Weight loss'' and ''exercise'' may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as ''metformin'' (''Glucophage''), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes. Studies have shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the development of ''heart disease'', and whether impaired glucose tolerance turns out to be an entity that deserves treatment itself is something that physicians are currently debating.' "
What is the preparation for a glucose tolerance test?," As mentioned previously, preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test involves fasting overnight (from 8 to 16 hours) and participating normally in activities of daily living. The individual should eat and drink as they normally do prior to the test. The morning of the test, the person should not consume caffeine or smoke."
How are the results of the glucose tolerance test evaluated?,"'Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:' Normal response: A person is said to have a normal 
  response when the two hour glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values 
  between 0 and 2 hours are less than 200 mg/dl. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): A person is said to have impaired 
  glucose tolerance when the fasting plasma glucose is 
  less than 126 mg/dl and the two hour glucose level is between 140 and 199 
  mg/dl. This is sometimes referred to as ""prediabetes"" because people with IGT 
  have a higher risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes: A person has diabetes when two diagnostic 
  tests done on different days show that the blood glucose level is high. This means either the 
  two hour levels is greater than 200 mg/dl or the fasting glucose is noted as greater than 126 mg/dl.
  A 
  glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5% or more also supports a 
  diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes during pregnancy: A pregnant woman has diabetes 
	if she has a fasting plasma glucose of over 92 mg/dl, or a two hour glucose level 
	greater than 153 mg/dl."
What about glucose tolerance testing during pregnancy?,"'As mentioned previously, the glucose tolerance test is used for the diagnosis of ''gestational diabetes'' (diabetes that develops during pregnancy). It may be used if there are equivocal fasting or random blood glucose results, or to screen for gestational diabetes in pregnant women between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation who are not known to have diabetes.\t ''The test may also be used in the postpartum period to detect diabetes in women who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Women who had gestational diabetes do not always develop diabetes later in life, but they should undergo diabetes screening at least every three years throughout their life.\t ' "
Introduction to oral health and bone disease,"'Osteoporosis and tooth loss are health concerns that affect many older men and women. Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture. This disease can affect any bone in the body, although the bones in the hip, spine, and wrist are affected most often. In the United States more than 40 million people either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass.''Research suggests a link between osteoporosis and bone loss in the jaw. The bone in the jaw supports and anchors the ''teeth''. When the jawbone becomes less dense, tooth loss can occur, a common occurrence in older adults. Tooth loss affects approximately one-third of adults age 65 and older.'  "
Skeletal bone density and dental concerns,"'The portion of the jawbone that supports our teeth is known as the alveolar process. Several studies have found a link between the loss of alveolar bone and an increase in loose teeth (tooth mobility) and tooth loss. Women with osteoporosis are three times more likely to experience tooth loss than those who do not have the disease.''Low bone density in the jaw can result in other dental problems as well. For example, older women with osteoporosis may be more likely to have difficulty with loose or ill-fitting ''dentures'' and may have less optimal outcomes from oral surgical procedures.'  "
Periodontal disease and bone health,"""Periodontitis is a chronic infection that affects the gums and the bones that support the teeth. Bacteria and the body's own immune system break down the bone and connective tissue that hold teeth in place. Teeth may eventually become loose, fall out, or have to be removed.""'Although tooth loss is a well-documented consequence of periodontitis, the relationship between periodontitis and skeletal bone density is less clear. Some studies have found a strong and direct relationship among bone loss, periodontitis, and tooth loss. It is possible that the loss of alveolar ''bone mineral density'' leaves bone more susceptible to periodontal bacteria, increasing the risk for periodontitis and tooth loss.' "
The role of the dentist and dental X-rays,"'Research supported by the National Institute of ''Arthritis'' and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) suggests that dental ''x-rays'' may be used as a screening tool for osteoporosis. Researchers found that dental x-rays were highly effective in distinguishing people with osteoporosis from those with normal bone density.''Because many people see their dentist more regularly than their doctor, dentists are in a unique position to help identify people with low bone density and to encourage them to talk to their doctors about their bone health. Dental concerns that may indicate low bone density include loose teeth, gums detaching from the teeth or receding gums, and ill-fitting or loose ''dentures''.'  "
The effects of osteoporosis treatments on oral health,"'It is not known whether osteoporosis treatments have the same beneficial effect on oral health as they do on other bones in the skeleton. Additional research is needed to fully clarify the relationship between osteoporosis and oral bone loss; however, scientists are hopeful that efforts to optimize skeletal bone density will have a favorable impact on ''dental health''.''Bisphosphonates, a group of medications available for the treatment of osteoporosis, have been linked to the development of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which is cause for concern. The risk of ONJ has been greatest in patients receiving large doses of intravenous bisphosphonates, a therapy used to treat ''cancer''. The occurrence of ONJ is rare in individuals taking oral forms of the medication for osteoporosis treatment.' "
Taking steps for healthy bones,"'A healthy lifestyle can be critically important for keeping bones strong. You can take many important steps to optimize your bone health:'  Eat a well-balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D.  Engage in regular physical activity or exercise. Weight-bearing activities -- such as walking, jogging, dancing, and weight training -- are the best for keeping bones strong. Don't smoke, and limit alcohol intake. Report any problems with loose teeth, detached or receding gums, and loose or ill-fitting dentures to your dentist and your doctor."
Baby bottle tooth decay,"'Baby bottle tooth decay (also called early childhood ''caries'', ''nursing'"" caries, and nursing bottle syndrome) occurs when a baby's teeth are in frequent contact with sugars from liquid carbohydrates, such as fruit juices, milk, formula, fruit juice diluted with water, ""'sugar'' water or any other sweet drink. Human ''breast milk'' can cause tooth decay as well. As these liquids break down in the mouth into simple sugars and are allowed to sit in the mouth, bacteria start feeding on the sugars, causing tooth decay.''If left untreated, decayed teeth can cause ''pain'' and make it difficult to chew and eat. Also, baby teeth serve as ""space savers"" for adult teeth. If baby teeth are damaged or destroyed, they can\'t help guide permanent teeth into their proper position, possibly resulting in crowded or crooked permanent teeth. Badly decayed baby teeth could lead to an ''abscessed tooth'', with the possibility of infection spreading elsewhere.' "
How do I prevent baby bottle tooth decay?,"'Some tips to prevent baby bottle tooth decay include:' During the day, to calm or comfort your baby, don't give a bottle filled with sugary liquids or milk; instead, give plain water or substitute a pacifier. At anytime, don't dip your baby's pacifier in sugar, honey, or any sugary liquid. At bedtime, don't put your baby to bed with a bottle filled with sugary liquids (watered-down fruit juice or milk still increases the risk of decay). Give plain water. Don't allow your baby to nurse continuously throughout the night while sleeping, since human breast milk can cause decay. Use a pacifier or give a bottle filled with plain water instead. Don't add sugar to your child's food Use a wet cloth or gauze to wipe your child's teeth and gums after each feeding. This helps remove any bacteria-forming plaque and excess sugar that have built up on the teeth and gums. Ask your dentist about your baby's fluoride needs. If your drinking water is not fluoridated, fluoride supplements or fluoride treatments may be needed. Teach your baby to drink from a cup by his or her first birthday. Moving to a ""sippy cup"" reduces the teeth's exposure to sugars; however, constant sipping from the cup can still result in decay unless it is filled with water."
Thumb sucking,"""Generally, it's normal and healthy for infants to suck their thumbs, fingers, pacifiers or toys. Object sucking gives children a sense of emotional security and comfort. However, if thumb sucking continues beyond the age of ""'5 -- when'' the permanent teeth begin to come ''in -- dental'' problems may occur. Depending on the frequency, intensity, and duration of the sucking, the teeth can be pushed out of alignment, causing them to protrude and create an overbite. The child may also have difficulty with the correct pronunciation of words. In addition, the upper and lower jaws can become misaligned and the roof of the mouth might become malformed.' "
Tips to help your child stop thumb sucking,"'First, remember that thumb sucking is normal and should not be a concern of parents unless the habit continues as the permanent teeth begin to emerge.''The child must make the decision on their own to stop sucking their thumb or fingers before the habit will cease. To help toward this goal, parents and family members can offer encouragement and positive reinforcement. Because thumb sucking is a security mechanism, negative reinforcement (such as scolding, nagging, or punishments) are generally ''ineffective -- making'' children defensive and driving them back to the habit. Instead, give praise or rewards for time successfully avoiding the habit. Gradually increase the time needed without sucking to achieve the reward. The younger the child, the more frequent the rewards will need to be given. For children who want to stop, cover the finger or thumb with a band-aid as a reminder. Take the thumb or finger out of the mouth after the child falls asleep.''To help older children break the habit, parents should try to determine why their child is doing ''it -- find'"" out what stresses your child faces and try to correct the situation. Once the problem is gone, the child often finds it is easier to give up sucking. If this doesn't work, there are dental appliances a child can wear in the mouth to prevent sucking. These appliances are cemented to the upper teeth, sit on the roof of the mouth and make thumb sucking harder and therefore less pleasurable."" "
Tongue thrusting,"'Tongue thrusting is the habit of sealing the mouth for swallowing by thrusting the top of the tongue forward against the lips.''Just like thumb sucking, tongue thrusting exerts pressure against the front teeth, pushing them out of ''alignment -- which'' causes them to protrude, creating an overbite and possibly interfering with proper speech development.''If you notice symptoms of tongue thrusting, consult a speech pathologist. This person can develop a treatment plan that helps your child to increase the strength of the chewing muscles and to develop a new swallowing pattern.' "
Lip sucking,'Lip sucking involves repeatedly holding the lower lip beneath the upper front teeth. Sucking of the lower lip may occur by itself or in combination with thumb sucking. This practice results in an overbite and the same kinds of problems as discussed with thumb sucking and tongue thrusting. Stopping the habit involves the same steps as described for stopping thumb sucking.' 
Early tooth loss,"""Premature loss of a child's primary teeth typically occurs due to tooth decay, injury, or lack of jaw space.""'If teeth are lost before the permanent teeth emerge, the nearby teeth can tip or shift into the space now unoccupied. When a permanent tooth tries to emerge into its space, there may not be enough room. The new tooth may emerge tilted. Crooked or misaligned teeth can cause a range of problems from interfering with proper chewing to causing temporomandibular joint problems.''If your child loses a tooth prematurely, your dentist may recommend a space maintainer. A space maintainer is a ''plastic'' or metal device that holds open the space left by the missing tooth. Your dentist will remove the device once the permanent teeth begin to erupt.''Reviewed by the doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Reviewed by Jay H. Rosoff, DDS, on March 1, 2007.''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson Mathis, MD, on May 1, 2005.''Portions of this page © The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2005' "
What is oral thrush?,"'Thrush'' is a ''yeast infection'' of the mouth and throat. ''Thrush'' can also be associated with yeast infections of the ''esophagus''. Thrush appears as creamy white curd-like patches on the tongue and inside of the mouth and back of the throat. As mentioned above, in individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast infections are more common. For example, in a non-infant population, thrush may be a sign of an underlying ''HIV'' infection. The child may not have any symptoms from the condition or may refuse to eat or swallow because of ''pain'' or an unusual feeling in the mouth. Sometimes older children complain of a cottony feeling in the mouth.''Another form of oral ''yeast infection'' is ''angular cheilitis'', which is the development of painful fissures at the corners of the mouth. Yeast infection can also involve the tongue and lead to flattening (erosion) of the papillae of the surface of the tongue, along with ''pain'' and reddening of the tongue (acute atrophic ''candidiasis'').' "
What are yeast infections?,"'What are commonly known as ""yeast"" infections are caused by various species of a yeast-like fungus called ''Candida'', particularly the species ''Candida albicans''. Yeast organisms are some of the germs (including bacteria) that normally reside on various parts of the body and that ordinarily cause no symptoms or signs.' "
Why do yeast sometimes cause symptoms and signs?,"'Certain conditions, such as antibiotic use, may upset the balance of microbes in the body (particularly between the bacteria and fungi) and allow an overgrowth of ''Candida''. Yeast also can thrive in chronically moist folds of skin, such as in the groin.''Yeast infections may flare up and then heal in most people. However, in newborns or individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast can cause more serious or chronic infections.'  "
How do babies get yeast infections?,"'Many infants acquire ''Candida'"" infections from their mothers during the process of birth. Yeast exists naturally in the mother's vagina. The baby comes in direct contact with the yeast during delivery through the birth canal.""'Many ''babies'' who escape this infection at birth soon acquire ''Candida'' from close contact with other family members.' "
What are oral thrush symptoms and signs?,"'Most common ''oral thrush'' symptoms include:' Thrush is characterized by a white coating or white patches on the tongue, mouth, inner cheeks, and the back of the throat.  The tissue under the white patches is often red, raw, and sore. Lesions can be painful and even bleed when scraped.  Oral thrush often looks like cottage cheese or milk curds. Bad breath Cheilosis (Cracking at the outer edges of the lips) Feeling of food stuck in the throat or sore throat Strange or unpleasant taste in the mouth Burning mouth syndrome: Symptoms of a painful burning sensation, mouth dryness, soreness, tingling, or numbness throughout the mouth and tongue. Symptoms can be associated with an abnormal bitter or metallic taste in the mouth. In severe cases of thrush, the esophagus (food pipe), which leads down to the stomach, may also be involved. This will cause pain with swallowing, fever, shaking or chills, or difficulty swallowing."
How do children (and adults) acquire thrush?,"'Outbreaks of thrush in childcare settings may be the result of an increased use of antibiotics and growth of the yeast normally present in the mouth, rather than newly acquired ''Candida'' infections. In children (and adults) taking antibiotics or steroids (such as cortisone-related ''asthma medications''), the balance of the normal microbes in the mouth can be disturbed. This may cause an overgrowth of ''Candida'', which in turn results in oral thrush.'  "
How does yeast affect diaper rash?,"'Candida'"" may infect an infant's ""'diaper'' area and worsen a ''diaper rash''. This is because yeast can grow very readily on irritated, moist skin. The infected skin is usually fiery red with areas that may have a raised red border and is usually intensely ''itchy'' (pruritic).' "
Can thumb sucking cause problems with yeast?,'Children who suck their thumbs or other fingers may occasionally develop ''Candida'' around their fingernails. This causes redness at the edges of the nails.' 
Can a nursing mother acquire yeast infections from her infant?,'Nursing'' mothers are at risk for developing ''Candida'' infections on their breasts (this is called ''mastitis'') and can be treated with the same medication that is used for infants.' 
What is the treatment for thrush and other yeast infections?,"'Health care professionals usually treat oral thrush and yeast infections, such as ''Candida'' ''diaper rash'', with antifungal medicines; these include ''nystatin'' (''Mycostatin''), ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin), or ''miconazole'' (''Monistat'') either by mouth or in a topical cream. Luckily, most ''Candida'' are very sensitive to nystatin, and resistance is rare. There are many topical antifungals available as ''over-the-counter'' brands. Oral thrush requires an oral medication that is available by prescription only.''The following tips can help care for children with diaper ''rash'':'   Caregivers should change the child's diapers frequently and gently cleanse the child's skin with water and a mild soap and pat it dry. It is important to minimize skin contact with urine and stool. Allowing periods of exposure to dry air without wearing a diaper can also be helpful. Barrier creams or ointments, such as Desitin or A&D, are helpful. While cornstarch may help mild diaper rash, it should not be used for children with significantly inflamed skin. High-absorbency disposable diapers may help keep the skin dry. A baby's bottom is very sensitive, so staying dry is very important. Avoid plastic pants that do not allow air to circulate over the diaper area. The diapering system should be able to hold urine or liquid feces."
What should caregivers do if the medication does not effectively treat the yeast infection?,"'There are some situations when a child may need a different medication to clear a yeast infection. A health care provider may prescribe another type of antifungal cream or oral preparation that may include ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral'', ''Extina'', ''Xolegel'', ''Kuric''), ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''), or ''itraconazole'' (''Sporanox'').' "
Should a child with yeast infection be kept out of childcare?,"'There is no need to remove a child with yeast infection from childcare. Since most healthy people already harbor ''Candida'', children with thrush and ''Candida'' diaper rash do not have to be excluded from child care (as long they are able to participate comfortably).''Childcare providers should follow good hygiene, including careful hand washing and disposal of nasal and oral secretions of children with thrush, in order to avoid transmitting the infection to children who may not already be infected.' "
Are there other names for yeast infection?,"'Health care professionals refer to a yeast infection as candidiasis because ''Candida'' causes the infection. Thrush is another name for ''oral candidiasis''. The old name for ''Candida'' was ''Monilia''. The infection is still sometimes called ''moniliasis'', and thrush is still at times known as oral moniliasis.' "
Impacted Teeth,"'''Wisdom teeth'', otherwise known as third molars, are the last set of ''teeth'' todevelop. Sometimes these ''teeth'' emerge from the gum line and the jaw is largeenough to allow room for them, but most of the time, this is not the case. Moreoften, one or more of these third molars fails to emerge in proper alignment orfails to fully emerge through the gum line and becomes entrapped or""impacted"" between the jawbone and the gum tissue. Impacted wisdomteeth can result in swelling, ''pain'', and infection of the gum tissue surroundingthe ''wisdom teeth''. In addition, ''impacted wisdom teeth'' can cause permanent damageto nearby teeth, gums, and bone and can sometimes lead to the formation of ''cysts'' or tumors that can destroy sections of the jaw. Therefore, dentistsrecommend people with ''impacted wisdom teeth'' have them surgically removed.'""It's not just wisdom teeth that sometimes become impacted and need to beremoved. Other teeth, such as the cuspids and the bicuspids can become impactedand can cause the same types of problems described with impacted wisdomteeth.""'''' "
Tooth Loss,"'''Dental implants'' are an option for tooth loss due to an accident orinfection or as an alternative to ''dentures''. The implants are tooth root substitutes that are surgicallyanchored in place in the jawbone and act to stabilize the artificial teeth towhich they are attached. Suitable candidates for dental implants need to havean adequate bone level and density, must not be prone to infection, and must bewilling to maintain good oral hygiene practices.' "
Jaw-Related Problems," 
Unequal jaw growth. In some individuals, the upper and lower jaw
fail to grow properly. This can cause difficulty in speaking, eating,
swallowing, and breathing. While some of these problems -- like improper teeth
alignment -- can be corrected with braces and other orthodontic appliances, more
serious problems require oral surgery to move all or part of the upper jaw,
lower jaw, or both into a new position that is more balanced, functional, and
healthy. 
Improve fit of dentures. For first-time denture wearers, oral
surgery can be done to correct any irregularities of the jaws prior to creating
the dentures to ensure a better fit. Oral surgery can also help long-term
denture wearers. Supporting bone often deteriorates over time resulting in
dentures that no longer fit properly. In severe cases, an oral surgeon can add
a bone graft to areas where little bone remains. 
Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Dysfunction of the 
TMJ, the small joint in front of the ear where the skull and lower jaw
meet, is a common source of headache and facial pain. Most patients with TMJ
disorders can be successfully treated with a combination of oral medications,
physical therapy, and splints. However, joint surgery is an option for advanced
cases and when the diagnosis indicates a specific problem in the joint."
Other Conditions Treated by Oral Surgery,"'Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, on May 1, 2005.''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic'' 2000-2005' 
Facial injury repair. Oral surgery is often used to fix fractured
jaws and broken facial bones. 
Lesion removal and biopsy. Oral surgeons can take a small sample of
abnormal growth or tissue and then send it for laboratory testing for
identification. Some lesions can be managed medically or can be removed by the
oral surgeon. 
Cleft lip and cleft palate repair. Cleft lip and cleft palate result when all or portions of the mouth and nasal cavity do
not grow together properly during fetal development. The result is a gap in the
lip and/or a split in the opening in the roof of the mouth. Oral surgeons work
as part of a team of healthcare specialists to correct these problems through a
series of treatments and surgical procedures over many years. 
Facial infections. Pain and swelling in the face, neck or jaws may
indicate an infection. Infections in this area of the body can sometimes
develop into life-threatening emergencies if not treated promptly and
effectively. An oral surgeon can assist in diagnosing and treating this
problem. Surgical treatment, if needed, may include cutting into and draining
the infected area as well as extracting any teeth that might be involved. 
Snoring/sleep apnea. When conservative methods fail to alleviate
this problem, surgery can be tried. Surgical procedures involve removing the
soft tissues of the oropharynx (an area in the back portion of the mouth) or
the lower jaw. Laser surgery is a newer treatment option. Depending on the
surgical technique used, the laser is used to either slowly scar the palate,
which tightens it, or to remove palate tissue."
What Causes Sexual Problems?,"'Sexual dysfunction can be a result of a physical or psychological problem.' Physical causes: Many physical and/or medical conditions can cause sexual problems. These conditions include diabetes, heart disease, neurological diseases, hormonal imbalances, menopause, chronic diseases such as kidney disease or liver failure, and 
	alcoholism and drug abuse. In addition, the side effects of certain medications, including some 
	antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual desire and function. Psychological causes: These include work-related stress and anxiety, concern about sexual performance, marital or relationship problems, depression, feelings of guilt, and the effects of a past sexual trauma. "
Who Is Affected by Sexual Problems?,"'Both men and women are affected by sexual problems. Sexual problems occur in adults of all ages. Among those commonly affected are those in seniors, which may be related to a decline in health associated with ''aging''.' "
How Do Sexual Problems Affect Women?,"'The most common problems related to sexual dysfunction in women include:' Inhibited sexual desire: This involves a lack of sexual desire or interest in sex. Many factors can contribute to a lack of desire, including hormonal changes, medical conditions and treatments (for example cancer and chemotherapy), depression, pregnancy, stress, and fatigue. Boredom with regular sexual routines also may contribute to a lack of enthusiasm for sex, as can lifestyle factors, such as careers and the care of children. 
 Inability to become aroused: 
 For women, the inability to become physically aroused during sexual activity often involves insufficient vaginal lubrication. The inability to become aroused also may be related to anxiety or inadequate stimulation. In addition, researchers are investigating how blood flow problems affecting the vagina and clitoris may contribute to arousal problems. Lack of orgasm (anorgasmia): 
  This is the absence of sexual climax (orgasm). It can be caused by sexual inhibition, inexperience, lack of knowledge, and psychological factors such as guilt, anxiety, or a past sexual trauma or abuse. Other factors contributing to anorgasmia include insufficient stimulation, certain medications, and chronic diseases. 
   Painful intercourse: Pain during intercourse can be caused by a number of problems, including endometriosis, a pelvic mass, ovarian cysts, vaginitis, poor lubrication, the presence of 
scar tissue from surgery or a 
sexually transmitted disease. A condition called vaginismus is a painful, involuntary spasm of the muscles that surround the vaginal entrance. It may occur in women who fear that penetration will be painful and also may stem from a sexual phobia or from a previous traumatic or painful experience. 
"
How Is a Female Sexual Problem Diagnosed?,"""To diagnose a woman's sexual problem, the doctor likely will begin with a thorough evaluation of symptoms and a physical exam. The doctor may perform a ""'pelvic exam'' to evaluate the health of the reproductive organs and a ''Pap smear'' to detect changes in the cells of the cervix (to check for ''cancer'' or a pre-cancerous condition). He or she may order other tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the problem.''An evaluation of your attitude regarding sex, as well as other possible contributing factors (fear, ''anxiety'', past sexual trauma/abuse, relationship problems, ''alcohol'' or ''drug abuse'', for example) will help the doctor understand the underlying cause of the problem and make appropriate recommendations for treatment.' "
How Are Female Sexual Problems Treated?,"'The ideal approach to treating sexual problems in women involves a team effort between the woman, doctors, and trained therapists. Most types of sexual problems can be corrected by treating the underlying physical or psychological problems. Other treatment strategies focus on the following:' Providing education. Education about human anatomy, sexual function, and the normal changes associated with aging, as well as sexual behaviors and responses, may help a woman overcome her anxieties about sexual function and performance. Enhancing stimulation. This may include the use of erotic materials (videos or books), masturbation, and changes to sexual routines. 
   Providing distraction techniques. Erotic or non-erotic fantasies, exercises with intercourse, music, videos, or television can be used to increase relaxation and eliminate anxiety. 
   Encouraging non-coital behaviors. Non-coital behaviors (physically stimulating activity that does not include intercourse), such as sensual massage, can be used to promote comfort and increase communication between partners. 
   Minimizing pain. Using sexual positions that allow the woman to control the depth of penetration may help relieve some pain. The use of vaginal lubricants can help reduce pain caused by friction, and a warm bath before intercourse can help increase relaxation. 
"
Can Female Sexual Problems Be Cured?,"'The success of treatment for female sexual dysfunction depends on the underlying cause of the problem. The outlook is good for sexual problems related to a treatable or reversible physical condition. Mild dysfunction that is related to stress, fear, or anxiety often can be successfully treated with counseling, education, and improved communication between partners.' "
How Do Hormones Affect Sexual Function?,"'Hormones play an important role in regulating sexual function in women. With the decrease in the female hormone estrogen that is related to aging and ''menopause'', many women experience some changes in sexual function as they age, including poor vaginal lubrication and decreased genital sensation. Further, research suggests that low levels of the male hormone testosterone also contribute to a decline in sexual arousal, genital sensation, and orgasm. Researchers still are investigating the benefits of hormones and other medications, including drugs like ''Viagra'', to treat sexual problems in women.' "
What Effect Does a Hysterectomy Have on Sexual Function?,"'Many women experience changes in sexual function after a ''hysterectomy'' (surgical removal of the uterus). These changes may include a loss of desire as well as decreased vaginal lubrication and genital sensation. These problems may be associated with the hormonal changes that occur with the loss of the uterus. Furthermore, nerves and blood vessels critical to sexual function can be damaged during the surgery.' "
How Does Menopause Affect a Woman's Sexual Function?,"'The loss of estrogen following ''menopause'"" can lead to changes in a woman's sexual functioning. Emotional changes that often accompany menopause can add to a woman's loss of interest in sex and/or ability to become aroused. ""'Hormone replacement therapy'' -- ''HRT'' -- may improve certain conditions, such as loss of vaginal lubrication and genital sensation, which can create problems with sexual function.''It should be noted that some ''postmenopausal'' women report an increase in sexual satisfaction. This may be due to decreased anxiety over getting ''pregnant''. In addition, postmenopausal woman often have fewer child-rearing responsibilities, allowing them to relax and enjoy intimacy with their partners.' "
"When Should I Call My Doctor About Sexual 
Problems?","'Many women experience a problem with sexual function from time to time. However, when the problems are persistent, they can cause distress for the women and her partner, and can have a negative impact on their relationship.

What are sexual problems in men?,"'Sexual health'"" is an important part of a man's life, no matter his age, civil status, or sexual orientation. It is also an important part of a couple's foundation and contributes to the quality of life. Sexual problems in men are very common and impact sexual health. Many problems with sexual health can be treated. Therefore, it is important for a man to discuss these issues with a physician.""""The definition of sexual dysfunction is the inability to have a satisfactory sexual relationship. This definition depends on each person's own interpretation on what he judges satisfactory. In general, sexual dysfunction can affect the quality of life and, even more importantly, can be the first symptom of another medical or psychological problem. Any sexual complaint should be taken seriously and evaluated."" "
How does sexual function work?,"'Sexual activity involves coordination between various systems of the body. Hormones and neurological pathways must be in sync for sexual desire to be present. Blood vessels, nerves, and penile integrity must all be present for an adequate erection and its maintenance during the sexual relation. Muscles and nerves coordinate ejaculation achieved when the physiological passageway for sperm (from the testicles to the urethra) is present. ''Orgasm'"" is a complex phenomenon that isn't completely understood, but it involves the coordination of muscles and nerves. When sexual dysfunction is present, the physician must evaluate all the possible problems in this chain of events."" "
What are the types of sexual dysfunction in men?,"'Types of sexual dysfunction include disorders involving sexual desire or libido, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. They will be described separately, but understand that some medical conditions can affect two or more disorders at the same time.'  "
How are sexual problems in men diagnosed?,"""Evaluation of sexual dysfunction starts with a detailed medical, sexual, and psychological history, followed by a thorough physical examination. The second step must not be overlooked because sexual dysfunction can have many causes. Sometimes, the patient's partner can also contribute to the evaluation and could provide useful information as well.""'A detailed medical, psychological, and sexual history is acquired during the interview with the physician. Some of the questions that are asked can be intimate and might cause you to feel too shy to answer thoroughly. It is imperative to give the proper information, even though it is understandable that it can take time to be comfortable talking about this. Having a good relationship with your physician is always helpful.''Some of the questions the doctor could ask might concern the frequency of sexual relations, your sexual orientation, if the frequency or quality of sexual relations are satisfying, and your number of sexual partners, among others. They will also inquire about nonsexual-related complaints.''A complete physical examination is performed including assessing the pulses in the legs and a thorough examination of the external genitalia (penis, scrotum, and perineum) and their reflexes.''One of the possible tests is a ''nocturnal'' tumescence test to evaluate nocturnal erections. Your physician might also ask for tests for penile blood vessel function or some tests of the nervous system to help differentiate between possible causes of sexual dysfunction.' "
What is the treatment for sexual problems in men?,"'The treatment plan depends greatly on the precise cause of the sexual problem. If the cause is psychological, help from a psychiatrist or psychologist can be helpful. Often in this situation, ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' is the treatment used. Sometimes the treatment will include couples therapy. If the cause of the diminished libido is from medications being taken, sometimes there are alternative medications without sexual side effects. For others, hormonal replacement may be suggested. Talk to your doctor about any changes in libido you have experienced.'  "
What is low libido (low sexual desire)?,"'The definition of ''low libido'"" is when sexual desire is diminished or absent. The definition also varies according to the patient's level of satisfaction of his own sexual desire. Some men can be very fulfilled with what some men consider scarce sexual activity.""'Sexual desire problems affect a small percentage of men in the general population. Libido is mainly a hormonal and brain phenomenon. Sexual desire requires normal levels of testosterone (male hormone) in the blood and a certain attraction for the partner in question.' "
What are the symptoms of low libido?,"""The person that lacks sexual desire won't want to initiate the sexual relation. If the act is initiated, ""'low libido'' can also present itself as the inability to attain an erection. If the patient experiences a first episode of ''erectile dysfunction'' without any previous sexual symptoms and adequate nocturnal erection, the cause is probably psychogenic and the problem is not the erection. It is also important to specify if the low libido is new in onset or if one has always felt this way about sexual relations.' "
What causes a low sex drive in men?,"'Many causes have been identified as contributing to the diminishment of sexual desire. They include:' Medications (SSRIs, anti-androgens, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, opioid analgesics) Alcoholism Depression Fatigue Hypoactive sexual disorder Recreational drugs Relationship problems Other sexual dysfunction (fear of humiliation) Sexual aversion disorder Systemic illness Testosterone deficiency Stress Lack of time History of sexual abuse Hormonal problems such as hyperthyroidism"
What are risk factors for low libido?,"'Risk factors for low libido in men include:' Age because testosterone concentration will decrease over the years Alcohol consumption Malnourishment Smoking Drug consumption Conditions requiring medication that lowers testosterone, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), pain, and prostate cancer"
What is erectile dysfunction (impotence)? Who gets it?,"'Erectile dysfunction'' (''ED'') is the inability to acquire or maintain a satisfactory erection. The prevalence of ''erectile dysfunction'"" varies according to the patient's age. About 16% of men from 50 to 59 years of age will suffer from erectile dysfunction and 44% of those aged 70 to 75 years will, too.""'There are three types of erections -- those caused by tactile stimulation, those caused by mental stimulation, and those that men experience while sleeping. This classification can be important when the cause of erectile dysfunction is yet to be determined.''In order to have an erection, men need stimuli; they need blood arriving from the arteries and have veins capable of locking the blood in place. Each of the numerous steps in this system can fail making erectile dysfunction a complex problem for investigation.' "
What are the symptoms of erectile dysfunction?,"'Erectile dysfunction will cause the penis to be unable to acquire or maintain a satisfactory erection. It is important to specify to the doctor the rapidity of onset, the presence of nocturnal erections, and the quality of the erection if it can be attained but not maintained. The quality of an erection can be judged according to the rigidity and the functionality (Is the penis erect enough to allow for vaginal penetration?).''Erectile dysfunction with sudden onset and no previous history of sexual dysfunction suggests a psychogenic cause, unless there was a previous surgery or a genital ''trauma''. The loss of nocturnal erections will suggest a neurologic or vascular cause. Finally, when an erection is not sustained, its loss may be due to an underlying psychological cause or vascular problem. Talk to your doctor if you have noticed any problems with your erectile function.' "

What are the risk factors for erectile dysfunction?,'The risk factors for erectile dysfunction include:' Obesity Smoking Diabetes High blood pressure High cholesterol Cardiovascular disease Medication use Obstructive sleep apnea Restless leg syndrome Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) Peyronie's disease Prostate cancer treatment
What is the treatment for erectile dysfunction?,"'Nowadays, there are many options for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Before suggesting pharmacological help, the doctor may suggest a change in lifestyle habits. Since many causes of erectile dysfunction are disorders in which lifestyle changes will have a positive effect, addressing these issues can be helpful. Therefore, regular ''exercise'', a healthy ''diet'', ''smoking cessation'', and limiting alcohol consumption can all have an impact on erectile function. Lifestyle changes can also include the use of a more genitalia-friendly bicycle seat.' "
What are nonsurgical treatments for erectile dysfunction?,"'There are many nonsurgical treatments available for erectile dysfunction.''Oral pharmacological treatment''The first line of pharmacological treatment is a class of medication called phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitors. This class includes ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra''), and ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis''). They will improve the ability to attain and maintain the erection, but sexual stimulation is still required for this medication to work. It should be taken some time before the sexual act is planned, but has a long timeframe of action. Side effects include visual disturbances, flushing, ''back pain'', and ''muscle pain''. Most side effects will abate with time. Usually, there will be no side effects at all. If you are taking ''nitrates'', phosphodiesterase inhibitors are not recommended since both medications taken simultaneously could cause severe ''hypotension'' (excessive ''low blood pressure'').'""Other types of oral medication are available. Apomorphine will enhance penile erection. And there are others. You should ask your doctor for other types of medication if the first one didn't work. Other treatment options should also be discussed.""'Transurethral therapy''Another type of pharmacological solution is a liquid that can be applied in the urethra that manages to improve erection. The erection can be maintained by applying an elastic band at the base of the penis.''Intracavernous injection''Injections at the base of the penis (intracavernous) can help attain and maintain an erection. There are various types of solutions that can be injected -- ''papaverine'"", alprostadil, and drug combinations. These injections are considered the most effective treatments for erectile dysfunction. They are also convenient for the patients who don't tolerate the oral therapies.""'Side effects include priapism (prolonged and painful erection) and fibrosis (scarring) but they are rare. There are ways to prevent these side effects (especially the prolonged and painful erection). The patient must follow the training and recommendations given at the beginning of this type of therapy. Contraindications for intracavernous injections include ''sickle cell anemia'', ''schizophrenia'', and severe psychiatric disorder.''Vacuum constriction device''This is a ''plastic'' cylinder connected to a vacuum-generating source that creates a negative pressure that draws the blood to the penis and makes way for an erection. An elastic band must be placed at the base of the penis to maintain the rigidity. The base of the penis will stay flaccid which might make the genitalia pivot. Side effects include ejaculatory problems, ''penile pain'', and blood pooling because of ruptured blood vessels (ecchymosis or ''petechiae'').' "
What are surgical treatments for erectile dysfunction?,"'There are numerous surgical treatments available for erectile dysfunction.''Penile vascular surgery'""Bypass surgery can be performed when there is an isolated artery occlusion disrupting blood flow in the penis. With any surgical procedure, it's necessary to consider the patient's surgical risk. Not all patients will be able to qualify for this type of intervention.""'Prosthesis''Various types of prosthesis are available -- malleable, mechanical, and inflatable. The patient should discuss the type he would prefer with his physician. The majority of prostheses will need replacement after 10 to 15 years. Surgical complications include infection, mechanical failure, cylinder leaks, perforation, penile shortening, autoinflation, and ''pain''.' "
What is premature ejaculation?,"'Premature ejaculation is the most common of the ejaculatory disorders; approximately 20% to 30% of men will have premature ejaculation. Ejaculation problems involve the improper discharge of sperm, prostatic, and seminal vesicle fluid through the urethra.''There are three different types of premature ejaculation:' Premature ejaculation is ejaculation after minimal or no physical stimulation. Retarded ejaculation is ejaculation after a long delay of physical stimulation. Retrograde ejaculation is orgasm without ejaculation, also called ""dry"" ejaculation."
What are the symptoms of premature ejaculation?,"'Classically, premature ejaculation includes:''Generally, premature ejaculators will only have about a minute or less of intravaginal time before they ejaculate.''Retarded ejaculation will present as a long delay of intravaginal time to the point where the patient will not be satisfied with the sexual relation.'""Anejaculation or retrograde ejaculation is the experience of a dry orgasm. The semen doesn't go out of the urethra. It can either flow to the bladder instead or not be produced at all. Following the sexual act in the latter case, patients will notice the presence of semen in their first urine."" Brief ejaculatory latency Loss of control Psychological distress in the patient and/or partner"
What causes premature ejaculation?,"'There are many potential causes of premature ejaculation. These include neurological causes that affect the following areas:''Premature ejaculation may be caused by negative conditioning and penile hypersensitivity. Retarded ejaculation may be an early sign of ''diabetes'' or may develop following surgery for ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''). Anejaculation (retrograde ejaculation) may be caused by radical ''prostatectomy'', cystoprostatectomy (removal of the bladder and the rectum), or the use of certain medications such as alpha-blockers (''tamsulosin'') and antidepressants (SSRIs).' Central control of ejaculation Innervations to the seminal tract Sensory innervation to the genitalia/prostate"
What is the treatment for premature ejaculation?,"'The treatment will vary according to the cause of premature ejaculation. Couples sexual therapy or psychological therapy can be useful when psychological causes are involved. Other nonpharmacological therapies include actively trying to ""hold it in."" Drug therapy has also proven to be successful. The medications used to treat premature ejaculation are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (TCAs).' "
What is disordered orgasm?,'Disordered orgasm is the inability to reach an orgasm after adequate stimulation. Orgasm is still a phenomenon that is poorly understood.' 
What causes disordered orgasm?,"'The causes of disordered orgasm include:' Psychiatric disorder Diabetic neuropathy Multiple sclerosis Complications from genital surgery Pelvic trauma Drugs (alpha-blockers, antidepressants)"
What is the treatment for disordered orgasm?,'Anorgasmia will be treated with psychiatric help or by treating the underlying cause.' 
What are other kinds of sexual dysfunction in men?,"""Another category of sexual problem is sexual pain. A penile lesion, injury, or a skin disease can be the cause among others. Men's sexual pain occurs less frequently than women's."" "
At what age do men experience sexual dysfunction?,"'There are normal changes in sexual function in the elderly. Older men can have the following symptoms of sexual dysfunction:''These phenomena can be experienced as patients grow old. Nevertheless, it can be addressed so that those affected can still have a very satisfactory sexual life.' Longer delay between stimulation and erection Erection is less turgid Ejaculation is less strong Ejaculatory volume is smaller Time between erections is longer Less sensitivity to tactile stimuli Lower testosterone Orgasm is attained more slowly"
Can sexual problems in men be prevented?,"'Lifestyle changes can be useful to help treat or improve sexual dysfunction, but more importantly, they can have an impact before the development of the disease itself. You can prevent the incidence of sexual troubles by having a healthy lifestyle; ''exercise'' regularly, eat well, limit alcohol consumption, and ''quit smoking'', if you are a smoker. Lifestyle changes take time and effort, but the results are worthwhile.' "
What is the prognosis for sexual problems in men? Can they be cured?,"'Prognosis varies according to the method of treatment and the underlying disease. Nowadays, many innovations have changed the face of male sexual dysfunction giving men multiple options regarding treatment. Not only do men have choices but the developing technologies and medications have also given men a voice to share their experience.'""It's very important that you speak to your doctor about any concern regarding your sexual function or that of your partner."" "
Which types of doctors or specialists treat sexual problems in men?,"'Psychiatrists, psychologists, and sexologists can be involved in the management of sexual dysfunction. Psychiatrists or psychologists can especially help when the cause of the dysfunction is psychogenic. Therapies targeting cognition and behavior usually have good success rates. Sexologists can also contribute to these therapies.' "
What is orthostatic hypotension?,"'When a person stands up from sitting or lying down, the body must work to adjust to that change in position. It is especially important for the body to push blood upward and supply the brain with oxygen. If the body fails to do this adequately, blood pressure falls, and a person may feel lightheaded or even pass out. Orthostatic hypotension is the term used to describe the fall in blood pressure when a person stands (orthostatic= upright posture of the body; hypo= less + tension=pressure).'""Adequate blood supply to the body's organs depends upon three factors: ""'When the body changes position, a variety of actions occur involving all parts of the ''cardiovascular system'' as well as the autonomic nervous system that helps regulate their function. ''The ''autonomic nervous system'' can be considered to ""run in the background"" of the body, regulating body processes that we take for granted. There is a balance between the ''sympathetic system'' (adrenergic nerves), that speed things up, and the ''parasympathetic system'' (cholinergic nerves) that slow things down. These names are based on the type of chemical that is used to transmit signals at the nerve endings. ''These two systems are in balance, and yet need to respond to routine changes in the body that happens throughout the day.''Orthostatic hypotension is not a disease or a complaint from an individual; it is an abnormal change in blood pressure and heart rate associated with an illness.' a heart strong enough to pump,  arteries and veins that are able to constrict or squeeze, and  enough blood and fluid within the vessels.  Adrenaline (from the sympathetic nervous system) allows the body to respond to stress. Imagine seeing a bear in the woods; your heart beats faster, your palms get sweaty, your eyes dilate, and your hair stands on end.  Acetylcholine is the chemical that is the anti-adrenaline and is involved in the parasympathetic nervous system. 
 When the body moves to a standing position, pressure monitors (baroreceptor cells) located in the carotid arteries and 
the aorta sense a subtle drop in blood pressure because of gravity, which causes blood to flow towards the legs.  Almost immediately, the sympathetic system is stimulated, causing the heart rate to increase, the heart muscle to contract or squeeze more forcefully, and blood vessels to constrict or narrow.  All of these actions serve to increase the blood pressure so that an adequate amount of blood can still be pumped to the brain and other organs.  Without these changes, gravity would cause the blood to remain in the lowest part of the body and away from the brain, causing symptoms 
of lightheadedness or even passing out."
What are the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension?,"'When the brain does not get enough blood supply, it begins to shut down.''Symptoms include:''There may also be weakness, blurred vision, and shaking or tremulousness.''These symptoms may resolve quickly as the body slowly adjusts to the standing position, but in some cases the patient has to sit or lie down quickly to prevent passing out or falling.'   lightheadedness,  confusion,  nausea, and  fainting or passing out. "
What are the risk factors for orthostatic hypotension?,"'Orthostatic hypotension most often occurs in the elderly. ""''Hardening of the arteries''"" or ''atherosclerosis'' that develops as we age makes it more difficult for blood vessels to adapt quickly when necessary. As well, many of the diseases that are associated with orthostatic hypotension are progressive, with symptoms worsening with age.''Pregnancy'' is associated with orthostatic hypotension. As the pregnancy progresses, the volume of the circulatory system expands and blood pressure tends to fall. This may lead to lightheadedness when standing quickly. Blood pressure levels return to normal after delivery.''Excessive sweating'' due to physical exertion and exposure to heat are risk factors and potential causes of dehydration and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Patients who have other risk factors to develop orthostatic hypotension have an increased risk if they become even mildly dehydrated.''Chronic ''alcohol'' use and ''drug abuse'' are also risk factors for developing symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.' "
What causes orthostatic hypotension?,"'Orthostatic hypotension has many potential causes, some affecting only one part of the system that supplies blood to the brain, and others affecting two or three.''Loss of fluid within the blood vessels is the most common reason to develop the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. The fluid may be water or blood depending upon the cause.''A ''vasovagal episode'' is a condition that may occur when a stimulus causes excess activation of the parasympathetic system, slowing the heart rate and dilating blood vessels. Symptoms of lightheadedness or fainting then occur due to the lowering of blood pressure and decrease in blood flow to the brain. The stimulus may be pain from an injury such as a ''broken bone'', or there may be a psychologic trigger, such as a medical student watching a first operation. The vagus nerve that causes this response may also in some cases be triggered by urinating (micturition syncope) or by pushing hard to have a bowel movement.''Patients with ''diabetes'' may develop ''peripheral neuropathy'' that can affect nerves of the autonomic nervous system, and as a result, may develop orthostatic hypotension. As well, patients with poorly-controlled ''diabetes'' have the potential of becoming dehydrated.''Some patients may develop post-prandial lightheadedness, meaning that symptoms occur after a heavy meal. In this case, the body dilates blood vessels to the stomach and intestine to help with ''digestion'', leaving less blood available to flow to the brain.'""Addison's Disease""', or ''adrenal insufficiency'', may also be associated with the inability of the body to compensate for position change.''There are a variety of reasons that ''heart disease'' may cause orthostatic hypotension. Abnormalities of the electrical conduction system including heart rates that are too slow or too fast may cause changes in blood pressure. Patients with heart valve disorders, ''heart failure'', and ''heart attack'' may all experience orthostatic hypotension.''Disorders of the nervous system may also cause orthostatic hypotension. Examples include ''Parkinsonism'', ''amyloidosis'', and Shy-Drager Syndrome (or multiple system atrophy).''Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome'' describes the feeling of lightheadedness, ''nausea'', ''fatigue'', and weakness associated with an elevated heart rate (greater than 120 beats per minute) that begins within 10 minutes of a heads-up tilt table test. It is often seen in younger females between the ages of 12 and 50, and there may be a relationship with ''chronic fatigue syndrome''.'   Dehydration occurs when fluid intake cannot match the amount of fluid lost by the body. Vomiting, 
 diarrhea, fever, and heat-related illnesses (for example, heat exhaustion or 
 heat stroke) are common reasons a person loses a significant amount of fluid. Diuretics or water pills used to control high blood pressure are also another cause of a decreased amount of fluid in the body. Blood loss and other causes of anemia decrease the number of red blood cells that carry oxygen in the bloodstream, and this may lead to the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. The bleeding may arise from one large event or may occur slowly over a period of time. With slow bleeding, the body may be able to compensate, replacing the lost volume of red blood cells with water in the bloodstream. However, after a while the loss of oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood will cause symptoms to develop. In addition to lightheadedness, there may be weakness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Medications that affect the autonomic nervous system may also cause orthostatic hypotension.  Beta blocker medications such as metoprolol (Inderal) block the beta-adrenergic receptors in the body, preventing the heart from speeding up, preventing the heart from contracting as forcefully, and dilating blood vessels. All three of these effects affect the ability of the body to react to position changes. Aside from high blood pressure and heart disease, these medications are also used for headache control and anxiety prevention. sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis) dilate blood vessels, and this class of medication may cause orthostatic hypotension. The effect can be magnified if taken with nitrates, medications used to treat angina [for example, nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, Nitroquick, Nitrolingual, Nitro-Dur, Minitran, Nitro-Bid and others), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, Ismo, Monoket)], alcohol, or narcotic pain medications. Other medications used for high blood pressure control may be a potential cause of orthostatic hypotension, even if taken as prescribed. Orthostatic hypotension is a side effect of many psychiatric medications, including tricyclic antidepressants [amitriptyline (Endep, Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl), phenothiazines (Thorazine, Mellaril, Compazine), and MAO inhibitors (Nardil, Parnate)"
When should I call the doctor for orthostatic hypotension?,"'Feeling faint or lightheaded is not normal. While a rare episode that can be explained by circumstances, such as working or exercising in the heat, may be ignored, more frequent occurrences should be investigated. ''If a person passes out and is unconscious, even for a short period of time, is never normal and medical care should be accessed.' "
How is orthostatic hypotension diagnosed?,"'The key to the diagnosis is a good history and physical examination. The health care practitioner will want to know the circumstances that are associated with the symptoms of lightheadedness or passing out, since the patient is unlikely to have taken their blood pressure and checked their pulse rate in the midst of the episode.''The symptoms tend to be transient and resolve quickly. Should there be concern that the vital signs will change with position, the health care practitioner will take the blood pressure in both lying and standing positions and look for changes. It is advisable to pump up the cuff first, then have the patient stand, and then begin to release the pressure.''According to the American Academy of Neurology, the formal diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension requires a 20mm drop in systolic blood pressure or a 10mm drop in diastolic blood pressure within three minutes of standing. Often there is an associated increase in the heart rate, especially if dehydration or bleeding is the cause (if the patient is taking a beta blocker, the heart rate may not be able to respond with an increase).''Blood tests may be ordered to look for the underlying cause. These may include a red blood cell count (''CBC'') to access for anemia or bleeding. ''Electrolytes'' may be checked, especially if there has been a history of fluid loss through ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea'', since sodium and potassium abnormalities may be an issue. Kidney function may be assessed.''If the physical examination reveals concern about the heart, an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') may be done to evaluate electrical conduction and heart rhythm. An ''echocardiogram'' or ''ultrasound of the heart'' may be ordered to evaluate the heart valves and assess the function of the heart muscle. A ''stress'' test may be considered if there is concern about ''coronary artery disease''.''A heads-up tilt table test may be ordered if the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension continue to recur but it has been difficult to document abnormalities in blood pressure readings. During the test, the patient is strapped flat on a table, and as the table gradually is tilted to a 70 or 80 degree angle, continuous blood pressure and heart rate readings are taken. The patient may be left on the table for more than 10 minutes to look for the delayed changes seen in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.''For many patients, the diagnosis may be made based upon the history and physical examination, and no further testing may be needed.'  "
What is the treatment for orthostatic hypotension?,"'The treatment for orthostatic hypotension depends upon the underlying diagnosis. If the cause is dehydration, then fluid replacement will resolve the symptoms. If it is due to medication, then an adjustment of the dose or change in the type of medicine taken may be required.''Compression stockings may be considered to help prevent fluid from pooling in the legs when a person is sitting or lying down. This allows for more blood flow to be available to the brain when changes in position occur.''Medications may be of use, again depending upon the underlying cause of the orthostatic hypotension. For those who are otherwise healthy and have no specific illness that must be treated, increased salt and fluid intake may be recommended. ''Caffeine'' and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications for example, ''ibuprofen'' may also be suggested.''Some patients may be a candidate for ''fludrocortisone'' (''Florinef'') to increase the volume of fluid in the blood vessels. Fludrocortisone is an adrenergic (adrenaline-mimicking) drug, which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. This medication does have significant side effects, including lowering magnesium and potassium levels in the blood, ''headache'', swelling, and ''weight gain''.' "
What are the complications of orthostatic hypotension?,"'Falling is the most important complication of orthostatic hypotension. Most often, the symptoms are transient and self- limiting, giving the patient a chance to sit down, but when the drop in blood pressure causes syncope (fainting) or near syncope, it is the ''trauma'' that is sustained in the fall that causes the most damage.' "
How can orthostatic hypotension be prevented?,"'Since dehydration is the most common cause of orthostatic hypotension, it is important to minimize the risk by keeping adequately hydrated. This is especially important if an individual works or exercises in a hot environment. Fluid lost from vomiting, ''diarrhea'', and other illnesses that are associated with a ''fever'' should be replaced as best as possible.''Patients taking new medications that may affect the autonomic nervous system should be aware of the potential for orthostatic hypotension and report any symptoms to their health care practitioner.'

What are Osgood-Schlatter disease causes and risk factors?,"'It is felt that ''stress'' on the tibia by the patellar tendon tugging on its attachment site during activities involving the quadriceps muscle group (the large muscles of the thigh) predisposes one to the development of Osgood-Schlatter disease. Therefore, jumping activities and prolonged running are risk factors for developing Osgood-Schlatter disease.' "
What are symptoms of Osgood-Schlatter disease?,"'Osgood-Schlatter disease is felt to be due to recurrent pulling tension of the patellar tendon by the large muscles (quadriceps) of the front of the thigh.

What is Paget's disease?,"'Paget\'s disease is a chronic condition of bone characterized by disorder of the normal bone remodeling process. Normal bone has a balance of forces that act to lay down new bone and take up old bone. This relationship (referred to as ""bone remodeling"") is essential for maintaining the normal calcium levels in our blood. In bone affected by Paget\'s disease, one or more localized areas of bone are affected by abnormal bone remodeling, which is disturbed and not synchronized. As a result, the bone that is formed is abnormal, enlarged, not as dense, brittle, and prone to breakage (''fracture'').'""Paget's disease affects older skeletal bone of adults. It's estimated that 1% of adults in the U.S. have Paget's disease. There is also an extremely rare form of Paget's disease in children, referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. Paget's disease is also known as osteitis deformans and Paget disease."" "
What are the types of Paget's disease?,"'There are two types of '""Paget's disease of bone"""". When a single site of bone is affected by Paget's disease, it is referred to as the monostotic type. When multiple sites of bone are affected by Paget's disease, it is referred to as the polyostotic type."" "
What causes Paget's disease?,"""It is not known what causes Paget's disease. Paget's disease is felt to be a disease of a particular cell that is responsible for bone resorption, the osteoclast."" "
What are risk factors for Paget's disease?,"""The onset of Paget's disease is typically after 55 years of age. Recently, certain genes have been associated with Paget's disease, including the Sequestrosome 1 gene on chromosome 5. Virus infection may be necessary to trigger Paget's disease in people who have ""'inherited'"" the genetic tendency to develop the condition by having these genes. Paget's disease is inherited in approximately one-third of patients. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a patient with the condition to have a family history of the disease."" "
Who discovered Paget's disease?,"""Paget's disease is named after the English surgeon Sir James Paget, who described the condition in 1877. Paget also discovered the worm that causes ""'trichinosis'' and described what is called '""Paget's disease of the breast""'. Together with Rudolph Virchow in Germany, Paget was one of the founders of pathology.' "
What are Paget's disease symptoms and signs?,"""Paget's disease causes no symptoms in a majority of those with the condition and is often incidentally noted when X-ray tests are obtained for other reasons. However, Paget's disease can cause bone pain, deformity, fracture, and ""'arthritis'"". The bone pain of Paget's disease is located in the affected area of bone. The most common bones affected by Paget's disease include the spine, the thigh bone (femur), the pelvis, the skull, the collarbone (clavicle), and the upper arm bone (humerus). Fractures can occur because affected bone is not as strong as normal bone. Arthritis occurs because of the deformity of affected bone adjacent to the joint and because of bowing of affected long bones. The type of arthritis that results is ""'osteoarthritis''.'""The symptoms of Paget's disease depend on the bones affected and the severity of the disease. Enlarged bones can pinch adjacent nerves, causing tingling and numbness. Bowing of the legs can occur. Hip or knee involvement can lead to arthritis, ""'limping'', as well as pain and ''stiffness'' of the hip or knee. ''Headache'', ''loss of vision'', and ''hearing loss'"" can occur when bones of the skull are affected. With very widespread Paget's disease, it is possible to develop ""'congestive heart failure'' due to an increased workload on the ''heart''. Sometimes the skin overlying the involved bone is warmer than usual. This is because of the increased blood supply to pagetic bone.'  "
What specialties of doctors diagnose and treat Paget's disease?,"""Paget's disease is treated by generalists, including general and family medicine doctors and internists, as well as specialists including ""'rheumatologists'', orthopedic surgeons, and otolaryngologists (ENT physicians) for ''hearing'"" loss. Frequently, the care of individuals with Paget's disease is a coordinated effort between several health care professionals depending on its location, symptoms, and complications."" "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of Paget's disease?,"""Health care professionals make a diagnosis of Paget's disease based on the X-ray appearance. Doctors also may detect Paget's disease with other imaging tests, such as a ""'bone scan'', ''MRI'' scan, and ''CT scan'' to make a diagnosis. ''Alkaline phosphatase'"", an enzyme that comes from bone, is frequently elevated in the blood of people with Paget's disease as a result of the abnormal bone turnover of actively remodeling bone. This blood test is also referred to as the serum ""'alkaline phosphatase'"" (SAP) and is used to monitor the results of treatment of Paget's disease.""""The bone scan is particularly helpful in determining the extent of the involvement of Paget's disease as it provides an image of the entire skeleton. Bone that is affected by Paget's disease can easily be identified with bone scanning images. A bone biopsy is generally not necessary to make the diagnosis of Paget's disease. Bone biopsy would be considered if there was a suspicion of ""'cancer'' or abnormal lesion in the involved bone.' "
What is the medical treatment for Paget's disease?,"""The medical treatment of Paget's disease is directed toward controlling the disease activity and managing its complications. When Paget's disease causes no symptoms and blood testing shows that the level of serum alkaline phosphatase is normal or minimally elevated, no treatment may be necessary. Bone pain can require anti-inflammatory ""'drugs'' (''NSAIDs'"") or pain-relieving medicines. Bone deformity can require supports such as heel lifts or specialized footwear. Surgery may be necessary for damaged joints, fractures, severely deformed bones, or when nerves are being pinched by enlarged bone. Prior to undergoing surgery on bone affected by Paget's disease, it is helpful for doctors to treat patients with medications, such as bisphosphonates or ""'calcitonin'' (Miacalcin), as this tends to diminish the risk of surgical complications, including bleeding.'""The medical treatment of the bone of Paget's disease involves either medicines called bisphosphonates or injectable calcitonin. Doctors more commonly use these drugs to treat certain patients with ""'osteoporosis'"". Paget's disease is not related to ""'osteoporosis'"", however. Furthermore, the dosing of the medications are different for Paget's disease and ""'osteoporosis''.'""Bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment for Paget's disease of bone. There are a number of medicines available that are taken by mouth, including ""'alendronate'' (''Fosamax''), ''risedronate'' (''Actonel''), ''etidronate'' (''Didronel''), and ''tiludronate'' (''Skelid''), and that are administered intravenously, including pamidronate (''Aredia'') and zoledronate (''Reclast''). In general, oral bisphosphonates are taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with 8 ounces of water; the medicine can cause irritation of the stomach and ''esophagus'' and are usually avoided in those patients with ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''). Intravenous bisphosphonates can be given to those with ''GERD''. Intravenous bisphosphonates can cause temporary muscle and ''joint pain'' but are not associated with irritation of the stomach or esophagus.'  "
Are there home remedies for Paget's disease?,"""There are no specific home remedies for Paget's disease of bone. Topical pain salves, ""'over-the-counter'' pain relievers, orthopedic support devices, including canes and splints, all can be helpful in certain patients.' "
What are complications of Paget's disease?,"""Complications of Paget's disease include bone pain, fracture of bone, deformity, nerve irritation (impingement), arthritis, localized skin warmth, and rarely, sarcoma, a form of ""'bone cancer''. Sarcoma of bone is also referred to as ''osteosarcoma'"" and is rare (less than 1% of patients with the condition). Abnormalities of calcium and phosphorus balance are common. Bleeding can occur during surgery, when affected bone is operated on, because of an increased blood supply to the bone. When Paget's disease affects the area of the skull adjacent to the nerves of hearing, it can sometimes lead to hearing loss due to pressure on the nerves."" "
What is the prognosis for Paget's disease?,"""The outlook is generally good, particularly if treatment is given before major changes in the affected bones have occurred. Paget's disease occurs most frequently in the spine, skull, pelvis, and the long bones of the thighs and lower legs. In general, symptoms progress slowly. Paget's disease is not a ""'bone cancer'"", and the disease does not spread to normal bones. Overall health of the patient is usually not affected by Paget's disease. Treatment can control Paget's disease and lessen symptoms, but treatment does not cure Paget's disease. Sarcoma form of bone ""'cancer'', though rare, can seriously affect overall health.' "

Facts you should know about osteoarthritis," Osteoarthritis is a joint inflammation that results from cartilage degeneration. Degenerative joint disease is another name for osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis can be caused by aging, heredity, and injury from trauma or disease. The most common symptom of osteoarthritis is pain in the affected joint(s) after repetitive use. Other osteoarthritis symptoms and signs includeswollen joints,joint stiffness,joint creaking, andloss of range of motion. swollen joints, joint stiffness, joint creaking, and loss of range of motion. There is no blood test for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. The goal of treatment in osteoarthritis is to reduce joint pain and inflammation while improving and maintaining joint function."
What is osteoarthritis?,"'Osteoarthritis is a form of ''arthritis'' that features the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints. Cartilage is a protein substance that serves as a ""cushion"" between the bones of the joints. Among the over 100 different types of arthritis conditions, osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease. OA occurs more frequently as we age. Before age 45, osteoarthritis occurs more frequently in males. After 55 years of age, it occurs more frequently in females. In the United States, all races appear equally affected. Hand osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, and knee osteoarthritis are much more common in seniors than younger people. A higher incidence of osteoarthritis exists in the Japanese population, while South-African blacks, East Indians, and Southern Chinese have lower rates. Osteoarthritis is abbreviated as OA or referred to as degenerative arthritis or degenerative joint disease (DJD).''Osteoarthritis commonly affects''Osteoarthritis usually has no known cause and is referred to as primary osteoarthritis. When the cause of the osteoarthritis is known, the condition is referred to as secondary OA.'   the hands, feet, spine, and large weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees."
What causes osteoarthritis?,"'Primary (idiopathic) osteoarthritis, OA not resulting from injury or disease, is partly a result of natural ''aging'' of the joint.''Secondary osteoarthritis is a form of osteoarthritis that is caused by another disease or condition. Conditions that can lead to secondary osteoarthritis include''Obesity causes osteoarthritis by increasing the mechanical ''stress'' on the joint and therefore on the cartilage. In fact, next to aging, obesity is the most significant risk factor for osteoarthritis of the knees. The early development of osteoarthritis of the knees among weight lifters is believed to be in part due to their high body weight. Repeated trauma to joint tissues (ligaments, bones, and cartilage) is believed to lead to early osteoarthritis of the knees in soccer players and army military personnel. Interestingly, health studies have not found an increased risk of osteoarthritis in long-distance runners.''Crystal deposits in the cartilage can cause cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis. Uric acid crystals cause arthritis in ''gout'', while calcium pyrophosphate crystals cause arthritis in ''pseudogout''.''Some people are born with abnormally formed joints (congenital abnormalities) that are vulnerable to mechanical wear, causing early degeneration and loss of joint cartilage. Osteoarthritis of the hip joints is commonly related to structural abnormalities of these joints that had been present since birth.''Hormone disturbances, such as ''diabetes'' and growth hormone disorders, are also associated with early cartilage wear and secondary osteoarthritis.' With aging, the water content of the cartilage increases, and the protein makeup of cartilage degenerates as a function of biologic processes. Eventually, cartilage begins to degenerate by flaking or forming tiny crevasses. In advanced osteoarthritis, there is a total loss of the cartilage cushion between the bones of the joints. Repetitive use of the worn joints over the years can mechanically irritate and inflame the cartilage, causing joint pain and swelling. Loss of the cartilage cushion causes friction between the bones, leading to pain and limitation of joint mobility. Inflammation of the cartilage can also stimulate new bone outgrowths (spurs, also referred to as osteophytes) to form around the joints. Osteoarthritis occasionally can develop in multiple members of the same family, implying a hereditary (genetic) basis for this condition. Osteoarthritis is therefore felt to be a result of a combination of each of the above factors that ultimately lead to a narrowing of the cartilage in the affected joint. obesity, repeated trauma or surgery to the joint structures, abnormal joints at birth (congenital abnormalities), gout, diabetes, hemochromatosis, and other hormone disorders."
What are osteoarthritis symptoms and signs?,"'Osteoarthritis is a disease that is isolated to the cartilage of the joints. Unlike many other forms of arthritis that are systemic illnesses (conditions that affect multiple areas of the body apart from the joints), such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and systemic ''lupus'', osteoarthritis does not affect other organs of the body. The most common symptom of osteoarthritis is pain in the affected joint(s) after repetitive use. This can lead to''Joint pain of osteoarthritis is usually worse later in the day. There can be''Pain and ''stiffness'' of the joints can also occur after long periods of inactivity (for example, sitting in a theater). In severe osteoarthritis, complete loss of the cartilage cushion causes friction between bones, causing pain even at rest or pain with limited motion.''Symptoms of osteoarthritis vary greatly from patient to patient. Symptoms debilitate some patients. On the other hand, others may have remarkably few symptoms in spite of dramatic degeneration of the joints apparent on ''X-rays''. Osteoarthritis can cause joint deformity as asymmetric cartilage loss in the joint leads to malalignment of a digit or limb. Symptoms also can be intermittent. It is not unusual for patients with osteoarthritis of the finger joints of the hands and knees to have years of pain-free intervals between symptoms. Osteoarthritis can lead to creaking (crepitus) of the joint, especially when severe cartilage loss leaves a joint ""bone-on-bone"" with little cartilage cushioning the joint during movement.''Osteoarthritis of the knees is often associated with excess upper body weight, with obesity, or a history of repeated injury and/or joint surgery. Progressive cartilage degeneration of the knee joints can lead to deformity and outward curvature of the knees, which is referred to as being ""bowlegged."" People with osteoarthritis of the weight-bearing joints (such as the knees) can develop a limp. The ''limping'' during load-bearing can worsen as more cartilage degenerates. In some patients, the pain, limping, and joint dysfunction may not respond to medications or other conservative measures. Therefore, severe osteoarthritis of the knees is one of the most common reasons for ''total knee replacement'' medical procedures in the United States.''Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine or lumbar spine causes pain in the neck or low back. Bony spurs, called osteophytes, that form along the arthritic spine can irritate spinal nerves, causing severe pain that can radiate from the spine as well as numbness and tingling of the affected parts of the body.'""Osteoarthritis causes the formation of hard, bony enlargements of the small joints of the fingers. Classic bony enlargement of the small joint at the end of the fingers is called a Heberden's node, named after a famous British doctor. The bony deformity is a result of the ""'bone spurs'"" from the osteoarthritis in that joint. Another common bony knob (node) occurs at the middle joint of the fingers in many patients with osteoarthritis and is called a Bouchard's node. Dr. Bouchard was a famous French doctor who also studied arthritis patients in the late 1800s. Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes may not be painful, but they are often associated with limitation of motion of the joint. The characteristic appearances of these finger nodes can be helpful in diagnosing osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis of the joint at the base of the big toe of the foot leads to the formation of a ""'bunion''. Osteoarthritis of the fingers and the toes may have a genetic basis and can be found in numerous female members of some families.'

How do health care professionals diagnose osteoarthritis?,"'There is no blood test for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Blood tests are performed to exclude diseases that can cause secondary osteoarthritis, as well as to exclude other arthritis conditions that can mimic osteoarthritis.' X-rays of the affected joints can be used to diagnose osteoarthritis. The common X-ray findings of osteoarthritis include loss of joint cartilage, narrowing of the joint space between adjacent bones, and bone spur formation. Simple X-ray testing can also be very helpful to exclude other causes of pain in a particular joint as well as assisting the decision-making as to when surgical intervention might be considered. Arthrocentesis is a procedure to remove joint fluid that is often performed in a health care professional's office. During arthrocentesis, a sterile needle is used to remove joint fluid for analysis. Joint fluid analysis is useful in excluding gout, infection, and other causes of arthritis. Removal of joint fluid and injection of corticosteroids into the joints during arthrocentesis can help relieve pain, swelling, and inflammation. Arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a viewing tube into the joint space. Abnormalities of and damage to the cartilage and ligaments can be detected and sometimes repaired through the arthroscope. If successful, patients can recover from the arthroscopic surgery much more quickly than from open joint surgery. Finally, a careful analysis of the location, duration, and character of the joint symptoms and the appearance of the joints helps the doctor in diagnosing osteoarthritis. Bony enlargement of the joints from spur formations is characteristic of osteoarthritis. Therefore, the presence of Heberden's nodes, Bouchard's nodes, and bunions of the feet can indicate to the doctor a diagnosis of osteoarthritis."
Osteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis: What is the difference?," Osteoarthritis is a chronic joint disorder of cartilage.It is not a systemic disease.It is not an autoimmune disease. It is not a systemic disease. It is not an autoimmune disease. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, therefore, it features a misdirected immune system that attacks body tissues (particularly the joint lining tissue called synovium).Rheumatoid arthritis is also a systemic disease.Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis can attack tissues throughout the body beyond affected joints, including the lungs, eyes, and skin. Rheumatoid arthritis is also a systemic disease. Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis can attack tissues throughout the body beyond affected joints, including the lungs, eyes, and skin."
What are 22 osteoarthritis home remedies and treatment options?,"'Aside from weight reduction and avoiding activities that exert excessive ''stress'' on the joint cartilage, there is no specific medical treatment to halt cartilage degeneration or to repair damaged cartilage in osteoarthritis. There is no medication to stop osteoarthritis (disease-modifying medication). The goal of treatment in osteoarthritis is to reduce joint pain and inflammation while improving and maintaining joint function.''Some patients with osteoarthritis have minimal or no pain and may not need treatment. Others may benefit from conservative measures such as''These measures are particularly important when large, weight-bearing joints are involved, such as the hips or knees. In fact, even modest weight reduction can help to decrease symptoms of osteoarthritis of the large joints, such as the knees and hips. Medications are used to complement the physical measures described above. Medication may be used topically, taken orally, or injected into the joints to decrease joint inflammation and pain. When conservative measures fail to control pain and improve joint function, surgery can be considered.''Resting sore joints decreases stress on the joints and relieves pain and swelling. Patients are asked to simply decrease the intensity and/or frequency of the activities that consistently cause joint pain.''Physical activity usually does not aggravate osteoarthritis when performed at levels that do not cause joint pain. ''Exercise'' is helpful for relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis in several ways, including strengthening the muscular support around the joints. It also prevents the joints from ""freezing up"" and improves and maintains joint mobility. Finally, it promotes weight reduction and endurance. Applying local heat before and ''cold'' packs after exercise can help relieve pain and inflammation. ''Swimming'' is particularly well suited for patients with osteoarthritis because it allows patients to exercise with minimal impact stress to the joints. Other popular exercises include''Aside from physical therapy, physical therapists can provide support devices, such as splints, canes, walkers, and ''braces''. These medical devices can be helpful in reducing stress on the joints. Occupational therapy can assess the demands of daily activities and suggest additional devices that may help people at work or home. Finger splints can support individual joints of the fingers. The following measures can help ease hand symptoms:''Spine symptoms can improve with a neck collar, lumbar corset, or a firm mattress, depending on what areas are involved.''In many patients with osteoarthritis, mild pain relievers such as ''aspirin'' and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') may be sufficient treatment. Studies have shown that acetaminophen given in adequate doses for pain relief can often be equally as effective as prescription anti-inflammatory medications in relieving pain in osteoarthritis of the knees. Since acetaminophen has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than ''NSAIDS'' (see below), especially among elderly people, acetaminophen is generally the preferred initial drug given to patients with osteoarthritis. Medicine to relax muscles in spasm might also be given temporarily. Pain-relieving creams applied to the skin over the joints can provide relief of minor arthritis pain. Examples of pain-relieving creams include''Topical treatments applied to the skin surface surrounding the joint affected by osteoarthritis include''Each of these provide some relief from osteoarthritis pain.''Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (NSAIDs) are medications that are used to reduce pain and inflammation in the joints. Examples of NSAIDs include''It is sometimes possible to use NSAIDs temporarily and then discontinue them for periods of time without recurrent symptoms, thereby decreasing the risk of side effects.''The most common side effects of NSAIDs involve gastrointestinal distress, such as stomach upset, cramping ''diarrhea'', ulcers, and even bleeding. The risk of these and other side effects increases in the elderly. Newer NSAIDs called ''COX-2 inhibitors'' have been designed that have less toxicity to the stomach and bowels. Because osteoarthritis symptoms vary and can be intermittent, these medicines might be given only when ''joint pains'' occur or prior to activities that have traditionally brought on symptoms.''Some studies, but not all, have suggested that alternative treatment with the food ''supplements'' ''glucosamine'' and chondroitin can relieve symptoms of pain and stiffness for some people with osteoarthritis. These ''supplements'' are available in pharmacies and health-food stores without a prescription, although there is no certainty about the purity of the products or the dose of the active ingredients because they are not monitored by the U.S. FDA. The National Institutes of Health studied glucosamine in the treatment of the pain of osteoarthritis. Their initial research demonstrated only a minor benefit in relieving pain for those with the most severe osteoarthritis, and in most patients, there was no benefit greater than that from placebo pills. Further studies, it is hoped, will clarify many issues regarding dosing, safety, and effectiveness of different formulations of glucosamine for osteoarthritis. Patients taking blood thinners should be careful when taking chondroitin as it can increase the blood thinning and cause excessive bleeding. Fish-oil supplements have been shown to have some anti-inflammatory properties, and increasing the dietary fish intake and/or taking fish-oil capsules (''omega-3'' capsules) can sometimes reduce the inflammation of arthritis.''While oral cortisone is generally not used in treating osteoarthritis, when injected directly into the inflamed joints, it can rapidly decrease pain and restore function. Since repetitive cortisone injections can be harmful to the tissues and bones, they are reserved for patients with more pronounced symptoms.''For persisting pain of severe osteoarthritis of the knee that does not respond to weight reduction, exercise, or medications, a series of injections of ''hyaluronic acid'' (''Synvisc'', ''Hyalgan'', Orthovisc, Supartz, Euflexxa, and others) into the joint can sometimes be helpful, especially if surgery is not being considered. These products seem to work by temporarily restoring the thickness of the joint fluid, allowing better joint lubrication and impact capability, and perhaps by directly affecting pain receptors.''Surgery is generally reserved for those patients with osteoarthritis that is particularly severe and unresponsive to the conservative treatments. Arthroscopy, discussed above, can be helpful when cartilage tears or loose pieces of cartilage are suspected. Osteotomy is a bone-removal procedure that can help realign some of the deformity in selected patients, usually those with certain forms of knee disease. Severely degenerated joints may be best treated by fusion (arthrodesis) or replacement with an artificial joint (joint replacement, or arthroplasty). Total hip and total knee replacements are now commonly performed in community hospitals throughout the United States.

What is the best treatment for osteoarthritis (OA)?,"'The ideal steps to take should lead to a proper diagnosis and an optimal long-term treatment plan. While many steps are described here, the plan must be customized for each person affected by osteoarthritis, depending on the joints affected and the severity of symptoms.''An opinion regarding the cause or the type of the arthritis can often be adequately obtained by consulting a general family doctor. It is often unnecessary to see an arthritis specialist (''rheumatologist''), like myself, for this purpose. However, if the diagnosis or treatment plan is unclear, a rheumatologist might be consulted.'""When I determine that a patient has a classic node formation from osteoarthritis (Heberden's node), I may make the diagnosis solely based upon the examination, without the need for any additional tests, such as blood or X-ray testing. Sometimes, testing can be helpful to better understand the degree and character of the osteoarthritis affecting a certain joint. It can also be helpful for monitoring and to exclude other conditions.""'Treatment may not be necessary for osteoarthritis of the hands with minimal or no symptoms. When symptoms are troubling and persist, however, treatment might include pain and anti-inflammatory medications, with or without food supplements, such as glucosamine and/or chondroitin. Furthermore, heat/cold applications and topical pain creams can be helpful.''As a first step, I recommend that patients go ahead and try the ''over-the-counter'' food supplements glucosamine and chondroitin. Each of these health supplements has been shown by some studies to relieve the pain and stiffness of some (but not all) patients with osteoarthritis. These supplements are available in pharmacies and health-food stores without a prescription. If patients do not benefit after a two-month trial, I suggest that they discontinue these supplements. Of note, the manufacturers sometimes make claims that these supplements ""rebuild"" cartilage. This claim has not been adequately verified by scientific studies to date.''For another type of dietary supplementation, it should be noted that fish oils have been shown to have some anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, increasing the dietary fish intake and/or ''fish oil'' capsules (omega-3 capsules) can sometimes reduce the inflammation of arthritis. There is some evidence that ''vitamin D'' supplementation can reduce ''joint swelling'' of osteoarthritis.''Obesity has long been known to be a risk factor for osteoarthritis of the knee. I recommend weight reduction for patients who are ''overweight'' with early signs of osteoarthritis of the hands, because they are at a risk for also developing osteoarthritis of their knees. Foods to avoid include those that promote ''weight gain''. As described above, even modest weight reduction can be helpful.''Pain medications that are available over the counter, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), can be very helpful in relieving the pain symptoms of mild osteoarthritis. I recommend these as the first-line medication treatment. Studies have shown that acetaminophen, given in adequate doses, can often be equally as effective as prescription anti-inflammatory medications in relieving pain in osteoarthritis of the knees. Since acetaminophen has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), especially in elderly patients, acetaminophen is generally the preferred initial drug given to patients with osteoarthritis. If symptoms persist, then I recommend trials of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (''Advil'', Motrin IB, ''Nuprin''), ''ketoprofen'' (Orudis), and naproxen (''Aleve''). Many patients do best when they take these medications along with their glucosamine and chondroitin supplements.''Some patients get significant relief of pain symptoms by dipping their hands in hot wax (paraffin) dips in the morning. Hot wax can often be obtained at local pharmacies or medical supply stores. It can be prepared in a Crock-Pot and be reused after it hardens as a warm covering over the hands by peeling off and replacing it into the melted wax. Warm water soaks and nighttime cotton gloves (to keep the hands warm during ''sleep'') can also help ease hand symptoms. Performing gentle, low-impact range of motion exercises regularly can help to preserve function of the joints. These exercises are easiest to perform after early morning hand warming.''Pain-relieving creams that are applied to the skin over the joints can provide relief of daytime minor arthritis pain. Examples include capsaicin (ArthriCare, Zostrix), salicin (Aspercreme), methyl salicylate (Ben-Gay, Icy Hot), and menthol (Flexall). For additional relief of mild symptoms, local ice application can sometimes be helpful, especially toward the end of the day. Occupational therapists can assess daily activities and determine which additional types of therapy may help patients at work or home.''Finally, when arthritis symptoms persist, it is best to seek the advice of a health care professional who can properly guide the optimal management for each individual patient. Many other prescription medications are available for the treatment of osteoarthritis for patients with chronic, annoying symptoms.''In addition to the steps described above, pay attention to joint problems elsewhere in the body if one develops early signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hands.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with osteoarthritis?,"'The prognosis of patients with osteoarthritis depends on which joints are affected and whether or not they are causing symptoms and impaired function.' Some patients are unaffected by osteoarthritis while others can be severely disabled. Joint replacement surgery for some results in the best long-term outcome. Finally, if one is concerned that osteoarthritis could be lead to injury of the internal organs, don't be. Osteoarthritis does not cause internal organ damage or blood-test abnormalities."
Is it possible to prevent osteoarthritis?,'There is no ''prevention'' of osteoarthritis with the exception of avoiding joint injury.' 
What specialists treat osteoarthritis?,"'Osteoarthritis is treated by' general practitioners, family practitioners, internists, orthopedists, rheumatologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, orthotists, physiatrists, and other rehabilitation specialists."
What does the future hold for osteoarthritis?,"'In the future, medications may be available that protect the cartilage from the deteriorating consequences of osteoarthritis. Research into cartilage biology will eventually lead to new and exciting breakthroughs in the management of osteoarthritis.''Surgical innovation has led to a technique for the repair of isolated splits of cartilage (fissures) of the knee. In this procedure, a patient\'s own cartilage is actually grown in the laboratory, then inserted into the fissure area and sealed over with a ""patch"" of the patient\'s own bone covering the tissue. While this is not a procedure for the cartilage damage of osteoarthritis, it does open the door for future cartilage research. These and other developing areas hold promise for new approaches to an old problem.''Investigators at the National Institutes of Health have found that taking glucosamine did not significantly improve symptoms of osteoarthritis compared to placebo. Studies are under way to look at whether some glucosamine formulations may have advantages over others.''Research scientists have found that ''doxycycline'', a ''tetracycline'"" drug, slows the progression of cartilage degeneration in the knees of patients with osteoarthritis. This seems to be a result of the drug's effect on enzymes that destroy cartilage rather than on their properties as antibiotics. More studies and ""'clinical trials'' need to determine the significance of this interesting work and how specific treatments might be developed as a result.' "

What are the treatment options for osteoarthritis?,"'Painful swelling of the joints due to wear and tear over many years is called ''osteoarthritis''. ''Osteoarthritis'' may develop in any joint that includes the fingers, hips, and knees. Usually, the joints feel painful during moderate usage for patients with ''arthritis''. The cartilage (a rubbery tissue covering the ends of the bones) breaks down over time, leaving the bones without anything to cushion them. This causes them to rub against each other, resulting in ''pain'' and swelling. There are many treatment options available to curb the complications of arthritis.\xa0''Painkillers along with guided physical activity are usually considered the best treatment for arthritis in the early stages. However, if patients are unable to continue their daily activities, then the surgical option is recommended for relief.''Physical activity:'' Patients with arthritis have a hard time performing physical activities, but ''exercise''\xa0is the best thing that can relieve arthritis ''pain'' and lessen joint damage. ''Exercise'' can also help to ''lose weight''. That will put less ''stress'' on the joints. Exercises such as stretching, muscle strengthening, and ''swimming'' can help patients to keep fit. It also increases flexibility, range of motion, and lubrication in the joints. Exercises involving\xa0lifting weights\xa0can build muscle strength, which can help them to manage daily activities with moderate effort. Exercises also strengthen the ''heart'' and ''lungs'' and can reduce ''fatigue'' and increase patients’ stamina. Typical aerobic exercises such as ''walking'',\xa0''running'', riding a bicycle,\xa0and swimming can cut down calories. Walking and water aerobics are considered the best exercises for patients with arthritis.''Medications:'' Usually, a doctor may prescribe medications such as paracetamol, ''oxycodone'', ''hydrocodone'', ''ibuprofen'', and ''naproxen'' that may relieve pain and swelling.\xa0''Corticosteroid'' injections:'' Medications may relieve pain in the joint. During this procedure, the doctor numbs the area around the joints, then places a needle into space within the joints, and injects medication. The number of cortisone injections may be limited to three or four each year because the medication can worsen joint damage over time.''Lubrication injections:'' Injections of ''hyaluronic acid'' may offer pain relief by providing some cushioning in your knee. Hyaluronic acid is similar to a component normally found in your joint fluid.''Natural remedies:'' Some herbs and ''supplements'' (capsaicin,\xa0''flaxseed'',\xa0''ginger'', ''ginkgo'', and turmeric) may relieve arthritis. However, the most popular ones for pain relief are\xa0chondroitin sulfate\xa0and\xa0''glucosamine''. Both are made of compounds found in the cartilage. They may help your body regenerate the cartilage on the joints. Studies have shown that they may provide modest pain relief and could be tried if patients are unable to tolerate other pain medications. The American College of ''Rheumatology'' doesn’t currently recommend the use of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine. Other natural remedies include\xa0''acupuncture'',\xa0''massage'', heating pads, and ice packs. Reducing\xa0''stress''\xa0by maintaining a positive outlook may also help to reduce ''joint pain'' and swelling.''Physical therapy or rehabilitation:'' Physical therapists can work with patients on exercises to reduce pain and improve range of motion.''Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation'' (TENS):'' Treatment with TENS is usually arranged by a physiotherapist or doctor. It uses a machine that sends electrical impulses through sticky patches,\xa0called electrodes, attached to the skin. This may help ease the pain caused by osteoarthritis by numbing the nerve endings in the spinal cord that control pain.''Surgery:'' If patients have tried numerous remedies and got no relief or only a temporary reprieve, the doctor may suggest surgical options which include:' Joint repair: In this procedure, joint surfaces are usually smoothed or realigned to reduce pain and improve function. These types of procedures can often be performed arthroscopically through small incisions over the joint. Joint replacement: This procedure removes the damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one. The most commonly replaced joints are the hips and knees. Joint fusion: This procedure is more often used for smaller joints, such as those in the wrist, ankles, and fingers. It removes the ends of the two bones in the joints and then locks those ends together until they heal into one rigid unit."
Does osteoarthritis reduce life expectancy?,"'It is usually difficult to predict the course of arthritis, and life expectancy varies greatly on several factors. Arthritis can reduce a person’s life expectancy and quality of life, although many people live with their symptoms beyond the age of 80 or even 90 years. Factors affecting arthritis prognosis include age, disease progression, and lifestyle factors, such as ''smoking'' and weight. Due to advances in medications and other treatments, the prognosis for arthritis is better than ever before.' "
What is osteoarthritis? What is osteoporosis?,  The definition of osteoarthritis is degeneration of joint cartilage tissue and the underlying bone.  The definition of osteoporosis is a medical condition that results in bones becoming brittle and/or fragile.
Are osteoarthritis and osteoporosis forms of arthritis?,'Arthritis'' is defined as painful inflammation and ''joint stiffness''.''The most common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis and ''rheumatoid arthritis''.\xa0It is possible for one person to have both conditions.' Osteoarthritis is a type of arthritis that involves both the underlying tissue and the underlying bone of a joint.  Osteoporosis is mainly a loss of bone tissue that is not limited to the joint areas.
"Which one is more painful and worse, osteoarthritis or osteoporosis?","'Both conditions may be mild, moderate or severe, but because of the high risk of bone ''fractures'' with ''osteoporosis'', some doctors may consider ''osteoporosis'', especially if it is severe, to be the ""worse"" disease because of a high risk for other fractures.

Often a person with osteoporosis do not have symptoms until:' Pain in the joints like the hands, knee, hips, spine and/or neck Stiffness in joints Joint swelling, tenderness, bumps (bone spurs) Joint deformity Limping when walking Crackle sounds when joint is moved A bone fracture occurs  Porous bones are detected by bone density tests or seen incidentally in imaging tests like X-rays or CT. Height loss due to spinal bone compression fractures Severe back pain Change in posture Difficulty and/or the inability to walk"
What are the differences in the causes of osteoarthritis vs. osteoporosis?,"'The main differences in the causes of these diseases are:'  Osteoarthritis is mainly caused by overuse or ""wear and tear"" on the joints. Osteoarthritis may be categorized by stages 0-4, with 0 represents a normal joint and 4 represents severe disease. Osteoporosis is mainly caused by one or more underlying problems like calcium deficiency, vitamin D deficiency or hormonal changes. Osteoporosis typically has T - scores between -1.0 or above (normal) to -2.5 or below (diagnostic of osteoporosis) in a diagnostic bone density test."
What are the risk factors for osteoarthritis vs. osteoporosis? Are they inherited?,"'Osteoarthritis risk factors include:''Most of the risk factors for osteoporosis are the same as for osteoarthritis like older age, being female, and genetics (family history), but others include:\xa0' Older age Joint injuries Repeated stresses to joints  Obesity Bone deformities Genetics (family history) Being female Certain disease(s) like rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus Smoking Alcohol use Bone fracture after age 40 Lack of exercise Small and/or thin body Post menopause Low calcium and/or low vitamin D intake Other medical conditions like hyperthyroidism"
What procedures and tests diagnose osteoarthritis vs. osteoporosis?,"'Diagnosis of osteoarthritis includes:''There are no blood tests used to diagnose osteoarthritis.''Diagnosis of osteoporosis includes:\xa0' History Physical exam Imaging tests  History Physical exam Blood tests  Bone mineral density (BMD) test Possibly, bone biopsy  Conventional X-ray"
What natural home remedies relieve pain from osteoarthritis and osteoporosis?,"'Home remedies may help with symptom relief in either condition, but they are not effective at treating the underlying cause.\xa0''Natural home remedies that have been proposed or reported as having some benefit for pain relief of osteoarthritis include:''Home remedies for osteoporosis pain include:''Always check with your doctor before using home remedies. Scientific evidence for the use of specific ''supplements'' or herbal remedies may be minimal.''\xa0' Hot and cold compresses Epsom salt baths OTC (over-the-counter) medications Ginger Turmeric Green tea Regular exercise Healthy diet If obese, weight loss Diet intake of foods high in calcium and vitamin D Diet intake of plant estrogens Hot and cold compresses Braces and supports Acupuncture/acupressure Massage therapy"
What is the medical and surgical treatment for osteoarthritis and osteoporosis?,"'Basic treatments for osteoarthritis include ''NSAIDs'' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', for example, ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'' and other brands).\xa0''Some people with osteoarthritis may need narcotic treatment to relieve pain. Other people with osteoarthritis may need injections, for example;\xa0''Osteoporosis treatment that helps relieve pain, treat, and prevent the disease are a drug class called bisphosphonates, for example:''Osteoporosis also may be surgically treated with joint replacement surgery.'  corticosteroid injections, arthroscopy, and/or surgical joint replacement. Fosamax-Plus D (alendronate) Boniva (ibandronate) Actonel with calcium (risedronate) Reclast (zoledronic Acid)"
What is the prognosis for osteoarthritis and osteoporosis? Can they be cured?," There is no cure for osteoarthritis or osteoporosis.  The prognosis for osteoarthritis and osteoporosis is usually good to fair, but can range from good to poor, depending on the person's response to treatments and the severity of the disease. Osteoarthritis is a progressive disease that can be slowed, but in some patients with osteoporosis, the disease can be stopped with treatments. "
Can you prevent osteoarthritis or osteoporosis?," Osteoporosis may be slowed and/or prevented if diagnosed and treated with medicine (bisphosphonates) early in the disease. Osteoarthritis, although a degenerative disease, may be prevented in some people by not stressing their joints and exercising appropriately. "
What is osteoarthritis (OA)?,'Osteoarthritis'' (OA) is a chronic joint disorder featuring degeneration and inflammation of cartilage of one or many joints.' 
What is rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') is a chronic autoimmune joint disorder characterized by inflammation of the tissue (synovium) that lines the joints. Chronic inflammation of this tissue can lead to cartilage and bone destruction, as well as deformity of the involved joints. ''RA'', an autoimmune systemic disease, has the potential to cause injury to other organs, including the eyes, ''lungs'', and ''heart''.' "
What are the causes and risk factors for OA and RA?,"'OA can be primary (of unknown cause or spontaneous) or secondary (a result of injury or disease).''People can inherit primary OA. It can occur as the protein composition of cartilage degenerates due to biologic processes that lead to cartilage inflammation.''Another disease or condition causes secondary OA. Conditions that can lead to secondary OA included repeated joint ''trauma'', joint surgery, ''obesity'', abnormally designed joints at birth, ''gout'', ''hemochromatosis'', ''diabetes'', and other hormonal disorders.' "
How do the signs and symptoms of OA differ from those of RA?,"'OA may not cause any symptoms in an involved joint. OA can cause''OA may affect only a single joint. Because OA is not a systemic disease but a local joint problem, there are no systemic symptoms. As cartilage inflammation irritates adjacent bone, new bone can be stimulated to form resulting in bony out growths or spurs (''osteophytes''). These are visible with X-ray testing as is cartilage loss.''RA'' causes''Joints are often involved in a symmetrical fashion, involving both sides of the body. Because ''RA'' is a systemic disease, it can lead to ''fever'', ''fatigue'', and can cause injury to other organs, such as the ''lungs'', ''heart'', eyes, etc. Because the inflammation leads to bony destruction and weakens ligaments, ''RA'' eventually leads to permanent joint destruction and joint deformity. In ''RA'', X-ray testing can reveal characteristic bone damage called erosion.' joint pain, bony joint enlargement, joint warmth, tenderness, and eventual misalignment of involved joints. joint pain, joint warmth, joint swelling, joint stiffness (particularly morning stiffness), and joint tenderness, typically involving many joints."
What tests do doctors use to diagnose OA and RA?,"'Doctors can often clinically diagnose OA (with the history and physical examination). In order to determine the degree of OA, simple X-ray testing can note the amount of cartilage loss of the involved joint(s).''Doctors diagnose ''RA'' with a history and physical examination, as well as blood testing. Because ''RA'' is a systemic autoimmune disease, it is characterized by abnormally elevated blood tests for inflammation (sed rate or ''sedimentation rate'', ''C-reactive protein'', etc.), as well as abnormal markers specific to ''rheumatoid arthritis'', including the antibody ""''rheumatoid factor'' or RF."" X-ray testing can document joint damage, erosions, and bone thinning from the inflammation of RA.' "
How do treatment options and home remedies for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis differ?,"'For symptomatic OA, doctors commonly recommend ''over-the-counter'' ''pain'' relievers and sometimes ''fish oil'' or ''glucosamine'' chondroitin food supplementation. These include ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') and also anti-inflammatory medications such as the ''NSAIDs'' ''ibuprofen'' or ''naproxen'' in selected situations. There are no specific treatments for OA.''Doctors treat RA aggressively with medications that limit or stop the autoimmune inflammation. While ''over-the-counter'' ''pain'' relievers are sometimes used to supplement treatment, the basic treatment requires medications that must be monitored for benefit as well as any signs of toxicity. These medications include'  methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), sulfasalazine (Azulfadine), etanercept (Enbrel), abatacept (Humira), infliximab (Remicade), and many others."
How does the prognosis of OA compare to the prognosis for RA?,"'Both OA and RA can progress, though often slowly. In general, because OA is a process that is localized to the involved joint(s), it carries only the risk of progressive loss of joint function of that affected joint.''RA frequently causes progressive joint damage, destruction, and deformity if not treated. The prognosis of patients with RA depends upon its response to treatment, which can be dramatic, and what organs are affected throughout the body (lungs, heart, eyes, etc.).' "
Is it possible to prevent OA or RA?,'OA that is secondary to some degree could be prevented by avoiding joint injury and addressing any underlying disease or condition that could harm the cartilage of joints.''It is currently not possible to prevent RA. Perhaps in the future with genetic risk research this may become possible.' 
What are osteocytes?,"'Osteocytes\xa0are cells inside the bone. As osteoblasts mature, they become osteocytes. Osteoblasts turn into osteocytes while the new bone is being formed, and the osteocytes then get surrounded by the new bone.\xa0Once osteoblasts turn into osteocytes, they express different proteins and settle themselves into life as active bone regulatory cells. Osteocytes are the most abundant cell type in the bone, and they live about 25 years. Osteocytes function as part of the regulatory network that controls the\xa0body’s calcium and phosphate homeostasis.\xa0Osteocytes affect bone remodeling by producing regulatory factors to influence the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in response to endocrine signals including the blood level of ''vitamin D''. Osteocytes can sense pressures or cracks in the bone and help to direct where osteoclasts will dissolve the bone.' "
What is an osteochondral grafting of articular cartilage injuries?,"'Articular cartilage'' covers the bony ends of the joints throughout the body. Cartilage being smooth allows easy gliding of the joint. Cartilage may be damaged due to injury or degenerative diseases such as ''arthritis''.\xa0''A partial or full-thickness cartilage injury or erosion of the cartilage due to severe arthritis can lead to the exposure of the underlying bone.\xa0''Osteochondral grafting'' is a method of treating such conditions of cartilage damage where the underlying bone is exposed. The procedure is typically performed for weight-bearing joints such as the knees, but it may be performed for other joints too. The surgery is performed with the goal of restoring knee stability and achieving a ''pain''-free range of motion.''Transplants of autogenous or allogeneic osteochondral grafts have become popular due to the following reasons:' Autograft: A cartilage and bone from another site in the knee in the patient’s own body. Allograft: A tissue graft is obtained from a donor knee and made to fit the patient knee. They offer a possibility of true hyaline cartilage resurfacing. They can be performed in a single procedure. They are performed with reusable equipment. They do not require outside laboratory assistance. No screws or other devices are typically required to hold the graft as they fit tightly. It is ideal for younger patients and athletes as a replacement to the joint replacement surgery."
When should osteochondral grafts not be done?,"'The surgery may be contraindicated in the following conditions:' Serious underlying medical conditions Poor nutritional status Tumors Joint space diseases Secondary changes due to cartilage damage in degenerative joint disease Limitations to the amount of tissue that can be taken from within a patient’s own knee so larger areas of cartilage loss may not be optimal for this approach Global arthrosis (erosions or abnormalities at multiple sites of the joint) Older patients with degenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthritis, would benefit more by a joint replacement surgery."
How are osteochondral grafts performed?,"'Prior to the surgery, the surgeon performs a complete physical assessment.\xa0The surgeon performs blood and radiological assessments such as X-ray and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') to assess the joint status.\xa0''Fitness'' for the surgery and consent is obtained.\xa0The surgery is performed under general anesthesia.''Because there is a wide range of chondral disease, the surgeon may perform an arthroscopic evaluation for the assessment of a chondral lesion before proceeding to open surgery to perform an osteochondral grafting.\xa0''Arthroscopy'' is a procedure in which a narrow tube with a camera and light source is inserted through a small incision to diagnose and treat problems inside a joint. Surgical instruments may also be inserted in arthroscopic procedures. This procedure may be performed prior to the surgery or during graft surgery.''The patient may be discharged two to three days after the surgery. Weight bearing is allowed while an immobilizer is worn for the weight-bearing joint, for example, a knee immobilizer. This reduces the contact pressure in the joint.\xa0''The immobilizer may be removed for sedentary activity and range-of-motion exercises during the initial three weeks after the surgery. Complete recovery may take six to eight weeks.''Regular follow-up with the surgeon and physical therapy would be required. The surgeon may perform an arthroscopic evaluation of the joint to monitor healing.' The defect is exposed via an open incision (a surgical cut).  The visible difference between a smooth, healthy cartilage and the defect is identified.  After the defect size is confirmed, a drill of matching diameter is used to remove the damaged cartilage and bone segment to prepare the area for a graft.  The graft is prepared by cutting it to the size of the defect. The graft is then washed.  The graft may be soaked in a bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) for patients electing to supplement the procedure with stem cells.  The osteochondral graft is then fitted into the prepared defect."
What are the complications of an osteochondral graft surgery?,"'Some complications encountered during the surgery are' pain, swelling, and bruising, bleeding, infection, an injury to the surrounding nerves and blood vessels and graft failure."
What is osteochondritis dissecans?,"'Osteochondritis dissecans is a joint condition whereby a variable amount of bone and its adjacent cartilage loses its blood supply. Osteochondritis dissecans can involve the bone and cartilage of virtually any joint. Elbows and knees are most commonly affected. Usually, only a small portion of the affected cartilage is involved. Osteochondritis dissecans most commonly affects boys between 9 and 18 years of age.' "
What causes osteochondritis dissecans?,'The cause of osteochondritis dissecans is often unknown. Theories include mild recurrent injuries or growth disturbances.' 
What are symptoms of osteochondritis dissecans?,"'Symptoms of osteochondritis dissecans are a direct result of the irregularity of the cartilage within the affected joint. Symptoms include joint ''pain'', stiffness, and even locking of the joint so that its range of motion is significantly limited to the point that it cannot be moved beyond a limited range. For example, when osteochondritis dissecans affects the elbow, the joint may not move beyond 90 degrees of extension instead of being able to fully extend straight to 180 degrees.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose osteochondritis dissecans?,"'Osteochondritis dissecans can be suggested clinically by observing the lack of full range of motion with ""locking"" of the joint at a certain angle. It is at this angle that the loosened cartilage and bone is literally being ""pinched"" as the joint is attempting to move. Ultimately, osteochondritis dissecans is best diagnosed with imaging studies, such as ''magnetic resonance imaging'' scan (''MRI'' scan) or an arthrogram.' "
What is the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans?,"'There is no cure as such, but the condition can be treated by a variety of means depending on the size and location of the lesion as well as the age of the patient and the degree of symptoms. Arthroscopic surgery is a procedure that is frequently used as a treatment to remove the loose cartilage and bone tissue from the joint. It can also be used to encourage healing by drilling and fixation of lesions that are only partially detached.''Sometimes, especially in the very young (juvenile) form, osteochondritis dissecans can spontaneously correct itself.'  "
What is the prognosis of osteochondritis dissecans?,"'Indicators of a worse prognosis or outcome include a large-sized lesion, a lesion on a weight-bearing area, and older age of the patient.' "
Is it possible to prevent osteochondritis dissecans?,'It is only possible to prevent osteochondritis dissecans by preventing ''trauma'' or injury to the affected joint.' 
What is renal osteodystrophy?,"'The medical term ""renal"" describes things related to the kidneys. Renal osteodystrophy is a bone disease that occurs when your kidneys fail to maintain the proper levels of calcium and phosphorus in your blood. It\'s a common problem in people with kidney disease and affects most dialysis patients. ''Renal osteodystrophy is most serious in children because their bones are still growing. The condition slows bone growth and causes deformities. One such deformity occurs when the legs bend inward toward each other or outward away from each other; this deformity is referred to as ""renal ''rickets''."" Another important consequence is short stature. Symptoms can be seen in growing children with ''renal disease'' even before they start dialysis.''The bone changes from renal osteodystrophy can begin many years before symptoms appear in adults with kidney disease. For this reason, it\'s called the ""silent crippler."" The symptoms of renal osteodystrophy aren\'t usually seen in adults until they have been on dialysis for several years. Older patients and women who have gone through ''menopause'"" are at greater risk for this disease because they're already vulnerable to ""'osteoporosis'', another bone disease, even without kidney disease. If left untreated, the bones gradually become thin and weak, and a person with renal osteodystrophy may begin to feel bone and joint ''pain'"". There's also an increased risk of bone fractures."" "
Hormones and Minerals,"'In healthy adults, bone tissue is continually being remodeled and rebuilt. The kidneys play an important role in maintaining healthy bone mass and structure because one of their jobs is to balance calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood.'""Calcium is a mineral that builds and strengthens bones. It's found in many foods, particularly milk and other dairy products. If calcium levels in the blood become too low, four small glands in the neck called the parathyroid glands release a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone draws calcium from the bones to raise blood calcium levels. Too much PTH in the blood will remove too much calcium from the bones; over time, the constant removal of calcium weakens the bones. ""'Phosphorus, which is found in most foods, also helps regulate calcium levels in the bones. Healthy kidneys remove excess phosphorus from the blood. When the kidneys stop working normally, phosphorus levels in the blood can become too high, leading to lower levels of calcium in the blood and resulting in the loss of calcium from the bones.''Healthy kidneys produce calcitriol, a form of ''vitamin D'', to help the body absorb dietary calcium into the blood and the bones. If calcitriol levels drop too low, PTH levels increase, and calcium is removed from the bones. Calcitriol and PTH work together to keep calcium balance normal and bones healthy. In a patient with ''kidney failure'"", the kidneys stop making calcitriol. The body then can't absorb calcium from food and starts removing it from the bones."" "
How is renal osteodystrophy diagnosed?,"'To diagnose renal osteodystrophy, your doctor may take a sample of your blood to measure levels of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, and calcitriol. The doctor may perform a bone biopsy to see how dense your bones are. A bone biopsy is done under local anesthesia and involves removing a small sample of bone from the hip and analyzing it under a microscope. Determining the cause of renal osteodystrophy helps the doctor decide on a course of treatment.' "
How is osteodystrophy treated?,"'Controlling PTH levels prevents calcium from being withdrawn from the bones. Usually, overactive parathyroid glands are controllable with a change in ''diet'"", dialysis treatment, or medication. The drug cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar), approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2004, lowers PTH levels by imitating calcium. If PTH levels can't be controlled, the parathyroid glands may need to be removed surgically.""""If your kidneys aren't making adequate amounts of calcitriol, you can take synthetic calcitriol as a pill or in an injectable form. Your doctor may prescribe a calcium supplement in addition to calcitriol.""""Renal osteodystrophy can also be treated with changes in diet. Reducing dietary intake of phosphorus is one of the most important steps in preventing bone disease. Almost all foods contain phosphorus, but it's especially high in milk, cheese, dried beans, peas, nuts, and peanut butter. Limit ""'drinks'' such as cocoa, dark sodas, and beer. Often, medications such as ''calcium carbonate'' (''Tums''), ''calcium acetate'' (''PhosLo''), sevelamer hydrochloride (''Renagel''), or lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) are prescribed with meals and snacks to bind phosphorus in the bowel. These decrease the absorption of phosphorus into the blood. Be sure your phosphate binder is aluminum-free because aluminum can be toxic and cause ''anemia''. A renal dietitian can help develop a dietary plan to control phosphorus levels in the blood.''Exercise'"" has been found to increase bone strength in some patients. It's important, however, to consult a doctor or health care professional before beginning any exercise program.""""A good treatment program, including proper attention to dialysis, diet, and medications, can improve your body's ability to repair bones damaged by renal osteodystrophy.""

What is brittle bone disease (osteogenesis imperfecta)?,"'Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) refers to a group of bone diseases that have in common a defect in bone formation. There are at least 8 known types of osteogenesis imperfecta that range in severity, but people with all types of the condition have bones that tend to break easily, also referred to as brittle bones. Brittle bone disease is estimated to affect 6 or 7 out of every 100,000 people worldwide.''Other names for osteogenesis imperfecta include:' Brittle bone disease Glass bone disease Fragile bone disease Ekman-Lobstein Disease Lobstein Disease (Type I) Vrolik Disease (Type II)"
What is temporary brittle bone disease?,"'Temporary brittle bone disease is not the same thing as osteogenesis imperfecta. It is a term that has been used to describe frequent fractures occurring during the first year of life, although a definite cause of the condition has not been identified.''The term ""temporary brittle bone disease"" is controversial because many fractures that cannot otherwise be accounted for have been suggested as forms of deliberate injury, and some experts have argued that temporary brittle bone disease does not exist. Other experts argue that nutritional deficiencies, metabolic conditions, or other temporary conditions can render bones susceptible to ''fracture'' in the first year, since these fractures often occur in the absence of other signs of deliberate injury such as ''bruising''.' "
Is the cause of brittle bone disease genetic (inherited)?,"'Brittle bone disease is caused by genetic defects, or mutations. These mutations can either be ''inherited'' from the parents or may arise on their own as new mutations.''Most cases of brittle bone disease are inherited from the parents (congenital) in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the defective gene is necessary (from one parent) for the condition to be present. However, some forms of the condition may be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that two copies of a defective gene are required (one from each parent). Mutations in the COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP and P3H1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta. These genes code for proteins that are important for collagen formation. Collagen is an important component of bones and other body structures.' "
What are the 8 types of brittle bone disease?,'Osteogenesis imperfecta is divided into eight types designated by the Roman numerals I through VIII. The type of disease of the bone is determined by the particular genetic mutation and pattern of inheritance.' Type I is the mildest and most common form of the disease and makes up about half of all cases. Type II is the most severe form. Infants with Type II brittle bone disease develop fractures even inutero and have severe abnormalities at birth. Death usually occurs within a few weeks of birth. Type III is the most severe form among infants who survive the neonatal period. These infants develop multiple fractures and have short stature and other abnormalities. Type IV and V brittle bone disease can vary in severity from mild to more severe. Type VI is very rare and is similar to types IV and V. Types VII and VIII are usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern (meaning that a defective gene must be received from each parent).
Does brittle bone disease cause pain?,"'The defective brittle bones themselves are not painful, but ''chronic pain'' may develop in some people with osteogenesis imperfecta due to repeated fractures and skeletal changes. ''Pain'' may also result from acute injuries such as fractures.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of brittle bone disease?,'Symptoms and signs of brittle bone disease vary according to the type. These can include:' Frequent fractures that lead to skeletal deformity Short stature. Bluish coloration to the whites of the eyes (sclerae). Hearing loss. Low birth weight and birth defects in certain forms. Problems with tooth and jaw development. Lung defects in some new borns.
Are brittle bone disease (osteogenesis imperfecta) and osteoporosis the same disease?,"'No, ''osteoporosis'' is the loss of ''bone density'' in normal bones. In brittle bone disease, there is a genetic defect that causes bones to be formed abnormally. However, in both conditions, there is a greater likelihood of bone ''fracture''.' "
At what age does brittle bone disease manifest?,"'Brittle bone disease manifests in childhood. In the most severe forms, changes can even be identified in the fetus in utero.' "
What tests diagnose brittle bone disease?,'The characteristic symptoms of brittle bone disease typically suggest the diagnosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by blood and urine tests to rule out other conditions and by family history and genetic testing.' 
How is brittle bone disease treated?,"'Osteogenesis imperfecta cannot be cured, and treatment is directed at managing symptoms and quality of life. Treatment goals include minimizing fractures and promoting general health and function. The treatment team may include primary care physicians, geneticists, rehabilitation specialists, endocrinologists, neurologists, orthopedic specialists, and pulmonologists.''Treatments can include surgical procedures to repair fractures or correct deformities. Medications such as bisphosphonates (approved for ''osteoporosis'') are sometimes used to improve bone density. Mobility aids including walkers, crutches, and wheelchairs, may be used when needed.' "
What is the life expectancy of brittle bone disease? Can brittle bone disease be cured?,"'Brittle bone disease has no cure.''The prognosis for infants with the most severe form of osteogenesis imperfecta is poor, and most children may not live beyond a few weeks. The prognosis for those with milder forms of the condition who receive good medical management is much better, and many people may have average lifespans.' "
What is rickets?,"'Rickets is a bone disorder caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. Rickets leads to softening and weakening of the bones and is seen most commonly in children 6-24 months of age. There are several subtypes of rickets, including hypophosphatemic rickets (vitamin-D-resistant rickets), renal or kidney rickets (''renal osteodystrophy''), and most commonly, nutritional rickets (caused by dietary deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate). Classic nutritional rickets is also medically termed osteomalacia.'  "
What is the history of rickets?,"'Roman descriptions of individuals with rickets can be found as early as the second century, and in the 1640s, the condition was well documented as a common bone ailment across England. Unfortunately, the scientifically proven cause of rickets was not identified until the 1920s, and by the 1930s, public-health initiatives recommended fortifying milk with vitamin D and cod-''liver'' oil as a nutritional supplement for young infants and children. This led to a near eradication of rickets in the United States and other industrialized nations. Unfortunately, rickets has made a comeback and is still common in less-developed nations. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, rickets is seen more frequently amongst infants and children living in industrialized nations, often among more affluent populations.' "
What are risk factors for the development of rickets?,"'Rickets risk factors include' premature birth (low levels of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus); limited sun exposure (especially in high and low latitudes); hereditary metabolic diseases (for example, X-linked hypophosphotemic rickets); darkly pigmented individuals; infants born to vitamin D-deficient mothers; renal (kidney) diseases that affect calcium and phosphorus absorption; and nutrition -- suboptimal calcium and phosphorus intake or low vitamin D intake (seen in certain vegan diets due to avoidance of milk/dairy products). Soy milk and breakfast cereals fortified with vitamin D are helpful."
What causes rickets?,"'Regardless of the type of rickets, the cause is always either due to a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. Three common causes of rickets include nutritional rickets, hypophosphatemic rickets, and renal rickets.''Nutritional rickets, also called osteomalacia, is a condition caused by ''vitamin D deficiency''. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential for the normal formation of bones and ''teeth'' and necessary for the appropriate absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the bowels. It occurs naturally in very small quantities in some foods such as saltwater fish (salmon, sardines, herring, and fish-liver oils). Vitamin D is also naturally synthesized by skin cells in response to sunlight exposure. It is necessary for the appropriate absorption of calcium from the gut.''Infants and children most at risk for developing nutritional rickets include dark-skinned infants, exclusively ''breastfed'' infants, and infants who are born to mothers who are vitamin D deficient. In addition, older children who are kept out of direct sunlight or who have vegan diets may also be at risk.''Hypophosphatemic rickets is caused by chronically low levels of phosphate in the blood. The bones become painfully soft and pliable. This is caused by a genetic dominant X-linked defect in the ability for the kidneys to control the amount of phosphate excreted in the urine. The individual affected is able to absorb phosphate and calcium from the gut, but the phosphate is lost through the kidneys into the urine. This is not caused by a ''vitamin D deficiency''. Patients with hypophosphatemic rickets typically have obvious symptoms by 1 year of age. Treatment is generally through nutritional ''supplements'' of phosphate and ''calcitriol'' (the activated form of vitamin D).''Similar to hypophosphatemic rickets, renal rickets is caused by a number of kidney disorders. Individuals suffering from ''kidney disease'' often have decreased ability to regulate the amounts of ''electrolytes'' lost in the urine. This includes calcium and phosphate, and therefore the affected individuals develop symptoms almost identical to severe nutritional rickets. Treatment of the underlying kidney problem and nutritional supplementation are recommended for these patients.'  "
What are rickets symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of rickets include bone ''pain'' or tenderness, dental deformities, delayed formation of ''teeth'', decreased muscle strength, predisposition to infections, impaired growth, ''short stature'', and a number of skeletal deformities, including abnormally shaped skull (craniotabes), bowlegs, rib-cage abnormalities (rachitic rosary), and breastbone, pelvic, and spinal deformities.''Occasionally, in very severe rickets, patients may develop even more serious signs and symptoms associated with very low levels of calcium or phosphate. These might include tetany (involuntary muscle contractions) or ''seizures''. These are medical emergencies and require immediate treatment.'  "
Who are the specialists who treat rickets?,'Pediatricians and family practitioners usually care for children with nutritional rickets without consulting specialists. Kidney specialists (nephrologists) generally help manage renal rickets as well as hypophosphatemic rickets and sometimes a pediatric endocrinologist (specializes in hormones) may get involved.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose rickets?,"'Rickets is initially diagnosed clinically with a complete medical and nutritional history and with a complete physical exam by a health professional. If rickets is suspected in a child and the child has no acute symptoms such as ''seizures'' or tetany, ''X-rays'' of long bones (radius, ulna, and femur) and ribs are obtained.''Vitamin D levels, ''alkaline phosphatase'', parathyroid hormone (hormone involved in calcium and phosphate control), and ''electrolytes'', including indirect measurements of kidney function (BUN and ''creatinine''), should be evaluated if the ''X-rays'' show any of the following characteristics that are consistent with rickets:''Different causes of rickets will reveal different findings on laboratory tests. For the scope of this article, we will focus on vitamin D deficiency. In these cases, the active form of vitamin D will be decreased, parathyroid hormone will be increased, and calcium and phosphate will be decreased.' Widening or abnormally shaped metaphysis (most actively growing part of the bone below the growth plate) Obvious bowing of the femurs Osteopenia (bones which are not as dense, a sign of decreased mineralization) Rib flaring (rachitic rosary) Multiple fractures at different healing stages"
What is the treatment for rickets?,"'The treatment for rickets depends upon the cause as mentioned above in the discussion of hypophosphatemic rickets and renal rickets. In cases of nutritional rickets and vitamin D deficiency, treatment is simple. The first step is to prevent the complications of calcium and phosphate deficiency by correcting any abnormal levels with supplemental calcium or phosphate as well as the activated vitamin D (''calcitriol''). Once the diagnosis of rickets is confirmed, initiation of vitamin D supplementation is recommended, as well as a ''diet'' rich in calcium. This is especially important for children on vegan diets. The treatment for some of the bony abnormalities depends on the severity of the cases and may require referral to an orthopedic provider for evaluation.' "
What is the prognosis for rickets?,"'Outcomes for children with nutritional rickets are excellent, especially if diagnosed early. Appropriate supplementation with calcium and vitamin D will lead to healing of the bony defects within days to months. Severe bowing, seen in longer-standing cases of rickets, may also resolve over a number years without requiring surgical intervention. In patients with very advanced disease, however, the bony changes may be permanent.' "
Is it possible to prevent rickets?,"'Pediatricians, family practitioners, and obstetricians are responsible for educating parents (and expecting parents) about measures to prevent rickets. For the expecting mother, this includes recommending ''prenatal vitamins'' and appropriate nutritional counseling. For the new mother, it is important for her to be advised about vitamin D supplementation for exclusively breastfed ''babies'' and, as the child gets older and begins to wean, appropriate nutritional counseling, and reasonable sun exposure for the child.''Vitamin D insufficiency is increasingly being recognized as an under-detected health risk for people of all ages in the United States. Up to 30% of U.S. children are vitamin D deficient to some degree and worldwide this is a much higher percentage. In 2011, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) published a technical report titled ""UV ''Radiation'': A Hazard to Children and Adolescents"" that concluded that all ""infants, children, and adolescents receive vitamin D supplementation and avoid overexposure to sunlight and artificial sources due to the health risks (''cancer'', etc)."" Currently, studies are unclear about how much vitamin D is enough in certain populations, but the current recommendation is for at least 400 IU daily.''Given the fact that vitamin D supplementation may not be readily available worldwide, more research needs to be performed to determine the ""safe"" amount of sunlight exposure for infants and children if we are going to successfully prevent rickets throughout the world.'  "
Facts you should know about osteomyelitis," Osteomyelitis is an infection of bone that can occur in any age group. Treatment of osteomyelitis can include antibiotics, splinting, or surgery. Causes of osteomyelitis include bacteria in the bloodstream from infectious diseases that spread to the bone, an open wound from a trauma over a bone, and recent surgery or injection in or around a bone. The most common types of bacteria that cause osteomyelitis are Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacteriaceae. Risk factors for developing osteomyelitis include a weakened immune system due to a medical condition or medications, cancer, chronic steroid (cortisone) use, sickle cell disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), diabetes, hemodialysis, intravenous drug users, infants, and the elderly. Symptoms of osteomyelitis vary. In children, osteomyelitis symptoms may include pain or tenderness over the affected bone, difficulty or inability to use the affected limb or to bear weight or walk due to severe pain, fever, chills, and redness at the site of the infected area. In adults, the symptoms of osteomyelitis include fever, chills, irritability, swelling or redness over the infected bone, drainage of pus, stiffness, and nausea. Physicians diagnose osteomyelitis with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, imaging studies (X-rays, bone scans, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds), and sometimes a biopsy of the bone. Treatment for osteomyelitis usually includes antibiotics and pain medications. Sometimes the patient may need surgery. The prognosis for osteomyelitis is good with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients can make a full recovery without lasting complications. Delayed treatment or significant bone and soft tissue injury can lead to long-term problems and even deformity."
What is osteomyelitis?,"'Osteomyelitis is infection in the bone. Osteomyelitis can occur in infants, children, and adults. Different types of bacteria typically affect the different age groups. In children, osteomyelitis most commonly occurs at the ends of the long bones of the arms and legs, affecting the hips, knees, shoulders, and wrists. In adults, it is more common in the bones of the spine (vertebral osteomyelitis), ''feet'', or in the pelvis.'  "
What causes osteomyelitis?,"'There are several different ways to develop the bone infection of osteomyelitis. The first is for bacteria to travel through the bloodstream (''bacteremia'') and spread to the bone, causing an infection (hematogenous osteomyelitis). This most often occurs when the patient has an infectious disease elsewhere in the body, such as ''pneumonia'', an ''abscessed tooth'', or a ''urinary tract infection'' that spreads through the blood to the bone.''An open ''wound'' from a ''trauma'' (post-traumatic ''wound'') over a bone can lead to osteomyelitis. This happens most commonly with underlying ''peripheral vascular disease'', ''peripheral neuropathy'', or ''diabetes mellitus''. With an open ''fracture'' (''compound fracture''), bacteria may come in contact with the bone that punctures through the skin. This increases the risk of osteomyelitis.''A recent surgery or injection in or around a bone can also expose the bone to bacteria and lead to periostitis, an infection of the surface membrane of the bone. This can worsen and affect the whole bone, leading to osteomyelitis.''The most common types of bacteria that cause osteomyelitis are ''Staphylococcus'' (including methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' or ''MRSA''), ''Pseudomonas'', and ''Enterobacteriaceae''. Less commonly, gram-negative bacteria causes osteomyelitis.''Patients with conditions or taking medications that weaken their immune system are at a higher risk of developing osteomyelitis. Risk factors include ''cancer'', chronic steroid use, ''sickle cell disease'', ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), ''diabetes'', ''hemodialysis'', intravenous drug users, infants, and the elderly.' "
What are osteomyelitis symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis can vary greatly. In children, osteomyelitis most often occurs more quickly. Osteomyelitis in children is most likely caused by bacteria that travel through the bloodstream (''bacteremia'') and spread to the bone. ''Hematogenous osteomyelitis'' is the medical term for the spread of bacteria through the blood to infect the bone. Children often develop ''pain'' or tenderness over the affected bone, and they may have difficulty or inability to use the affected limb or to bear weight or walk due to severe pain. They may also have ''fever'', chills, and redness at the site of the infected area.''In adults, the symptoms and signs often develop more gradually and include ''fever'', chills, irritability, swelling or redness over the infected bone, ''drainage of pus'', ''stiffness'', and ''nausea''. In people with ''diabetes'', ''peripheral neuropathy'', or ''peripheral vascular disease'', there may be no pain or fever. The only sign may be an area of skin breakdown that is worsening or not healing. In osteomyelitis of the spine (vertebral osteomyelitis) or the spinal discs (discitis), the only symptom may be ''back pain''.''Acute osteomyelitis occurs with a rapid onset, and pain, fever, and stiffness usually accompany this quick onset. It generally occurs after a break in the skin from injury, trauma, surgery, orthopedic procedures (especially ones involving bone hardware or fixators), joint infection, or ''skin infection'' from wounds such as a foot wound or ulceration.''Chronic osteomyelitis is insidious (slow) in onset. It may be the result of a previous infection of osteomyelitis. Despite multiple courses of antibiotic therapy, it may reoccur. Symptoms and signs of chronic osteomyelitis are subtle but may include fever, pain, redness, or discharge at the site of infection.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose osteomyelitis?,"'The diagnosis of osteomyelitis begins with a complete medical history and physical examination. During the medical history, the doctor may ask questions about recent infections elsewhere in the body, past medical history, medication usage, and family medical history.''The physical examination will look for areas of tenderness, redness, swelling, decreased or painful range of motion, and open sores.''The doctor may then order tests to help diagnose osteomyelitis. Several blood tests help determine if there is an infection present. These include a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR), ''C-reactive protein'' (CRP), and blood cultures. None of these is specific for osteomyelitis but they can suggest that there may be some infection in the body.''Health care professionals usually obtain imaging studies of the involved bones. These can include plain radiographs (''X-rays''), bone scans, computed tomography (CT) scans, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRIs''), and ultrasounds. These imaging studies can help identify changes in the bones that occur with osteomyelitis.''After a physician identifies an area of bone with possible osteomyelitis, a biopsy of the bone may be obtained to help determine precisely which bacteria are involved, and the culture of this can indicate the best choice for antibiotic treatment.'  "
What is the treatment for osteomyelitis?,"'In many cases, antibiotics and pain medications effectively treat osteomyelitis. If a doctor obtains a biopsy, this can help guide the choice of the best antibiotic. The duration of treatment of osteomyelitis with antibiotics is usually four to eight weeks but varies with the type of infection and the response to the treatments. In some cases, the doctor will immobilize an affected area with a brace to reduce the pain and speed the treatment.''Sometimes, surgery may be necessary. If there is an area of localized bacteria (bone ''abscess'') or joint infection (''septic arthritis'""), a doctor may need to open, wash, and drain it. If there is damaged soft tissue or bone, this may need to be removed (debridement). If it's necessary to remove bone, it may need to be replaced with bone graft or stabilized during surgery."" "
What is the prognosis for osteomyelitis?,"'With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the prognosis for osteomyelitis is good. A patient will need to adhere to antibiotics regimes for four to eight weeks and sometimes longer in the treatment of osteomyelitis depending on the bacteria that caused it and the response of the patient. Commonly, patients can make a full recovery without longstanding complications.'""However, if there is a long delay in diagnosis or treatment, or if there is significant bone and soft tissue injury due to trauma with compromised local blood supply, it can lead to long-term permanent functional deficits and/or make the patient more prone to reoccurrence. If it's necessary to perform surgery, debridement, or bone grafting, this will prolong the time it takes to recover."" "
What is osteopenia?,"'Osteopenia is a bone condition characterized by a decreased density of bone, which leads to bone weakening and an increased risk of breaking a bone (''fracture'').''Osteomalacia, ''osteomyelitis'', and ''osteoarthritis'' are different conditions that are frequently confused with osteopenia because they sound similar. Osteomalacia is a disorder of the mineralization of newly formed bone, which causes the bone to be weak and more prone to ''fracture''. There are many causes of osteomalacia, including ''vitamin D deficiency'' and low blood phosphate levels. ''Osteomyelitis'' is bone infection. ''Osteoarthritis'' is ''joint inflammation'' featuring cartilage loss and is the most common type of ''arthritis''. ''Osteoarthritis'' does not cause osteopenia, ''osteoporosis'', or a decreased ''bone mineral density''.' "
"Which causes more bone fractures, osteopenia or osteoporosis?","'Osteopenia is important because it can cause bone ''fractures''. People with osteopenia are not as likely to ''fracture'' a bone as those with ''osteoporosis''; however, because there are many more people with osteopenia than ''osteoporosis'', patients with osteopenia account for a large number of patients who fracture a bone. In other words, while ''osteoporosis'' indicates bone that is more prone to fracture and people with osteoporosis have a higher percentage risk of fracture than osteopenia, because of the much larger number of people with osteopenia there is a greater total number of fractures in these people.''Bone fractures due to osteopenia and osteoporosis are important because they can be very painful, although some spinal (vertebral) fractures are painless.''In addition to the ''pain'', hip fractures are a serious problem because they require surgical repair. Also, many patients require long-term ''nursing''-home care after a ''hip fracture''. Fractures, especially in the elderly, are associated with an increase in overall mortality (death rate). A significant percentage of people die in the year following hip fracture, due to complications including ''blood clots'' related to immobility, ''pneumonia'', and many other reasons.' "
What are osteopenia symptoms and signs? Is it painful?,"'Osteopenia does not cause ''pain'' unless a bone is broken (fractured). Interestingly, ''fractures'' in patients with osteopenia do not always cause ''pain''. Osteopenia or osteoporosis can be present for many years prior to diagnosis for these reasons. Many bone fractures due to osteopenia or osteoporosis, such as a ''hip fracture'' or vertebral fracture (fracture of a bone in the spine), are very painful. However, some fractures, especially vertebral fractures (fractures of the bony building blocks of the spine), can be painless and therefore osteopenia or osteoporosis may go undiagnosed for years. In addition to ''back pain'', recurrent spinal (vertebral) fractures can cause ''stooped posture'"" (dowager's hump) and loss of height.""  "
What risk factors and causes of osteopenia?,"'Osteopenia has multiple causes. Common causes and risk factors include'   genetics (familial predisposition to osteopenia or osteoporosis, a family history of early bone loss, and other genetic disorders); hormonal causes, including decreased estrogen (such as in women after menopause) or testosterone; smoking; excess alcohol; thin frame; immobility; certain medications (such as corticosteroids, including prednisone) and antiseizure medications; malabsorption due to conditions (such as celiac sprue); and chronic inflammation due to medical conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis)."
Are osteopenia and osteoporosis the same condition?,'Osteopenia and osteoporosis are related conditions. The difference between osteopenia and osteoporosis is that in osteopenia the bone loss is not as severe as in osteoporosis. That means someone with osteopenia is more likely to fracture a bone than someone with a normal bone density but is less likely to fracture a bone than someone with osteoporosis.' 
Are osteopenia and osteomalacia the same condition?,"'Osteopenia is a bone condition characterized by decreased bone density, which leads to bone weakening and an increased risk of bone fracture. Osteomalacia is a bone disorder characterized by decreased mineralization of newly formed bone. Osteomalacia is caused by severe ''vitamin D'' deficiency (which can be nutritional or caused by a hereditary syndrome) and by conditions that cause very low blood phosphate levels (such as genetic syndromes and ''cancer'' related syndromes). People with osteomalacia and those with osteopenia may have no symptoms. Both osteomalacia and osteopenia increase the risk of breaking a bone. However, symptoms of osteomalacia include bone ''pain'' and muscle ''weakness'', bone tenderness, difficulty ''walking'', and ''muscle spasms''. These symptoms are not caused by osteopenia.' "
Who should be tested for osteopenia?,'Not everyone needs to be tested for a decreased ''bone mineral density'' (osteopenia or osteoporosis). Your doctor can determine if you should be tested. The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends the following groups of people be tested for osteopenia or osteoporosis:' Women 65 years and older and men 70 years and older Postmenopausal women and men 50-69 years of age at increased risk for osteoporosis Adults who have a bone fracture after age 50 Adults with a medical condition associated with bone loss (such as rheumatoid arthritis) or who take a medication that can cause bone loss (such as prednisone or other steroids) Anyone being considered for prescription treatment for osteopenia or osteoporosis Anyone being treated for osteoporosis to monitor treatment
When should you see a doctor for osteopenia?,'Anyone who has been diagnosed with osteopenia should implement lifestyle changes and discuss with their physician whether they should take calcium and ''vitamin D'' ''supplements'' and possibly receive prescription medication for their condition.' 
Which types of specialists treat osteopenia?,"'Osteopenia can be diagnosed and treated by many different medical specialists, including primary care providers (such as internists and family practitioners), ''rheumatologists'', endocrinologists, and gynecologists. Other specialists may treat osteopenia, as well, especially if they are prescribing a medication that predisposes to osteopenia, such as the cortisone medication prednisone.' "
What procedures and tests diagnose osteopenia?,"'Osteopenia is diagnosed using measures of bone mineral density (BMD). The test recommended by the National Osteoporosis Foundation to measure BMD is the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan or ''DXA scan'' (formerly known as ''DEXA'' scan). A DXA scan measures BMD in the hip (femoral neck), spine, and sometimes the wrist. These locations are chosen because these are frequent sites of bone fracture. The DXA is a very accurate predictor of future fracture risk.''The DXA scan gives two results: a ""T score"" and a ""Z score."" The Z score compares the patient\'s BMD to the average of a person of the same age and sex. The T score compares the BMD to a healthy 30-year-old of the same sex. These scores are measured in standard deviations above or below normal. For example, if a T score is -1.0, this indicates a BMD that is 1.0 standard deviations below a healthy 30-year-old of the same sex. In other words, the lower the bone mineral density, the lower the T score or Z score and the higher the risk of fracture. The risk for fracture doubles with every standard deviation below normal. So, someone with a T score of -2.0 has an approximately twofold increased risk of fracture as compared to someone with a T score of -1.0.''T scores are used to diagnose osteopenia and osteoporosis; those between -1.0 and -2.5 indicate osteopenia, and T scores lower than -2.5 indicate osteoporosis. But it is important to realize that T scores are not the only indication of osteoporosis; if someone has a bone fracture without ''trauma'' (or after falling from standing height), then they have osteoporosis by definition, regardless of T score. These patients should be treated as though they have osteoporosis, even if their T score is normal or in the osteopenic range.''Other tests used to measure bone density include the peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDXA), quantitative computed tomography (QCT), peripheral QCT (pQCT), and quantitative ''ultrasound'' densitometry (QUS). Bone density test results can be obtained by any of these methods. Sometimes a routine X-ray reveals diffuse osteopenia (osteopenia in all bones visualized by the X-ray) or osteopenia of a particular location, such as spinal osteopenia. Periarticular osteopenia is an indication of past inflammation around a certain joint. This can be seen in conditions such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and does not necessarily indicate a decreased BMD throughout the bony skeleton. While routine ''X-rays'' may suggest decreased bone mineral density, the DXA scan is much more precise in diagnosing osteopenia and osteoporosis.'  "
Is there an diet plan for osteopenia?,"'A ''diet'' containing sufficient calcium and ''vitamin D'', as detailed above, is key for people with osteopenia. Low-fat dairy products such as low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese, vegetables such as broccoli and collard greens, and salmon and sardines are some good sources of dietary calcium.''In addition, studies have shown that higher fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with improved bone density.''Minimizing drinking alcohol and not ''smoking'' are essential for people with osteopenia. Drinking more than two alcoholic ''beverages'' daily is associated with decreased bone density. ''Smoking'' reduces bone density. Stopping ''smoking'', of course, improves health in many different ways.' "
What are treatment options and medications for osteopenia?,"'People with osteopenia should make certain important lifestyle modifications and ensure that their dietary intake of calcium and ''vitamin D'' (vitamin D2, vitamin D3, and\xa0''cholecalciferol'') are adequate. Management of an underlying condition causing malabsorption, such as ''celiac sprue'', can improve bone density. Not everyone with osteopenia requires treatment with prescription bone-building medication. This is because while 34 million people have osteopenia, and therefore the condition accounts for a large number of bone fractures, the absolute risk for fracture in any individual is low. So,\xa0if bone-building medications were prescribed to everyone with osteopenia it would result in a large number of people who may never even have had a bone fracture taking medication for many years, exposing them to unnecessary expense and potential side effects.''If you have osteopenia, your doctor can determine if you need treatment with prescription medication. The decision to treat is made on a case-by-case basis depending on each individual. Factors other than bone mineral density can increase the risk of fracture, and these risk factors can be used to determine if a certain individual requires treatment for osteopenia. These include a parent who fractured their hip, previous or current treatment with ''corticosteroids'' (such as prednisone), thin and small-framed individuals, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''smoking'', and drinking more than two alcoholic ''beverages'' daily. Your doctor may use this information to calculate your risk of a bone fracture in the next 10 years. This risk can then be used to determine if treatment is necessary.''The diagnosis of osteopenia can be an eye-opening wake-up call to make certain lifestyle changes. Lifestyle modifications are an important part of the ''prevention'' and treatment of osteopenia and osteoporosis. These lifestyle changes include weight-bearing ''exercise'' (for example, ''walking'' or lifting light weights), quitting smoking, not drinking excessively, and ensuring an adequate daily intake of calcium and ''vitamin D''. If dietary intake is not adequate, then ''supplements'' may be prescribed. The Institute of Medicine released the following guidelines on calcium and vitamin D intake on Nov. 30, 2010:''The following prescription medications are treatment options for osteopenia and osteoporosis:''Alendronate'' (''Fosamax''), ''risedronate'' (''Actonel''), ''zoledronic acid'' (''Reclast''), and ''raloxifene'' (''Evista'') have an indication from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the ''prevention'' of osteoporosis (such as for those with osteopenia), as well as for the treatment of osteoporosis. For raloxifene (Evista) and risedronate (Actonel), the doses used for osteopenia are the same as those used for osteoporosis. Zoledronic acid (Reclast) is an intravenous medication given yearly for the treatment of osteoporosis but every other year for the prevention of osteoporosis. Alendronate (Fosamax) is given as 10 mg daily or 70 mg weekly for osteoporosis, and the dose is halved for the prevention of osteoporosis (5 mg daily or 35 mg weekly).''Side effects of alendronate (Fosamax) and other bisphosphonates (risedronate, zoledronic acid and ''ibandronate'') prescribed for osteoporosis and osteopenia are a subject of intense medical research and media scrutiny recently. The risks under scrutiny include unusual hip fractures and a jawbone problem known as ''avascular necrosis'' of the jaw. These side effects are rare. Generally these medications are used only when the benefits of preventing bone fractures far outweigh the risks.'   800 IU (international units) daily for women over the age of 71 600 IU daily for women in other age groups, men, and children 400 IU daily for infants under 12 months of age 1,200 mg (milligrams) daily for adult women over the age of 50 and men 71 years and older: At least 1,200 mg is recommended, including diet and calcium supplements. Calcium should be taken in divided doses, no more than 600 mg at once, to ensure optimal intestinal absorption. 1,000 mg daily for younger adult women (who are not breastfeeding or lactating) and adult men Bisphosphonates (including alendronate [Fosamax], risedronate [Actonel], ibandronate [Boniva], and zoledronic acid [Reclast]) Calcitonin (Miacalcin, Fortical, Calcimar) Teriparatide (Forteo) Denosumab (Prolia) Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen and progesterone Raloxifene (Evista)"
What follow-up is needed after osteopenia treatment has started?,"'Often osteopenia does not require treatment with prescription medications. In this situation, the bone density test may be repeated to monitor the bone mineral density (BMD), usually after two years, to detect progressive bone loss and determine if treatment is necessary. Two years may seem like a long time between tests, but BMD changes very slowly, and this length of time is usually necessary to detect significant changes in bone density.''A follow-up test for BMD is frequently repeated after treatment with prescription medication for osteopenia is begun. Again, because changes in BMD occur slowly, the repeat testing is usually done several years after treatment is begun. However, follow-up testing while on treatment is controversial because:' A decrease in the risk for fracture while on treatment for osteopenia and osteoporosis is not always mirrored by an increase in BMD on DXA or other testing If repeat testing shows continued bone loss, this does not mean the medication is not working because it is also likely the bone loss would have been much worse if left untreated."
Is osteopenia reversible?,"'Infrequently, osteopenia can normalize on follow-up testing. This is more common in certain situations, such as when only mild osteopenia on the initial bone density test. When mild osteopenia is caused by significant ''vitamin D deficiency'', and the ''vitamin D deficiency'' is treated, then the osteopenia may reverse. Another example is when osteopenia is caused by malabsorption from ''celiac sprue'', and the ''celiac sprue'' is treated, then osteopenia often improves.''These specific examples apply to a minority of people with osteopenia. Usually, osteopenia does not reverse, but with the proper treatment, the bone density can stabilize and the risk for a bone fracture improves.' "
What is the prognosis of osteopenia?,"'Frequently, bone loss can be slowed or stabilized with lifestyle changes or medication if necessary. In some situations, bone loss may continue due to hormonal factors, medical conditions, or medications. Examples of these situations may be untreated celiac sprue, untreated or resistant ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and treatment with steroid medication such as prednisone used for another medical condition.' "
Can you prevent osteopenia?,"'The best way to prevent osteopenia is by living healthfully. In regard to osteopenia, prevention includes ensuring adequate calcium intake either through ''diet'' or ''supplements'', ensuring adequate vitamin D intake, not drinking too much alcohol (no more than two ''drinks'' daily), not smoking, and getting plenty of ''exercise''. Weight-bearing ''exercise'', such as walking, lifting light weights, or doing push-ups, is the most effective exercise for preventing and treating bone loss. This is because this type of exercise signals to the bones to become stronger.''For most people, prescription medications are not necessary to prevent osteopenia. However, some people taking certain medications (such as prednisone or other steroids) for more than a few months may need to take prescription medication to prevent bone loss.' "
What is osteoporosis?,"'Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by a decrease in the density of bone, decreasing its strength and resulting in fragile bones. Osteoporosis literally leads to the abnormally porous bone that is compressible, like a sponge. This disorder of the skeleton weakens the bone and results in frequent fractures (breaks) in the bones. ''Osteopenia'', by definition, is a condition of bone that is slightly less dense than normal bone but not to the degree of bone in osteoporosis.''Normal bone is composed of protein, collagen, and calcium, all of which give bone its strength. Bones that are affected by osteoporosis can break (fracture) with relatively minor injuries that normally would not cause a bone to fracture. The fracture can be either in the form of cracking (as in a ''hip fracture'') or collapsing (as in a compression fracture of the vertebrae of the spine). The spine, hips, ribs, and wrists are common areas of bone fractures from osteoporosis although osteoporosis-related fractures can occur in almost any skeletal bone.'  "
What are osteoporosis causes and risk factors?,"'The following are factors that will increase the risk of developing osteoporosis:'   Female gender Caucasian or Asian race Thin and small body frame Family history of osteoporosis (for example, having a mother with an osteoporotic hip fracture doubles your risk of hip fracture) Personal history of fracture as an adult Cigarette smoking Excessive alcohol consumption Lack of exercise Diet low in calcium Poor nutrition and poor general health, especially associated with chronic inflammation or bowel disease Malabsorption (nutrients are not properly absorbed from the gastrointestinal system) from bowel diseases, such as celiac sprue that can be associated with skin diseases, such as dermatitis herpetiformis Low estrogen levels in women (which may occur in menopause or with early surgical removal of both ovaries) Low testosterone levels in men (hypogonadism) Chemotherapy that can cause early menopause due to its toxic effects on the ovaries Amenorrhea (loss of the menstrual period) in young women is associated with low estrogen and osteoporosis; amenorrhea can occur in women who undergo extremely vigorous exercise training and in women with very low body fat (for example, women with anorexia nervosa) Chronic inflammation, due to chronic inflammatory arthritis or diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or liver diseases Immobility, such as after a stroke, or from any condition that interferes with walking Hyperthyroidism, a condition wherein too much thyroid hormone is produced by the thyroid gland (as in Grave's disease) or is ingested as thyroid hormone medication Hyperparathyroidism is a disease wherein there is excessive parathyroid hormone production by the parathyroid gland, a small gland located near or within the thyroid gland. Normally, the parathyroid hormone maintains blood calcium levels by, in part, removing calcium from the bone. In untreated hyperparathyroidism, the excessive parathyroid hormone causes too much calcium to be removed from the bone, which can lead to osteoporosis. When vitamin D is lacking, the body cannot absorb adequate amounts of calcium from the diet to prevent osteoporosis. Vitamin D deficiency can result from dietary deficiency, lack of sunlight, or lack of intestinal absorption of the vitamin such as occurs in celiac sprue and primary biliary cirrhosis. Certain medications can cause osteoporosis. These medicines include long-term use of heparin (a blood thinner), antiseizure medicine such as phenytoin (Dilantin) and phenobarbital, and long-term use of oral corticosteroids (such as prednisone). Inherited disorders of connective tissue, including osteogenesis imperfecta, homocystinuria, osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, and skin diseases, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (These causes of hereditary secondary osteoporosis each are treated differently.)"
What are osteoporosis symptoms and signs?,"""Osteoporosis can be present without any symptoms for decades because osteoporosis doesn't cause symptoms until bone breaks (fractures). Moreover, some osteoporotic fractures may escape detection for years when they do not cause symptoms. Therefore, patients may not be aware of their osteoporosis until they suffer a painful fracture. The symptom associated with osteoporotic fractures usually is ""'pain''; the location of the ''pain'' depends on the location of the fracture. The symptoms of osteoporosis in men are similar to the symptoms of osteoporosis in women.''Fractures of the spine (vertebra) can cause severe ""band-like"" pain that radiates from the back to the sides of the body. Over the years, repeated spinal fractures can lead to chronic ''lower back pain'' as well as loss of height and/or curving of the spine due to collapse of the vertebrae. The collapse gives individuals a hunched-back appearance of the upper back, often called a ""dowager hump"" because it commonly is seen in elderly women.''A fracture that occurs during the course of normal activity is called a minimal ''trauma'', or ''stress fracture''. For example, some patients with osteoporosis develop ''stress'' fractures of the ''feet'' while walking or stepping off a curb.''Hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. With osteoporosis, hip fractures can occur as a result of trivial slip-and-fall accidents. Hip fractures also may heal slowly or poorly after surgical repair because of poor healing of the bone.'  "
What are the consequences of osteoporosis?,"'Osteoporotic bone fractures are responsible for considerable pain, decreased quality of life, lost workdays, and disability. Up to 30% of patients suffering a hip fracture will require long-term ''nursing''-home care. Elderly patients can develop ''pneumonia'' and ''blood clots'' in the leg veins that can travel to the ''lungs'' (''pulmonary embolism'') due to prolonged bed rest after the hip fracture. Osteoporosis has even been linked with an increased risk of death. Some 20% of women with a hip fracture will die in the subsequent year as an indirect result of the fracture. In addition, once a person has experienced a spine fracture due to osteoporosis, he or she is at very high risk of suffering another such fracture in the near future (next few years). About 20% of ''postmenopausal'' women who experience a vertebral fracture will suffer a new vertebral fracture of bone in the following year.' "
Why is osteoporosis an important public health issue?,"'With the ''aging'' of America, the number of people with osteoporosis-related fractures will increase exponentially. The pain, suffering, and overall impact on health and economic costs will be enormous.' In the U.S., 44 million people have low bone density (10 million have osteoporosis, and 34 million have osteopenia). This amounts to 55% of the U.S. population aged 50 years and older. One in two Caucasian women will fracture a bone due to osteoporosis in her lifetime. In the U.S., direct health care costs from osteoporosis fractures amount to a billion dollars, without even taking into account the indirect costs, such as lost days at work and productivity. Approximately 20% of those who experience a hip fracture will die in the year following the fracture. One-third of hip-fracture patients are discharged to a nursing home within the year after fracture. Only one-third of hip-fracture patients regain their pre-fracture level of function."
What factors determine bone strength?,"'Bone mass (bone density) is determined by the amount of bone present in the skeletal structure. Generally, the higher the bone density, the stronger the bones. Bone density is greatly influenced by genetic factors, which in turn are sometimes modified by environmental factors and medications. For example, men have a higher bone density than women, and African Americans have a higher bone density than Caucasian or Asian Americans.''Normally, bone density accumulates during childhood and reaches a peak by around age 25. Bone density then is maintained for about 10 years. After age 35, both men and women will normally lose 0.3%-0.5% of their bone density per year as part of the ''aging'' process.''Estrogen is important in maintaining bone density in women. When estrogen levels drop after menopause, loss of bone density accelerates. During the first five to 10 years after menopause, women can suffer up to 2%-4% loss of bone density per year! This is predominantly attributed to insufficient estrogen and can result in the loss of up to 25%-30% of their bone density during that time period. The accelerated bone loss after menopause is a major cause of osteoporosis in women, referred to as postmenopausal osteoporosis. This is true even in women who seem to otherwise have normal health.' "
What tests do health care professionals use in the diagnosis of osteoporosis?,"'A routine X-ray can reveal osteoporosis of the bone because the bones appear much thinner and lighter than normal bones. Unfortunately, by the time X-rays can detect osteoporosis, at least 30% of the bone has already been lost. In addition, X-rays are not accurate indicators of bone density. Thus, the appearance of the bone on X-ray often is affected by variations in the degree of exposure of the X-ray film.''The National Osteoporosis Foundation, the American Medical Association, and other major medical organizations recommend a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA, formerly known as ''DEXA'') be used for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. DXA typically measures bone density in the hip, the spine, and the forearm. The test takes only five to 15 minutes to perform, exposes patients to very little ''radiation'' (less than one-tenth to one-hundredth of the amount used on a standard ''chest X-ray''), and is quite precise.''The bone density of the patient is compared to the average peak bone density of young adults of the same sex and race. This score is called the ""T score"" or T-score, and it expresses the bone density in terms of the number of standard deviations (SD) below peak young adult bone mass.''It is important to note that while osteopenia is considered a lesser degree of bone loss than osteoporosis, it nevertheless can be of concern when it is associated with other risk factors (such as ''smoking'', cortisone steroid usage, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', family history of osteoporosis, etc.) that can increase the chances for developing vertebral, hip, and other fractures. In this setting, osteopenia may require medication as part of the treatment program.' Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density T score of -2.5 or below. Osteopenia (between normal and osteoporosis) is defined as bone density T score between -1 and -2.5."
What types of health care professionals treat osteoporosis?,"'Health care professionals who treat osteoporosis include generalists and internists as well as gynecologists, endocrinologists, ''rheumatologists'', and, for fractures, bone surgeons (orthopedists).' "
Who should have bone density testing?,"'The National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines state that there are several groups of people who should consider DXA testing for proper diagnosis of bone health:''The National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines state that bone-density testing does not need to be performed if a person has a known osteoporotic fracture because the patient will be treated for osteoporosis with or without a bone-density study. In addition, bone-density testing is not appropriate if the person undergoing the test is not willing to take treatment based on the results. Therefore, if bone-density testing is done, it should be performed on people willing to take some specific action to improve their bone health based on the results.' All postmenopausal women below age 65 who have risk factors for osteoporosis All women aged 65 and older Postmenopausal women with fractures, although this is not mandatory because treatment may well be started regardless of bone density Women with any of more than 50 medical conditions associated with osteoporosis; a primary care physician can scan a patient's list of medical illnesses to determine if one of these conditions is present (see causes above) Women whose decision to begin treatment for osteoporosis might be aided by bone density testing to determine the presence or absence of osteoporosis or osteopenia"
"What is the treatment for osteoporosis, and can osteoporosis be prevented?","'The goal of treatment of osteoporosis is the ''prevention'' of bone fractures by reducing bone loss or, preferably, by increasing bone density and strength. Although early detection and timely treatment of osteoporosis can substantially decrease the risk of future fractures, none of the available treatments for osteoporosis are complete cures. In other words, it is difficult to completely rebuild bone that has been weakened by osteoporosis. Therefore, prevention of osteoporosis is as important as treatment. The following are osteoporosis treatment and prevention measures for optimal health of the bone:'   Lifestyle changes, including quitting cigarette smoking, curtailing excessive alcohol intake, exercising regularly, and consuming a balanced diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D Medications that stop bone loss and increase bone strength, such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), raloxifene (Evista), ibandronate (Boniva), calcitonin (Calcimar), zoledronate (Reclast), and denosumab (Prolia) Medications that increase bone formation such as teriparatide (Forteo)"
"Exercise, quitting cigarettes, and curtailing alcohol","'Exercise has a wide variety of beneficial health effects. However, exercise does not bring about substantial increases in bone density. The benefit of exercise for osteoporosis has mostly to do with decreasing the risk of falls, probably because balance is improved and/or muscle strength is increased. Research has not yet determined what type of exercise is best for osteoporosis or for how long it should be continued. Until research has answered these questions, most doctors recommend weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, preferably daily for optimal health.''A word of caution about exercise'': It is important to avoid exercises that can injure already weakened bones. In patients over 40 and those with ''heart disease'', ''obesity'', ''diabetes mellitus'', and ''high blood pressure'', exercise should be prescribed and monitored by physicians. Extreme levels of exercise (such as marathon ''running'') may not be healthy for the bones. Marathon running in young women that leads to ''weight loss'' and loss of menstrual periods can actually promote osteoporosis.''Smoking'' one pack of cigarettes per day throughout adult life can itself lead to loss of 5%-10% of bone mass. ''Smoking'' cigarettes decreases estrogen levels and can lead to bone loss in women before menopause. Smoking cigarettes also can lead to earlier menopause. In postmenopausal women, smoking is linked with increased risk of osteoporosis. Data on the effect of regular consumption of alcohol and ''caffeine'' on osteoporosis is not as clear as with exercise and cigarettes. In fact, research regarding alcohol and ''caffeine'' as risk factors for osteoporosis shows widely varying results and is controversial. Certainly, their effects are not as great as other factors. Nevertheless, moderation of both alcohol and caffeine is prudent.'  "
Calcium supplements for osteoporosis,"'Building strong and healthy bones requires an adequate dietary intake of calcium beginning in childhood and adolescence for both sexes. Most importantly, however, a high dietary calcium intake or taking ''calcium supplements'' alone is not sufficient in treating osteoporosis and should not be viewed as an alternative to or substituted for more potent prescription medications for osteoporosis. In the first several years after menopause, rapid bone loss may occur even if calcium ''supplements'' are taken.''The following calcium intake has been recommended by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference on Osteoporosis for all people, with or without osteoporosis:''Daily calcium intake can be calculated by the following method:''Unfortunately, surveys have shown that the average woman in the U.S. is consuming less than 500 mg of calcium per day in their diet, less than the recommended amounts. Additional calcium can be obtained by drinking more milk and eating more yogurt or cottage cheese or by taking calcium supplement tablets as well from calcium-fortified foods, such as orange juice.''The various calcium ''supplements'' contain different amounts of elemental calcium (the actual amount of calcium in the supplement). For example, ''Caltrate'', ''Os-Cal'', and ''Tums'' are ''calcium carbonate'' salts. Each 1,250 mg of calcium carbonate salt tablet (such as Caltrate 600 mg, ''Os-Cal 500'' mg, or Tums 500 mg extra strength) contains 500 mg of elemental calcium. A person who needs 1,000 mg/day of calcium supplement can take one tablet of Tums 500 mg extra strength (containing 500 mg of elemental calcium) twice daily with meals.''The calcium carbonate supplements are best taken in small divided doses with meals since the ''intestines'' may not be able to reliably absorb more than 500 mg of calcium all at once. Therefore, the best way to take 1,000 mg of a calcium supplement is to divide it into two doses. Likewise, a dosage of 1,500 mg should be split into three doses.''Calcium supplements are safe and generally well tolerated. Side effects are ''indigestion'' and ''constipation''. If ''constipation'' and ''indigestion'' occur with calcium carbonate supplements, calcium citrate (Citracal) can be used. Some patients have ''difficulty swallowing'' calcium tablets. In this situation, chewable candy-like calcium in the form of Viactiv is available. Certain medications can interfere with the absorption of calcium carbonate. Examples of such medications include proton-pump inhibitors such as ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''), lansoprazole (''Protonix''), and ''rabeprazole'' (''Aciphex''), which are used in treating ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') or peptic ulcers. When these medications are being taken, calcium citrate is preferred.''Many ""natural"" calcium carbonate preparations, such as oyster shells or bone meal, may contain high levels of lead or other harmful elements and should be avoided.' 800 mg/day for children 1-10 years of age 1,000 mg/day for men, premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women also taking estrogen 1,200 mg/day for teenagers and young adults 11-24 years of age 1,500 mg/day for postmenopausal women not taking estrogen 1,200 mg-1,500 mg/day for pregnant and nursing mothers The total daily intake of calcium should not exceed 2,000 mg. Excluding dairy products, the average American diet contains approximately 250 mg of calcium. There is approximately 300 mg of calcium in an 8-ounce glass of milk. There is approximately 450 mg of calcium in 8 ounces of plain yogurt. There is approximately 130 mg of calcium in 1 cup of cottage cheese. There is approximately 200 mg of calcium in 1 ounce of cheddar cheese. There is approximately 90 mg of calcium in ½ cup of vanilla ice cream. There is approximately 300 mg of calcium in 8 ounces of calcium-fortified orange juice."
Vitamin D for osteoporosis,"'An adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D are important foundations for maintaining bone density and strength. However, calcium and vitamin D alone are not sufficient to treat osteoporosis and should be given in conjunction with other treatments. Vitamin D is important in several respects:''Vitamin D comes from the diet and the skin. Vitamin D production by the skin is dependent on exposure to sunlight. Active people living in sunny regions (Southern California, Hawaii, countries around the equator, etc.) can produce most of the vitamin D they need in their skin. Conversely, lack of exposure to sunlight, due to residence in northern latitudes or physical incapacitation, causes vitamin D deficiency. In less temperate regions such as Minnesota, Michigan, and New York, production of vitamin D by the skin is markedly diminished in the winter months, especially among the elderly. In that population, dietary vitamin D becomes more important.''Unfortunately, vitamin D deficiency is quite common in the U.S. In a study in a general medical ward of one hospital, vitamin D deficiency was detected in 57% of the patients. An estimated 50% of elderly women consume far less vitamin D in their diet than is recommended. The vitamin D status is easily evaluated with a simple blood test.''The Food and ''Nutrition'' Board of the Institute of Medicine has recommended the following as an adequate vitamin D intake:''But if a person already has osteoporosis, it is advisable to ensure 400 IU twice per day as the usual daily intake, most commonly as a supplement alongside prescribed medications for osteoporosis.''An average multivitamin tablet contains 400 IU of vitamin D. Therefore, one to two ''multivitamins'' a day should provide the recommended amount of vitamin D. Alternatively, vitamin D can be obtained in combination with calcium in tablet forms, such as Caltrate 600 + D (600 mg of calcium and 200 IU of vitamin D) and others.''Adequate levels of calcium and vitamin D are essential for optimal bone health, especially when used with prescribed medication for osteoporosis. Chronic excessive use of vitamin D can lead to toxic levels of vitamin D, ''elevated calcium levels'' in blood and urine, and may also cause ''kidney stones''. Since various ''dietary supplements'' may also contain vitamin D, it is important to review vitamin D content in dietary supplements before taking additional vitamin D.' Vitamin D helps the absorption of dietary calcium from the intestines. The lack of vitamin D alone can cause calcium-depleted bone (osteomalacia), which further weakens the bones and increases the risk of fractures. Vitamin D, along with adequate calcium (1,200 mg of elemental calcium), has been shown in some studies to increase bone density and decrease fractures in postmenopausal women but not in premenopausal or perimenopausal women. 800 IU/day for men and women over the age of 71 600 IU/day for women in other age groups, men, and children 400 IU/day for infants under 12 months"
Can adding certain foods to one's diet help to prevent osteoporosis?,'Eating a diet that has adequate calcium and vitamin D can be beneficial in preventing osteoporosis.' 
Are there foods to avoid when it comes to osteoporosis?,"'Excessive alcohol should be avoided by those with osteoporosis. For those with underlying ''celiac disease'', it is essential to avoid foods with ''gluten'' (wheat, barley, and rye) in them.' "
Medications that prevent bone loss and breakdown,"'Currently, the most effective medications for osteoporosis that are approved by the FDA are antiresorptive agents, which decrease the removal of calcium from bones. The bone is a living dynamic structure; it is constantly being built and removed (resorbed). This process is an essential part of maintaining the normal calcium level in the blood and serves to repair tiny cracks in the bones that occur with normal daily activity and to remodel bone based on the physical stresses placed on the bone. Osteoporosis results when the rate of bone resorption exceeds the rate of bone rebuilding. Antiresorptive medications inhibit removal of bone (resorption), thus tipping the balance in favor of bone rebuilding and increasing bone density. ''HRT'' is one example of an antiresorptive agent. Others include alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), raloxifene (Evista), ibandronate (Boniva), calcitonin (Calcimar), zoledronate (Reclast), and denosumab (Prolia).''Bisphosphonates decrease the risk of hip fracture, wrist fracture, and spine fracture in people with osteoporosis and can improve the T-score. Alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel, ''Atelvia''), ibandronate (Boniva), and zoledronate (Reclast) are bisphosphonates.''To reduce side effects and to enhance absorption of the medicine, all bisphosphonates taken by mouth (orally) should be taken in the morning, on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before breakfast, and with at least 8 ounces (240 ml) of water (not juice). This improves the absorption of the bisphosphonate. Taking ''the pill'' sitting or standing (as well as drinking adequate amounts of liquids) minimizes the chances of ''the pill'' being lodged in the ''esophagus'', where it can cause ulceration and scarring. Patients should also remain upright for at least 30 minutes after taking the pill to avoid reflux of the pill into the esophagus. Newer intravenous bisphosphonates, such as ibandronate (Boniva) and zoledronate (Reclast), bypass the potential esophagus and stomach problems.''Food, calcium, ''iron supplements'', ''vitamins'' with ''minerals'', or antacids containing calcium, magnesium, or aluminum can reduce the absorption of oral bisphosphonates, thereby resulting in loss of effectiveness. Therefore, oral bisphosphonates should be taken with plain water only in the morning before breakfast. Also, no food or drink should be taken for at least 30 minutes afterward.''Alendronate (Fosamax) is a bisphosphonate antiresorptive medication. Alendronate is approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis as well as for osteoporosis that is caused by cortisone-related medications (glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis). Alendronate has been shown to increase bone density and reduce fractures in the spine, hips, and arms. Fosamax is taken by mouth once a week to prevent and treat postmenopausal osteoporosis. Alendronate is the first osteoporosis medication also approved for increasing bone density in men with osteoporosis, either in a daily or a weekly dosing schedule.''Fosamax generally is well tolerated with few side effects. One side effect of alendronate is irritation of the esophagus (the food pipe connecting the mouth to the stomach). Inflammation of the esophagus (''esophagitis'') and ulcers of the esophagus have been reported infrequently with alendronate use.''Risedronate (Actonel, Atelvia) is another bisphosphonate antiresorptive medication. Like alendronate, this drug is approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis as well as for osteoporosis that is caused by cortisone-related medications (glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis). Risedronate is chemically different from alendronate and has less likelihood of causing esophageal irritation. Risedronate also is more potent in preventing the resorption of bone than alendronate.''Ibandronate (Boniva) is a bisphosphonate for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is available in formulations for both daily and monthly oral use as well as for intravenous use every three months.''Zoledronate (Reclast) is a unique intravenous bisphosphonate antiresorptive medication that is given once every year. This formulation seems to have very good ability to strengthen bones and prevent fractures of both spinal and nonspinal bones. The convenience of once-a-year dosing is obvious. As with all bisphosphonates, patients taking Reclast must be taking adequate calcium and vitamin D prior to and after infusion of the medication for optimal results. Generally, patients are given ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') the day of the infusion and for several days afterward to prevent occasional minor muscle and joint aches. The infusion lasts approximately 20-30 minutes. Reclast is used to treat and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and increases bone mass in men with osteoporosis. Reclast is also used to treat and prevent steroid-induced osteoporosis (glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis). Reclast reduces risk of fractures after a low-trauma hip fracture. Reclast should not be used in patients who have had ''avascular necrosis'' or during/prior to ''pregnancy''.''Raloxifene (Evista)''Raloxifene (Evista) belongs to a class of ''drugs'' called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). SERMs work like estrogen in some tissues but as an antiestrogen in other tissues. The SERMs were developed to reap the benefits of estrogen while avoiding the potential side effects of estrogen. Thus, raloxifene can act like estrogen on bone but as an antiestrogen on the lining of the uterus where the effects of estrogen can promote ''cancer''.''The first SERM to reach the market was ''tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex''), which blocks the stimulative effect of estrogen on breast tissue. Tamoxifen has proven valuable in women who have had ''cancer'' in one breast for preventing ''cancer'' in the second breast. Raloxifene is the second SERM to be approved by the FDA. Evista has been approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In a three-year study involving some 600 postmenopausal women, raloxifene was found to increase bone density (and lower ''LDL cholesterol'') while having no detrimental effect on the uterine lining (which means that it is unlikely to cause ''uterine cancer'').''Because of its antiestrogen effects, the most common side effects with Evista are ''hot flashes''. Conversely, because of its estrogenic effects, Evista increases the risk of blood clots, including ''deep vein thrombosis'' (''DVT'') and ''pulmonary embolism'' (blood clots in the lung). The greatest increase in risk occurs during the first four months of use. Patients taking raloxifene should avoid prolonged periods of immobility during travel, when blood clots are more prone to occur. The risk of ''deep vein thrombosis'' with raloxifene is probably comparable to that of estrogen, about two to three times higher than the usual low rate of occurrence. Evista decreases the risk of spinal fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, but it is not known if there is a similar benefit in decreasing the risk of hip fracture. (The only agents that are definitely proven to decrease the risk of hip fracture are bisphosphonates and denosumab.)''Calcitonin (Calcimar, Miacalcin) is a hormone that has been approved by the FDA in the U.S. for treating osteoporosis. Calcitonins come from several animal species, but salmon calcitonin is the one most widely used. Calcitonin can be administered as a shot under the skin (subcutaneously), into the muscle (intramuscularly), or inhaled nasally (intranasally). Intranasal calcitonin is the most convenient of the three methods of administration.''Calcitonin has been shown to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. In women with established osteoporosis, calcitonin has been shown to increase bone density and strength in the spine only.''Calcitonin is a weaker antiresorptive medication than bisphosphonates. Calcitonin is not as effective in increasing bone density and strengthening bone as estrogen and the other antiresorptive agents, particularly bisphosphonates. In addition, it is not as effective as bisphosphonates in reducing the risk of spinal fractures and has not been proven effective in reducing hip fracture risk. Therefore, calcitonin is not the first choice of treatment in women with established osteoporosis. Nevertheless, calcitonin is a helpful alternative treatment for patients who cannot tolerate other medications.''Common side effects of either injected or nasal spray calcitonin are ''nausea'' and flushing. Patients using Miacalcin Nasal Spray can develop nasal irritation, a ''runny nose'', or ''nosebleeds''. Injectable calcitonin can cause local skin redness at the site of injection, skin ''rash'', and flushing.''Teriparatide (Forteo) is a synthetic version of the human hormone, parathyroid hormone, which helps to regulate calcium metabolism. Unlike other medications for osteoporosis that reduce the resorption of bone, teriparatide very effectively promotes the growth of new bone. Forteo is self-injected into the skin. Because long-term safety is not yet established, it is only FDA-approved for 24 months of use. It reduces spinal fractures in women with known osteoporosis, but it is not known if there is a similar reduction in the risk for hip fracture. Generally, after a two-year course of teriparatide the patient is switched to bisphosphonate therapy to maintain bone density.''The latest treatment approved for osteoporosis is denosumab (Prolia), an injectable antibody that blocks a chemical messenger that plays a role in promoting bone thinning by the bone cells that are responsible for bone resorption. Prolia strengthens bone by increasing its density and reduces fractures. Prolia is administered by twice yearly injections under the skin. Denosumab is used for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. Denosumab can cause increased risk of infections and low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia).'  "
Hormone therapy (menopausal hormone therapy),"'Estrogen ''hormone therapy'' after menopause (previously referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' or HRT) has been shown to prevent bone loss, increase bone density, and prevent bone fractures. It is useful in preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Estrogen is available orally (''Premarin'', ''Estrace'', ''Estratest'', and others) or as a skin patch (Estraderm, Vivelle, and others).''Estrogen also is available in combination with ''progesterone'' as pills and patches. Progesterone is routinely given along with estrogen to prevent uterine cancer that might result from estrogen use alone. Women who have had a ''hysterectomy'' (surgical removal of the uterus) may take estrogen alone since they no longer have a uterus to become cancerous. Nasally delivered estrogen and lower-dose combination pills of estrogen and progesterone are also being studied. However, due to adverse effects of HRT, such as increased risks of ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', blood clots in the veins, and ''breast cancer''; HRT is no longer recommended for long-term use in the therapy of osteoporosis. Rather, HRT is used short term to relieve menopausal ''hot flashes''.''Every woman needs to have an individualized discussion regarding HRT with her doctor because each woman will place different weight on the risks and benefits of the treatment.' "
Choosing an osteoporosis medication,"""In choosing a medication for osteoporosis, a physician will consider all aspects of a patient's medical history as well as the severity of the osteoporosis.""'If a postmenopausal woman has other menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and ''vaginal dryness'', HRT will be the proper choice for these menopausal symptoms as well as for the prevention of osteoporosis. After the menopausal symptoms have passed, some other nonestrogen prescription medication will be considered for the longer term.''If the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is the only issue under consideration, then bisphosphonates such as alendronate, ibandronate, or risedronate are more effective than menopausal hormone therapy in preventing osteoporotic fractures and less likely to be associated with substantial adverse effects. So far, bisphosphonates are the most well-studied and effective category of prescription medication for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.''A few serious esophageal conditions preclude the use of oral bisphosphonates, specifically esophageal stricture or ''achalasia''. In these two conditions, it is likely that the bisphosphonate tablets will be retained in the esophagus and lead to esophageal inflammation, ulceration, and scarring. Caution often is advised for people with ''dysphagia'' (trouble swallowing) because the ''dysphagia'' may be a manifestation of a problem in the esophagus that will cause the bisphosphonate tablets to get stuck. Caution also is advised when there is ''gastritis'', duodenitis, or ulcers because of the possibility that the bisphosphonate will aggravate the inflammation associated with these conditions. Any worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms should be reported immediately, but the vast majority of people tolerate bisphosphonates without symptoms when the prescribing directions are followed carefully. Fortunately, ''GERD'' or ''heartburn'', which are common, are not reasons for withholding bisphosphonates but they are considered when selecting optimal treatment for an individual. Prescribing directions should be followed carefully. Moreover, intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronate (Reclast) or injectable denosumab (Prolia), may be given to those with esophageal strictures, achalasia, dysphagia, or gastrointestinal side effects from oral bisphosphonates.''In patients with GERD or who have symptoms of heartburn, risedronate may prove to cause less irritation to the esophagus than alendronate, but now intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronate may be preferred.''Calcitonin is a weaker antiresorptive medication than bisphosphonates. It is reserved for patients who cannot take or will not consider taking other medications. Raloxifene also is a weaker medication for improving bone density or preventing fractures as compared to estrogen or bisphosphonates. In patients with moderate to severe osteoporosis, it is advisable to use the more potent antiresorptive medications (bisphosphonates). In addition, the safety and effectiveness of more than three years of raloxifene, or more than 24 months of teriparatide, have not been well studied.''Estrogen replacement'' and raloxifene differ in their side effects and also in their effects on ''cholesterol levels''. For example, raloxifene does not raise the ""good"" ''HDL cholesterol'' but estrogen replacement does. Both estrogen and raloxifene lower the ""bad"" ''LDL cholesterol''.' "
Prevention of osteoporosis due to long-term corticosteroids,"'The long-term use of corticosteroids (such as prednisone, cortisone, and ''prednisolone'') can lead to osteoporosis. Corticosteroids cause decreased calcium absorption from the intestines, increased loss of calcium through the kidneys in urine, and increased calcium loss from the bones. To prevent bone loss while on long-term corticosteroids, patients should' have an adequate calcium (1,000 mg daily if premenopausal, 1,500 mg daily if postmenopausal) and vitamin D intake (the actual level of Vitamin D can be measured with a simple blood test); however, calcium alone or combined with vitamin D cannot be relied upon to prevent bone loss from corticosteroids unless other prescription medications are added; discuss with their doctor the use of either alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronate, which have been approved for the prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis; discuss with their doctor about having a DXA bone density scan as well as blood testing for calcium, kidney function, and vitamin D prior to beginning therapy and monitoring for osteoporosis during therapy."
Monitoring osteoporosis therapy,"'The American Medical Association and other reputable medical organizations recommend that repeat bone density testing (DXA scans) ''not'' be done for monitoring osteoporosis treatment or prevention on a routine basis. It is sometimes difficult to know just how to use repeated bone density measurements during therapy. Here are a few of the most important reasons:''For all of these reasons, as surprising as it may sound to many people (and even some doctors!), rechecking bone density is not at all like checking ''blood pressure'' during treatment of ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''). Routine bone density testing during treatment may not be helpful. In the future, however, if ongoing research brings new technology or new therapies, testing decisions may change.' Bone density changes so slowly with treatment that the changes are smaller than the measurement error of the machine. In other words, repeat DXA scans cannot distinguish between a real increase in bone density due to treatment and a mere variation in measurement from the machine itself. The real purpose of osteoporosis treatment is to decrease future bone fractures. There is no good correlation between increases in bone density with decreases in fracture risks with treatment. For example, alendronate has been shown to decrease fracture risk by 50% but only to increase bone density by a few percent. In fact, most of the fracture reduction with raloxifene is not explained by raloxifene's effects on bone mineral density. One density measurement taken during treatment will not help the doctor plan or modify treatment. For example, even if the DXA scan shows continued deterioration in bone density during treatment, there is not yet research data demonstrating that changing a medication, combining medications, or doubling medication doses will be safe and helpful in decreasing the future risk of fractures. Even if bone density deteriorates during treatment, it is quite likely that the patient would have lost even more bone density without treatment. Recent research has shown that women who lose bone density after the first year of HRT will gain bone density in the next two years of therapy, whereas women who gain in the first year will tend to lose density in the next two years of therapy. Therefore, bone density during treatment fluctuates naturally, and these fluctuations may not correlate with the prevention of fractures due to the medication."
Prevention of hip fractures in elderly people with osteoporosis,"'Elderly people with osteoporosis can decrease their risk for hip fracture by maintaining muscle strength, coordination, and balance with exercise programs. Throw rugs and animals in pathways of the home should be minimized or eliminated. Good lighting is essential for safe walking to the restroom both day and night.''Additionally, for those elderly people who use canes for walking, etc., it is essential that the rubber tips of the canes are regularly checked for any signs of wear. When this rubber wears through it presents a serious risk of causing the cane (and, therefore, the person) to slip, which can result in serious bodily ''harm -- including'' hip fracture.''Currently, it is not clear as to how long patients with osteoporosis being treated with bisphosphonates should continue the bisphosphonate treatment. Many doctors are interrupting treatment for a ""drug holiday"" off of the drug as it may not be necessary after five to seven years. Guidelines for duration of treatment of osteoporosis with bisphosphonates are being developed.' "
What are complications of osteoporosis?,"'The primary complication of osteoporosis is bone fracture. This may lead to no symptoms or be associated with severe, intractable pain. Recurrent fractures are common and can lead to deteriorating skeletal structure. Occasionally, fractures of the spinal vertebrae can push bone into adjacent nerves and/or spinal cord. This can require neurosurgical intervention. Osteoporotic vertebral fractures can also be relieved by vertebroplasty (kyphoplasty) procedures whereby the collapsed vertebra is inflated by a balloon and a cement (methylmethacrylate) is injected to reform structure to the vertebra.''Repeated vertebral compression fractures can lead to severe deformity of the spine of the chest (''kyphosis'') that can compromise ''breathing'' along with cause extreme loss of height. This can increase the risk of problems with any respiratory infections.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for patients with osteoporosis?,"'The outlook for patients with osteoporosis depends greatly on where fractures occur. Additionally, if treatment is begun when the bone disease is detected early, the outcome is better.''Hip fractures are a particularly dangerous consequence of osteoporosis in the elderly. Approximately 20% of those who experience a hip fracture will die in the year following the fracture. Only one-third of hip-fracture patients regain their pre-fracture level of function. One-third of hip-fracture patients are discharged to a nursing home within the year after fracture.''Newer medications, medicine with different methods of delivery, and research into the optimal management of osteoporosis will bring even better options for health care of patients with osteoporosis in the future. Persons interested in more information about osteoporosis and its treatment options can get information from the National Osteoporosis Foundation.' "
What Is the Goal of Physical Therapy?,"'The goal of physical therapy is to get a person back to the point where he or she can perform normal, everyday activities without difficulty. ''Preserving good range of motion is key to maintain the ability to perform daily activities. Therefore, increasing the range of motion of a joint is the primary focus of physical therapy. Building strength in the involved muscles surrounding the joint also is extremely important, since stronger muscles can better stabilize a weakened joint. ''Physical therapists provide exercises designed to preserve the strength and use of your joints. They can show you the best way to move from one position to another and can also teach you how to use ''walking'' aids such as crutches, a walker or a cane, if necessary. ' "
What Are Some Benefits of Occupational and Physical Therapy?,"'If you have arthritis, there are many benefits to participating in a physical and occupational therapy program, including: ' You gain education about your type of arthritis, so that you can be well 
	informed. If you are overweight, a dietary plan can be created to reduce the 
	stress of excess weight on supporting joints of the back, legs, and feet. As 
	yet, no specific diet -- other than a diet designed for weight loss -- has 
	proved helpful for arthritis. You gain foot-care advice, including choice of well-fitting shoes with 
	shock-absorbing outer soles and sculptured (orthotic) insoles molded exactly 
	to the contour of each foot. You will learn therapeutic methods to relieve discomfort and improve 
	performance through various physical techniques and activity modifications."
What Techniques Will I Learn?,"""You'll learn several techniques, including:"" Rest. Bed rest helps reduce both joint inflammation and pain, and is especially useful when multiple joints are affected and fatigue is a major problem. Individual joint rest is most helpful when arthritis involves one or only a few joints. Custom splints can be made to rest and support inflamed joints and a soft collar can support the neck while you are sitting or standing. Thermal modalities. Applying ice packs or heating pads, as well as deep heat provided by ultrasound and hot packs, can help relieve local pain. Heat also relaxes muscle spasm around inflamed joints. Heating joints and muscles with a warm bath or shower before exercising may help you exercise more easily. Exercise. Exercise is an important part of arthritis treatment that is most effective when done properly every day. Your doctor and therapist will prescribe a program for you that may vary as your needs change."
What Therapy Is Offered for People Recovering From Joint Replacement?,"'Preoperative programs of education and exercise, started before joint replacement surgery, are continued at home. They may be changed in the hospital after surgery to fit new needs during the rehabilitation period. These exercises may be added to your usual exercise regimen, and you may find your ability to exercise has improved after surgery.' "
What Joint Protection Techniques Are Offered?,"'There are ways to reduce the ''stress'' on joints affected by arthritis while participating in daily activities. Some of these include: ''An occupational therapist can show you ways to do everyday tasks without worsening pain or causing joint damage. Some joint protection techniques include: ' Controlling your weight to avoid putting extra stress on weight-bearing 
	joints such as the back, hips, knees, and feet. Being aware of body position, using good posture to protect your back 
	and the joints of your legs and feet. When possible, sit down to do a job 
	instead of standing. Change position often since staying in one position for 
	a long time tends to increase stiffness and pain. Conserving energy by allowing for rest periods, both during the workday 
	and during an activity. Respecting pain. It is your body's way of telling you something is 
	wrong. Don't try an activity that puts strain on joints that are already 
	painful or stiff. Using proper body mechanics for getting in and out of a car, chair or 
	tub, as well as for lifting objects. Using your strongest joints and muscles to reduce the stress on smaller 
	joints. For example, carrying a purse or briefcase with a shoulder strap 
	rather than with your hand. Distributing pressure to minimize stress on any one joint. Lifting 
	dishes with both palms rather than with your fingers and carrying heavy 
	loads in your arms instead of with your hands. If your hands are affected by arthritis, avoid tight gripping, pinching, 
	squeezing, and twisting. Ways to accomplish the same tasks with alternate 
	methods or tools can usually be found."
What Are Assistive Devices for Arthritis?,"'If you have arthritis, many assistive devices have been developed to make activities easier and less stressful for the joints and muscles. Your therapist can suggest devices that will be helpful for tasks you may find difficult at home or at work.''A few examples of helpful devices include a bath ''stool'' for use in the shower or tub, grab bars around the toilet or tub, and long-handled shoehorns or sock grippers. Your therapist can show you catalogs that have a wide variety of assistive devices.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is middle ear infection or inflammation?,"'Middle ear inflammation is also called otitis media. Otitis media is inflammation of the middle ear; however, many doctors consider otitis media to be either inflammation or infection of the middle ear, the area inside the eardrum (tympanic membrane -- see illustration). ""Otitis"" means inflammation of the ear, and ""media"" means middle. This inflammation often begins with infections that cause sore throats, colds, or other respiratory problems, and spreads to the middle ear. Infections can be caused by ''viruses'' or bacteria, and can be acute or chronic. Both ears can be infected at the same time (double ''ear infection''). These infections are not ""swimmer\'s ear"" (also termed ''otitis externa'' or outer ''ear infection'"" because it occurs in the ear canal up to the eardrum), but not beyond. However, some people can have swimmer's ear and a middle ear infection at the same time.""'Acute middle ear infections ''usually are of rapid onset and short duration. They typically are associated with fluid accumulation in the middle ear, signs or symptoms of infections in the ear, a bulging eardrum usually accompanied by pain or a ''perforated eardrum'', and drainage of purulent material (pus, also termed suppurative otitis media). The person also may have a ''fever''.''Chronic middle ear infections'' are a persistent inflammation of the middle ear, typically for a minimum of three months. This is in distinction to an acute ear infection that usually lasts only several weeks. Following an acute infection, fluid (an effusion) may remain behind the eardrum (tympanic membrane) for up to three months before resolving. It may develop after a prolonged period of time with fluid (effusion) or negative pressure behind the eardrum (tympanic membrane). This type of infection can cause ongoing damage to the middle ear and eardrum, and there may be continuing drainage through a hole in the eardrum. Chronic middle ear infections often start painlessly without fever. Ear pressure or popping can be persistent for months. Sometimes a subtle loss of ''hearing'' can result from chronic middle ear infections.' "
What is serious middle ear infection or inflammation?," Serious otitis media is inflammation in the middle ear without infection. Typically, the Eustachian tube is not functioning and cannot ventilate the ear normally. As a result, fluid accumulates in the middle ear. This can lead to a dullness or fullness within the ear along with diminished hearing."
What happens to the eardrum in chronic middle ear infection or inflammation?," The eardrum (tympanic membrane) has three delicate layers that help keep the eardrum thin but strong. A chronic middle ear infection causes changes in the eardrum that weaken it, and often lead to a hole in the eardrum (tympanic membrane perforation). Eventually, the eardrum loses its strength and begins to collapse into the middle ear space. When the eardrum collapses or retracts from negative pressure in the middle ear, it can attach to the other middle ear structures. The eardrum is frequently seen draped around the middle ear bones (ossicles) or the inner wall of the middle ear (promontory). This disrupts the conduction of sound through the middle ear and may diminish hearing."
What happens to the eardrum if a hole develops in the eardrum?,"  A hole that forms in the eardrum (tympanic membrane perforation) usually causes a chronic draining ear, or a condition called chronic otitis media with perforation. Often the drainage (otorrhea) will have a foul odor and can be seen draining from the ear. Hearing can improve after the middle ear fluid is released, or it may worsen secondary to the inflammation in the middle ear."
How common is acute middle ear infection or inflammation?," This type of acute middle ear infection is an extremely common diagnosis. In the U.S., it is estimated that most children experience at least one middle ear infection before the age of three."
Why do infants and young children tend to have ear infections?," The Eustachian tube, a canal that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat, is shorter and more horizontal in infants and young children than in older children and adults. This allows easier entry into the middle ear for the microorganisms that cause infection and leads to otitis media. Young children also have more immature immune systems. The result is that infants and young children are at greater risk of acquiring ear infections than adults."
How does the Eustachian tube change with age?," As a person ages, the Eustachian tube doubles in length and becomes more vertically positioned so that the nasopharyngeal orifice (opening) in the adult is significantly below the tympanic orifice (the opening in the middle ear near the ear drum) than in a child. The greater length and particularly the slope of the tube as it grows serves more effectively to protect, aerate and drain the middle ear."
How do you get a middle ear infection?," Bacteria and viruses can cause middle ear infections. Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas, and Moraxella account for about 85% of cases of acute otitis media. Viruses account for the remaining 15%. Affected infants under 6 weeks of age tend to have infections from a variety of different bacteria in the middle ear."
Common causes of acute and middle ear infection?," Bottle-feeding: The position of the breastfeeding child is better than that of the bottle-feeding position in terms of the function of the Eustachian tube that leads into the middle ear. If an infant needs to be bottle-fed, it's better to hold babies rather than allowing them to lie down with the bottle. Ideally, they should not take the bottle to bed. (In addition to increasing the chance for acute infection, falling asleep with milk in the mouth enhances the risk of tooth decay.) Upper respiratory tract infection: Children often develop upper respiratory infections prior to developing this type of infection. Exposure to groups of children (as in childcare centers) results in more frequent colds, and therefore more earaches. Exposure to air with irritants, such as tobacco smoke Birth defects: Children with cleft palate or Down syndrome are more prone to ear infections. Eustachian tube problems: Any problems with the Eustachian tubes (for example, blockage, malformation, inflammation) will increase the risk of infection. If the individual has allergies, he or she may have swelling and blockage of one or both Eustachian tubes. Immunosuppressed: Individuals with suppressed immune response are at increased risk for ear infections. Ear infections later in childhood: Children who have episodes of acute infections before six months of age tend to have more later in childhood."
What causes chronic middle ear infection or inflammation?," The Eustachian tube normally prevents the accumulation of fluid by allowing fluid to drain through the tube. Chronic otitis media develops over time, and often starts with a chronic middle ear effusion (fluid) that does not resolve. This persistent fluid will often become contaminated with bacteria, and the bacteria found in chronic otitis media are often different from those found in acute otitis media. Therefore, anything that disturbs the function of the Eustachian tube can lead to chronic otitis media. In some individuals that are ill from other diseases, and there is pus draining from the ear, there is a danger that otitis media (especially bacterial-caused) may invade the mastoid bone and reach the brain. These individuals need to be seen urgently by a health care professional. Do not delay treatment by trying home remedies."
"Signs and symptoms of acute middle ear infection in infants, toddlers, and children","'Signs and symptoms of middle ear infections in babies, toddlers, and children may include the following:''These symptoms are often associated with signs of ''upper respiratory infection'' such as a runny or stuffy nose, or a ''cough''.'   Young nonverbal children may be irritable and pull or tug at their ear(s). Young children with middle ear infections may be irritable, fussy, or have problems feeding or sleeping. Older children may complain about pain and fullness in the ear (earache). A child of any age may have a fever. The buildup of pus within the middle ear causes pain and dampens the vibrations of the eardrum (so there is usually temporary hearing loss during the infection). Severe ear infections may cause the eardrum to rupture. The pus then drains from the middle ear into the ear canal. The hole in the eardrum from the rupture usually heals without medical treatment."
Signs and symptoms of middle ear infections in adults, Ear pain Difficulty hearing Ear(s) may feel plugged up Ringing in ears Dizziness Fever Headache Nausea and/or vomiting
Are ear infections contagious?," Ear infections are not contagious. However, many children develop infections following a cold or other viral infection, and those infections are contagious."
Which specialties of doctors treat middle ear infections?," The majority of children and adults are diagnosed and treated by either pediatricians, primary health care doctors, emergency or urgent care medical providers, or other health care professionals. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists may be consulted for some individuals. On rare occasions, a neurologist or neurosurgeon may be needed to treat a severe infection that may extend to other organ systems."
How is acute middle ear infection diagnosed?,"'The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) have determined the criteria needed to diagnose acute otitis media (AOM), acute onset, middle ear effusion (MEE), and middle ear inflammation.''Identification of the three criteria is dependent on clinical observation; middle ear effusion and middle ear inflammation are the most difficult to observe and as a consequence there are studies that suggest acute otitis media is overdiagnosed.' The new guidelines describe this as ""moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane (ear drum) or new onset of otorrhea (ear drainage) not due to external otitis (inflammation of the ear canal) or mild bulging of the ear drum, and recent ear pain (holding, tugging, rubbing ear in a nonverbal child) or intense reddening of the ear drum."" The guideline also strongly recommends that clinicians should not diagnose AOM without the presence of MEE. Recurrent acute otitis media is defined as at least three well-documented and separate acute otitis media episodes in 6 months or four well-documented and separate AOM episodes in the past 12 months with at least one in the past 6 months. There is no definitive lab test for acute otitis media. One method that helps determine acute otitis media versus otitis media with effusion is pneumatic otoscopy (the normal eardrum moves readily with pressure changes) and the appearance of the tympanic membrane (acute otitis media has abnormal appearance; otitis media with effusion does not). However, not everyone is skilled at this technique; pediatricians, family practice physicians, ENT specialists, and ER doctors who work in pediatric ER's are likely to be skilled in the diagnostic procedure."
How is acute middle ear infection or inflammation treated?,"'The treatment for acute otitis media varies depending upon the age and symptoms of the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend the following:''*Observation is an appropriate option only when follow-up can be ensured and antibacterial agents can be started if symptoms persist or worsen within 2-3 days. The guidelines also recommend ""shared decision making"" with the ''caregiver''. Non-severe illness is represented by mild ear pain and fever <39 C (102.2 F) in the past 24 hours. Severe illness is defined as moderate to severe otalgia (ear pain) or any ear pain for at least 48 hours or fever 39 C. These 2013 guidelines are current.''If antibiotics are initiated, ''amoxicillin'' is usually recommended as the first line treatment. This is usually prescribed for 10 days. Some children do not respond within the first 48-72 hours of treatment, and antibiotic therapy may have to be changed. Even after antibiotic treatment, some children are left with some fluid in the middle ear, which can cause temporary hearing loss lasting for up to 3 to 6 weeks. In most children, this fluid eventually disappears spontaneously (on its own). Ceftriaxone (50mg/kg/d) injection is recommended for children who cannot take oral antibiotics; three days of this antibiotic is usually more effective than a single injection.''Children who have recurring bouts of otitis media may be referred to an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist or ENT). Some of these children may benefit from having an ear tube placed (tympanostomy tube) to permit fluid to drain from the middle ear. In addition, if a child has a bulging eardrum and is experiencing severe pain, a procedure to lance the eardrum (myringotomy) may be recommended to release the pus. The eardrum usually heals within a week. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy has not been shown to decrease the frequency of ear infections in those children with recurrent AOM.''Although treatment may cure an ear infection, it is possible for the ear to become re-infected.'  "
How is chronic middle ear infection or inflammation treated?," Initially, antibiotics may resolve the ear infection. If a tympanic membrane perforation also is present, topical antibiotic drops may be used. If eardrum or ossicle scarring has occurred, that will not be reversed with antibiotics alone. Surgery often is indicated to repair the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and remove the infected tissue and scar from the middle ear and the mastoid bone. Long-term prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended."
What are the goals of chronic otitis media surgery?,"'Finally, hearing is to be restored.'   The goals of surgery are to first remove all of the infected tissue so that it can be ""safe"" from recurrent infections. The second goal is to recreate a middle ear space with an intact eardrum. This may seem strange that hearing is the last priority, but if the first two priorities are not met, anything that is done to improve hearing will ultimately fail. If hearing is restored, but the infection returns, the hearing will be lost again. Likewise, if hearing is restored, but the middle ear space is not recreated, the eardrum will re-stick to the middle ear or the ossicles."
Are there any home remedies for acute middle ear infection?,"'There are a number of suggested home remedies for the treatment of ear infections, including''However, there are limited studies suggesting the benefits of these measures over accepted and recommended treatments.'   humidified air, homeopathic treatments, naturopathic ear drops, decongestants, and antihistamines.  Both oral and topical analgesics are effective in controlling the pain associated with ear infections, but the use of decongestants or antihistamines has not been demonstrated to improve symptoms or speed the resolution of acute otitis media."
What limitations are there on a child with middle ear infection or inflammation?," Otitis media is not contagious (although the initial cold that caused it may be). A child with otitis media can travel by airplane but, if the Eustachian tube is not working well, the pressure change as the plane descends may cause the child pain. It is best not to fly (or swim) with a draining ear. You should always consult your doctor if you have specific concerns."
Can otitis media (middle ear infection or inflammation) be prevented?,"  Currently, the best way to prevent acute otitis media is to assure a child is vaccinated. Ensuring that your child receives an annual flu vaccine and is up to date with his/her pneumococcal vaccine is the best way to prevent the most common causes of middle ear infections (otitis media). In addition, both early and sustained breastfeeding (for at least 6 months) and avoidance of tobacco smoke exposure have been shown to be related to fewer ear infections. Recent studies suggest that Xylitol-based gum or lozenges may have a preventive impact on acute otitis media. Unfortunately, it cannot be used in young children, and must be used 3-5 times a day during the cold and flu season to be effective."
"What is ""swimmer's ear"" infection in children and adults?","'External otitis or ""swimmer\'s ear"" in children and adults is an infection of the skin covering the outer ear and ear canal. The ear infection can be short-term (acute) or chronic, which lasts for a long period.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of swimmer's ear in children and adults?,"'Other signs and symptoms of an outer ear infection in children include severe pain when the ear is moved, touched, or itched, and irritability. Outer ''ear infections'' in children also can be causes by middle ''ear infections'' (''otitis media'') or objects placed in the ear.'   The first symptom of infection is the ear feeling full, and it may itch. The ear canal swells, and fluid or puss may come from the ear. Swimmer's ear is very painful, especially with movement of the outside portion of the ear. The ear canal can swell shut, and the side of the face can become swell. A sense of fullness in the ear The lymph nodes of the neck may enlarge, making it difficult or painful to open the jaw. People with swimmer's ear may experience some temporary hearing loss in the infected ear."
What causes acute swimmer's ear infection in children an adults?,"""Acute external otitis (acute swimmer's ear) is a common bacterial infection caused by ""'Streptococcus'', ''Staphylococcus'', or ''Pseudomonas'' bacteria. Usually, bacterial ear infections in children and adults are transmitted through excessive water exposure from swimming, diving, surfing, kayaking, or other water sports. When water collects in the ear canal (frequently trapped by wax), the skin can become soggy, which is an incubator for bacteria to collect and grow. ''Cuts'' or abrasions in the lining of the ear canal (for example, from cotton swab injuries) also can expose the ear canal to a bacterial infection.''Itchy'' ears can drive a person crazy. It can be the first sign of an infection, but if the problem is chronic, it is more likely caused by a chronic ''dermatitis'' of the ear canal. ''Seborrheic dermatitis'' and ''eczema'' can both affect the ear canal. There is really no cure for this problem, but it can be made tolerable with the use of steroid drops and creams. People with these problems are more prone to acute infections as well. Use of ear plugs, alcohol drops, and non-instrumentation of the ear is the best ''prevention'' for infection. Other treatments for ''allergies'' may also help itchy ears.' "

"Can objects, bugs, or insects in the ear cause outer ear infections?","'Young children often will put foreign objects their ear by accident or while scratching or trying to clean their ear. Often, children who put objects in their ear also have swimmer’s ear (external ear infection). Do not try to remove objects stuck in the ear because it can be difficult. Call your pediatrician to have the object safely removed. Usually this can be done in the office, but sometimes, general anesthesia may be necessary to remove the lodged object if it is stuck deeply in the ear or if the child or adult is uncooperative.''Insects or bugs can be trapped in the ear, for example, small gnats can be caught and stuck in the ''earwax''. Often, bugs and insects can washed out with warm water. Larger insects or bugs may not be able to turn around in the narrow canal.

Try to keep the ear free of wax. This may require visits to the doctor to have your ears cleaned. Do not attempt to put anything into the ear canal (such as a swab) to try to remove earwax that is deep within the ear canal. If you already have an ear infection, or if you have a hole in your eardrum, or if you have had ear surgery or ear tubes, first consult your doctor prior to swimming and before you use any type of eardrop. An easy and inexpensive eardrop solution can be made by mixing equal parts of rubbing alcohol and white vinegar (50:50 mixture). This solution will increase the rate of evaporation of water in the ear canal and has antibacterial properties. Using this solution to rinse the ear before and after water exposure can serve as a protective measure against infection. Mineral oil eardrops can be used to protect the ear from water when a dry crusty skin condition exists. A 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide can be used for occasional ear cleaning to help remove earwax that can cause water to build up in the ear. Apply using an ear dropper (about half full). The solution will fizz slightly. Turn your head to the side and pull back on the top of your ear so that the solution fills the ear canal. Afterward, make sure to use one of the methods described above for drying the ear. You can also use a hair dryer on low setting to dry the ear canal. This also can be done after using the drying eardrops."

All states have implemented these screening protocols within hospitals and birthing clinics. Most hearing screening tests are done prior to discharge from the hospital or birthing clinics.''Typically, nurses or medical assistants are trained extensively on how to operate automated equipment for testing infants. Prior to discharge, each newborn has his/her hearing tested. If, for some reason, the newborn does not pass the screen, a rescreen is usually done. If the infant does not pass the second hearing test, he/she is referred to a specialist for further testing.'""Specialists who are experts at testing hearing are called audiologists. Audiologists have had training that emphasizes diagnostic hearing testing techniques as well as hearing rehabilitation of children and adults. Their postgraduate academic training requires a minimum of a master's degree."" "
Why is it important to screen for hearing loss in all newborn infants?,"'Significant ''hearing loss'' is the most common disorder at birth.  Approximately 1%-2% of newborns are affected.''Several national committees, including the National Institutes of Health, the American Academy of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'', have recommended that hearing loss in infants be identified, and when possible treated, prior to 6 months of age. This recommendation is based on studies that have shown that children identified with hearing loss prior to 6 months of age have a better chance of developing skills equivalent to their peers by the time they enter kindergarten. Children not identified until later (for example, it is very common to first identify hearing impaired children at age 2 to 3 years) may ultimately suffer from irreversible and permanent impairments in speech, language, and cognitive abilities when compared to their peers.''Prior to the implementation of hearing screen programs, it was customary to only test those newborns who had known significant risk factors for hearing loss. This group included infants whose mothers suffered from illness during ''pregnancy'', those who had a family history of hearing loss, or those who were exposed to ''drugs'' known to affect hearing. In addition, infants with the following conditions were included for hearing screening:''However, despite the testing of all infants who fell into this ""high-risk registry,"" over half of all newborns with hearing loss were missed!'""In order to identify this large group of hearing-impaired infants not identified with current testing protocols, it is now recommended that all newborns have a hearing test prior to discharge from the hospital. The goal of this program is to identify all hearing-impaired infants at an early age, thereby increasing these children's chance at healthy and more productive lives.""   low birth weight and/or prematurity, or oxygen deprivation or breathing difficulties at birth; high bilirubin levels (yellow color); syndromes associated with hearing loss; abnormal head or face structures; infections such as cytomegalovirus, syphilis, herpes, or toxoplasmosis; or low Apgar scores (which assess several health factors at one and again at five minutes after birth)."
How common is hearing loss in infants?,"'Most permanent hearing loss is due to damage/malfunction of the nerve that transmits sound from the inner ear to the brain (auditory nerve).  For those infants in whom a cause is determined, approximately half have a genetic condition and the remaining half have an acquired condition to explain their hearing loss.' "
What are some of the causes of hearing loss in the newborn?,"'Hearing loss in a newborn can be caused by a number of conditions. Some of the known risk factors include high bilirubin levels (''jaundice''), drugs that are toxic to the ears (for example, medicines that are given to the newborn to battle a serious infection may damage hearing as a side effect), prolonged mechanical ventilation, low Apgar scores, meningitis, prematurity, and/or low birth weight. Malformed structures in the middle or ''outer ear'' can also lead to hearing loss. Viral illness during the pregnancy, such as ''rubella'' (''German measles'') or ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV''), can be passed to the newborn and result in hearing loss. Hearing loss can sometimes be ''inherited'' in abnormal genes passed from the parents to the newborn or be the result of a gene mutation that occurred during ''fetal development''. ''Genetic counseling'' is often recommended for parents to determine if heredity is the cause of the hearing loss. In approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, the cause is never determined.' "
How is hearing in infants tested?,"""Hearing in infants can be tested using two different methods: the auditory brainstem response (ABR) evaluations or the otoacoustic emission (OAE) measures. Both tests are accurate, noninvasive, automated, and do not require any observable response from the infant. Which test is used depends on the screening program's choice of instrumentation and training. For a screening tool, both methods are extremely effective. There are, however, some distinct differences in how the hearing is measured using an ABR versus an OAE."" "
What is an ABR test?,"'In order to process sounds, electrical impulses are transmitted through nerves from our ears to the brainstem at the base of the brain. An auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a physiological measure of the brainstem\'s response to sound. It tests the integrity of the hearing system from the ear to the brainstem. The test is performed by placing four to five electrodes on the infant\'s head, after which a variety of sounds is presented to the infant through small earphones. As the hearing nerve fires, the sound stimulus travels up to the brain. This electrical activity generated by the nerve can be recorded by the electrodes and is represented as waveforms on a computer screen. The audiologist can then present different loudness levels of each sound and determine the softest levels at which the infant can hear. For infant-screening purposes, only one sound is used to test the hearing, commonly referred to as a ""click."" The click is a grouping of several sounds to test a wider area of the hearing organ at one time. The click is typically presented at a loud level and a soft one. If a healthy response is recorded, then the infant has ""passed"" the hearing screen. Testing usually takes five to 15 minutes to complete.' "
What is an OAE evaluation?,"'An otoacoustic emission test (OAE) measures an acoustic response that is produced by the inner ear (cochlea), which in essence bounces back out of the ear in response to a sound stimulus. The test is performed by placing a small probe that contains a microphone and speaker into the infant\'s ear. As the infant rests quietly, sounds are generated in the probe. Once the cochlea processes the sound, an electrical stimulus is sent to the brainstem. In addition, there is a second and separate sound that does not travel up the nerve but comes back out into the infant\'s ear canal. This ""byproduct"" is the otoacoustic emission. The emission is then recorded with the microphone probe and represented pictorially on a computer screen. The audiologist can determine which sounds yielded a response/emission and the strength of those responses. If there is an emission present for those sounds that are critical to speech comprehension, then the infant has ""passed"" the hearing screen.  Testing generally takes about five to eight minutes.' "
"OAEs and ABRs, is one test better than the other?","""Both tests have advantages and disadvantages when used for screening, and depending on the program and experience of the audiologist, either one can be utilized successfully. The OAE is easy and cost-effective. However, the false-positive rate (for example, an infant fails a hearing test but actually has normal hearing) may be higher for an OAE than for an ABR. The false-positive rate for ABR testing is approximately 4% when testing is done during the first three days of life.  The false positive rate for OAE testing is 5%-21% for testing done during the first three days of life.  This large variation between ABR and OAE testing is commonly felt to reflect the OAE testing device's increased sensitivity to residual ""'amniotic fluid'"" and vernix that is commonly found in the neonate's ear canal.""'The two tests, however, rely on different mechanisms of hearing for the screening. For in-depth testing and a complete hearing evaluation of infants, these tests work best together as a complement to each other.' "
What does it mean when an infant does not pass the hearing screen?,"'A newborn who fails an initial hearing screen may not necessarily have a permanent hearing loss or a hearing loss at all. There are many possible reasons why an infant may fail a hearing screening test. One common reason is that fluid from the birth may still be present in the ear canal. This fluid blocks the sound stimulus, preventing it from reaching the inner ear, and therefore causes the newborn to fail. Similarly, fluid in the middle-ear space behind the eardrum (a common site for infection in children) can also block the sound stimulus and lead to a false failed test. After these problems resolve, the infant usually passes the rescreen. Therefore, it is important to have at least one week between the initial hearing screen and the rescreen to allow the newborn a chance to ""dry out.""''Another possible reason for a false failure is excessive noise or movement from the infant during the test. The responses that are recorded with an ABR or OAE are very, very small. Any movement or crying from the infant can prevent the equipment from detecting the response. Therefore, it is important that the newborn is quiet or sleeping for the hearing screen. Feeding the infant just prior to the screening is often very helpful. Although neither test is painful, they are novel experiences for the newborn and can be momentarily upsetting.''If it becomes evident that an infant has a hearing loss, then a full diagnostic exam is necessary to determine the type and amount of hearing loss.' "
What is the difference between a hearing screen and a diagnostic hearing test?,"'The basic difference between a diagnostic test and a hearing screen is the amount of information gathered during the session. For example, if an infant fails the hearing screen, it is unknown if there truly is a hearing loss, how much hearing loss is present, or whether or not the hearing loss is permanent or correctable. A diagnostic test can usually answer these questions. The diagnostic test session is understandably longer and requires more interaction with the infant. Typically, a more extensive ABR is conducted, using a variety of test stimuli. OAEs are also performed to cross-check the results of the ABR. To complete a thorough test, the infant needs to ''sleep'' in the office for upward of 45 minutes. The more information that can be collected, the more complete the results will be.' "
"If an infant does not pass a hearing screen in the hospital, what happens next?","'Most hospital screening programs will refer infants who failed the initial screening test to a secondary center that specializes in more complete testing for diagnosis. Sometimes, simple problems, such as too much  residual amniotic fluid and vernix in the ear canal, will resolve prior to the rescreen and the infant will pass the second test. The rescreen is an important step in determining whether the infant is able to hear, so it should not be taken lightly.''If an infant does not pass the rescreen, then a full diagnostic test will be necessary. This test may be completed at the rescreen site or at another facility, depending on several factors.' "
"If an infant has a hearing loss, what is the next step?","'The ability of an infant to compensate for the hearing loss will depend on both the type and the degree of hearing loss.''The type of hearing loss refers to where in the ear the hearing loss is located and what is causing it. There are two basic types of hearing loss, conductive and sensorineural. A conductive loss is caused by problems in the outer or middle ear. This is the type of loss that results when a child has a middle-''ear infection'', trapped fluid from birth, impacted wax in the outer ear or malformation of the ear and associated structures. It is usually correctable with medical treatment or surgery. Occasionally, a conductive loss cannot be corrected with surgery. However, these children typically do extremely well with hearing aids. A sensorineural loss is indicative of a problem in the inner ear or somewhere along the nerve to the ear (auditory nerve). This type of loss is typically permanent and cannot be corrected with surgery. A hearing aid or a cochlear implant may be utilized in this situation.''The degree of hearing loss refers to the severity of the hearing loss, which can range from mild to profound. Although the term ""mild"" sounds relatively benign, a mild hearing loss in a child who is trying to develop speech and language can have a huge impact on his/her success.'""If the hearing loss, whether it is conductive, sensorineural, or a combination of both, is determined to be uncorrectable by a physician, then the next step is to fit the infant with hearing aids. This is accomplished by a pediatric audiologist who can adjust the hearing aids according to the baby's hearing loss and monitor the infant's progress through regular visits. The infant should also be enrolled in an early childhood intervention program that is often provided through the school system.""""In addition to the early medical or surgical treatment of the hearing loss, parental involvement is essential. Parents need to monitor the child's progress and facilitate and encourage the use of the hearing aids and other therapeutic exercises that are designed to help the child become a careful listener and talker. Research has found that the one common denominator among successful hearing-impaired children is the parent's willingness to help the child throughout his/her lifetime.""'Summary & Recommendations (from the American Academy of Pediatrics Preventative Series Task Force -- July 2008)''Importance: Children with hearing loss have increased difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication skills, increased behavioral problems, decreased psychosocial well-being, and lower educational attainment compared with children with normal hearing.''Detection: Because half of the children with hearing loss have no identifiable risk factors, universal screening (instead of targeted screening) has been proposed to detect children with permanent congenital hearing loss.  There is good evidence that newborn hearing screening testing is highly accurate and leads to earlier identification and treatment of infants with hearing loss.''Benefits of detection and early treatment: Good quality evidence shows that early detection improves lingual outcomes.' "
What are risks and complications of cosmetic ear surgery?,"'Your surgery will be performed safely and with care in order to obtain the best possible results. The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is here for your information only, not to frighten you, but to make you aware and more knowledgeable concerning this surgical procedure.'  Infection of the skin or of the cartilage (chondritis) of the ear. Bleeding or hematoma formation. A cosmetic or functional result that does not meet your expectations. An unfavorable result may occur at any time following surgery, and includes inadequate correction, recurrence, contour distortions, or asymmetric correction, all of which may require secondary surgery. Permanent or temporary numbness of the skin of the ear or face. Scar or keloid formation, which is an overgrowth of scar tissue. Prolonged pain, impaired healing, and the need for hospitalization. Narrowing of the external ear canal. Suture extrusion. When permanent sutures are used to maintain shape, they may become evident through the skin and may eventually require removal. If the surgery is being done because of a tumor, there can be recurrence of the tumor and the need for additional surgery or other therapeutic modalities including radiation therapy or chemotherapy."
What happens before surgery?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either the hospital or the surgicenter. In both facilities, quality care is provided without the expense and inconvenience of an overnight stay. An anesthesiologist will monitor you throughout the procedure. Usually, the anesthesiologist will call the night before surgery to review the medical history. If he or she is unable to reach you the night before surgery, they will talk with you that morning. If your doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, you should arrange to have these done several days in advance.''You should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days of the date of your surgery. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications (such as ''Advil'', ''Naprosyn'', ''Nuprin'') should not be taken within 4-7 days of the date of surgery depending on the preparation. Many over-the- counter products contain aspirin or antinflammatory ''drugs'"". So it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question, please call your doctor's office or consult your pharmacist. ""'Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Usually your doctor will give you your prescriptions at the preoperative visit. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of your surgery. ''You must not eat or drink anything 6 hour prior to the time of surgery. This includes even water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication. ''Smokers'' should make every effort to stop ''smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding. If you are sick or have a ''fever'' the day before surgery, call the office. If you wake up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. Your doctor will decide if it is safe to proceed with surgery.' "
What happens on the day of surgery?,"'It is important that you know precisely what time you are to check in with the surgical facility, and that you allow sufficient preparation time. Bring all papers and forms with you including any preoperative orders and history sheets. You should wear comfortable loose fitting clothes which do not have to be pulled over the head. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. Remove all make-up with a cleansing cream. Thoroughly wash your face with soap and water. Do not apply make-up or cream to your face.''Do not take any medication unless instructed by your doctor or the anesthesiologist. Usually in the pre- operative holding room, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) and you may be given a medication to help you relax.' "
What happens during surgery?,"'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a ''gas'' and an intravenous medication to put you to ''sleep'' and to maintain your anesthetic at a safe and comfortable level. During the procedure, you will be continuously monitored including ''blood pressure'', pulse, oxygen saturation (pulse oximeter), and ''heart'' rhythm (''EKG''). The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room.''Depending on what is required and whether or not you are also undergoing additional procedures, the surgery may take several hours. Your doctor will typically come to the waiting room to talk with any family or friends once you are safely to the recovery room.' "
What happens after surgery?,"'After surgery, you will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor you. You will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once you have fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. You will need a friend or family member to pick you up from the surgical facility and to take you home. He or she should spend the first night after surgery with you. When you arrive home from the surgical facility, you should go to bed and rest with your head elevated on 2-3 pillows. By keeping your head elevated above your heart, you can minimize ''edema'' and swelling. You may get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom. It is best to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated once you have recovered fully from the anesthetic. Avoid hot liquids for several days. Even though you may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to go slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, you may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery; if it persists, your doctor may prescribe medication to settle the stomach. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''You will be prescribed antibiotics after surgery, and should finish all the pills that have been ordered. Some form of a narcotic will also be prescribed (typically ''hydrocodone''/''Vicodin''), and is to be taken as needed. If you require narcotics you are cautioned not to drive. In some situations your doctor may give you steroids to be taken either preoperatively and/or post-operatively. It is very important that you take this medication as prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. If you have ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'' post-operatively, you may be prescribed medications for nausea (anti-emesis), such as phenergan. If you have any questions or you feel that you are developing a reaction to any of these medications, you should consult your doctor. You should not take any other medication, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless you have discussed it with your doctor.' "
What are the general instructions and follow-up care?,"'In most situations, a bandage will have been placed to cover the ''wound''. If you are undergoing an otoplasty, a compressive dressing will be placed. You should not remove the dressing because these are holding the external ears in the appropriate position. Your doctor will probably check the ear the next day in the office. If you experience severe ''pain'' on only one side, please call the office to report this to the doctor. It may be the first indication of a hematoma. Unless instructed otherwise, the bandages should remain in place for one week. At this time, you are asked to return to the office to have the sutures removed. We usually recommend that you wear an elastic band (ear band-it) at night for the next 6 weeks. It is best to wear the band even during the day when it is ""socially acceptable"". We discourage facial tanning for 6 months after surgery. If you must be in the sun you should use a number 15 or greater sun block. You may use your usual make-up anytime after surgery. Do not wear earrings or glasses (if possible) for 3 weeks.''After the bandages have been removed, clean the wound with a Q-tip soaked in hydrogen peroxide to remove all crusts. By gently removing all crusts, the wound edges will heal better with a less obvious scar. Apply polysporin ointment, or a similar antibiotic ointment of your choice, to the cleaned wound. If you develop a ''rash'', discontinue the ointment and notify your surgeon. You may wash you face and hair after the bandages have been removed. Avoid excessive scrubbing of the wound.''Use a gentle soap and shampoo. We ask that you stay out of the pool for several weeks, and after that to wear the ear band-it for the next 6 weeks. Numbness, slight swelling, ''itching'', and discoloration are normal complaints, and should go away with time. You should plan to stay in town for 3 weeks to allow for after-surgery (postoperative) care.' A fever greater than 101.5 degrees F which persists despite increasing the amount of fluid you drink and acetaminophen (Tylenol). A person with a fever should try to drink approximately one cup of fluid each waking hour.  Persistent sharp pain or severe one- sided pain which is not relieved by the pain medication you were prescribed. Increased swelling or redness of the ears. Drainage from the wound."
What is ovarian cancer? What are the types of ovarian cancer?,"'The term ''ovarian cancer'' includes several different types of cancer (uncontrolled division of abnormal cells that can form tumors) that all arise from cells of the ovary. Most commonly, tumors arise from the epithelium, or lining cells, of the ovary. These include epithelial ovarian (from the cells on the surface of the ovary), fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal (the lining inside the abdomen that coats many abdominal structures) cancers. These are all considered to be one disease process. There is also an entity called ovarian low malignant potential tumor; these tumors have some of the microscopic features of a cancer, but tend not to spread like typical cancers.''There are also fewer common forms of ovarian cancer that come from within the ovary itself, including germ cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors. All of these diseases as well as their treatment will be discussed.' "
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC),"'Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) or ovarian carcinoma accounts for a majority (85%-90%) of all ovarian cancers. It is generally thought of as one of three types of cancer that include ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal (lining tissues of the pelvis and abdomen) cancer. All three tumors types behave and are treated the same way. The four most common tumor cell types of epithelial ovarian cancer are serous, mucinous, clear cell, and endometrioid. These cancers arise due to DNA changes in cells that lead to the development of cancer. The serous cell type is the most common variety. It is now thought that many of these cancers actually come from the lining in the fallopian tube, and fewer of them from the cells on the surface of the ovary, or the peritoneum. However, it is often hard to identify the sources of these cancers when they are found at advanced stages, which is very common.' "
Ovarian low malignant potential tumor (OLMPT; borderline tumor),"'Ovarian tumors of low malignant potential (OLMPT; formerly referred to as borderline tumors) account for about 15% of EOC. They are most often serous or mucinous cell types. They often develop into large masses that may cause symptoms, but they only rarely ''metastasize'', that is, spread to other areas. Often, removal of the tumor, even at more advanced stages, can be a cure.' "
Germ cell ovarian cancers,"'Germ cell tumors arise from the reproductive cells of the ovary. These tumors are uncommon and are seen most commonly in ''teens'' or young women. This type of tumor includes different categories: dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, embryonal carcinomas, polyembryomas, non-gestational choriocarcinomas, immature teratomas, and mixed germ cell tumors.' "
Stromal ovarian cancers,"'Another category of ovarian tumor is the sex cord-stromal tumors. These arise from supporting tissues within the ovary itself. As with germ cell tumors, these are uncommon. These cancers come from various types of cells within the ovary. They are much less common than the epithelial tumors. Stromal ovarian cancers (hormone-producing tumors) include granulosa-stromal tumors and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors.' "
What are ovarian cancer statistics?,"'According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), there are over 22,000 cases of ovarian cancer and almost 14,000 deaths from the condition each year. The vast majority of the cases are EOC and are found at stage 3 or later, meaning the cancer has spread beyond the pelvis or to the ''lymph nodes''. This is mostly due to the lack of definite symptoms and signs at the early stages of cancer growth. Around 1.2% of women will be diagnosed with cancer of the ovary at some point in life, thus, it is relatively rare. The median age of diagnosis is 63. However, approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed between ages 35 and 54. Caucasian women have the highest rate of diagnosis. The incidence rates for ovarian cancer have been declining slightly over the past 10 years in the U.S., by about 1.9% per year. Death rates have also fallen an average of 2.2% per year.''Like many other cancers, when ovarian cancer is found at an early stage (for example, localized to the ovary or fallopian tube) the average survival rate at five years is very good (about 93%); most women at stage 1 will still be alive at five years. However, the five-year average survival rate for all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer is only 48.6%. This is because it is often found at an advanced stage in which the disease has already spread within the abdomen.''Survival is also dependent on the type of care the patient receives. Women suspected of having ovarian cancer should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist. These are physicians with special training in gynecologic (ovarian, uterine, cervical, vulvar, and vaginal) cancers. If a woman does not involve a doctor with this specialized training in her care, then studies show that her survival is significantly worse, often by many years. For this reason, every woman with this disease ideally will obtain a referral to a gynecologic oncologist before she starts any treatment or has any surgery.' "
What are ovarian cancer risk factors?,"'Risk factors are related to two major categories: menstrual cycles (''ovulation'') and family history. The more a woman ovulates (cycles) over her lifetime, the higher her risk of ovarian cancer. Thus starting her period (menarche) at a younger age, ending her periods (''menopause'') at a late age, and never ''getting pregnant'' (nulliparity) are all risk factors. ''Up to 25% of ovarian cancers are related to family cancer syndromes. Because of this, current guidelines suggest that all women with ovarian cancer should undergo testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene changes (mutations). All patients with ovarian cancer will ideally discuss this topic with their doctor. These gene mutations can affect males as well as females. If a patient is positive for one of these, then her siblings and her children can be tested as well. Testing involves a simple blood test. The results of this test can greatly affect how family members are monitored for various cancers, including ''breast cancer'', and family members of both sexes are encouraged to be tested.'""BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that have been identified with hereditary cancer risk. BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase a woman's risk of ""'breast cancer'', for example. When compared with the general population risk (1.3% of women will develop ovarian cancer), women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations have a 35%-70% (BRCA1) or 10%-30% (BRCA2) chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetime. Lynch syndrome (typically colon and ''uterine cancer'""), Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Cowden's syndrome are other conditions associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer but are less common.""'The less common varieties of ovarian cancer (borderline, germ cell, and stromal tumors) have few definable risk factors. The germ cell tumors often seen at younger ages and are treated very differently both surgically and chemotherapeutically.' "
What are ovarian cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Screening tests are used to test a healthy population in an attempt to diagnose a disease at an early stage. Unfortunately, there are no good screening tests for ovarian cancer, despite extensive ongoing research. Imaging (pelvic or abdominal ''ultrasound'', ''X-rays'', and ''CT scans''), and blood tests should not be used as a screen, as they are inaccurate and lead many women to surgery who do not need it (they are false positive tests).''Diagnosis of ovarian cancer is often suspected based on symptoms and physical exam, and these are followed by imaging. The ''cancer symptoms'' and signs, when present, are very vague. ''Ovarian cancer symptoms'' and signs can include ''fatigue'', getting full quickly (early satiety), ''abdominal swelling''\xa0and ''bloating'', clothes suddenly not fitting, ''leg swelling'', changes in bowel habits, changes in bladder habits, ''abdominal pain'', and ''shortness of breath''. As mentioned above, these symptoms can be very subtle and vague, as well as very common. This only makes diagnosing the disease that much more difficult. Some studies suggest that the average patient with ovarian cancer sees up to three different doctors prior to obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Often, it is the persistence of the patient that leads to a diagnosis. OLMPT and some benign tumors can present with similar symptoms. In addition, they are often seen with very large masses in the ovary. Often these masses are large enough to cause bloating, abdominal distension, ''constipation'', and changes in bladder habits.''In the more uncommon ovarian types (stromal and germ cell tumors), symptoms are similar. Sometimes, granulosa cell tumors (granulosa-theca cell tumors) can occur with severe ''pain'' and blood in the belly from a ruptured tumor. These can often be confused with a ruptured ''ectopic pregnancy'', as they tend to be found in women of reproductive age.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose ovarian cancer?,"'Often vague symptoms eventually lead to a clinical diagnosis, or one based on suspicion generated by exams (for example, a ''pelvic exam'' that detects a mass or lump that is abnormal), laboratory tests, and imaging. However, an accurate diagnosis requires some of the mass or tumor to be removed, either by biopsy (less often), or preferably, surgery to verify the diagnosis. Often a high clinical suspicion can trigger a referral to a gynecologic oncologist.''Various types of imaging studies can be used to preliminarily diagnose this disease and lead to tissue sampling. Pelvic or abdominal ultrasound and CT scans are the most commonly done studies. These often can give images that show masses in the abdomen and pelvis, fluid in the abdominal ''cavity'' (''ascites''), obstructions of the bowels or kidneys, or disease in the chest or ''liver''. Many times, this is all that is necessary to trigger a referral to a specialist, as the suspicion for ovarian cancer can be quite high. PET scans can be used but often are not necessary if a ''CT scan'' is able to be performed.''Blood work can be helpful as well. The ''CA-125'' is a blood test that is often, but not always, elevated with ovarian cancer. If a ''postmenopausal'' woman has a mass and an elevated CA-125, she has an extremely high risk of having a cancer. However, in younger women, CA-125 is extraordinarily inaccurate. It is elevated by a large number of disease processes, including but not limited to, ''diverticulitis'', ''pregnancy'', ''irritable bowel syndrome'', ''appendicitis'', ''liver disease'', stomach disease, and more. No one should get this test done unless they actually have a mass, or their doctor has some reason to get it. It should not be drawn just to see the level since it is not a reliable screening test for ovarian cancer.''HE4 is another blood test that is used in the U.S. to monitor patients with ovarian cancer to see if their cancer has recurred. Like CA-125, the HE4 test does not always detect cancer.''OVA-1, ROMA, and Overa are examples of blood tests that are used to help doctors determine the likelihood that an identified mass will be cancerous. These tests are still under review as ways to aid a doctor in planning for surgery when a mass is found.'  "
How do medical professionals determine ovarian cancer staging?,"'Staging is the process of classifying a tumor according to the extent to which it has spread in the body at the time of diagnosis.''Ovarian cancer staging:''Complete staging of an ovarian cancer includes ''hysterectomy'', removal of the ovaries, tubes, pelvic and aortic lymph node biopsies or dissection, biopsies of the omentum (a large fatty structure that provides support for abdominal organs), and peritoneal (lining tissue of the abdomen) biopsies.''Ovarian cancer staging is determined surgically, unless it is stage 4 (''metastasis'' outside of the abdomen, or metastasis to the liver -- not on the surface of the liver). If it is stage 4, or very advanced stage 3, then often this is proven with biopsy, and chemotherapy may start neoadjuvantly (before surgery). If the disease is not obviously stage 4, then aggressive surgical staging and debulking (see next section) often is considered. This decision is based on the health of the patient, as well as the judgment of the surgeon as to the chance of achieving an optimal debulking (see treatment below).'

What are ovarian cancer treatment options?,"'Epithelial ovarian cancer treatment most often consists of surgery and chemotherapy. The order is best determined by a gynecologic oncologist.''Surgery is used for both staging and debulking. Staging is the determination of the extent to which as cancer has spread in the body. Debulking is removing as much of the tumor as possible. This surgery usually results in removal of both tubes and ovaries (known as salpingo-''oophorectomy''), the uterus (hysterectomy), removal of the omentum (omentectomy -- a large fat pad that hangs off of the colon), lymph node biopsies, and any other organ involved in the disease. This can mean a portion of the small bowel, large bowel, liver, the spleen, the gallbladder, a portion of the stomach, a portion of the ''diaphragm'', and removal of a portion of the peritoneum (a thin lining in the abdomen that covers many of the organs and the inside of the abdominal wall). Done properly, this can be a very extensive surgery. The patients who live the longest have all of the visible nodules taken out at time of surgery. To accomplish an ""optimal debulking,"" at minimum, no individual nodule greater than 1 cm should be left behind. If this cannot be done, the patient is brought back to the operating room for a second surgery after a few rounds of chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery).''It should be noted that now many gynecologic oncologists believe that optimal debulking should mean that there is no visible disease left at the time of surgery. This has been a shift over the last years. Historically, the goal was to leave no individual nodule greater than 2 cm behind. This has steadily progressed to the point where the term optimal debulking is now accepted by many to mean that there is no disease left to remove. As we have progressed to this point, surgery has become more involved, on a more routine basis. This has led to a concern about undertreatment of elderly patients due to a fear that they cannot survive the surgical risks.''Any patient healthy enough to tolerate chemotherapy will often benefit greatly from its use. The ''drugs'' used in ovarian cancer tend to have fewer side effects, and thus are easier to tolerate than many other chemotherapy drugs. Currently, there are two ways to give chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Traditionally, it is given into the vein intravenously (IV). When initially diagnosed, the usual first-line approach is to give a combination of a platinum drug (typically carboplatin) and a taxane drug, such as paclitaxel (''Taxol'') or ''docetaxel'' (''Taxotere'').''Another way of giving the chemotherapy is to place it directly into the abdomen (intraperitoneal or IP). In many studies, intraperitoneal administration has been shown to significantly increase survival. This is most often used after optimal surgical debulking. Currently, the drugs used are cisplatin and paclitaxel.''Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other treatments to identify and attack (target) specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.''The drug bevacizumab is an example of targeted therapy that has been used in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab (''Avastin'') is a monoclonal antibody that targets the development of blood vessels by a tumor.''Other targeted therapies for ovarian cancer include a group of drugs known as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARP inhibitors). These drugs block an enzyme necessary for DNA repair and may cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib (Lynparza) and niraparib (Zejula) are examples of PARP inhibitors that may be used to treat advanced ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy drugs that work to prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Cediranib is an angiogenesis inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.''Stromal and germ cell ovarian tumors are most often treated with a combination of chemotherapy drugs. There is much less research on these as they are more curable and much less common than epithelial tumors. Because of their rarity, it will be very difficult to find effective new treatments.''The Gynecologic ''Oncology'' Group is a national organization that sponsors ''clinical trials'' in gynecologic cancers. Patients can ask their physician if they are eligible for a clinical trial that may help them, as this is how new drugs are discovered. If a doctor or hospital does not participate in the GOG trials, a doctor can often contact a regional center that does.'""Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. It is now used in the management of a number of different types of cancer. With immunotherapy, substances made by the body or made synthetically are used to strengthen the body's natural defenses against cancer.""  "
What is the survival rate and prognosis of ovarian cancer?,"'Epithelial ovarian cancer is the deadliest of the gynecologic cancers. Approximately 80% of patients will eventually die of the disease. However, survival in the short term is quite good, meaning many years. With the addition of IP chemotherapy, the survival of ovarian cancer has been significantly extended. According to studies, if a patient undergoes optimal debulking followed by IP chemotherapy, then they have a greater than 50% chance to still be alive in six years. This is quite good compared to other advanced stage cancers. Even in the recurrent setting, epithelial ovarian cancer is often very sensitive to chemotherapy. The disease can often go in to complete remission (no detectable disease) many times. However, once it recurs, it is not curable and will continue to come back, although drugs may treat recurrent ovarian cancers and prolong survival.''Germ cell and stromal tumors have a much better prognosis. They are often cured because they are more often detected at early stages.' "
Is it possible to prevent ovarian cancer?,"'There is no way to truly prevent ovarian cancer. One would think that removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries would prevent the disease but this is not always the case (primary peritoneal cancer can arise in the pelvis even after the ovaries have been removed). However, there are ways to significantly reduce your risk. If a woman takes ''birth control pills'' for more than 10 years, then her risk of ovarian cancer drops significantly. ''Tubal ligation'' has long been known to decrease the risk of ovarian cancer. Recently, removal of the entire tube has been shown to further decrease the risk. This procedure, called a salpingectomy, can be considered by any woman considering a tubal ligation. Removal of the ovaries does decrease the risk of cancer, but at the cost of increasing death due to ''heart disease'' and other causes. Currently, this procedure is often saved for specific situations (genetic risk, family history) in patients under 60 to 65 years of age and is not used in the general population. Until recently, if a woman was close to ''menopause'' and was undergoing surgery, then the ovaries and tubes would be removed. The recent studies indicating that many of these cancers actually come from the fallopian tube, and the studies indicating that removal of even postmenopausal ovaries causes other problems has caused a significant shift in this philosophy. Certainly, the tubes should be removed at the time of hysterectomy for any woman. The need for removal of the ovaries is much more uncertain.''Genetic abnormalities are an exception to this recommendation. If a patient is positive for a BRCA or Lynch syndrome genetic defect (mutation), then the patient should strongly consider removal of her tubes and ovaries to decrease the chance of her getting a cancer. Women with these mutations are at a very high risk of ovarian cancer, and in this situation the risk of ''heart disease'' is not as significant as dying of one of these cancers. This can be planned at the end of child bearing, or at age 35. Each patient is recommended to discuss this with her doctor, or a genetic counselor.' "
How does one cope with ovarian cancer?,"'A diagnosis of cancer is often accompanied by the emotional side effects of ''anxiety'', fear, and ''depression''. Just as treatments are designed to help fight cancer growth and spread, self-care and support measures to help one handle the emotional aspect of the diagnosis can be extremely valuable.''Many hospitals and cancer treatment centers offer cancer support groups and counseling services to help manage the trying emotional side effects of cancer and its treatment. There are also a number of valuable online resources for both patients and families.''For example, the ''American Cancer Society'' offers tips on coping with cancer in everyday life; coping checklists for patients and caregivers; managing anger, fear, and ''depression''; and a series of online ""I can cope"" classes through their website.''The National Ovarian Cancer Coalition (NOCC) also offers online resources on coping with ovarian cancer.''The ''National Cancer Institute'' offers a variety of patient education publications about coping with the effects of cancer and its treatment on everyday life, including materials for caregivers and family.' "
What should I know about ovarian cysts?," Ovarian cysts are closed, sac-like structures within the ovary that are filled with a liquid or semisolid substance. Ovarian cysts may not cause signs or symptoms. Larger cysts are more likely to cause signs and symptoms such as:Pain in the abdomen, pelvis, sometimes radiating to the low back, is the most common symptomFeeling of bloating or indigestionIncreased abdominal girthFeeling an urge to have a bowel movement or having difficult, painful bowel movementsPain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia)Pain in the lower right or left quadrant of the abdomen on one sideNausea and vomiting Pain in the abdomen, pelvis, sometimes radiating to the low back, is the most common symptom Feeling of bloating or indigestion Increased abdominal girth Feeling an urge to have a bowel movement or having difficult, painful bowel movements Pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) Pain in the lower right or left quadrant of the abdomen on one side Nausea and vomiting There are many causes and types of ovarian cysts, for example, follicular cysts, ""chocolate cysts,"" dermoid cysts, and cysts due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Most ovarian cysts are not cancerous. Most ovarian cysts are diagnosed with ultrasound or physical examination. Transvaginal ultrasound is a common way to examine ovarian cysts. The treatment of an ovarian cyst depends upon the cause of the cyst and varies from observation and monitoring to surgical treatment. Rupture of an ovarian cyst is a complication that sometimes produces severe pain and internal bleeding. A ruptured (burst) ovarian cyst usually causes pain on one side that comes on suddenly."
"What 
are the ovaries 
and how big are they?","'The ovary is one of a pair of reproductive glands in women that are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of a walnut. The ovaries produce eggs (ova) and the female hormones estrogen and ''progesterone''. The ovaries are the main source of female hormones, which control the development of female body characteristics such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. They also regulate the ''menstrual cycle'' and ''pregnancy''.' "
What are ovarian cysts?,"'Ovarian cysts are closed, sac-like structures within an ovary that contain a liquid, or semisolid substance. ""Cyst"" is merely a general term for a fluid-filled structure, which may or may not represent a ''tumor'' or neoplasm (new growth). If it is a tumor, it may be benign or ''malignant''. The ovary is also referred to as the female gonad.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of ovarian cysts?,"'Most ovarian cysts are never noticed and resolve without women ever realizing that they are there. When a cyst causes symptoms, pain in the abdomen or pelvis is the most common one. The pain can be caused from:''If the cyst has reached a large size, other symptoms may arise as a result of pressure or distortion of adjacent anatomical structures. These other symptoms can include'   rupture of the cyst, rapid growth and stretching, bleeding into the cyst, or twisting of the cyst around its blood supply (known as torsion). abdominal fullness, expansion of the abdomen, or bloating, low back pain, indigestion, feeling full after eating only a small amount (early satiety), urinary urgency, difficulty with emptying the bladder completely, feeling an urge to defecate having difficult bowel movements, or pain with sexual intercourse."
What are the symptoms of a ruptured ovarian cyst?,"'A ruptured (burst) ovarian cyst will not always cause symptoms, particularly if the cyst is small. However, sometimes a ruptured ovarian cyst can lead to severe pain and internal bleeding. The pain with a ruptured ovarian cyst typically comes on suddenly and occurs on one side only. The pain may begin during physical activity such as vigorous ''exercise'' or may begin during sexual intercourse. A ruptured ovarian cyst usually does not cause ''fever'' or gastrointestinal symptoms.' "
What causes ovarian cysts? What are the types of ovarian cysts?,"'There are many causes of ovarian cysts, and most ovarian cysts are not cancerous.' Follicular cysts: The most common type is a follicular cyst, which results from the growth of a follicle. A follicle is the normal fluid-filled sac that contains an egg. Follicular cysts form when the follicle grows larger than normal during the menstrual cycle and does not open to release the egg. Usually, follicular cysts resolve on their own over the course of days to months. Follicular cysts can contain blood (hemorrhagic cysts) from leakage of blood into the egg sac. Corpus luteum cysts: A Corpus luteum cyst is related to the menstrual cycle. The corpus luteum is an area of tissue within the ovary that occurs after an egg has been released from a follicle. If a pregnancy doesn't occur, the corpus luteum usually breaks down and disappears. It may, however, fill with fluid or blood and persist as a cyst on the ovary. Usually, this cyst is found on only one side, produces no symptoms and resolves spontaneously. ""Chocolate cysts:"" Endometriosis is a condition in which cells that normally grow inside as a lining of the uterus (womb), instead grow outside of the uterus in other locations. The ovary is a common site for endometriosis. When endometriosis involves the ovary, the area of endometrial tissue may grow and bleed over time, forming a blood-filled cyst with red- or brown-colored contents called an endometrioma, sometimes referred to as a ""chocolate cyst."" Polycystic ovarian syndrome: The condition known as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by the presence of multiple small cysts within both ovaries. PCOS is associated with a number of hormonal problems and is the most common cause of infertility in women. Dermoid cysts (benign cystic teratomas): Both benign and malignant tumors of the ovary may also be cystic. Occasionally, the tissues of the ovary develop abnormally to form other body tissues such as hair or teeth. Cysts with these abnormal tissues are really tumors called benign cystic teratomas or dermoid cysts. Tubo-ovarian abscesses: Infections of the pelvic organs can involve the ovaries and Fallopian tubes. In severe cases, pus-filled cystic spaces may be present on, in, or around the ovary or tubes. These are known as tubo-ovarian abscesses."
Can ovarian cysts cause cancer?,"'Most ovarian cysts are not due to ''cancer'', and having an ovarian cyst does not cause ''ovarian cancer''. However, some ovarian ''cancers'' develop cystic areas inside the tumor. ''Ovarian cancer'' is much less common than benign ovarian cysts.' "
What about ovarian cysts during pregnancy?,"'Ovarian cysts are sometimes discovered during pregnancy. In most cases, they are an incidental finding at the time of routine ''prenatal ultrasound'' screening. The majority of ovarian cysts found during pregnancy are benign conditions that do not require surgical intervention. However, surgery may be indicated if there is a suspicion of ''malignancy'', if an acute complication such as rupture or torsion (twisting of the cyst, disrupting the blood supply) develops, or if the size of the cyst is likely to present problems with the pregnancy.'  "
Can a woman get ovarian cysts during menopase or postmenopause?,"""Ovarian cysts may develop during pregnancy or at any point in a woman's life. Some kinds of ovarian cysts are related to the menstrual cycle and occur before a woman has reached ""'menopause'' (the time point at which a women has not had a ''menstrual period'' for 12 consecutive months). However, ''postmenopausal'' women may still develop other types of ovarian cysts.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat ovarian cysts?,'Gynecologists-obstetricians are the medical specialists most likely to treat ovarian cysts.' 
How are ovarian cysts diagnosed?,"'Sometimes ovarian cysts may be noticed by a doctor during a bimanual examination of the pelvis. If a cyst is suspected based upon symptoms or physical examination, imaging techniques are used. Most cysts are diagnosed by ultrasound, which is the best imaging technique for detecting them. Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce an image of structures within the body. Ultrasound imaging is painless and harmless. Transvaginal ultrasound is a diagnostic tool to better visualize the ovaries using a thin ultrasound probe inside the vagina.''Cysts can also be detected with other imaging methods, such as ''CT scan'' or ''MRI'' scan (''magnetic resonance imaging'').''Functional ovarian cysts:'"" If a woman is in her 40's, or younger, and has regular menstrual periods, most ovarian masses are ""'""functional ovarian cysts,""'' which are not really abnormal. Examples include follicular cysts and corpus luteum cysts. These are related to the process of ''ovulation'"" that happens with the menstrual cycle. They usually disappear on their own during a future menstrual cycle. Therefore, especially in women in their 20's and 30's, these cysts are watched for a few menstrual cycles to verify that they disappear.""'Cancer'' risks: ''Ovarian cancer'' is rare in women younger than age 40. After age 40, an ovarian cyst has a higher chance of being cancerous than before age 40, although most ovarian cysts are still benign even after age 40. ''CA-125'' blood testing can be used as a marker of ovarian ''cancer'', but it does not always represent cancer, even when it is abnormal, and it may be normal in the presence of malignancy. CA-125 is a protein that is elevated in the bloodstream of many women with advanced ovarian cancer.' Because oral contraceptives work by preventing ovulation, physicians will not generally expect women who are taking oral contraceptives to have common ""functional ovarian cysts."" These women do not have functional ovarian cysts. They may receive further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound or possibly surgical intervention. Functional ovarian cysts do not occur in women after they have reached menopause. Small cystic arrested follicles may persist in the ovary after menopause. Other factors are helpful in evaluating ovarian cysts (besides the woman's age, or whether she is taking oral contraceptives). A cyst that contains a simple sac of fluid on ultrasound is more likely to be a benign neoplasm than a cyst with solid tissue in it. So the ultrasound appearance also plays a role in determining the level of suspicion regarding an ovarian tumor. First, many benign conditions in women of childbearing age can cause the CA-125 level to be elevated, so CA-125 is not a specific test, especially in younger women. Pelvic infections, uterine fibroids, pregnancy, benign (hemorrhagic) ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and liver disease are some of the conditions that may elevate blood CA-125 levels in the absence of ovarian cancer. Second, even if the woman has an ovarian cancer, not all ovarian cancers will cause the CA-125 level to be elevated. Furthermore, CA-125 levels can be abnormally high in women with breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer."
What is the treatment for ovarian cysts?,"'Most ovarian cysts in women of childbearing age are follicular or corpus luteum cysts (functional cysts) that disappear naturally in one to three months, although they can rupture and cause pain. They are benign and have no long-term medical consequences. They may be diagnosed coincidentally during a pelvic examination in women who do not have any related symptoms. All women have follicular cysts at some point that generally go unnoticed.''Ultrasound is useful to determine if the cyst is simple (just fluid with no solid tissue, suggesting a benign condition) or compound (with solid components that often requires surgical resection).'""In summary, the ideal treatment of ovarian cysts depends on the likely cause of the cysts and whether or not it is producing symptoms. The woman's age, the size (and any change in size) of the cyst, and the cyst's appearance on ultrasound help determine the treatment. Cysts that are functional are usually observed (watchful waiting) with frequent monitoring unless they rupture and cause significant bleeding, in which case, surgical treatment is required. Benign and malignant tumors require operation.""'Treatment can consist of simple observation, or it can involve evaluating blood tests such as a CA-125 to help determine the potential for cancer (keeping in mind the many limitations of CA-125 testing described above).''There are no natural or home remedies to treat ovarian cysts, other than taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' for ''pain management''.'  "
What about surgery for ovarian cysts?,"'Any type of ovarian mass, including a cyst, can be surgically removed either with ''laparoscopy'', or if needed, an open abdominal incision (laparotomy) if it is causing severe pain, not resolving, or if it is suspicious in any way. Once the cyst is removed, the growth is sent to a pathologist who examines the tissue under a microscope to make the final diagnosis as to the type of cyst present.' "
What is the prognosis for a woman with ovarian cysts?,"'Most functional (related to the menstrual cycle) ovarian cysts resolve on their own and do not cause long-term problems. Benign cysts or benign tumors can be surgically removed. The vast majority of ovarian cysts do not cause any long-term problems. Rarely, cysts may be present within an ovarian cancer. In this case, the prognosis depends upon the extent of spread and exact type of cancer that is present.' "
Can ovarian cysts be prevented?,'There is no known way to prevent the development of ovarian cysts.' 
What is cancer prevention?,"'To prevent new ''cancers'' from starting, scientists look at risk factors and protective factors. Anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor.''Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:' Changing lifestyle or eating habits. Avoiding things known to cause cancer. Taking medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting."
"What are ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer?","'Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which ''malignant'' (cancer) cells form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.''Ovarian cancer'' is the leading cause of death from cancer of the ''female reproductive system''.''The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.''Women who have a family history of ovarian cancer and/or certain ''inherited'' gene changes, such as ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' gene changes, have a higher risk than women who do not have a family history or who have not inherited these gene changes. For women with inherited risk, ''genetic counseling'' and genetic testing can be used to find out more about how likely they are to develop ovarian cancer.' "
"Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer prevention","'Key points of Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal cancer ''prevention'' are:''Avoiding ''cancer risk factors'' may help prevent certain cancers.

What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes.

Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
What is an overactive bladder?,"'Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition that is characterized by sudden, involuntary contraction of the muscle in the wall of the urinary bladder. This results in a sudden, compelling need to urinate that is difficult to suppress (''urinary urgency''), even though the bladder may only contain a small amount of urine. The key symptom is sudden urge to void (urgency) with or without urgency urinary incontinence, often associated with urinary frequency (voiding 8 or more times per day) and nocturia (awakening one or more times at night to void). Irritating fluids, such as ''caffeinated'' ''beverages'' (coffee, tea), spicy foods, and ''alcohol'' can worsen the symptoms. It is common for those affected to compensate for OAB by toilet mapping, fluid restriction, and timed voiding. There is no ''pain'', burning, or ''blood in the urine'' with OAB.''Overactive bladder coupled with urinary leakage (inability to suppress the urge to void) is also referred to as urgency urinary incontinence. Another common type of urinary incontinence is called ''stress'' incontinence, which is caused by ''weakness'' in the pelvic floor muscles that surround and support the bladder and urethra. The symptom of ''stress'' incontinence is leakage when ''coughing'', straining, jumping, or with other physical activity that increase the pressure in the abdomen (Valsalva). Treatment for stress incontinence is very different than urge incontinence. In some individuals, there can be a combination of urge and stress incontinence (mixed incontinence). Often, the most bothersome condition is treated first in individuals with mixed urinary incontinence. In general, urinary incontinence is more common in women compared to men.''The overall prevalence of overactive bladder is 13.9%, affecting men and women with equal frequency. Although it can happen at any age, overactive bladder is especially common in older adults. Overactive bladder should not be considered a normal part of ''aging''. The prevalence under the age of 50 is < 10%. After age 60, the prevalence increases to 20%-30%. It is estimated that 60% of patients have dry OAB (no leakage) while 40% have wet OAB.' "
What are the causes of overactive bladder?,"""Overactive bladder is typically caused by early, uncontrolled contraction (spasms) of the bladder muscle (detrusor muscle), resulting in an urge to urinate. Overactive bladder is primarily a problem of the nerves and muscles of the bladder that allow for early contraction during the normal relaxation phase of bladder filling. The bladder's contraction in response to filling with urine is one the steps in the normal process of urination. The contraction and relaxation of the detrusor muscle is regulated by the nervous system. Approximately 300 cc of urine in the bladder can signal the nervous to trigger muscles of the bladder to coordinate urination. Voluntary control of the sphincter muscles at the opening of the bladder can hold the urine in the bladder for longer. Up to 600 cc of urine can be contained in a normal adult bladder. For those with OAB, the bladder capacity is typically low (< 200cc).""'Overactive bladder typically results from inappropriate contraction of the detrusor muscle regardless of the amount of urine. The most common form of OAB is idiopathic, where the exact cause is not known. However, OAB can result from problems of the nervous system.''The common abnormalities of the nervous system that cause overactive bladder are''Other causes of ''OAB symptoms'' include ''urinary tract infection'', bladder stones, urethral strictures, benign prostatic enlargement (''BPH''), or bladder tumors.''Frequently, no apparent cause of overactive bladder can be determined (idiopathic overactive bladder).'   spinal cord injury, back problems (disc hernia, degenerative disc disease), strokes, Parkinson's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and diabetic neuropathy."
Are there any risk factors for overactive bladder?,"'Some of the common risk factors for overactive bladder include the following:' Advanced age Injury to the nervous systemStrokeSpinal cord injuryDementiaParkinson's diseaseMultiple sclerosis Stroke Spinal cord injury Dementia Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Prostate enlargement Prostate surgery Multiple pregnancies Previous pelvic surgery Previous radiotherapy of the pelvis Postmenopausal women have an increased risk of OAB. Race may affect risk of developing OAB: African-American and Hispanic men and women have a higher risk of developing OAB. Obesity also appears to increase the risk of OAB. OAB is also associated with depression, anxiety, and other symptoms."
What are overactive bladder symptoms?,"'The symptoms of an overactive bladder include ''frequent urination'' (urinating eight or more times per day), urgency of urination (sudden, compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer) with or without urgency urinary incontinence, and nocturia (awakening one or more times at night to urinate). Overactive bladder may cause significant social, psychological, occupational, domestic, physical, sexual, and financial problems. Again, these symptoms should not be considered a normal part of aging.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose overactive bladder?,"'The diagnosis of overactive bladder is based on the presence of symptoms, while excluding other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. This is based on history, physical examination, and a urine test. Waking up to urinate one or more times at night, urinary frequency (urinating at least eight times daily), urinary urgency, and urinary incontinence are all important clues in evaluating someone suspected of having overactive bladder.''In addition to a general physical examination, a ''pelvic exam'' in women (to assess for dryness, atrophy, inflammation, infection, stress incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse [seeing a bulge in the vagina particularly with increasing abdominal pressure by straining]) and a prostate examination in men (to assess for size, tenderness, texture, and/or masses) are helpful in excluding other contributing conditions.''Urine analysis (UA) to assess for infection, blood cells in the urine, and high levels of glucose (''sugar'') in the urine is recommended. Occasionally, urine cytology (to look for ''cancer'' cells in the bladder) is sometimes advised in individuals undergoing evaluation of urinary incontinence and overactive bladder, particularly individuals with blood cells in the urine (''hematuria''). Bladder ''ultrasound'' measurement of the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination (called post-void residual) may also provide additional information about the cause of urinary incontinence (obstruction to urine flow or weak bladder muscle) but is not needed in all individuals with OAB symptoms.' "
What are the treatments for an overactive bladder?,"'The treatment for overactive bladder can vary with each individual. Guidelines suggest starting with less invasive therapies first. The recommended first line of therapy is behavioral, dietary, and lifestyle therapies. In some individuals, the addition of biofeedback is helpful. Biofeedback may be done in the office or by a physical therapist. In those individuals who do not respond adequately to behavioral, dietary, or lifestyle therapies, the addition of medications (pharmacologic therapy) is recommended as a second-line treatment. Third-line therapies consist of less-invasive surgical options (injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder wall) and electrical stimulation therapies, including sacral neuromodulation (Interstim) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PTNS). More extensive surgical therapies are available but are rarely needed for treatment of OAB that is not the result of a nervous system condition.''Here are commonly recommended treatments.''Dietary and Lifestyle''Behavioral'   Weight loss in obese individuals may decrease incontinence episodes. Reducing fluid intake to a recommended daily amount may be helpful in decreasing OAB symptoms. Decreasing/eliminating caffeine intake may be helpful in some individuals. Kegel exercises: Regular, daily exercising of pelvic muscles can improve, and even prevent, urinary incontinence. This is particularly helpful for younger women. These exercises should be performed 30-80 times daily for at least eight weeks. These exercises are thought to strengthen the muscles of the pelvis and urethra, which can support the opening to the bladder to prevent incontinence. Their success depends on practicing the proper technique and the recommended frequency. These exercises may be helpful for women with both stress and urgency urinary incontinence. Biofeedback: Used in conjunction with Kegel exercises, biofeedback helps people gain awareness and control of their pelvic muscles. Biofeedback is often performed by a physical therapist but may also be performed in the office of a urologist or urogynecologist. Biofeedback can help identify the pelvic floor muscles to ensure proper contractions of these muscles. Vaginal weight training: Small weights are held within the vagina by tightening the vaginal muscles. These exercises should be performed for 15 minutes, twice daily, for four to six weeks. Pelvic-floor electrical stimulation: Mild electrical pulses stimulate muscle contractions. This should be done in conjunction with Kegel exercises. Bladder training teaches people to resist the urge to void by conscious suppression of the need to urinate as well as using pelvic floor muscle contractions to suppress the urge to void and gradually expand the intervals between voiding. Toileting assistance uses routine or scheduled toileting, habit-training schedules, and prompted voiding to empty the bladder regularly to prevent leaking."
What is the role of medications in treating overactive bladder?,"'There are several medications recommended for the treatment of overactive bladder. Using these medications in conjunction with behavioral therapies has shown to increase the success rate for the treatment of overactive bladder.''The main goals of OAB treatment are to''Typically, the medications for overactive bladder start to work within one to two weeks, and optimal relief of OAB symptoms is usually achieved by six weeks. The most common medications (anticholinergics), bladder relaxants, target to decrease the overactivity of the detrusor muscle. Anticholinergics should be used under the direction of the physician prescribing them. They may have some common side effects, including ''dry mouth'', ''constipation'', facial flushing, blurry vision, and ''confusion'' (in the elderly). There are multiple anticholinergic therapies approved for the treatment of overactive bladder. They all are similar in their ability to treat the ''symptoms of overactive bladder'' but differ in the frequency and type of side effects as well as method of use. Some are once daily, some are topical treatments applied to the skin, and some come in different doses, allowing one to increase the dose if needed. Lastly, several of these medications are now available in generic forms.''Contraindications: The use of anticholinergics in individuals with narrow-angle ''glaucoma'' is not recommended without approval from an eye specialist. The side effects of anticholinergic medications for OAB may be increased with the use of other medications, thus it is important to always review current medications with the prescribing physician prior to starting an anticholinergic.''Injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder is considered a third-line therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder and is used in individuals who have tried and failed and/or cannot tolerate the side effects of medical therapy and/or has contraindications to the use of medications to treat overactive bladder.''Another third-line therapy is neuromodulation.''Neuromodulation is a newer method of treating overactive bladder with electrical stimulation that results in reorganization of the spinal reflexes involved in bladder control. There are two types of neuromodulation available: percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and sacral neuromodulation (Interstim). PTNS is performed in the office and is usually performed once a week for 12 weeks with periodic therapies thereafter to maintain a response. It involves placing a small needle into the area near the ankle and administering electrical stimulation. Sacral neuromodulation is usually performed in two stages. The first stage involves the placement of wires (leads) into areas in the ''sacrum'' and then using a small generator to test the response to stimulation. If there is a 50% or more improvement in symptoms the wires (leads) are internalized and an internal generator is placed, typically under the skin near the buttocks.''Surgery is rarely necessary in treating overactive bladder unless symptoms are debilitating and unresponsive to other treatments. Reconstructive bladder surgery (cystoplasty) is the most common surgical procedure. This surgery involves enlarging the size of the bladder by using part of the intestine.' reduce urinary urgency and frequency, increase voided volume (bladder capacity), and decrease urge incontinence (reduce leakage episodes). Oxybutynin (Ditropan) prevents urge incontinence by relaxing the detrusor muscle. This is typically taken two to three times a day (Ditropan XL is extended release, taken once a day). This medication was the first-generation therapy available, and its main side effects include dry mouth (60%) and constipation. Ditropan patch (Oxytrol) is also available with fewer side effects, but it releases a smaller dose than the oral form. The patch is placed on the skin once to twice weekly, and it may cause some local skin irritation. Tolterodine (Detrol, Detrol LA) is indicated for the treatment of an overactive bladder with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence. This medication affects the salivary glands less than oxybutynin, thus, it is better tolerated with fewer side effects (dry mouth). Detrol is usually prescribed twice a day, whereas the long-acting type (Detrol LA) is taken only once a day. Trospium chloride (Sanctura) is available in both a once a day and twice a day therapy. Trospium is less likely to get into the brain and is broken down differently than other medications, which may be beneficial in some individuals. Solifenacin (Vesicare) is a relatively newer medication in this group. It is generally similar to tolterodine, but it has a longer half-life and needs to be taken once a day. Darifenacin (Enablex) is also a newer anticholinergic medicine for treating overactive bladder with fewer side effects, such as confusion. Therefore, it may be more helpful in the elderly with underlying dementia. This medication is also typically taken once a day. Fesoterodine fumarate (Toviaz) is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. The medication is taken once daily. Common side effects include constipation and dry mouth. Mirabegron (Myrbetriq) is a new type of medication, a beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, to treat overactive bladder that is not an anticholinergic and can be used alone or more recently is being tested in combination with anticholinergic medications. Unlike anticholinergic medications that work to prevent the bladder muscle from contracting, the beta-3 adrenoceptor agonists work on the bladder to help it to relax. As these medications have a very different mechanism of action, they have different side effects. The side effects include increased blood pressure, incomplete bladder emptying, sinus irritation, constipation, and dry mouth (< 2%-3%). Currently, mirabegron is the only drug of this type that is FDA approved, however, other similar agents are being studied.It is recommended that blood pressure checks be performed when starting mirabegron. It is recommended that blood pressure checks be performed when starting mirabegron. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) is a toxin that is injected directly into the bladder muscle with a cystoscope and may be repeated every four to six months. The effects of the toxin are to prevent the release of chemicals from the nerves that supply the bladder, preventing stimulation of the bladder muscle. As the chemical cannot spread very far when injected, to treat the bladder adequately, multiple injections of a small amount of the toxin are necessary for the treatment to be effective. In most individuals, this can be done in the office. The treatment does not cause permanent changes and thus will require periodic retreatments for the effect to be continued. Serious side effects are unusual but may include difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty talking, muscle weakness, and more commonly, urinary tract infection and urinary retention. Individuals undergoing injection of Botox into the bladder muscle must be willing to perform clean, intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder. The effect of Botox is not permanent, thus repeat injections are needed to maintain the improvement, typically once every six to 16 months. Estrogen, either oral or vaginal, may be helpful in conjunction with other treatments for postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence."
Are there alternative therapies for OAB?,"'There is limited information on the effects of ''acupuncture'' on OAB symptoms. However, small studies have demonstrated improvements in OAB symptoms.''Select herbal therapies have also demonstrated improvement in OAB symptoms in small studies.' "
What are treatments for the chronically incontinent?,"'Although many people will improve their continence through medications, pelvic-muscle exercises, and bladder training, some will never achieve complete dryness. Sometimes treatment failures are due to concurrent use of other necessary medications, such as diuretics (water pills that increase urination), that actually can cause incontinence. Others may have dementia or other physical impairments that keep them from being able to perform pelvic-muscle exercises or retrain their bladders. Many will be cared for in long-term care facilities or at home. The following recommendations can help keep the chronically ''incontinent'' drier and reduce their cost of care:'   Scheduled toileting (timed voiding): Take people to the toilet every two to four hours or according to their toilet habits. Prompted voiding: Check for dryness and encourage use of the toilet. Improved access to toilets: Use equipment such as canes, walkers, wheelchairs, and devices that raise the seating level of toilets to make toileting easier. Managing fluids and diet: Behavioral modifications can directly impact symptoms of OAB. These include eliminating dietary caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods (for those with urge incontinence) and encourage adequate fiber in the diet. Disposable absorbent garments: Use these to keep people dry. Avoid indwelling catheters as much as possible, as these are associated with a risk of urinary tract infection, stones, and urethral and bladder irritation."
What measures can be taken at home to prevent overactive bladder symptoms?,"'The exact cause of overactive bladder syndrome is not known, thus preventative strategies are not established. However, the following options can avoid exacerbating symptoms in some individuals.''Caffeine may exacerbate urinary urgency, and it is potentially an irritant to the bladder. Eliminating caffeine intake can diminish some of the symptoms of overactive bladder.''Some experts suggest that avoidance of certain foods, such as ''chocolate'', spicy foods, alcohol, carbonated beverages, and nuts, can be beneficial in preventing symptoms of overactive bladder. Others encourage increasing the amount of dietary fiber for people with overactive bladder. Limiting fluid intake can also help to reduce urinary frequency.''Excess weight can put more pressure on the bladder, causing urinary incontinence. Therefore, ''weight loss'' can also help with urinary incontinence in general.' "
What are some of the complications of overactive bladder?,"'Common complications that can result from overactive bladder include' urinary tract infections (UTIs), skin irritation, skin infection, bladder stones, falls/fractures in elderly, sleep disturbances, negative impact on quality of life, and depression."
What is the prognosis for overactive bladder?,"'The overall prognosis for overactive bladder is generally good. Through a combined approach of behavioral modifications and medications, the patient can help significantly improve bladder urgency, and the quality of life of those affected by overactive bladder can substantially improve.' "
What is hyperparathyroidism?,"'Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid glands, also called parathyroids. ""Primary"" means this disorder originates in the parathyroids: One or more enlarged, overactive parathyroid glands secretes too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). In secondary hyperparathyroidism, a problem such as ''kidney failure'' causes the parathyroids to be overactive. This publication focuses on primary hyperparathyroidism.' "
What are the parathyroid glands?,"'The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized glands located on the thyroid gland in the neck. Occasionally, a person is born with one or more of the parathyroid glands embedded in the thyroid, in the thymus, or located elsewhere around this area. In most such cases, however, the glands function normally.''Though their names are similar, the thyroid and parathyroid glands are entirely different glands, each producing distinct hormones with specific functions. The parathyroid glands secrete PTH, a substance that helps maintain the correct balance of calcium and phosphorus in the body. PTH regulates the level of calcium in the blood, release of calcium from bone, absorption of calcium in the intestine, and excretion of calcium in the urine.''When the level of calcium in the blood falls too low, the parathyroid glands secrete just enough PTH to restore the blood calcium level.' "
What is primary hyperparathyroidism?,"'If the parathyroid glands secrete too much hormone, as happens in primary hyperparathyroidism, the balance is disrupted: Blood calcium rises. This condition of excessive calcium in the blood, called hypercalcemia, is what usually signals the doctor that something may be wrong with the parathyroid glands. In 85 percent of people with primary hyperparathyroidism, a benign tumor called an adenoma has formed on one of the parathyroid glands, causing it to become overactive. Benign tumors are noncancerous. In most other cases, the excess hormone comes from two or more enlarged parathyroid glands, a condition called hyperplasia. Very rarely, hyperparathyroidism is caused by ''cancer'' of a parathyroid gland.''This excess PTH triggers the release of too much calcium into the bloodstream. The bones may lose calcium, and too much calcium may be absorbed from food. The levels of calcium may increase in the urine, causing kidney stones. PTH also lowers blood phosphorus levels by increasing excretion of phosphorus in the urine.' "
How common is hyperparathyroidism?,"'In the United States, about 100,000 people develop the disorder each year. Women outnumber men two to one, and risk increases with age. In women 60 years and older, two out of 1,000 will develop hyperparathyroidism each year.' "
Why are calcium and phosphorous so important?,"'Calcium is essential for good health. It plays an important role in bone and tooth development and in maintaining bone strength. Calcium is also important in nerve transmission and muscle contraction.''Phosphorus is found in all bodily tissue. It is a main part of every cell with many roles in each. Combined with calcium, phosphorus gives strength and rigidity to your bones and ''teeth''.' "
What causes hyperparathyroidism?,"""In most cases doctors don't know the cause. The vast majority of cases occur in people with no family history of the disorder. Only about 5 percent of cases can be linked to an ""'inherited'' problem. Familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is a rare, inherited syndrome that affects the parathyroids as well as the pancreas and the ''pituitary gland''. Another rare ''genetic disorder'', familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, is sometimes confused with typical hyperparathyroidism. Each accounts for about 2 percent of primary hyperparathyroidism cases.' "
What are the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism?,"'A person with hyperparathyroidism may have severe symptoms, subtle ones, or none at all. Increasingly, routine blood tests that screen for a wide range of conditions, including ''high calcium levels'', are alerting doctors to people who have mild forms of the disorder even though they are symptom-free.''When symptoms do appear, they are often mild and nonspecific, such as a feeling of weakness and ''fatigue'', ''depression'', or aches and pains. With more severe disease, a person may have''Patients may have thinning of the bones without symptoms, but with risk of ''fractures''.''Increased calcium and phosphorus excretion in the urine may cause kidney stones.'   a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion or impaired thinking and memory, and increased thirst and urination."
Is there a blood test to diagnose hyperparathyroidism?,"'Hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed when tests show that blood levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone are too high. Other diseases can cause high blood calcium levels, but only in hyperparathyroidism is the elevated calcium the result of too much parathyroid hormone. A blood test that accurately measures the amount of parathyroid hormone has simplified the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.''Once the diagnosis is established, other tests may be done to assess complications. Because high PTH levels can cause bones to weaken from calcium loss, a measurement of ''bone density'' can help assess bone loss and the risk of fractures. Abdominal images may reveal the presence of kidney stones and a 24-hour urine collection may provide information on kidney damage, the risk of stone formation, and the risk of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.' "
Will surgery (parathyroidectomy) cure hyperthyroidism?,"'Surgery to remove the enlarged gland(s) (''parathyroidectomy'') is the main treatment for the disorder and cures it in 95 percent of operations, with low complication rates when performed by surgeons experienced with hyperparathyroidism.''The NIH panels recommended against the use of expensive imaging tests to locate benign tumors before initial surgery. Such tests are not likely to improve the success rate of surgery, which is about 95 percent when performed by experienced surgeons. Simple imaging tests before surgery are preferred by some surgeons. Localization tests are useful in patients having a second operation for recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism.'   About 1% of patients undergoing surgery experience damage to the nerves controlling the vocal cords, which can affect speech. One to 5% of patients lose all their parathyroid tissue and thus develop chronic low calcium levels, which may require treatment with calcium or vitamin D. The complication rate is slightly higher for hyperplasia than it is for adenoma since more extensive surgery is needed."
"What are other treatment 
options for hyperparathyroidism?","'Calcimimetics are a new class of drug that turns off secretion of PTH. They have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism secondary to ''kidney failure'' with ''dialysis'', and primary hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid ''cancer''. They have not been approved for primary hyperparathyroidism, but some physicians have begun prescribing calcimimetics for some patients with this condition. Patients can discuss this class of drug in more detail with their physicians.''Some patients who have mild disease may not need immediate treatment, according to panels convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2002. Patients who are symptom-free, whose blood calcium is only slightly elevated, and whose kidneys and bones are normal may wish to talk with their physicians about long-term monitoring. In the 2002 recommendation, periodic monitoring would consist of clinical evaluation, measurement of serum calcium levels, and bone mass measurement. If the patient and physician choose long-term follow-up, the patient should try to drink lots of water, get plenty of ''exercise'', and avoid certain diuretics, such as the ''thiazides''. Immobilization (inability to move) and gastrointestinal illness with ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea'' can cause calcium levels to rise. Patients with hyperparathyroidism should seek medical attention if they find themselves immobilized, vomiting, or having ''diarrhea''.' "
Which doctors specialize in treating hyperparathyroidism?,"'Endocrinologists are doctors who specialize in hormonal problems. Nephrologists are doctors who specialize in kidney and mineral disorders. Along with surgeons who are experienced in endocrine surgery, endocrinologists and nephrologists are best qualified to treat people with hyperparathyroidism. Organizations that help people with hyperparathyroidism may have additional information to assist in finding a qualified health professional nearby.' "
What is hyperthyroidism?,"'Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which an overactive thyroid gland is producing an excessive amount of thyroid hormones that circulate in the blood. (""Hyper"" means ""over"" in Greek). Thyroid hormones include thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T3 is actually the most active thyroid hormone. Much of the T4 is converted to T3 in the bloodstream.''The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck. The thyroid gland itself is regulated by the pituitary gland in the brain, and the pituitary gland is regulated by the hypothalamus, another gland in the brain.''Thyrotoxicosis is a toxic condition that is caused by an excess of thyroid hormones from any cause. Thyrotoxicosis can be caused by an excessive intake of thyroid hormone or by overproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.' "
What are hyperthyroidism symptoms and signs?,"'Hyperthyroidism is suggested by several signs and symptoms; however, people with mild disease usually experience no symptoms. People 70 years of age and older may not have any symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism. In general, the symptoms become more obvious as the degree of hyperthyroidism increases. The symptoms usually are related to an increase in the metabolic rate of the body.''Common symptoms include:''In older people, irregular heart rhythms and ''heart failure'' can occur. In its most severe form, untreated hyperthyroidism may result in ""''thyroid storm'',"" a condition involving ''high blood pressure'', ''fever'', and heart failure. Mental changes, such as ''confusion'' and ''delirium'', also may result.'   Excessive sweating Heat intolerance Increased bowel movements Tremor (usually fine shaking) Nervousness, agitation, anxiety Rapid heart rate, palpitations, irregular heart rate Weight loss Fatigue, weakness Decreased concentration Irregular and scant periods (menstruation) Fine or brittle hair Rapid heartbeat Thinning and/or smooth velvety skin Sleep disturbances"
What is the difference between hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidsm?,"'Hyperthyroidism refers to an increased production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland, while ''hypothyroidism'' refers to a condition in which a person has too little thyroid hormone or underproduction of thyroid hormones.' "
What causes hyperthyroidism?,'Some common causes of hyperthyroidism include:'   Graves' Disease Functioning adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) Excessive intake of thyroid hormones Abnormal secretion of TSH Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland) Excessive iodine intake
Graves' disease,"""Graves' disease"""", which is caused by a generalized overactivity of the thyroid gland, and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In this condition, the thyroid gland usually has lost the ability to respond to the normal control by the pituitary gland via TSH (renegade). Graves' disease is hereditary and is up to five times more common among women than men.""""Graves' disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease, and antibodies that are characteristic of the illness may be found in the blood. These antibodies include thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI antibodies), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO), and ""'TSH receptor'' antibodies.'""Signs and symptoms of Graves’ disease include those of hyperthyroidism; however, Graves’ disease may be associated with eye disease (Graves' opthalmopathy) and skin lesions (dermopathy). Opthalmopathy can occur before, after, or at the same time as the hyperthyroidism. Early on, it may cause ""'sensitivity to light'' and a feeling of ""sand in the eyes."" The eyes may be reddened and produce excess tears. Swelling behind the eyeballs causes the eyes to protrude, and ''double vision'' can occur. The degree of opthalmopathy is worsened in those who smoke.''In addition to the symptoms of hyperthyroidism mentioned above, Graves\' disease may be associated with eye disease (Graves\' opthalmopathy) and skin lesions (dermopathy). Opthalmopathy can occur before, after, or at the same time as the hyperthyroidism. Early on, it may cause sensitivity to light and a feeling of ""sand in the eyes."" The eyes may be reddened and produce excess tears. Swelling behind the eyeballs causes the eyes to protrude, and ''double vision'' can occur. The degree of opthalmopathy is worsened in those who smoke.''The course of the eye disease is often independent of the ''thyroid disease'', and steroid medications may be necessary to control the inflammation that causes the opthalmopathy. In addition, surgical intervention may be required. The skin condition (dermopathy) is rare and causes a painless, red, lumpy skin ''rash'' on the front of the legs.'""The triggers for Graves' disease include:""""Graves' disease can be diagnosed by a standard, nuclear medicine ""'thyroid scan'', which shows diffusely increased uptake of a radioactively labeled iodine. In addition, a blood test may reveal elevated TSI levels.' stress, smoking, radiation to the neck, medications, and infectious organisms such as viruses."
Thyroiditis (thyroid gland inflammation),"'Inflammation of the thyroid gland may occur after a viral illness (subacute thyroiditis). This condition is associated with signs and symptoms of ''fever'' and ''sore throat'' , often with painful swallowing. The thyroid gland is also tender to touch. There may be generalized neck aches and pains. Inflammation of the gland with an accumulation of white blood cells known as lymphocytes (lymphocytic thyroiditis) may also occur. In both of these conditions, the inflammation leaves the thyroid gland ""leaky,"" so that the amount of thyroid hormone entering the blood is increased. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is most common after a ''pregnancy'' and can actually occur in up to 8% of women after delivery. In these cases, the hyperthyroid phase can last from 4 to 12 weeks and is often followed by a hypothyroid (low thyroid output) phase that can last for up to 6 months. The majority of affected women return to a state of normal thyroid function. Thyroiditis can be diagnosed by a thyroid scan.' "
Other causes of hyperthyroidism,"'As we age, lumps or nodules may form in the thyroid gland. Usually, these lumps do not produce thyroid hormones and require no treatment. Occasionally, a nodule may become ""autonomous,"" which means that it does not respond to pituitary regulation and produces thyroid hormones independently. This becomes more likely if the nodule is larger than 3 cm. When there is a single nodule that is independently producing thyroid hormones, it is called a functioning nodule. If there is more than one functioning nodule, the term toxic, multinodular goiter is used. Functioning nodules may be readily detected with a thyroid scan.''Taking too much thyroid hormone medication is actually quite common. Excessive doses of thyroid hormones frequently go undetected due to the lack of follow-up of patients taking their thyroid medicine. Other persons may be abusing the drug in an attempt to achieve other goals such as ''weight loss''.''A ''tumor'' in the pituitary gland may produce an abnormally high secretion of TSH (the thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland). This leads to excessive signaling to the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. This condition is very rare and can be associated with other abnormalities of the pituitary gland. To identify this disorder, an endocrinologist performs elaborate tests to assess the release of TSH.''The thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. An excess of iodine may cause hyperthyroidism. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is usually seen in patients who already have an underlying abnormal thyroid gland. Certain medications, such as ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), which is used in the treatment of heart problems, contain a large amount of iodine and may be associated with thyroid function abnormalities.' "
What tests are used for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism?,"'A blood test can confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Usually, in hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid, blood levels of thyroid hormones are elevated. However, there is one exception. If the excessive amount of thyroid hormone is due to a TSH-secreting ''pituitary tumor'', then the levels of TSH will be abnormally high. This uncommon disease is known as ""secondary hyperthyroidism.""'""Although the blood tests mentioned previously can confirm the presence of excessive thyroid hormone, they do not point to a specific cause. A combination of antibody screening (for Graves' disease) and a thyroid scan using radioactively labeled iodine (which concentrates in the thyroid gland) can help diagnose the underlying thyroid disease. Graves' disease is almost certain if there are obvious signs and symptoms that affect the eyes. Tests for hyperthyroidism are based on an individual basis."" "
Medications for hyperthyroidism treatment,"'The options for treating hyperthyroidism include, treating the symptoms of the condition with medications, antithyroid ''drugs'', radioactive iodine, and surgery.''Medications that immediately treat ''hyperthyroidism symptoms'' caused by excessive thyroid hormones, such as a rapid heart rate, include ''beta-blockers'', for example, ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), ''atenolol'' (''Tenormin''), and ''metoprolol'' (''Lopressor''). These medications counteract the effect of thyroid hormone to increase metabolism, but they do not alter the levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. A doctor determines which patients to treat based on a number of variables including the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism, the age of the patient, the size of the thyroid gland, and the presence of coexisting medical illnesses.'  "
Antithyroid drugs,"'There are two main antithyroid drugs available for use in the United States to treat hyperthyroidism, ''methimazole'' (''Tapazole'') and ''propylthiouracil'' (PTU). The major risk of these medications is occasional suppression of production of white blood cells by the bone marrow (agranulocytosis). (White cells are needed to fight infection.) It is impossible to tell if or when this side effect is going to occur, so regular determination of white blood cells in the blood are not useful.''Rarely, methimazole or propylthiouracil may cause fever, ''sore throat'', or other signs of infection. If you develop these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.'""Usually, long-term antithyroid therapy is only used for people with Graves' disease, since this disease may actually go into remission under treatment without requiring treatment with thyroid radiation or surgery. If treated from 1 to 2 years, data shows remission rates of 40%-70%. When the disease is in remission, the gland is no longer overactive, and antithyroid medication is not needed.""""Studies also have shown that adding a pill of thyroid hormone to the antithyroid medication results in higher remission rates. This type of therapy remains controversial, however. When long-term therapy is withdrawn, patients should continue to be seen by the doctor every three months for the first year, since a relapse of Graves' disease is most likely in this time. If a patient does relapse, antithyroid drug therapy can be restarted, or radioactive iodine or surgery may be considered."" "
Radioactive iodine,"'Radioactive iodine is given orally (either by pill or liquid) on a one-time basis to ablate a hyperactive gland. The iodine given for ablative treatment is different from the iodine used in a scan. Radioactive iodine is given after a routine iodine scan, and uptake of the iodine is determined to confirm hyperthyroidism. There are no widespread side effects with this therapy.''Usually, more than 80% of patients are cured with a single dose of radioactive iodine. It takes between 8 to 12 weeks for the thyroid to become normal after therapy. Permanent hypothyroidism is the major complication of this form of treatment. While a temporary hypothyroid state may be seen up to 6 months after treatment with radioactive iodine, if it persists longer than 6 months, thyroid replacement therapy usually is begun.' "
Thyroidectomy (hyperthyroidism surgery),"'With the introduction of radioactive iodine therapy and antithyroid drugs, surgery for hyperthyroidism (''thyroidectomy'') is less common. When this therapy is necessary, it is used in:''Partial thyroidectomy (removal of a portion of the thyroid gland) was once a common treatment for hyperthyroidism. The goal is to remove the thyroid tissue that was producing the excessive thyroid hormone. However, if too much tissue is removed, an inadequate production of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) may result. In this situation, thyroid replacement therapy is started.''The major complication of thyroid surgery is disruption of the surrounding tissue, including the nerves supplying the vocal cords and the four tiny glands in the neck that regulate calcium levels in the body (the parathyroid glands). Accidental removal of these glands may result in low calcium levels (''hypercalcemia'') and require calcium replacement therapy.' Pregnant women and children who have major adverse reactions to antithyroid medications. People with very large thyroid glands and in those who have symptoms stemming from compression of tissues adjacent to the thyroid, such as difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, and shortness of breath."
What should I do if I think I have hyperthyroidism?,"'If you are concerned that you may have an excess amount of thyroid hormone, you should mention your symptoms to your doctor. A simple blood test is the first step in the diagnosis. From there, both you and your doctor can decide what the next step should be. If treatment is needed, it is important for you to let your doctor know of any concerns or questions you have about the options available. Remember that thyroid disease is very common, and the diseases that cause an excess of thyroid hormones can be easily diagnosed and treated.' "
Which types of doctors treat hyperthyroidism?,"""Endocrinologists are specialists in diagnosing and treating hormonal disorders such as hyperthyroidism. Primary care physicians, including family practitioners and internists, may also be involved in treating patients with hyperthyroidism. Ophthalmologists and ophthalmic surgeons may be involved in the care of patients with Graves' disease."" "
What is hereditary hemochromatosis?,"'Hereditary ''hemochromatosis'' is an ''inherited'' (genetic) disorder in which there is excessive accumulation of iron in the body (''iron overload''). It is a common ''genetic disorder'' among Caucasians in the United States, affecting approximately 1 million people in the United States. Individuals affected with hereditary hemochromatosis may have no symptoms or signs (and have normal longevity), or they can have severe symptoms and signs of iron overload that include sexual dysfunction, ''heart failure'', ''joint pains'', ''cirrhosis'' of the ''liver'', ''diabetes'', ''fatigue'', and darkening of the skin.''The normal iron content of the body is three to four grams. The total amount of iron in the body is carefully controlled. The body loses one mg of iron daily from sweat and cells that are shed from the skin and the inner lining of the ''intestines''. Women also lose one mg of iron daily on average from ''menstruation''. In normal adults, the intestines absorb one mg of iron daily from food to replace the lost iron, and therefore, there is no excess accumulation of iron in the body. When iron losses are greater, more iron is absorbed from food.''In individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, the daily absorption of iron from the intestines is greater than the amount needed to replace losses. Since the normal body cannot increase iron excretion, the absorbed iron accumulates in the body. At this rate of iron accumulation, a man with hemochromatosis can accumulate 20 grams of total body iron by age 40 to 50. This excess iron deposits in the joints, liver, testicles, and ''heart'', causing damage to these organs and signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. Women with hemochromatosis accumulate iron at a slower rate than men because they lose more iron than men due to iron loss from ''menstruation'' and ''breastfeeding''. Therefore, they typically develop signs and symptoms\xa0of organ damage due to excess iron 10 years later than men.' "
How is hereditary hemachromatosis inherited?,"'\tHereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means an individual has the possibility of developing iron overload only when a pair of abnormal genes are inherited from both parents. (An autosomal recessive disorder is different from autosomal dominant disorder in which individuals can develop disease by inheriting a single abnormal gene from only one parent.)''\tThe ''human body'' is composed of trillions of cells. Inside the inner core (nucleus) of each cell are chromosomes. Every human cell has two sets of 23 chromosomes (total of 46 chromosomes). Each set is inherited from one parent. Chromosomes contain DNA that carries genes that govern all bodily functions including cell metabolism, appearance, height, intelligence, hair and eye color, and other physical traits. Defects in DNA (also called mutations) are passed from one generation to the next, and sometimes can cause diseases.''\tThere are primarily two mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis; C282Y and H63D. The numbers 282 and 63 designate the location of the defects on the HFE gene located on chromosome number 6. An individual who inherits two C282Y mutations (one from each parent) is called a C282Y homozygote, and has a significant chance of developing hemochromatosis. In fact, C282Y homozygotes account for the majority of cases of hereditary hemochromatosis. Patients who inherit one C282Y mutation from one parent and another H63D mutation from another parent are called compound heterozygotes, accounting for a small number of the cases of hereditary hemochromatosis.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of hemochromatosis?,"'\tPeople with early hemochromatosis have no symptoms and are unaware of their condition. The disease may then be suspected when elevated iron blood levels are noted by routine blood testing.' 
		In men, symptoms may not appear until 30-50 years of age. Iron deposits in the skin cause darkening of the skin. Since females lose iron through menstrual blood loss, nonmenstruating women develop symptoms 15 to 20 years later. 
		Iron deposits in the pituitary gland and testicles cause shrinkage of the testicles and impotence. 
		Iron deposits in the pancreas cause a decrease in insulin production resulting in diabetes. 
		Iron deposits in the heart muscle can cause cardiomyopathy and lead to heart failure as well as abnormal heart rhythms. 
		Iron accumulation in the liver causes scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and an increased risk of developing liver cancer."
How is hemochromatosis diagnosed?,"'Most patients with hemochromatosis are diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 50; and about 75% have no symptoms. Hemochromatosis is discovered when elevated levels of iron in the blood are found as part of routine blood testing; or when blood iron levels are measured as in screening studies in family members of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. Some patients are diagnosed as having hemochromatosis when their doctors perform blood iron levels as part of the evaluation for abnormal elevations in blood levels of ''liver enzymes'', AST and ALT. However, symptoms of skin bronzing or ''hyperpigmentation'' (about 70% eventually develop this symptom), ''diabetes'', ''liver disease'', arthropathy, hypogonadism, ''cardiomyopathy'', and ''impotence'' or no menstrual periods (''amenorrhea'') may be present and may suggest that additional screening tests such as transferrin saturation and other blood and ''liver tests'' be ordered.''There are several blood tests that reflect the amount of iron in the body;\xa0ferritin level, iron level, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation.''Ferritin is a blood protein whose levels correlate with the amount of iron stored in the body. Blood ferritin levels usually are low in patients with\xa0''iron deficiency anemia'', and are high in patients with hemochromatosis and other conditions that cause an increase in body iron levels. Since ferritin also can be elevated in certain infections like ''viral hepatitis'' and other inflammatory conditions in the body, an elevated ferritin level alone is not sufficient to accurately diagnose hemochromatosis.''Serum iron, TIBC, and transferrin saturation are often performed together. Serum iron is the measure of the amount of iron in serum (the liquid portion of the blood). TIBC is a measure of the total amount of iron that can be carried in serum by transferrin, a protein that carries iron in serum from one part of the body to another. Transferrin saturation is a number calculated by dividing serum iron by TIBC - it is a number that reflects what percentage of the transferrin that is being used to transport iron. In healthy individuals the transferrin saturation is between 20% and 45%. In patients with ''iron deficiency'' ''anemia'', the serum iron and transferrin saturation are abnormally low; and in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis the serum iron and transferrin saturation may be abnormally high. Consequently, if transferrin saturation is about 45% or higher, the presence of mutations C282Y or H63D should be examined to confirm the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis.''Since serum iron can be elevated by eating and can fluctuate during the day, serum iron measurements should be done fasting, usually in the morning before breakfast.''The most accurate test for diagnosing hemochromatosis\xa0used to be the measurement of the iron content of liver tissue obtained by a biopsy. A ''liver biopsy'' involves the removal of a sample of liver tissue for analysis and is usually performed with a needle under local anesthesia. After numbing the skin and the underlying tissues, the doctor inserts the needle into the liver through the right lower rib cage, sometimes under ''ultrasound'' guidance. The tissue obtained by the needle is studied under a microscope for signs of active ''liver disease'', fibrosis and cirrhosis (permanent scarring), and iron content (usually significantly elevated in hemochromatosis).''The liver biopsy also has prognostic value because it determines whether the patient already has irreversible advanced cirrhosis. Patients with hemochromatosis who have a normal liver biopsy have longevity similar to other healthy adults if adequately treated, while patients with cirrhosis as a result of hemochromatosis have significantly reduced longevity. Furthermore, the risks of cirrhotic patients developing liver ''cancer'' (hepatocellular ''carcinoma'') are substantially higher than normal subjects, even with adequate treatment of the iron overload with phlebotomy. However, with the newer genetic testing, this invasive technique should be used only under certain conditions and is used infrequently.''The gene for hereditary hemochromatosis was identified in 1996. The gene is referred to as the HFE gene. Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated in most patients with two mutations of the HFE gene; C282Y and H63D. Currently, most investigators consider detection of these genes as diagnosis of heriditary hemochromatosis.''A C282Y homozygote is a person who has inherited one mutated C282Y gene from each parent. A C282Y homozygote is considered at considerable risk for developing iron overload disease. However, not every C282Y homozygote develops iron overload.''A C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote is a person who has inherited one mutated C282Y gene from one parent and a second mutated H63D gene from the other parent. Most compound heterozygotes have normal iron levels though some can develop mild to moderate iron overload.''A C282Y heterozygote is a person who has inherited one mutated C282Y gene from one parent and a second normal HFE gene from the other parent. Children born of two C282Y heterozygotes have a 25% chance of being a C282Y homozygote and, therefore, will be at risk of developing hemochromatosis. A C282Y heterozygote does not develop iron overload.''An algorithm for diagnosing hereditary hemochromatosis is as follows:''Who should undergo liver biopsy?''Not all patients with hemochromatosis need to undergo liver biopsy. The purpose of liver biopsy is to identify those patients with cirrhosis and to exclude other possible liver diseases. (Patients with hemochromatosis and cirrhosis are at increased risk of complications, especially liver ''cancer''.)''Young patients (<40 years of age) who are C282Y homozygotes with normal\xa0''liver blood tests'' and\xa0serum ferritin levels <1000 ng/ml have a very low risk of having cirrhosis of the liver. Therefore, these patients can be treated with therapeutic phlebotomy without a liver biopsy. Their prognosis is excellent with adequate treatment.''Older patients (>40 years of age) who have serum ferritin levels >1000 ng/ml, and have abnormally elevated liver blood tests may already have developed cirrhosis. Doctors may recommend liver biopsies in these patients provided that it is safe for them to undergo liver biopsy.' Adults suspected of having hereditary hemochromatosis (for example, adult, first-degree relatives of a patient with hereditary hemochromatosis) are evaluated by measurements of fasting serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation and ferritin. Patients with elevated serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation of greater than 45% are evaluated by genetic testing Patients with transferrin saturation greater than 45% who are C282Y homozygotes have hemochromatosis and, therefore, should be treated with therapeutic phlebotomy (see below)."
How is hemochromatosis treated?,"'The most effective treatment for hemochromatosis is to reduce iron in the body by phlebotomy (withdrawal of blood from the arm veins). One unit of blood, which contains 250 mg of iron, usually is withdrawn every one to two weeks. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are checked every two to three months. Once ferritin levels are below 50 ng/ml and transferrin saturations are below 50%, the frequency of phlebotomies are reduced to every two to three months. When hemochromatosis is diagnosed early and is treated effectively, damage to the liver, heart, testicles, pancreas and joints can be prevented completely, and patients maintain normal health. In patients with established cirrhosis, effective treatment can improve the function of the heart, skin color, and diabetes. However, cirrhosis is irreversible and the risk of developing liver ''cancer'' remains.''The benefits of therapeutic phlebotomy in hemochromatosis are as follows:' It prevents the development of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer if the disease is discovered and treated early. It improves liver function partially in patients who have already developed advanced cirrhosis. It improves and/or completely resolves symptoms of weakness, liver pain, joint pain, and fatigue. It improves function of the heart in patients with mild and early heart disease."
What about diet recommendations for people with hemochromatosis?," 
		A normal balanced diet is recommended without avoidance of iron containing foods provided patients are undergoing effective therapeutic phlebotomy. 
Alcohol should be avoided since alcohol consumption increases the risk of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
		Ingestion of high doses of vitamin C in individuals with iron overload may lead to fatal abnormal heart rhythms. Therefore, it is reasonable to avoid vitamin C supplementation until patients are adequately treated. 
		Raw seafood should be avoided since people with hemochromatosis are at risk of acquiring bacterial infections that flourish in iron rich environment."
What are the recommendations for screening for liver cancer in hemochromatosis?,"'\tLiver ''cancers'' (hepatoma or hepatocellular cancer) mainly occur in patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, patients with hemochromatosis and cirrhosis should have abdominal ultrasound examinations and blood tests for alpha-fetal protein (a protein produced by liver cancer) every six months.' "
What are repetitive motion disorders (RMDs?," Repetitive motion disorders (RMDs) are a family of muscular conditions that result from repeated motions performed in the course of normal work or daily activities. RMDs includecarpal tunnel syndrome,bursitis,tendonitis,epicondylitis,ganglion cyst,tenosynovitis, andtrigger finger. carpal tunnel syndrome, bursitis, tendonitis, epicondylitis, ganglion cyst, tenosynovitis, and trigger finger. RMDs are caused by too many uninterrupted repetitions of an activity or motion, unnatural or awkward motions such as twisting the arm or wrist, overexertion, incorrect posture, or muscle fatigue. RMDs occur most commonly in the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders, but can also happen in the neck, back, hips, knees, feet, legs, and ankles. The disorders are characterized by pain, tingling, numbness, visible swelling or redness of the affected area, and the loss of flexibility and strength. For some individuals, there may be no visible sign of injury, although they may find it hard to perform easy tasks. Over time, RMDs can cause temporary or permanent damage to the soft tissues in the body -- such as the muscles, nerves, tendons, and ligaments - and compression of nerves or tissue. Generally, RMDs affect individuals who perform repetitive tasks such as assembly line work, meat-packing, sewing, playing musical instruments, and computer work. The disorders may also affect individuals who engage in activities such as carpentry, gardening, and tennis."
Is there any treatment for repetitive motion disorders?," Treatment for RMDs usually includes reducing or stopping the motions that cause symptoms. Options include taking breaks to give the affected area time to rest, and adopting stretching and relaxation exercises. Applying ice to the affected area and using medications such as pain relievers, cortisone, and anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce pain and swelling. Splints may be able to relieve pressure on the muscles and nerves. Physical therapy may relieve the soreness and pain in the muscles and joints. In rare cases, surgery may be required to relieve symptoms and prevent permanent damage. Some employers have developed ergonomic programs to help workers adjust their pace of work and arrange office equipment to minimize problems."
What is the prognosis for repetitive motion disorders?," Most individuals with RMDs recover completely and can avoid re-injury by changing the way they perform repetitive movements, the frequency with which they perform them, and the amount of time they rest between movements. Without treatment, RMDs may result in permanent injury and complete loss of function in the affected area."
What research is being done?,'Much of the on-going research on RMDs is aimed at ''prevention'' and rehabilitation.

What is an ovulation calculator and why to calendar your most fertile days?,"'Ovulation'' calculators and calendars are tools that attempt to predict\xa0when women might ovulate. These tools are based on the typical length of their ''menstrual cycle'' and the expected window for ovulation. These tools will guide women when they are releasing an egg each month (also known as ovulation) and when are they most ''fertile'' for the best chances of ''getting pregnant''. Likewise, if they are taking any ''fertility'' medications, these tools can be used to suggest when they may be the most fertile for sexual intercourse. To use an ovulation calculator, women should know:' When was the first day of their last menstrual cycle? Duration of their menstrual cycle The number of days in their luteal phase: This is the latter phase of the menstrual cycle starting from ovulation and ending on just before bleeding starts. While the amount of time before ovulation can vary widely each month, the time after ovulation to the end of your cycle is usually fairly constant, and unless you have a health problem that affects your periods or you are pregnant, this phase lasts 14-16 days. If a woman is not sure about the length of the luteal phase, they can assume it is 14 days (the average length for most women)."
When does ovulation occur?,"'Ovulation may sometimes vary depending on the menstrual cycle:' If the average menstrual cycle of a woman is 28 days, then ovulation may occur around day 14, and the most fertile days are 12, 13, and 14. If the average menstrual cycles of a woman are 35 days, then ovulation may occur around day 21, and the most fertile days are 19, 20, and 21. If the average menstrual cycle of a woman is shorter or says 21 days, then ovulation may occur around day 7, and the most fertile days are 5, 6, and 7."
Can a woman use an ovulation calculator as a birth control?,"'It is not advised. Some women try to use ovulation calculators and calendars as a form of natural ''birth control''. The goal is to limit sex during predicted ''infertile'' days and abstain totally on fertile days as per the calendar. However, cycles may vary; average ''infertile'' days one month might become most fertile in the coming months. If women do not want to get pregnant, they should not totally rely on an ovulation calculator as a means of ''birth control''. There is a significant risk that they may have an unwanted ''pregnancy''.' "
What are common ovulating symptoms?,"'Ovulation\xa0is the female reproductive process of releasing a mature egg from the ovaries and transferring it to the fallopian tubes for ''insemination''. Generally, one egg is released every month, two weeks after ''menstruation'' begins. Below are a few common symptoms when a woman may be ovulating:' Increased sex drive, especially during the mid of the cycle, maybe a common symptom of ovulating. Few women notice changes such as very little soreness in the breast about mid-way through the cycle, which may be a sign of ovulation.  Due to a surge in progesterone hormone, women’s basal body temperature may be increased by about 0.5° during ovulation, especially during resting. Keeping a track of basal temperature every morning may give the accurate fertile days in the month. Women may feel something happening in their ovaries around ovulation. These sensations may vary wildly and could be anything from mild aches to twinges of pain. Some women have a condition called Mittelschmerz, where they feel ovulation as a one-sided backache or a cramp. The feeling may last anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. Ovulating women usually notice a change in vaginal discharge (cervical mucus), especially during ovulating days. These changes are caused by rising levels of estrogen in the body needed to release an egg."
Is charting in an ovulation calculator and calendar can perfectly predict ovulation and fertile days?,"'Charting in ovulation and calendar may not be perfect, but they may be fairly accurate. Additionally, the results may not be right if a woman is not sure about your ''last menstrual period'' or with irregular cycles. \xa0The calculators can give an idea about likely ovulation time. Combining them with the symptoms of ovulation may be beneficial. These tools are based on averages, and even if women may be charting periods accurately, the cycle length and ovulation date may vary cycle to cycle. These tools are most beneficial to women having regular periods by calculating the average cycle length and allowing them a wider fertility window to conceive.\xa0' "
What are natural methods of contraception?,"'Natural methods of ''contraception'' are considered ""natural"" because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.''The ''fertility'' awareness methods'' (FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicate ''ovulation'' has occurred or is about to occur.'""On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next ""'menstrual period''. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days in ''fertile'' mucus), the actual time during which a woman may become ''pregnant'' is measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.''FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control. Although these methods were developed to prevent pregnancy, they can equally be well used by a couple to increase fertility and promote ''conception''.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of natural birth control?,"'Natural methods are typically very inexpensive compared to other methods of birth control unless a woman chooses to purchase ovulation test kits.' A woman does not need to take medication or use hormonal manipulation. No procedures or fittings by a physician are required. It can be difficult to estimate or know precisely when a woman is fertile, allowing increased chances for unplanned conception. Natural methods are not as effective as some forms of contraception. Ovulation test kits are used by some couples using natural methods of contraception, and the cost of these kits is another potential disadvantage. Being unable to have intercourse at certain times of the month is a disadvantage for some women."
Calendar rhythm method,"""The calendar rhythm method to avoid pregnancy relies upon calculating a woman's fertile period on the calendar. Based upon her 12 previous menstrual cycles, a woman subtracts l8 days from her shortest menstrual cycle to determine her first fertile day, and 11 days from her longest menstrual cycle to determine her last fertile day. She can then calculate the total number of days during which she may ovulate. If a woman's menstrual cycles are quite irregular from month to month, there will be a greater number of days during which she might become pregnant.""'The calendar method is only about 80% effective in preventing pregnancy and when used alone, it is considered outdated and ineffective.' "
Basal body temperature method,"""The basal body temperature (BBT) method is based upon the fact that a woman's temperature drops 12 to 24 hours before an egg is released from her ovary and then increases again once the egg has been released. Unfortunately, this temperature difference is not very large. It is less than 1 degree F (about a half-degree C) when the body is at rest.""'The basal body temperature method requires that a woman take her temperature every morning before she gets out of bed. A special thermometer that is more accurate and sensitive than a typical oral thermometer must be used, and the daily temperature variations carefully noted. This must be done every month. Online calculators are available to help a woman chart her basal body temperature.''To use the basal body temperature as a birth control method, a woman should refrain from having sexual intercourse from the time her temperature drops until at least 48 to 72 hours after her temperature increases again.' "
Mucus inspection method,"'The mucus inspection method depends on the presence or absence of a particular type of cervical mucus that a woman produces in response to estrogen. A woman will generate larger amounts of more watery mucus than usual (like raw egg white) just before release of an egg from her ovary. This so-called egg-white cervical mucus (EWCM) stretches for up to an inch when pulled apart. A woman can learn to recognize differences in the quantity and quality of her cervical mucus by examining its appearance on her underwear, pads, and toilet tissue; or she may gently remove a sample of mucus from the vaginal opening using two fingers.''She may choose to have intercourse between the time of her ''last menstrual period'' and the time of change in the cervical mucus. During this period, it is recommended that she have sexual intercourse only every other day because the presence of seminal fluid makes it more difficult to determine the nature of her cervical mucus. If the woman does not wish to become pregnant, she should not have sexual intercourse at all for 3 to 4 days after she notices the change in her cervical mucus.' "
Symptothermal method,"'The symptothermal method combines certain aspects of the calendar, the basal body temperature, and the mucus inspection methods. Not only are all these factors taken into consideration, but also are other symptoms such as slight cramping and breast tenderness. Some women experience lower abdominal discomfort (in the area of the ovaries) during the release of an egg (ovulation).' "
Ovulation indicator testing kits,"""A woman can use an ovulation prediction kit to determine when she is most likely to ovulate. This special kit measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. Because luteinizing hormone promotes the maturation of an egg in the ovary, the amount of LH usually increases 20 to 48 hours before ovulation. This increase is called the luteinizing hormone surge, which can then be detected in a woman's urine 8 to 12 hours later. The ovulation prediction kit is designed to measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine.""'There are a number of ovulation prediction kits sold at pharmacies that range from simple to complex. In the simplest, the woman urinates onto a test stick and the amount of luteinizing hormone is indicated by a color change. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of luteinizing hormone in her urine. A woman begins testing her urine 2 to 3 days before she expects to ovulate based upon the dates of her previous monthly cycles.''The optimum days for ''fertilization'' are the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. The greatest chance of ''becoming pregnant'' is if intercourse occurs within 24 hours after the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovulation prediction kits are used primarily to increase the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, but they can also indicate to the woman that she is about to ovulate and should take appropriate ''contraceptive'' precautions.' "
Withdrawal method,"""Using the withdrawal method, the man withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina before he ejaculates so that the sperm released from his penis does not enter her vagina. Withdrawal is also called ""'coitus interruptus''.'""There are problems with using withdrawal as a contraceptive method. First, a man may release small amounts of sperm before actual ejaculation. Secondly, a man needs self-control and a precise sense of timing to be able to withdraw his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. Because this can be difficult for the man to complete successfully, the withdrawal method is only about 75%-80% effective in preventing pregnancy."" "
Lactational infertility,"'Lactational ''infertility'' is based upon the idea that a woman cannot become pregnant as long as she is ''breastfeeding'' her baby. It is true that a woman may not ovulate quite as soon after giving birth as she would if she were not breastfeeding. Women who are breastfeeding usually start ovulating again between 10-12 weeks after delivery.''However, the method is not considered appropriate as a sole contraceptive measure. A ''nursing'' mother may start ovulating again and not realize she is fertile, as ovulation can occur prior to the return of her menstrual period. If this happens and the mother has unprotected sexual intercourse, she can become pregnant at the same time she is still breastfeeding her baby. If a nursing mother does not wish to become pregnant again, she must start to use an appropriate method of contraception.' "
Douching and urination,"'Vaginal ''douching'"" is the use of a liquid solution to wash out mucus and other types of bodily debris from a woman's vagina. Many women choose to make regular douching a part of their routine for maintaining vaginal hygiene. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not recommend the practice.""""Regardless of whether a woman does it for hygienic reasons, vaginal douching does not work as a contraception method. During intercourse, active sperm can reach a woman's cervix and even the upper part of her uterus within five minutes of ejaculation. Douching after intercourse cannot be done soon enough to have any contraceptive benefits, and the douching could even force sperm higher up into the uterus. In addition, if a woman douches within a 6-8 hour period after using a spermicide, she may actually reduce the effectiveness of this contraceptive method.""'Some women used to think that standing up and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse might reduce the chances of them becoming pregnant. They hoped that gravity might make it more difficult for sperm to swim ""uphill"" to the uterus and that the stream of urine ''running'' over their vaginal area would wash away sperm, similar to the process of douching. However, just like douching, urination after intercourse does not have any contraceptive value.' "
Abstinence,"""Abstinence from sexual activity means not having any sexual intercourse at all. No sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex means that there is no chance that a man's sperm can fertilize a woman's egg.""""A man or a woman can practice abstinence from sexual activity for a specific period of time, or continuously throughout one's lifetime. Abstinence is essentially 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Another significant benefit of abstinence is that it markedly reduces the likelihood of contracting a ""'sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').''In this context, abstinence means refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity because sexually transmitted infections can be passed from one person to another in any and all of these ways. It should be noted that sexual activity such as mutual ''masturbation'"" and touching of the other partner's genitals can, in some instances, transfer sperm during heavy mutual foreplay possibly leading to pregnancy.""

What is oximetry?,'Oximetry is a procedure for measuring the concentration of oxygen in the blood. The test is used in the evaluation of various medical conditions that affect the function of the ''heart'' and ''lungs''.' 
How is oximetry done?,"'This is done using an oximeter, a photoelectric device specially designed for this purpose.  A reusable probe can be placed on the finger or a single use tape probe is placed on the earlobe or finger.' "
What are pulse oximeters?,"'The oximeters most commonly used today are called pulse oximeters because they respond only to pulsations, such as those in pulsating capillaries of the area tested.'  "
How common are oximeters?,"'Oximeters are now a virtual fixture in intensive care units, pulmonary units and elsewhere in hospitals and health care facilities.' "
How does a pulse oximeter function?,"'A pulse oximeter works by passing a beam of red and infrared light through a pulsating capillary bed. The ratio of red to infrared blood light transmitted gives a measure of the oxygen saturation of the blood.  The oximeter works on the principle that the oxygenated blood is a brighter color of red than the deoxygenated blood, which is more blue-purple. First, the oximeter measures the sum of the intensity of both shades of red, representing the fractions of the blood with and without oxygen. The oximeter detects the pulse, and then subtracts the intensity of color detected when the pulse is absent. The remaining intensity of color represents only the oxygenated red blood. This is displayed on the electronic screen as a percentage of oxygen saturation in the blood.' "
Are there other types of oximetry?,"'Yes. Oximetry can also be done on blood that is within the heart (intracardiac oximetry) or on whole blood that has been removed from the body.  More recently, using a similar technology to oximetry, carbon dioxide levels can be measured at the skin as well.' "
